<p>Artificial food colourings and additives (AFCAs) have long been suggested to adversely affect the learning and behaviour in children. In this study, we aimed to provide additional data to clarify the possible side effects of colouring additives on behaviour and memory. We administered acceptable daily intake values of AFCAs as a mixture (Eritrosin, Ponceau 4R, Allura Red AC, Sunset Yellow FCF, Tartrazin, Amaranth, Brilliant Blue, Azorubin and Indigotin) to female rats before and during gestation and then tested their effects on behaviour and on spatial working memory in their offspring. Effects on spatial learning and memory were evaluated by Morris water maze, behavioural effects were evaluated by open-field test and forced swim test. Our results showed that commonly used artificial food colourings have no adverse effects on spatial working memory and did not create a depressive behaviour in offspring. But they showed a few significant effects on locomotor activity as AFCAs increased some parameters of locomotor activity.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Artificial food colourings, additives (AFCAs) and some preservatives have long been suggested to adversely affect the learning and behaviour in children. The suspicion of main putative effect of AFCA is to induce overactive, impulsive and inattentive behaviour (i.e. hyperactivity) in children which should be associated with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0748233712436638">Aguiar et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0748233712436638">McCann et al., 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>Ben Feingold made his initial claims of the detrimental effect of AFCAs on childhood behaviour more than 30 years ago. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0748233712436638">Feingold (1976)</xref> hypothesized that hyperactivity might be a child’s adverse reaction to food additives, such as artificial sweeteners, artificial colours and preservatives, that are present in numerous industrial foods and drinks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0748233712436638">Bellisle, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0748233712436638">Feingold, 1976</xref>). Since then different kinds of AFCAs were studied separately or as a mixture in children with ADHD or in experimental studies. Tanaka studied the AFCAs separately in experimental studies in rats and focused on reproductive and neurobehavioural effects on them. In most of these experimental studies, neurobehavioural procedures evaluated especially the neuromuscular developmental effects of AFCAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0748233712436638">Tanaka, 1993</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0748233712436638">1994</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0748233712436638">1996</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0748233712436638">1997</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0748233712436638">2001</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0748233712436638">2006</xref>).</p>
<p>Disputes about this case caused concerns about the safety of AFCAs in the consumers’ minds. European Food Safe Authority (EFSA) took these concerns into consideration and therefore, some of the colouring additives were decided to be reevaluated. At the end of these reevaluations, acceptable daily intake (ADI) values of some of the colouring additives were decreased. However, studies on the effects of AFCA on memory and neurobehaviour is still inadequate in healthy individuals. In this study, we aimed to provide additional data to clarify the possible side effects of colouring additives on behaviour and memory. For this purpose, we administered a mixture of AFCA which is commonly present in many industrial foods to female rats before and during gestation and then tested their effects on behaviour and spatial working memory in their offspring when they became adult.</p>

<title>Materials</title>
<p>The additives in the artificial food colours mixture and the doses used in the study were as follows: Eritrosin 0.1 mg/kg/day, Ponceau 4R 4 mg/kg/day, Allura Red AC 7 mg/kg/day, Sunset Yellow FCF 2.5 mg/kg/day, Tartrazin 7.5 mg/kg/day, Amaranth 0.5 mg/kg/day, Brilliant Blue FCF 12.5 mg/kg/day, Azorubin 4 mg/kg/day and Indigotin 5 mg/kg/day. The doses used in the study were the ADI values of these artificial food colours which were obtained from Joint Expert Committee on Food Additives (JECFA) monographs (http://www.inchem.org/pages/jecfa.html). To prepare the artificial food colour mixture, colour additives were weighed separately and dissolved in water. Artificial food colour mixtures were prepared weekly and stored at 4°C.</p>

<sec id="section4-0748233712436638">
<title>Animals</title>
<p>Thirty, Wistar Han strain, female rats were included in the study and categorized as control group (<italic>n</italic> = 15) and experiment group (<italic>n</italic> = 15). The rats were housed individually in solid-floored cages with wood flakes and kept in a temperature-controlled (23 ± 1°C) room. One millilitre of artificial food colour mixture and 1 ml of water have been administered daily for a week by oral gavage to the experiment and the control groups, respectively. At the end of administration week, one male rat was placed in each cage and was allowed for 5 days to stay at the same cage to mate and the pregnancies of rats were provided. During the pairing period and the pregnancy period, administration of artificial food colour mixture to experiment group and water to control group was continued with the same dose and in the same way. After the partus of pregnant rats, offspring were allowed to stay with their mothers for a month for breast-feeding. Afterwards male and female offspring were separated and offspring of artificial food colour mixture administered rats were accepted as experiment group and offspring of water administered group were accepted as control group. At the end of 3 months, 10 female and 10 male rats from experiment group and 10 female and 10 male juvenile rats from control group were selected. The rats were grouped as female experiment group (FEG, <italic>n</italic> = 10), female control group (FCG, <italic>n</italic> = 10), male experiment group (MEG, <italic>n</italic> = 10), and male control group (MCG, <italic>n</italic> = 10). The colony room was maintained under an automatically regulated 12:12-h reverse light/dark cycle (lights off at 08:00 a.m.) and testing occurred during the dark phase which is their most active period.</p>
<p>For the spatial working memory, anxiety and depression tests, the rats were transferred to the laboratory where the test would be done and waited for a week for adaptation.</p>
<p>The animals were handled under the prescriptions for animal care and experimentation of the pertinent European Communities Council Directive (86/609/EEC), and all the procedures were approved by the Ethical Committee of Suleyman Demirel University.</p>

<title>Morris water maze</title>
<p>Morris water maze (MWM) is a task that evaluates spatial learning, a measure of cognitive function. A virtual version of this test has been validated in the human as a test for spatial learning. The tank was placed in a dimly lit, soundproof test room with various visual cues. This task uses a round pool of water in which a platform is submerged beneath the surface. When placed in the maze the animal’s task is to find the hidden platform. The MWM consisted of a circular pool, 150 cm in diameter and 80 cm in height, with the interior painted white. The water was maintained at a temperature of 22 ± 2°C and was made opaque by the addition of nontoxic dark yellow paint. The pool was surrounded by four halogen lights which were directed to the walls that surrounded the room.</p>
<sec id="section7-0748233712436638">
<title>Experimental procedure</title>
<p>Each trial was tracked using an overhead camera interfaced with a computer that recorded the time and path travelled for all the runs in the water maze. The tracking program which we used was Smart Version 2.0. The maze was divided into four equally sized virtual quadrants, which was named as zone 1, zone 2, zone 3 and zone 4. The platform remained in a fixed location for all runs and the target quadrant was the fourth quadrant. Throughout the experiment, animals were handled before the first trial of each day and then were released once from each of the four quadrants facing the centre of the pool. Daily training consisted of four trials in which the rat was placed in the water from four random starting positions (1, 2, 3 and 4) and the latency of escaping onto the platform was recorded. Start locations were equally spaced around the perimeter of the pool. This was conducted for 5 consecutive days. In a protocol modified from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0748233712436638">Morris (1984)</xref>, acquisition of place learning using spatial cues and navigational strategy was done on days 1–5 and then the test for memory called ‘probe trial’ was performed on day 6. On the first day of testing, animals were allowed to swim in the pool for 90 s. If a rat could not find the hidden platform, it was placed on the platform for 30 s to introduce the platform and show that the platform is a mean of escape from the water. On days 2–5, the animals were allowed to swim in the pool for 60 s. A trial ended when the rat climbed on the platform. If a rat again had not found the platform after 60 s, it was placed on the platform by the experimenter. All the rats were left on the platform for 15 s and then removed to their home cages by the experimenter. There were four trials per day, with an intertrial interval of approximately 20 min for each rat. After trials, subjects were dried with a towel and warmed under a 40-W soft white bulb (OSRAM) before being returned to the home cages. At the end of the fifth day, each rat had been trained 20 times totally and the acquisition period had been completed. On day 6, the platform was removed and the rats were released from the three other quadrants which did not contain the hidden platform before. At this probe trial test, the time spent in the target quadrant where the platform had been during acquisition period was recorded. The percentage of swimming in the quadrant of the former platform was calculated as a measurement of spatial memory. At day 1 if the time taken was greater than 90 s, it was recorded as 90 s; since day 2 if the time taken was greater than 60 s, it was recorded as 60 s. On day 7, visible platform procedure was applied. This is the cued version of the Morris water escape task. To eliminate the direct or indirect effects of the drug we have used, such as decreased vision, decreased motivational factors, increased anxiety of animals in the water and therefore decreased the desire to escape, we used cued version procedure. Each rat was released from the fourth quadrant all the time and visible platform was carried to the different quadrants for each trial except the fourth quadrant. Again escape latency to the visible platform was recorded (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0748233712436638">Morris, 1984</xref>).</p>

<sec id="section8-0748233712436638">
<title>Open-field test</title>
<p>The open-field maze (arena) was used to study locomotor, exploratory and anxiety-related behaviours. The apparatus consisted of a spherical arena (150 × 150 cm). The floor was marked into 16 segments. Four halogen lights were directed to the walls surrounding the apparatus, so diffuse overhead illuminations were provided. The animals were tested in a quiet room and the locomotor activity over a 5-min period was recorded using a ceiling-mounted videocamera (Sony SSC-DC398P, Japan). Each animal was tested individually in the open-field maze. Each animal was allowed to explore the maze for 5 min and behaviours were scored. The behaviours scored were as follows: the number of lines crossed with at least three paws of the rat, number of rearing and number of walling, the time spent at the edge of the apparatus, the time spent at the centre of the apparatus and number of centre square activity was recorded by a rater who were blind to the animals’ housing conditions. Line crossing (the number of line crosses) is a form of locomotor behaviour—horizontal locomotor activity. Rearing is defined as the animal standing upright on its hind legs. Walling is defined as the animal standing upright on its hind legs and front legs on the maze’s walls. Line crosses, rearing, walling, central square frequency and central square duration are usually used as measures of locomotor activity as well as exploration and anxiety, with a higher frequency of these behaviours indicating increased locomotion and exploration and low anxiety. Edge duration is a measure of exploratory behaviour and anxiety with a higher frequency of these activities indicating lower exploratory behaviour and higher anxiety (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0748233712436638">Brotto et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0748233712436638">Ekong et al., 2009</xref>).</p>

<sec id="section9-0748233712436638">
<title>Forced swim test</title>
<p>Rats were forced to swim in an inescapable situation, they tend to become immobile after initial vigorous activity. This immobility has been described as a symptom of a behavioural despair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0748233712436638">Porsolt et al., 1977</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0748233712436638">1978</xref>). The test was conducted using a modification of the method of Porsolt. Briefly, rats were individually placed in a 80-cm high and 40 cm diameter plastic cylindrical tank containing 50 cm of water with ambient temperature (23°C), so that the rat’s hindlimbs could not reach the tank’s floor. Rats were allowed to swim for 6 min and their activity was tracked (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0748233712436638">Karolewicz and Paul, 2001</xref>). The videotaped behaviour was subsequently analyzed by a rater who was blind to the animals’ housing conditions. Duration of immobility was defined as when the rat was stationary and only made the minimal movements necessary to stay afloat, and mobility was defined as swimming, jumping, rearing, sniffing or diving which were considered active, escape-directed behaviour. All of these movements were tracked using an overhead camera (Sony SSC-DC398P) interfaced with a computer which were using the Smart Version 2.0 program.</p>

<title>Statistical analysis</title>
<p>The statistical analyses were carried out using the SPSS for Windows program. The water maze data, latency to escape and probe trial data, open-field data and forced swim test data were first assessed by Levene homogeneity test, and the data were not homogeneous so the nonparametric tests were used and results were expressed as the mean ± SEM (standard error of mean) values. First, all the groups’ performance were assessed by Friedmann test and significance was found. A <italic>p</italic> value of less than 0.05 was considered to be statistically significant. To find which data was responsible for the significance, Wilcoxon signed ranks test was applied. Statistical significance between groups was analyzed by Krukal–Wallis test. The group comparisons of latency to escape to the hidden platform data and probe data of water maze and visible platform latency data were assessed by Kruskal–Wallis test. Open-field test and forced swim test data were again assessed by Kruskal–Wallis test. We used Bonferroni corrected Mann–Whitney <italic>U</italic> tests to determine which group was responsible for the difference. A <italic>p</italic> value of less than 0.01 was considered to be statistically significant. After the quartette comparisons, an additional statistical analysis was done, FEG and MEG were together accepted as experiment group, FCG and MCG were together accepted as control group and MWM data, open-field data and FST data of these two groups were assessed by one-way analysis of variance. A <italic>p</italic> value of less than &lt;0.05 was considered to be statistically significant.</p>

<title>Morris water maze data</title>
<p>The groups’ performance was assessed by Friedmann test, and it was found to be significant (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05). Comparison of day performances was as follows: performance of days 1–2, days 1–3, days 1– 4 and days 1–5 showed statistically significant differences in all groups (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0748233712436638">Figure 1</xref>). These results showed us that all groups learnt the system and developed to an acquisition level. There were no statistically significant difference between groups for the data of latency to escape to the hidden platform per day and there was no statistically significant difference between groups for probe trial test (<italic>p</italic> &gt; 0.05; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0748233712436638">Figure 2</xref>). Latency to escape to the visible platform was not statistically significant (<italic>p</italic> &gt; 0.05; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0748233712436638">Figure 3</xref>). So the data that evaluated the hippocampus-dependent spatial learning and memory showed no significant difference between groups. When we compare the MWM data as experiment and control group, like the quartette comparisons performance of days 1–2, days 1–3 and days 1–4 showed statistically significant difference (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05). Day 1, day 2, day 3, day 4 and day 5 comparisons between control and experiment group were not found to be statistically significant (<italic>p</italic> &gt; 0.05), so the spatial learning rates showed no difference between groups.</p>

<title>Open-field test data</title>
<p>Open-field maze data included number of line crosses, rearing, centre crosses, edge duration and centre duration. Kruskal–Wallis test was used to compare these data of the groups. Line crosses and edge duration data were statistically significant (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05). Number of line crosses data of FEG was significantly increased when compared with MEG and MCG (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01) and also FCG’s line crosses data were significantly higher when compared with MCG (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0748233712436638">Table 1</xref>). These data showed that the measure of locomotor activity as well as exploration in female offspring was significantly higher. When we compare control group (FCG + MCG, <italic>n</italic> = 20) and experiment group (FEG + MEG, <italic>n</italic> = 20) to find whether the sex would be the only fact of this significance, pairwise comparison of the groups as control and experiment group showed that the number of line crosses data still significant, and the number of line crosses was significantly higher in experiment group when compared with control group (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05; <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0748233712436638">Table 2</xref>). So AFCA exposition significantly increased the exploration behaviour and locomotor activity for this data. Edge duration time was significantly decreased in MEG when compared with MCG (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01; <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0748233712436638">Table 1</xref>). According to this data, we should mention that in male offspring the AFCA seems to lower the anxiety; but in females, there was no significant difference. But comparison of groups as experiment (<italic>n</italic> = 20) and control group (<italic>n</italic> = 20), unlike the comparison of four group edge duration data was not significant (<italic>p</italic> &gt; 0.05), but the number of walling data was significant (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05; <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0748233712436638">Table 2</xref>). Number of walling was significantly higher in experiment group when compared with control group, these data support the number of line crosses, as they are usually used as measure of locomotor activity, as well as higher exploration and lower anxiety for experiment group.</p>

<p>In quartette comparisons not only AFCA’s effect but the contribution of sex to locomotor behaviour was also evaluated. We can mention that gender should be an important fact on the differences in locomotor activity, exploration, and anxiety behaviour. But statistical analysis of data as experiment and control group showed us the significance in the number of line crosses and number of walling data. So AFCA alone effected two behaviours which we used as the signs of explorative and higher locomotor behaviour. In addition, AFCA and gender together might display synergistic effect on locomotor behaviour and might create different effects on male or female gender.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Our results showed that commonly used artificial food colours have no adverse effects on hippocampus-dependent spatial learning and memory when applied as a mixture with their ADI amounts. In the assessment of locomotor activity as well as exploration and anxiety, artificial food colours mixture showed a few significant effects. Quartette comparisons gave rise to the thought that the gender has an important contribution on significance. Females seem to have significantly better exploratory behaviour and also have better locomotor activity. But comparison of experiment and control groups showed that locomotor activity and exploration behaviour were higher in experiment group so not gender alone but artificial food colour mixture and gender together may have synergistic effect on locomotor activity and exploration behaviour.</p>
<p>Tanaka studied different AFCAs and evaluated selected reproductive and neurobehavioural parameters in mice. Different doses of erythrosine, sunset yellow FCF, Ponceau 4R, amaranth, allura red AC and lac dye in the diet were administered. In the study with erythrosine, emotional and movement activities were significantly increased in a dose-related manner and also in T-maze, movement time and average speed were significantly increased in the high-dose group in females (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0748233712436638">Tanaka, 2001</xref>). For sunset yellow FCF, some of the different neurobehavioural parameters were affected in female and in male offspring during the early lactation period in a dose-related manner. The middle- and high-dose levels of sunset yellow FCF produced some adverse effects in reproductive and neurobehavioural parameters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0748233712436638">Tanaka, 1996</xref>). For Ponceau 4R, in multiple water T-maze performance in the <italic>F</italic>
<sub>1</sub> generation, the time taken was significantly longer than the control in the middle-dose and high-dose groups in males, and those effects were significantly dose related (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0748233712436638">Tanaka, 2006</xref>). For middle doses of amaranth, several parameters of movement activity of male offspring at 3 weeks of age were affected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0748233712436638">Tanaka, 1993</xref>). There were few adverse effects of allura red AC on either movement activity or maze learning in F<sub>1</sub> generation mice in each sex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0748233712436638">Tanaka, 1994</xref>). The natural colour additive, lac dye, had also affected the neurobehavioural parameters. Swimming head angle was significantly affected in male offspring and olfactory orientation was significantly accelerated in female offspring in a dose-related manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0748233712436638">Tanaka, 1997</xref>). In Tanaka’s studies, AFCA’s adverse effects on neurobehavioural parameters seemed to be dose related, and adverse effects at selected parameters were seen with the middle and high doses which were greater than human ADI. Also different doses caused different effects in male and female mice. In accordance with our results; in Tanaka’s studies gender was reported as an important fact with the AFCAs’ effect on neurobehavioural parameters.</p>
<p>On the other hand, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0748233712436638">Sobotka et al. (1977)</xref> studied the different doses of artificial food colour tartrazine during gestation and lactation and showed no significant effect on the developing nervous system.</p>
<p>Studies in children are still inconsistent. Several studies reported improved behavioural characteristics in part, but not in all children of their study population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0748233712436638">Conners et al., 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0748233712436638">Kaplan et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0748233712436638">Williams et al., 1978</xref>), whereas others did not provide support for the Feingold hypothesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0748233712436638">Harley et al., 1978a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0748233712436638">b</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0748233712436638">Silver (1986)</xref> claimed that the specific elimination of synthetic food colours from the diet did not appear to be a major factor in the reduction of hyperactive behaviour in the majority of children. A recent study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0748233712436638">McCann et al. (2007)</xref> has concluded that exposure to two mixtures of four synthetic colours plus a sodium benzoate preservative in the diet resulted in increased hyperactivity in 3-year-old and 8- to 9-year-old children in general population and presented a support for the case that food additives exacerbate hyperactive behaviours (inattention, impulsivity and overactivity) in children at least up to middle childhood. These findings also showed that adverse effects are not just seen in children with extreme hyperactivity (i.e. ADHD) but can also be seen in the general population and across the range of severities of hyperactivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0748233712436638">McCann et al., 2007</xref>). The EFSA panel concludes that the study of Mc Cann et al. provided limited evidence that the two different mixtures of synthetic colours and sodium benzoate tested had a small and statistically significant effect on activity and attention in some children selected from the general population, although the effects were not observed for all children in all age groups and were not consistent for the two mixtures. The findings may thus be relevant for specific individuals within the population, showing sensitivity to food additives in general or to food colours in particular (The <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0748233712436638">EFSA Panel, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>The results of research carried on human and animals do not overlap completely. The selected tasks that were used to evaluate the neurobehavioural effects in experimental studies were not directly associated with ADHD, but they provide the signs of increased locomotor activity and spatial learning difficulty. Although there were some significant effects on locomotor activity as well as exploration and anxiety, artificial food colours which were used with ADI values during pregnancy had no adverse effect on spatial working memory and did not create a depressive behaviour in offspring. In our study ADI values of artificial food colours have been used as a mixture, so we cannot ignore the possibility that exceeding ADI values might cause additional and increased adverse effects. Thus, we can suggest that although gender seems to be an additional fact in the side effects of artificial food colours, we are not able to conclude exact clinical results based on these data. Besides in today’s world too much of artificial foods are being consumed and the amounts that exceed ADI values may become a question. Therefore, it would be a reliable approach to lower the consumption of take-home foods that contain AFCAs.</p>
