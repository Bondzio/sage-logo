<abstract>
<p>Active inclusion reforms are radically transforming social policies in Europe. Consequently, the welfare state is changing from a social citizenship approach based on uniform benefits and services towards a system of individualized, targeted welfare intervention. Reforms therefore involve a fundamental re-organization of welfare provision. This transformation is usually discussed as a matter of national regimes for active inclusion and European diffusion of ‘good’ governance. However, active inclusion policies rely on a different social policy approach implying differentiated implementation processes. The implementation of active inclusion reforms can therefore only be understood by taking into account the local level. A series of local studies on French and German minimum income schemes raises questions about national accounts of these schemes, which depict a shift towards workfare. By contrast, this article reveals local variation between market-oriented, bureaucratic and participatory active inclusion strategies dependent on the distinct local governance arrangements.</p>

<body>
<p>The key principles of the ‘Golden-Age’ welfare state were uniformity and similarity of welfare provision. The post-war welfare state was based on the logic of social citizenship (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0958928711425270">Marshall, 1965</xref>). Citizens were entitled to equal access to national programmes and benefits regardless of their regional affiliation or local authority.</p>
<p>However, the introduction of active inclusion policies radically transformed this egalitarian approach. Social policies are now increasingly based on a targeted, individualized approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0958928711425270">Serrano Pascual, 2007</xref>): ‘The process of individualization … has allegedly turned [universal] public provision of benefits and services into an approach not fit for purpose, as the needs of people have diversified and their desire for choice has increased’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0958928711425270">Seeleib-Kaiser, 2008</xref>: 4). By aiming to achieve the active inclusion of all people into society, the question is raised of how those experiencing diverse and often simultaneous causes of social exclusion (lack of adequate means of social protection, low skills, problems of child and family care, health, housing and transport) can be assisted with employment and accessing welfare services (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0958928711425270">Borghi and Van Berkel, 2007</xref>). These issues require welfare interventions to take individual circumstances into account (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0958928711425270">Van Berkel and Valkenburg, 2007</xref>: 3).</p>
<p>The transformation from uniform towards individualized welfare interventions represents a fundamental challenge for the architecture of modern welfare states. Active inclusion of marginalized people raises the question of how benefits and a range of welfare services can be connected with individual incentives and how enabling services tailored to the needs of the welfare beneficiaries can be organized. Hence, welfare state change becomes a problem of reorganizing services and benefits. Usually this question is discussed as an issue of European regulatory processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0958928711425270">Visser, 2009</xref>) or as a matter of national regimes of active inclusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0958928711425270">Barbier, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>To a great extent, however, the concrete organization of active inclusion policies takes place at the local level. Reforms to render public policies more ‘active’ and ‘coordinated’ (re-)introduce local discretion into social policy programmes, as, for example, minimum income schemes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0958928711425270">Finn, 2000</xref>). Processes of localizing welfare interventions, changing modes of welfare service delivery and new management techniques for controlling services are shifting issues regarding the reorganization of employment and social welfare services to the local level. We therefore assume that the introduction of active inclusion policies causes transformations of European welfare states that evolve differently depending on distinct structures of local governance.</p>
<p>The hypothesis of this paper is derived on the basis of three components. First, the renewal of the welfare state from uniform citizenship towards a targeted and individualized approach is discussed. Differences between market-oriented, bureaucratic and participatory concepts for active inclusion are highlighted. Second, the implications of active inclusion policies for the re-organization of the welfare state are discussed. We examine how distinct organizational conditions of local welfare provision relate to the different active inclusion strategies (market-oriented, bureaucratic or participatory). Finally, we test our assumptions about different local paths of active inclusion reforms by looking at eight local case studies detailing minimum income programmes in France and Germany. National accounts of these schemes usually point out very similar workfare trends in both countries. At the local level, however, we have discovered very different outcomes of active inclusion reforms, ranging from market-oriented, integrated and participatory variants of active inclusion to the persistence of standardized benefits.</p>
<sec id="section1-0958928711425270">
<title>Concepts and patterns of active inclusion in Europe</title>
<p>Active inclusion implies a reinterpretation of the relationship between the welfare state and its citizens. It signifies a shift from the idea of uniform social citizenship and collective rights towards greater individual responsibility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0958928711425270">Serrano Pascual, 2007</xref>). In theory – and today often in a practice – the benefit recipient and the state agree on a contract that defines reciprocal responsibilities. Without the benefit recipient taking an active role in this process of welfare ‘co-production’, the intended service cannot be delivered (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0958928711425270">Pestoff, 2009</xref>). This raises potential for discussion about different concepts of individual behaviour (see later) and also implies that welfare interventions create an important context for active inclusion (see later).</p>
<sec id="section2-0958928711425270">
<title>Active inclusion programmes: underlying concepts of individual behaviour</title>
<p>Active inclusion is a deviation from the idea of uniform social citizenship as it depends on individualized strategies. The concept comprises competing approaches for dealing with precarious life situations. This is evidenced by analysing the contrasting assumptions about individual behaviour that can underlie social policies. We distinguish between four approaches: individuals can be conceived as social citizens, clients, beneficiaries and autonomous citizens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0958928711425270">Van Berkel and Møller, 2002</xref>: 51–6).</p>
<p>The idea of social citizenship corresponds to social programmes that guarantee income protection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0958928711425270">Marshall, 1965</xref>). From this perspective, adequate benefits suffice to enable social citizens to make use of their capacities to act. Inclusion is supported via collective rights but remains open to definition by the individual.</p>
<p>In contrast, as a first variant of active inclusion, a market-oriented concept explains precarious life situations as a consequence of a lack of individual incentives. Following the rational argument ‘generosity … makes it irrational for individuals to reject benefits in favour of work’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0958928711425270">Lødemel and Trickey, 2001</xref>: 18). Thus, individuals play the role of clients contracting work-first services. Active labour market policies (ALMP), social policies and vocational training are conceptualized for the short run while financial incentives (regulations of the tax and benefit system) enforce labour market inclusion.</p>
<p>As a second type of active inclusion, a bureaucratic concept views the individual as being limited in many aspects, notably living conditions, qualifications or health. Individuals are treated as beneficiaries of a set of integrated services defined by the enabling state. Beneficiaries are bound to benefit from placement, counselling, social policies and ALMP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0958928711425270">Eichhorst et al., 2008a</xref>: 5). Services match a ‘policy of producing individuals and identities’ for labour market inclusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0958928711425270">Serrano Pascual, 2007</xref>: 12).</p>
<p>A third approach shares structural explanations for precarious life situations but proposes a participatory concept for active inclusion. Individuals are viewed as autonomous citizens who require encouragement to choose between employment and welfare services (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0958928711425270">Salais, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0958928711425270">Sen, 1999</xref>): ‘Without the substantive freedom and capability to do something, a person cannot be responsible for doing it’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0958928711425270">Sen, 1999</xref>: 284). Participatory services rely on the individuals’ commitment to use their capabilities to choose active participation in society.</p>
<p>To conclude, individualized strategies for active inclusion differ from collective rights of income protection. A market-oriented concept of active inclusion focuses on incentives for welfare clients to generate income on the labour market. In contrast, in the bureaucratic version, an enabling state defines beneficiaries’ needs for integrated policies to surmount structural deprivation for labour market integration. Alternatively, a participatory approach promotes autonomous citizens’ capabilities to choose among options for active inclusion. These market-oriented, bureaucratic and participatory strategies for the active inclusion of marginalized people into society require different organizational forms of welfare state intervention.</p>

<sec id="section3-0958928711425270">
<title>The institutional context: organizing local welfare interventions</title>
<p>Parallel to the programmatic aspects of active inclusion, the organizational context is crucial for implementing individualized approaches to welfare provision. Reforms of the organization, administration and delivery of policies and services are part of active inclusion strategies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0958928711425270">Borghi and Van Berkel, 2007</xref>). Changes in European welfare states show common trends of ‘good’ governance comprising decentralization, administrative reforms and new service delivery models. The Open Method of Coordination challenges the functioning of European welfare states and leads to transnational learning of governance reforms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0958928711425270">Visser, 2009</xref>). Deviations from common European trends are explained by national patterns of implementing active inclusion reforms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0958928711425270">Barbier, 2004</xref>): ‘The adoption and introduction of new forms of governance in the context of operational policy reforms are “filtered” or shaped by (national) socio-economic, historical, cultural, institutional and political contexts’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0958928711425270">Borghi and Van Berkel, 2007</xref>: 97). As a result, reforms of labour market and social policy programmes as well as changes in administration and policy coordination are usually analysed at the national level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0958928711425270">Clasen and Clegg, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>However, the exclusive focus on European and national institutions becomes increasingly problematic in understanding and analysing current welfare state reforms. Assuming that national reforms are the most important element in transforming welfare states may mean that important organizational issues are ignored (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0958928711425270">Clarke, 2008</xref>). Such a perspective implies that centralism and universalism are still overriding principles of the organization, administration and delivery of policies and services. It closely corresponds to a welfare state that is modelled on collective rights and uniform benefits to social citizens. Active inclusion reforms, however, imply different and new forms of welfare intervention. The promotion of individualized and targeted intervention goes along with the introduction of greater flexibility and discretion into welfare provision (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0958928711425270">Finn, 2000</xref>). According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0958928711425270">Salais and Villeneuve (2004)</xref>, the decentralization of competences, administrative reforms and new service delivery models all support situated public action. Situated public action means that the design, implementation and evaluation of social policies are no longer hierarchically and functionally divided steps but interrelated processes of providing social services. Situated public action implies the interaction of national and local authorities, public and private organizations, employment and social services, social workers and placement officers, beneficiaries and case-managers (Pestoff, 2008). In this process of co-producing individualized policies and services, the local level becomes key. It is at the local level where the different actors intervene to organize, administer and deliver targeted policies and services for active inclusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0958928711425270">Kaufmann, 2009</xref>: 88–106; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0958928711425270">Kazepov, 2010</xref>: 35–72). This local governance of situated welfare interventions can be analysed in terms of three dimensions: the local conditions for policies and services, the local institutionalization of the modes of interaction for welfare intervention and the local implementation of techniques for controlling service delivery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0958928711425270">Van Berkel and Borghi, 2008</xref>).</p>
<sec id="section4-0958928711425270">
<title>Local conditions for policies and services</title>
<p>The decentralization of competences for welfare interventions to the local level is an important prerequisite for providing a broader range of situated services – independent of the specific form of active inclusion policy (either market-oriented, bureaucratic or participatory) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0958928711425270">Lindsay et al., 2008</xref>). This localization reduces the capacity of national legislation to define universal, collective rights. Increasingly, the range of social policies and the concrete services are decided upon at the local level. However, the ability of public authorities, third sector organizations, and placement and welfare offices to locally provide individual, tailor-made or even participatory solutions varies strongly. Social services are increasingly determined and provided by local communities specified either by market-orientation, bureaucracy or partnership.</p>
<p>Market-oriented active inclusion policies are linked to conditions of decentralization leading to structural and financial retrenchment of the welfare system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0958928711425270">Rauch, 2008</xref>). Actors at the local level are weak and fragmented. This can be due to cost-shifting strategies in the multi-level system, limited financial resources or weak political preferences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0958928711425270">Finn, 2000</xref>: 54). Local accounts of active inclusion reforms in Poland (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0958928711425270">Sztandar-Sztanderska, 2009</xref>) and Italy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0958928711425270">Monteleone and Mozzana, 2009</xref>) suggest that weak local actors delivering important social services contribute to a cost-minimizing, market-oriented strategy.</p>
<p>According to the bureaucratic concept of active inclusion, national, regional and local efforts in a region are integrated by public agencies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0958928711425270">Niklasson, 2007</xref>: 188). While resources for the integration of services are available at the local level, the issue is monopolized by public agencies. In local structures based on bureaucratic entanglement, actors refrain from seeking broader legitimization at the local level. Thus, while enabling approaches are realized by the local integration of public services, local ties to citizens and associations remain weak.</p>
<p>In a setting characterized by local partnerships, issues are not only taken up at the local level but various actors also participate in carrying out active inclusion policies. The concept requires active local communities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0958928711425270">Lindsay et al., 2008</xref>: 717–21). For example, in the UK, authority was devolved in the form of ‘working neighbourhood’ projects. Strong communities fostered active inclusion through local ‘partners’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0958928711425270">Lindsay et al., 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>In short, situated public action shifts welfare interventions from the relatively homogeneous definition provided by national legislation towards local milieus, structures and initiatives. Local conditions support different approaches towards active inclusion. In the case of a market-oriented concept, weak and isolated local actors opt for cost-minimizing strategies. Bureaucratic localization of active inclusion policies is based on an important but exclusive structure of decentralized public agencies that integrate issues of active inclusion. In the case of a participatory concept, strong local communities use devolved authority for locally bound partnerships to encourage active inclusion.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0958928711425270">
<title>Local modes of interaction for service delivery</title>
<p>Decentralized, situated forms of public action imply a shift from the hierarchical provision of standardized services towards more inclusive types of local service organization. This increases the significance of interactions within a region. However, interaction between public authorities, placement and welfare offices, placement officers and management, case managers and persons in receipt of benefits may proceed according to different logics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0958928711425270">Garrow and Hasenfeld, 2010</xref>: 33–57). Local coordination processes for service delivery can be distinguished according to competition, bureaucratic regulation or participation.</p>
<p>Local interactions organized in the form of competition for ‘cheaper’ services support a market-oriented logic of active inclusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0958928711425270">Bredgaard and Larsen, 2007</xref>). Contracts and economic incentives then form the basis of relationships in a given region. Actors responsible for managerial, executive and operational tasks act at arm’s length as they are competing for ‘input’ in the process of delivering policies. Local studies from the UK in particular show how the introduction of competitive tendering among service providers transformed the local delivery of services into a market-oriented concept of active inclusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0958928711425270">Lindsay et al., 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>In contrast to arm’s length relations, bureaucratic welfare interventions for active inclusion are based on an expert system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0958928711425270">Kaufmann, 2009</xref>: 258–268). Local coordination of service delivery is viewed as an issue for the professionals involved in the necessary technical details. Such forms of competence-based coordination are highly technical, complex and shaped by micro-politics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0958928711425270">Derlien, 2000</xref>).</p>
<p>A participatory mode of active inclusion involves autonomous stakeholders who participate in arguing processes regarding welfare interventions. The various interests in the processes of action planning and service provision are acknowledged by making them subject to reason-giving. The idea is to persuade others of the right service by the ‘power of the better argument’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0958928711425270">Elster, 1998</xref>).</p>
<p>In short, a shift from hierarchical provision towards situated active inclusion policies demands greater local coordination for service delivery. However, different logics shape local interactions. In the case of a market-oriented concept of active inclusion, the delivery of services is organized in the form of competition between rational actors. For a bureaucratic concept of active inclusion, experts in a competence-based system regulate the delivery of services. In the participatory model, agreement on service delivery is a matter of local arguing processes between numerous autonomous stakeholders.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0958928711425270">
<title>Local control techniques of service delivery</title>
<p>Decentralized, situated public action requires ways to locally control differentiated activities between public authorities, third sector organizations, management, case managers and benefit recipients. Local mechanisms of control thereby partly replace or complement guarantees of collective social citizenship rights by national legislature or law courts. However, techniques employed to locally control service delivery can vary considerably (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0958928711425270">Hood et al., 2002</xref>). We distinguish between market-oriented, bureaucratic and participatory local attempts to control welfare interventions for active inclusion.</p>
<p>Market-oriented control is organized by benchmarking in the form of publishing rating systems or league tables of standards (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0958928711425270">Hood et al., 2002</xref>: 192). Operational control is weak, as this would imply a closer engagement and implication of the local controller in the process of service delivery. Therefore, outcome oriented indicators dominate. Opportunities to evaluate long-term procedures and more complex interventions are limited. Local accounts of active inclusion reforms in the UK (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0958928711425270">Lindsay et al., 2008</xref>), Italy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0958928711425270">Monteleone and Mozzana, 2009</xref>) and Poland (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0958928711425270">Sztandar-Sztanderska, 2009</xref>) illustrate how the introduction of simple job-entry statistics for controlling purposes shifts the focus of services onto job placement efforts for clients with lesser obstacles.</p>
<p>In the case of a bureaucratic concept of active inclusion, not only strategic but also operational control is high. General standards, formal rules and detailed reporting are applied by local actors to guarantee the inner coherence and integrated character of services. As a result, discretion in service delivery, for example between case managers and beneficiaries, is traded for consistency and accountability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0958928711425270">Du Gay, 2000</xref>).</p>
<p>Supposing a participatory concept for active inclusion control is based on the reciprocal dependency of actors. A ‘history’ of mutual action and group processes make local actors respect common goals. Trust-based control allows complex goals to be steered for welfare intervention. In the course of delivery, it leaves room for those realizing a service to adapt to specific circumstances (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0958928711425270">Bredgaard and Larsen, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>In short, unlike the oversight of collective rights by members of national parliament or law courts, decentralized, situated public action suggests various local ways to control services. In the case of market-based active inclusion, actors are controlled at a distance by outcome-oriented local benchmarking. In contrast, standards and detailed rules are locally applied to guarantee the coherence of services for a bureaucratic concept of active inclusion. Local group processes and mutuality control a participatory concept for active inclusion.</p>

<sec id="section7-0958928711425270">
<title>Active inclusion as a matter of local governance</title>
<p>Active inclusion policies initiate a shift from collective attempts at welfare state interventions towards more individual, integrated or even participatory approaches. This transformation is not only an issue of differences in programmatic terms, but also an organizational matter. Active inclusion policies introduce greater flexibility and local discretion for organizing benefits and services. For targeted and individual delivery, policies and services require local co-production involving national and local actors, public and private welfare providers, case-managers and benefit recipients. Beyond European and national reform paths, active inclusion policies therefore crucially shift the outcome of social policy onto the local level. Modes of regulating interaction between the manifold actors at the local level, the local conditions for taking up services and policies, as well as the local techniques for controlling situated public action, influence the direction of strategies aimed at promoting welfare and work for marginalized persons. We therefore assume that the European and national implementation of active inclusion reforms is to a great extent decided upon by local arrangements of organizing welfare interventions. As summarized in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0958928711425270">Table 1</xref>, we distinguish between four ideal types of the local organization of welfare interventions. While the provision of collective rights of social citizenship was based on principles of central organization, local governance can vary between market-oriented elements for the active inclusion of clients, bureaucratic concepts for the active inclusion of beneficiaries or participatory approaches for autonomous citizens.</p>

<title>Local governance of active inclusion in Europe</title>
<p>Based on a ‘most similar systems’ design (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0958928711425270">Przeworski and Teune, 1970</xref>) the possibility of locally varying active inclusion strategies is examined in this paper for France and Germany. For the purposes of comparative study, sampling systems that are as similar as possible reduces the number of factors accounting for differences. As a result of both belonging to the status-conserving Bismarckian welfare state model, France and Germany introduced similar social and labour market policy reforms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0958928711425270">Clegg, 2007</xref>). National accounts of the reformed minimum income schemes portray a move towards market-oriented active inclusion in Germany (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0958928711425270">Eichhorst et al., 2008b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0958928711425270">Jacobi and Mohr, 2007</xref>) but also in France: ‘More recently (2003), the minimum income system was reformed in order to introduce a new welfare-to-work scheme’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0958928711425270">Erhel and Zajdela, 2004</xref>: 138). For each country, we present local cases detailing the implementation of minimum income benefit programmes. Besides similar national regulation, we found very dissimilar local organizations of welfare interventions that may explain the different outcomes we observe.</p>
<p>The case studies serve the purpose of ‘plausibility probes’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0958928711425270">Gerring, 2004</xref>: 348) regarding the crucial role of the local level in implementing activation regimes. The insights are derived from a study of eight local authorities in France and Germany for the EU co-funded research project ‘Capright’. For a comparative design (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0958928711425270">Yin, 2007</xref>), in each country two ‘weak’ and two ‘strong’ socio-economic local authorities were selected for investigation. The detailed case studies are compiled from multiple sources of data including 80 expert interviews, documentary analysis and study of secondary literature. Field research in 2008 and 2009 covered the most important phase of institutionalization during the central activation policy reforms in Germany (2005) and France (2004), respectively. In each region, the author conducted interviews with key local decision-makers from local authorities, state agencies, employment agencies, welfare offices and third sector organizations. Based on a common analytical grid, detailed local reports were then composed. The material and quotes presented here as a case-study design represent a reconstruction of local procedures. As the interviewees were guaranteed complete confidentiality, neither their names nor the local entities studied are revealed in this publication.</p>
<p>By applying this theory-guided, comparative and multiple qualitative case study design to practice, we explore different local procedures of welfare provision in both France and Germany. We present the four most ‘crucial’ cases in detail and summarize the whole sample in a tabular overview at the end. The presented in-depth cases best exemplify the strong distinctions found between local procedures that gave rise to the development of four conceptually different types of local welfare intervention.</p>

<title>Local governance of minimum income schemes in France</title>
<p>In France, the renewal of the main minimum income scheme (‘Revenu minimum d’insertion’ (RMI) re-invigorated by a new regulation for a ‘Revenu de Solidarité Active’ (RSA) in 2009) into an instrument of active inclusion policy has entailed an extensive reorganization of welfare provision. While access criteria and the level of benefits both remain regulated nationally, decentralization in 2004 turned the organization of services into a local issue. Legal provisions only oblige the responsible local authority (‘Départements’) to appoint case-managers and to sign integration contracts with recipients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0958928711425270">Borgetto and Lafore, 2007</xref>). The local authority holds competences for numerous social services and is free to devise proper ALMP. As amounts of state financing are fixed, the development of the number of welfare recipients can pose a budgetary risk for the local authority (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0958928711425270">Aubree et al., 2006</xref>). At the local level, recipients of minimum income schemes can also access services run by the public employment service (‘Pôle Emploi’), agencies of national ministries, other sub-national actors, action plans for long-term unemployed (‘Plans Locaux pour l’Insertion et l’Emploi’) and local ‘one-stop shops for employment’ (‘Maison d’Emploi’).</p>
<sec id="section10-0958928711425270">
<title>Local authority F-C</title>
<p>In region F-C, provision of the minimum income scheme is based on local partnerships. A broad range of social and labour market services is offered to benefit recipients.</p>
<p>The local government views budgetary responsibility and the few national legal provisions as an incentive to organize specific local services for active inclusion policies. A history of successful local collaborations and an active community make local politicians and civil servants coordinate policies and services in a participatory way. As a principle of local partnership, the local authority cooperates with various actors to set up a service delivery system. Local committees for the minimum income scheme (for example, ‘Comité Départemental de l’Insertion’) serve to coordinate between the different public agencies and welfare associations. The local authority either supplements existing services by co-financing, for example public employment services, or it creates new offers by contracting out and public tendering of service demands to numerous actors. In doing so, counselling and placement tasks are delegated to case managers in public employment services and communes but also in up to 80 very different local associations (among these, for example, an association only for unemployed young artists). For recipients signing an integration contract, this opens up multiple options to access counselling either on social, socio-professional or job-placement matters. A high civil servant of the local authority explains how this service delivery system promotes the ‘self-reliance’ of recipients:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>The recipients not only need to be listened to or given money. But it depends on how we can assist them to become an actor of their proper life … . For each case, we put in place a gateway towards integration and this track depends on the abilities of the person … . For example, if the person is very close to taking up an employment activity, we have a contract with Pôle Emploi and Pôle Emploi will be responsible for the case management of this person. If we have someone who needs training or further education, we might have a specific association for this purpose and we will ask this association to take up the case management for this person, and finally, we, as Département, we will rather assist those recipients of the minimum income scheme that need social counselling before they can really tackle the route for integration. (F-C-3)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>To ensure that case managers, agencies and associations deliver services as planned, the local authority has developed different mechanisms of control. Broader, contracted objectives on the numbers of persons placed into employment or further education steer implementation. Simultaneously, the local authority, public agencies and welfare associations repeatedly highlight mutuality as basis for their relations. Since decentralization, continuous exchanges have been institutionalized, for example, in the form of roundtables, between the actors. As a result, commitment to the premises of the local service delivery system evolved including the application of integration contracts.</p>
<p>In short, strengthened by devolved competences, a reform-oriented local authority coordinates local partners’ different organizational resources and approaches for a local service delivery system. Local resource sharing, intensive local arguing processes between various actors on the right service offer and mixed control techniques resemble a participatory concept that creates various options of active inclusion for benefit recipients.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-0958928711425270">
<title>Local authority F-B</title>
<p>In region F-B, the minimum income benefit scheme is organized as an administration of assistance payment. Specific services to activate assistance recipients are weakly structured.</p>
<p>Local authority F-B hardly undertakes any efforts to implement active inclusion policies. Since the decentralization of the minimum income scheme, local politicians have been attacking the central state for neglecting its social responsibility. Local politicians repeatedly call on the Public Employment Agency to intensify activities towards minimum income scheme recipients. In the local administration, key positions are held by social workers who are sceptical about active inclusion policies. As a result, the obligatory case management of assistance recipients was simply added as another assignment to the already numerous tasks of the local social welfare services. Civil servants of the local authority recognize that an active counselling role, involving job placement or the drafting of integration contracts, is not common. The statement made by a manager of a local welfare service illustrates how the local organization relies on a concept to give people a minimum income but refrains from implementing active inclusion policy:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Us, we are here for advice, information and reception. … In any case, we, our role is to inform them [the recipients] with regard to the law and legal regulations … But then they act at their own risk and fate, but, me, I am not here for judging them. If you need, I can assist you, I can help you … . But then the rest, this is up to them to decide, these are adult persons. (F-B-9)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Apart from the national regulation for benefit payment, the local authority refuses to take any form of specific control regarding policy outcomes.</p>
<p>In conclusion, the local authority is opposed to reform and widely refrains from initiating local programmes, coordination or control mechanisms to achieve the active inclusion of assistance recipients. Instead, the local authority F-B administers benefits as a guaranteed minimum income.</p>

<sec id="section12-0958928711425270">
<title>Different local welfare interventions in France</title>
<p>Contrary to accounts of a shift in the French minimum income scheme towards market-oriented active inclusion, different local practices are indeed possible. In region F-C, the local authority takes advantage of decentralized responsibilities to create opportunities for the active inclusion of assistance recipients into employment and social services. For this, the local authority builds on established local partnerships, accepts arguing as a mode of coordination and implements forms of control that are largely based on mutuality. In contrast, local authority F-B administers the minimum income benefit as a guaranteed payment, while the local political authority calls on the central state to provide services.</p>

<title>Local governance of minimum income schemes in Germany</title>
<p>Initiated by the German labour market reforms (‘Hartz-Reformen’), the integration of social assistance and unemployment assistance led to the foundation of merged local services (‘Jobcenter’) for unemployed minimum income recipients in 2005. Local authorities (‘Kommunen’) usually agreed to merge tasks for social welfare with the local placement agencies of the Federal Employment Agency. National regulation defines entitlement criteria for benefits and instruments of ALMP. Competitive tendering is compulsory for the delivery of training and further education. In addition, centralized control of broader objectives is aimed at ensuring active placement. Given these national specifications, it is up to local actors to compile the specific local labour market programme, to organize complementary social services or to set local management objectives.</p>
<sec id="section14-0958928711425270">
<title>Local authority G-D</title>
<p>In region G-D, the organization of the minimum income programme focuses on placing unemployed people who are deemed immediately capable of working into employment or related activities.</p>
<p>A small circle involving the local management of the Jobcentre and the Employment Agency are primarily responsible for organizing the services. Local political, administrative or civil engagement in these decision-making processes is weak. The management of the Jobcentre does not consider collaboration with social associations or the local social welfare services as important. Approaches of local partnership or local bureaucracy are widely discredited due to a recent case of corruption. In contrast, strong credit is generally given to the Employment Agency’s local advocates of a transparent, market-oriented approach. Accordingly, the director of the Jobcentre points out that cost efficiency concerns prevail over social considerations in the local service delivery:</p>
<p>Let’s be realistic. A certain group of clients will not have a chance on the first labour market. This is at least consensus among our local supervising authorities. We should not waste money by spending only due to reasons of social policy deliberations (G-D-2).</p>
<p>The local labour market programme is predominantly composed of workfare community jobs (‘Arbeitsgelegenheiten mit Mehraufwandsentschädigung’) and short training measures. To implement the workfare community jobs, the Jobcentre pays project-executing organizations the minimum standard financial endowment. Among the staff of the Jobcentre, many employees have not been trained for placements or counselling. Of those qualified, placement officers outweigh social workers. The local authority mentions cost-minimizing strategies as a reason for not providing more qualified social workers. In this situation, the management of the Jobcentre advise staff to concentrate on placement but to refrain from social counselling activities. Furthermore, recipients whose short-term prospects of finding work are considered slim are not subject to placement or counselling efforts.</p>
<p>In order to steer services, the Jobcentre actively uses the national framework for benchmarking. In general, relationships between the management of the Jobcentre, staff and project-executing organizations primarily rely on controlling indicators for successful placement of the unemployed into employment, education or publicly subsidized jobs.</p>
<p>In summary, against the background of a shattered local community, service delivery is dominated by cost-efficiency strategies drawn up by the Employment Agency’s local civil servants. The federal steering and policy instruments for placement activities provide local resources for implementing a market-oriented logic. Partly on the basis of public tendering, project-executing organizations are paid a low tariff for their services to recipients. The activities of project-executing organizations and staff are controlled by placement benchmarking. In general, the services concentrate on those unemployed people who are easier to place on the labour market.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section15-0958928711425270">
<title>Local authority G-A</title>
<p>In region G-A, the minimum income scheme comprises both social as well as labour market services to integrate the unemployed into work-related activities.</p>
<p>Backed by the local political ambition of taking social concerns into broader account, the local administration actively makes use of its new authority over the Jobcentre. The local administration is an established actor with a wide influence over local activities. Relying on long-standing administrative relations, the local Employment Agency and the local administration negotiate ‘what is good for a beneficiary’. The director of the local Employment Agency explains attempts to also activate those recipients deemed with having only a low likelihood of finding work:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>On the contrary, our task is to offer and develop measures with low exigencies for this group of clients in order to bring them closer to the labour market. These are measures that are not aimed at immediate integration, but at developing their employability. The problems our clients have and carry around with them are partly very manifold. Therefore, we have first of all the task to reduce such a bundle of problems somehow before we can talk about qualifying someone for the labour market. (G-A-7)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The services of the Jobcentre correspond to this strategy by offering debt counselling or health services alongside a high percentage of workfare community jobs. To integrate social services in the system, an organization plan was drawn up by the local civil servants. It connects funding granted to social welfare associations with compliance to guidelines, prescribes a reporting system and lays out detailed instructions to social workers and the project-executing organizations. As the Jobcentre is in charge of this system, only its case managers can enable access to debt counselling or other social services for minimum income recipients. For case management, the local authority transferred significant numbers of social workers from its social welfare offices to work at the Jobcentre.</p>
<p>Placement and counselling activities by staff and project-executing organizations are closely supervised. Active services are not only demanded by national benchmarking on the integration of recipients into employment, education and subsidized employment. The local administration and the local Employment Agency have also set up a comprehensive system of indicators and reports requiring project-executing organizations to give an account of their efforts towards activating assistance recipients.</p>
<p>To conclude, the organization of the minimum income scheme in region G-A comes close to a bureaucratic logic of active inclusion. Instead of giving authority to the market or adopting broader participatory procedures, an established local coalition of civil servants from the local administration and the local Employment Agency work out a system for integrating national placement services with local social services. Implementation of a confined set of ALMP and social services by the Jobcentre, case managers and project-executing organizations is closely monitored by detailed local standards and reporting.</p>

<title>Different local welfare interventions in Germany</title>
<p>The hypothesis of the transformation of the German minimum income scheme towards a market-oriented concept for active inclusion is contradicted by the local analysis. Through discretion in service delivery and control techniques, national regulation leaves the local level a crucial part to play in the policy process. In region G-D, a disintegrated civil and bureaucratic local milieu facilitates the lobbying of local agents of the Employment Agency for cost-efficiency strategies. Benchmarking, low-tariff workfare community jobs and short training promote a strategy to accelerate placement of unemployed people who are considered ‘employable’. In contrast, in region G-A, an established bureaucratic coalition between the local authority and the local Employment Agency negotiate the services for active inclusion in detail. As a result, local civil servants develop tight controls, reporting and detailed standards for integrated services to support a strategy of reducing the barriers to labour market inclusion faced by beneficiaries.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>As a result of the transformation towards individualized approaches to welfare provision, welfare state reforms are increasingly becoming a local issue. The local cases studied in Germany and France reveal variety in the strategies applied towards minimum income recipients that is neither explained by national regulation of active inclusion policies nor by European processes to diffuse ‘good’ governance. In contrast to national analyses indicating a general shift towards market-oriented inclusion of minimum income recipients in both France and Germany, very different paths can be taken in the local co-production of such strategies. In the two Bismarckian welfare states analysed, welfare interventions coexist for market-oriented concepts to quickly integrate unemployed clients into the labour market, bureaucratic approaches for enabling the social inclusion of beneficiaries, participatory concepts of active inclusion to empower persons to choose among different inclusion options and even unconditional minimum income benefits for social citizens. Thus, different local approaches not only appear within one and the same welfare state model but also within individual welfare states.</p>
<p>As European welfare states change from a concept based on uniform social citizenship towards individualized and targeted welfare interventions, we can no longer take for granted the local organization of policies and services. The social policy process is altered by this shifting away from the principles of the central organization of benefits towards more decentralized and situated active inclusion approaches. Individualized, integrated or participatory welfare interventions proceed as a local co-production between different policy levels, different actors and divergent policy fields. Such a local co-production of active inclusion strategies is influenced by the local conditions for policies, the local modes of interaction for welfare intervention and the local control of service delivery. In theory as in practice, we identified important differences in these local governance dimensions. These differences explain the observation that strategies vary between market-based, participatory and bureaucratic concepts of active inclusion and even universal social citizenship logics.</p>
<p>Discussing both a summary (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0958928711425270">Table 2</xref>) and the detailed accounts of the local case study series in France and Germany allows us to highlight criteria explaining local governance arrangements. Both the overview and the detailed presentations illustrate that concrete governance arrangements take place in vaster local worlds of welfare that are defined by their socio-economic, historical, cultural and political situation. The overview shows that the categories of local socio-economic situation and government partisanship are too shallow to explain local differences. Instead, the local accounts revealed proper ‘paths’ of local governance for each region. For a region, the local history of successful and failed ways of cooperation was important for understanding current practices. In region F-C, established structures of local partnership made this the most feasible option to be relied on for the local organization of active inclusion strategies. In contrast, as partnerships or local bureaucracy were associated with failure in region G-D, scope existed to apply a fresh governance approach towards greater market orientation. Thus, past local experiences are important for explaining differences in implementation between local authorities.</p>

<p>Furthermore, in the studied regions it was possible to identify different actors with distinct preferences. For the local co-production of active inclusion approaches, not only politicians, but also local administrations, employment agencies and third sector organizations, played crucial roles as ‘lobbyists’ for divergent strategies. The positioning of such ‘skilled’ actors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0958928711425270">Garud et al., 2007</xref>) to advance particular concepts may differ between the local worlds of welfare. For example, a disintegrated local community G-D enabled agents of the Federal Employment Agency to reform the local organization towards a market-oriented concept. Conversely, in region G-A this actor had to give in to a negotiated strategy based on consensus with an established local authority. Such preferences, power and exchange relations between actors in a region further explain the different local strategies implemented.</p>
<p>However, the resources that enable different approaches at the local level are not only a local matter. It is also important to examine the way in which the national or European level opens up scope for lower level variation. Reforms in France and Germany illustrate how the national level creates room for manoeuvring at the local level. However, the transfer of financial, political, regulatory and technical competences to the local level is structured differently. In France, the decentralization of political authority makes it possible for a local authority to implement the minimum income scheme as a guaranteed benefit or to initiate proper services for active inclusion. In Germany, the national framework and the national empowerment of the local Employment Agencies strongly promote the implementation of active inclusion reforms in the local authorities. Local scope for manoeuvring here is pre-structured for implementing one of the three strategies for active inclusion. Notwithstanding the importance of studying local welfare interventions, the way in which the national and European level frame and provide resources for local action influence the options at the local level. Explanations that account for the local organization of targeted and individualized welfare interventions should thus take into account both distinct ‘paths’ and actors’ preferences in local authorities as well as the national and European processes for creating local worlds of welfare.</p>
