<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an autoimmune disease of the central nervous system (CNS) and is characterised by inflammation and destruction of myelin and axons. MS typically results in a physical decline of patients, including locomotor and sensory impairments during the course of the disease.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1352458512463481">1</xref></sup> Presumably, while these devastating effects on physical status are well characterised, the impact of MS on cognitive function is less appreciated, mainly because of the difficult detection of cognitive impairment as long as language skills and intellectual functions of MS patients are preserved.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1352458512463481">2</xref></sup></p>
<p>Yet, cognitive impairment has been observed in up to 65% of MS patients.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1352458512463481">2</xref></sup> Symptoms vary in intensity, affecting most frequently working memory, episodic memory, processing speed and — to a lesser extent — executive function.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1352458512463481">3</xref></sup> Each of these domains can be affected in patients with relapsing–remitting MS (RRMS), while decline in memory and abstract/conceptual reasoning seem to occur more commonly in patients with progressive types of MS.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1352458512463481">4</xref></sup> In some MS patients, multiple domains are affected, which may lead to MS-associated dementia.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1352458512463481">5</xref></sup></p>
<p>There is presently only little information available on symptomatic therapies of cognitive deficits in MS patients. Studies have suggested a delayed onset of cognitive impairment by an early treatment of MS with interferon (IFN). Promising results on both attention and memory have been obtained for IFN-β-1b<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1352458512463481">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1352458512463481">7</xref></sup> and IFN-β-1a,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1352458512463481">8</xref></sup> respectively. These interventions presumably act only through their general anti-inflammatory effects.</p>
<p>In Alzheimer’s disease (AD), cognitive decline is commonly treated by acetylcholinesterase inhibitors (AChEIs) and butyrylcholinesterase inhibitors (BChEIs). There may be no direct evidence for the reduction of cholinergic neurons in MS, but decreased cholinergic activity has been demonstrated in the cerebrospinal fluid of MS patients.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1352458512463481">9</xref></sup> Moreover, lesions targeting cholinergic pathways correlate with impaired memory in MS.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1352458512463481">10</xref></sup> AChEIs and BChEIs have therefore been considered as a potential approach for the treatment of MS-associated cognitive impairment.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1352458512463481">11</xref></sup> Studies of MS patients have suggested positive effects of ChEI on executive functions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1352458512463481">12</xref></sup> and memory.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1352458512463481">13</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1352458512463481"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1352458512463481">15</xref></sup> However, these studies were rather small<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1352458512463481">12</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1352458512463481"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1352458512463481">14</xref></sup> and resulted in inconsistent outcomes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1352458512463481">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1352458512463481">16</xref></sup></p>
<p>Rivastigmine, a reversible, brain-selective AChEI and BChEI, is approved for AD and Parkinson’s disease (PD) dementia.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1352458512463481">17</xref></sup> In patients with mild to moderate AD, daily doses of 6 mg to 12 mg rivastigmine improved the rate of cognitive decline, the activities of daily living and the severity of dementia.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1352458512463481">18</xref></sup> Transdermal rivastigmine patch administration has been demonstrated to be both similarly as efficient as rivastigmine capsules and to have a superior tolerability profile.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1352458512463481">19</xref></sup></p>
<p>A study of 15 MS patients and 13 healthy controls suggested that rivastigmine may improve cognitive processing speed.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1352458512463481">20</xref></sup> Additionally, functional magnetic resonance imaging revealed both an enhancement of prefrontal function and a modulation of functional connectivity related to cognition in patients with MS,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1352458512463481">21</xref></sup> and effects of rivastigmine on patterns of brain activation and brain plasticity could also be shown.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1352458512463481">22</xref></sup> In contrast, a single-centre study of 60 MS patients with cognitive impairment did not reveal significant differences between rivastigmine and placebo on memory and cognition after 12 weeks of treatment.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1352458512463481">23</xref></sup></p>
<p>Therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate efficacy and safety of transdermal rivastigmine patch administration in MS patients with cognitive deficits. For this evaluation, 200 cognitively impaired, defined as Faces Symbol Test (FST) score (time/number of correct items) of <underline>≥</underline> 3.0 and/or Multiple Sclerosis Inventarium Cognition (MUSIC) score of <underline>≤</underline> 19 at screening, MS patients were scheduled to receive rivastigmine (9.5 mg/day) or placebo for 16 weeks in a multicentre, double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled, parallel groups study, followed by a one-year open-label treatment phase. However, as a result of slow recruitment, the study was terminated after approximately one year of enrolment and only 86 patients had been recruited. Primary endpoint was the change of total recall scores (sum of all words immediately recalled over all six trials) of the selective reminding test (SRT) from baseline to week 16. Secondary endpoints comprised additional cognitive domains, fatigue, depression and quality of life after 16 weeks of treatment as well as long-term efficacy and safety.</p>

<title>Subjects</title>
<p>The study started in January 2009, and participants were enrolled at 30 investigational sites in Germany. However, the study was terminated in January 2010 because of slow recruitment. Inclusion criteria included diagnosis of MS (subtypes RRMS, secondary–progressive MS (SPMS), or clinically isolated syndrome, but not stratified a priori) as defined by the 2005 revised McDonald criteria,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1352458512463481">24</xref></sup> age from 18 to 65 years and cognitive impairment as defined by an FST<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1352458512463481">25</xref></sup> score of ≥ 3.0 and/or a MUSIC<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1352458512463481">26</xref></sup> score of ≤ 19 at screening. Participants were eligible if they had received IFN-β-1b therapy for at least 60 days before baseline.</p>
<p>Patients were excluded if they used AD medication, started taking psychoactive medication, or used muscle relaxants or lithium at different time points before randomisation. During the study, centrally acting anticholinergics and medication for PD were not permitted. Other exclusion criteria included pregnancy or breastfeeding, diabetes mellitus, malignancy, any cognition-affecting medical condition, drug addiction, alcohol abuse and depression as indicated by a Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1352458512463481">27</xref></sup> score of ≥ 14 at screening. Furthermore, patients were excluded if they had been subjected to cognitive testing with Brief Repeatable Battery of Neuropsychological Tests (BRB-N)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1352458512463481">28</xref></sup> within the last year before randomisation or if they had attended any cognitive rehabilitation study or program in the three months prior to the screening visit.</p>
<p>This study was performed in accordance with the International Conference on Harmonisation Harmonised Tripartite Guidelines for Good Clinical Practice (ICH-GCP) and applicable local regulations and with the ethical principles laid down in the Declaration of Helsinki. The study is registered in the clinicaltrials.gov database (protocol ID: NCT00881205). All participants provided written informed consent.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-1352458512463481">
<title>Study design</title>
<p>This randomised, placebo-controlled multicentre trial used a double-blind, parallel groups design. Randomisation lists were generated by an external clinical research organisation (CRO) using a validated system that automates the random assignment of the treatment arms under the responsibility of the GCP officer. The investigator enrolled the subjects and assigned participants to treatment according to the randomisation list. Patients, investigator staff, persons performing the assessments and data analysts remained blinded throughout the entire study period. Study drugs were identical in packaging, labelling, schedule of administration, appearance and odour. After a screening period of six weeks, participants were randomised to either rivastigmine or placebo in a 1:1 ratio. Participants then entered a four-week titration period, followed by a 12-week maintenance period and an optional 12-month open-label treatment phase. During the titration period, participants received rivastigmine patches of 5 cm<sup>2</sup>; (4.6 mg/day) for four weeks. If this initial dose was well tolerated, patients then received rivastigmine patches of 10 cm<sup>2</sup>; (9.5 mg/day) during the double-blind maintenance period for 12 weeks, then continued on the same during the optional open-label treatment phase for up to 12 months. Patches were applied daily according to the package information leaflet. Participants of the placebo group received placebo patches of the same size, shape and colour. At the end of the double-blind treatment phase, all participants who had completed the double-blind treatment phase were able to enter an open-label treatment phase. After commencement of the trial, seven amendments to the study protocol were implemented, which included changes regarding eligibility criteria, sample size and duration of follow-up. During screening we found our inclusion criteria were not appropriately chosen regarding cognitive impairment testing and hence, we excluded the Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test (RAVLT) and Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) as separate tests and excluded patients who already had performed a cognitive testing with BRB-N within the last year before randomisation. Moreover, adjustments were made regarding the limits for patients age 55 to 65 years and initial MS diagnosis period before randomisation. These changes did not affect the blinding on the accumulating data on participants’ outcomes.</p>

<sec id="section10-1352458512463481">
<title>Outcome measures</title>
<p>The primary objective of this study was to show that after 16 weeks of treatment with rivastigmine patch, participants will show a greater improvement in memory performance, as assessed by total recall on the SRT, as compared to patients receiving placebo. Secondary objectives were to show improvement in activities of daily living, as assessed by a subscale of the Patient Reported Impact of MS scale (PRIMuS)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1352458512463481">29</xref></sup> and improvement in the score of the clinical global impression scale (CGI). The CGI assesses symptom severity, treatment response and efficacy of treatment.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1352458512463481">30</xref></sup> Further measurements included additional BRB-N subtests. Other outcome measures were changes in cognitive functioning, as assessed by subscales of the BRB, the BRB-N composite index score, the Modified Fatigue Impact Scale (mFIS),<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1352458512463481">31</xref></sup> MADRS,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1352458512463481">27</xref></sup> FST<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1352458512463481">25</xref></sup> and the Multiple Sclerosis Functional Composite (MSFC).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1352458512463481">32</xref></sup> All efficacy assessments were measured at baseline, at the end of the double-blind treatment phase (week 16) and during the open-label treatment phase (weeks 32 and 68). Safety was assessed at weeks four, 10 and 16 (double-blind treatment phase) and at weeks 20, 32, 50 and 68 (open-label treatment phase).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-1352458512463481">
<title>Statistics</title>
<p>Primary and secondary outcome measures of both treatments were compared in an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model with factors treatment and centre and covariate baseline SRT score. Results are presented as mean ± standard deviation (SD). The change scores for the primary and secondary outcomes equal the score at week 16 minus the score at baseline. For primary outcome measures, least square (LS) means and the 95% confidence interval (CI) for the treatment contrast are additionally provided. <italic>P</italic> values less than 0.05 were considered significant. Analyses were performed with SAS, version 9.2.</p>
<p>Results are presented for the modified intention-to-treat (ITT) population. The modified ITT population consisted of all patients randomised who received at least one dose of study drug and had at least one baseline and post-baseline efficacy assessment. Safety was assessed in patients who received at least one dose of study drug and had at least one post-baseline safety assessment.</p>
<p>The sample size was estimated based on a study by Krupp et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1352458512463481">16</xref></sup> As our study had a shorter treatment phase (16 weeks), we expected our improvement in the rivastigmine arm to be approximately 22% lower than that observed by Krupp in the AChEI arm. Assuming a similar improvement in the placebo arm but a mean change of 4.59 with an SD of 8.7 in the active treatment group, a sample size of 90 in each group would have had 80% power to detect a difference in means of 3.02, using a two-group Satterthwaite <italic>t</italic> test with a 0.05 two-sided significance level. Assuming a 10% dropout,100 patients needed to be randomised to each treatment arm.</p>
<p>However, because of slow recruitment the study was prematurely terminated after the recruitment of 86 patients. With this recruitment the actual power of the study is 49%.</p>

<title>Study population and baseline characteristics</title>
<p>A total of 86 out of 125 MS patients screened were enrolled and randomised to either rivastigmine (<italic>n</italic> = 45) or placebo (<italic>n</italic> = 41). Of the 86 patients enrolled, 72 had RRMS, 13 SPMS and one had been diagnosed with clinically isolated syndrome. Of the 86 patients, 60 patients satisfied the criteria of cognitive impairment based on the results of the MUSIC and the FST test combined, 11 satisfied the criteria based only on the results of the MUSIC test, and 15 based only on the results of the FST test. A total of 18 out of 86 patients enrolled (20.9%) prematurely discontinued the study, 11 (24.4%) in the rivastigmine group and seven (17.1%) in the placebo group. The major reasons for discontinuation were adverse events (AE). A total of 34 patients in each group completed the double-blind study phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1352458512463481">Figure 1</xref>). Then, 28 rivastigmine patients and 27 placebo patients entered an optional 12-month open-label phase, in which all patients received rivastigmine. This phase was completed by 26.7% and 26.8% of patients who had initially been randomised to rivastigmine and placebo, respectively.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The rationale for ChEIs to treat memory impairment of MS patients was based initially on both the decreased cholinergic activity found in the cerebrospinal fluid of MS patients<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1352458512463481">9</xref></sup> and the correlation of lesions targeting cholinergic pathways with impaired memory in MS.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1352458512463481">10</xref></sup> Furthermore, rivastigmine significantly improves short-latency afferent inhibition, an in vivo index of central cholinergic function, in MS patients.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1352458512463481">33</xref></sup></p>
<p>The concept of using ChEIs to treat cognitive decline in MS patients was supported in the early 1990s by the findings of Leo and Rao<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1352458512463481">13</xref></sup> and Unverzagt et al.,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1352458512463481">14</xref></sup> who suggested an improvement in verbal memory by physostigmine. Donezepil received considerable attention in efforts to improve cognition in MS patients but initially promising results of a small single-centre randomised clinical trial<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1352458512463481">15</xref></sup> could not be confirmed in a larger multicentre trial.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1352458512463481">16</xref></sup> Similarly, recent studies have suggested an improvement of cognitive processing speed by rivastigmine.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1352458512463481">20</xref></sup> In our study, we evaluated efficacy and safety of rivastigmine in comparison to placebo in MS patients with cognitive deficits. We found a tendency for improvement of total recall by rivastigmine. This effect was, however, not significant because of lack of statistical power. Other outcome measures provided no evidence supporting benefits of rivastigmine over placebo. Throughout the study, treatment with rivastigmine was safe and well tolerated.</p>
<p>In conclusion, results on ChEIs as a therapeutic option for cognitively impaired MS patients are inconsistent and remain unsatisfactory.</p>
<p>There are three reasons that might explain the failure of this study and also possibly give a hint for the difficulties one faces when performing studies on ChEIs in MS. First, despite both the impact of cholinergic pathways on cognition and the initially positive results of some clinical studies in this field, the possibility cannot be excluded that mechanisms related to cognitive deficits of MS patients might per se preclude efficacy of ChEIs or rivastigmine in particular. Second, even if ChEIs might be effective in cognitively impaired MS patients, studies analysing their effects still suffer from methodological problems such as small sample sizes, selection of less sensitive cognition parameters or not appropriately chosen outcome measures. For example, our study aimed to include at least 100 patients per treatment group to be able to show a potential positive effect of rivastigmine. However, because of slow recruitment our study was prematurely terminated after enrolment of 86 patients and consequently (potential) differences in efficacy of rivastigmine vs placebo were unable to be detected. Third, based on the pathogenesis of MS, it is highly likely that MS detrimentally affects various aspects of cognitive functioning. Short-term, working and episodic memory are the most impaired functions in MS patients, along with initial learning difficulties resulting in memory problems.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1352458512463481">2</xref></sup> Cognitive deficits like short-term, working and episodic memory are most common in MS patients and typically seen with concurrent deficits in information processing speed and memory problems in general.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1352458512463481">34</xref></sup> While being mutually affected by each other, fatigue and depression may also influence cognitive performance. Therefore, these relations might hamper the analysis of medications that might act on rather isolated cognitive domains. Moreover, one could speculate whether these putative effects of rivastigmine could be assessed by a single primary endpoint like in our study the total recall score of the SRT or whether it is more suitable to apply and compare multiple outcome measures.</p>
<p>Including this study, no ChEI has shown reproducible benefits in cognitively impaired MS patients. Greater efforts are required to establish a pharmacological therapy to treat cognitive deficits in MS patients.</p>
<p>In summary, we were unable to show a significant improvement of memory functions by rivastigmine in cognitively impaired MS patients. Treatment had a favourable safety profile and was well tolerated. Further sufficiently large studies are needed to assess conclusively the efficacy of rivastigmine and to establish effective strategies for the treatment of cognitive impairment in MS patients by implementing the lessons learned from this study.</p>
