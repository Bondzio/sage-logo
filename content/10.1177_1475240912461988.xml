<abstract>
<p>The ontology of the field of international education is described and analysed in terms of singular, regional and generic modes of pedagogized knowledge. In contrast to singular and regional modes of knowledge which synthesize introjection (orientation onto themselves) and projection (orientation towards external contingencies), generic modes concentrate solely on projection onto the demands of the market. Generic knowledge is characterized as a reductive discourse that couples education to the acquisition of skills and competences. International education may be characterized as a region in which singulars (academic disciplines) are brought together in an integrating framework. ‘Internationally minded values’ are identified as constituting an overarching master view that weakens classification between the contents of the field of international education. It is proposed that the <italic>International Baccalaureate Learner Profile</italic>, as a specification for international education, constitutes pedagogized knowledge in the generic mode. Possible directions for future research in international education are discussed in the context of these contrasting modes of knowledge.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>This article will address the ‘what’ (ontology) of research into international education. Underpinning this article will be Basil Bernstein’s theories that describe and analyse the sociology of knowledge. In particular, his work on singulars, regions and generics of knowledge (Bernstein, 2000; Beck, 2002; Beck and Young, 2005; Young, 2008) will be used to inquire into the ontology of international education.</p>
<p>It remains controversial whether ‘international education’ constitutes an academic subject in its own right, or whether it is a hybrid field comprising international extensions to a variety of other cognate areas of inquiry. The term ‘international education’ can be used in a variety of contexts. For example, the expression is found in the string ‘comparative and international education’ (CIE) where it denotes an approach to the comparative academic study of education and education systems in ‘other’ countries (Bray et al., 2007; Phillips and Schweisfurth, 2006; Piper et al., 2006). International education can be used to refer to the educational experiences of students of one country studying in another country, sometimes in the context of a student exchange programme such as the European Union ERASMUS programme (Messer and Wolter, 2007). This usually involves students at higher education institutions. However, younger students may also travel to pursue their studies in schools away from their home country (Waters, 2006). The term is also used to denote the export of educational services across borders. A related field of international education is located in the context of international development aid in which educational technologies are transferred between countries. The precise relationship between these two meanings of international education may be contested (Crossley and Watson, 2003; Lowe, 1998; Wilson, 1994) but they are sufficiently close to be considered as ‘twin fields’. Two more senses of the expression are in currency, and may be closer to the interests of many readers of the present journal. One sense of the term addresses the practice of education in ‘international schools’ (Bates, 2011; Blandford and Shaw, 2001) and the other is more closely associated with the discourses of education that pertain to education for ‘international mindedness’ (Hayden, 2006; Parker, 2011; Thompson, 1998). Again, the relationship between international schools and international education is by no means clear-cut. An international school may offer an education that has no claims to be international, while an international education may be experienced by a student who has not attended a school that claims to be international (Hayden and Thompson, 1995). Furthermore, it should be borne in mind that the founding Director General of the International Baccalaureate (IB), Alec Peterson, described the IB as ‘applied comparative education’ (Peterson, 1977). Hence, at least at the time when Peterson was writing, the strength of classification (that is, boundary strength) between ‘international education as education for international mindedness’ and ‘international education as a component of comparative and international education’ was still apparently weak.</p>
<p>The motivations for carrying out research in international education (however that field may be constituted) are various. Some work is performed by professional researchers, whose activities may be supported by funding agencies which may include government departments, non-governmental organizations, and curriculum and assessment organizations. Numerous examples of published research in the field are the outcomes of professional development activities in which practising teachers are engaged. These examples of research may constitute project work towards the award of a higher degree in education at masters or doctoral level. It may be argued that they can be problematic because they are written principally with the instrumental aim of fulfilling the requirements for gaining an advanced qualification, as opposed to the production of reliable propositional knowledge (which may, of course, also be expected as a desirable outcome of such activity). There are institutional players, such as curriculum and assessment organizations, that have a vested interest in the practice and outcomes of research. Finally, the contribution of those who are not formally aligned with a university department, a curriculum and assessment organization or a funding body, but who may be school-based, cannot be ignored. It may be argued that it is only they who are dispassionate, disinterested observers in the field because they do not have so great a stake in the outcomes of research.</p>
<p>This article will continue with consideration of how the term ‘international education’ is to be defined for the purposes of this article.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-1475240912461988">
<title>What is ‘international education’?</title>
<p>A fundamental ontological question for researchers inquiring into international education concerns the unit of analysis. What is being studied when research in international education is conducted? What is international education, in the sense propagated and broadcast by the present journal? How might international schools be characterized? The terms ‘international education’ and ‘international school’ are commonly used in the literature, and it appears to be tacitly assumed that they are coupled together. Conversely, there also seems to be little agreement as to what each category constitutes and what their relations are exactly. Contrasting philosophies of international education are discussed that may have a pragmatic, utilitarian or ‘ideological’ focus (Hayden and Thompson, 1995). Matthews (1988) proposes a dichotomous taxonomy of international schools that distinguishes between ‘ideology-driven’ and ‘market-driven’ institutions. Schools in the former category are motivated by an explicitly internationalist philosophy or mission, whereas those in the latter are motivated by the exigencies of the market. However, it cannot be stated that international schools are where international education (however that is defined) takes place uniquely. As was indicated above, an international school may offer an education that has no claims to be international, while an international education may be experienced by a student who has not attended a school that claims to be international (Hayden and Thompson, 1995). Consequently, it may be concluded that no single entity can be typified as ‘an international school’ because a single universal definition of what constitutes international schools and other schools cannot be defended, nor can a single unitary definition of international education be proposed. The programmes of the IB are frequently used as a metonym for international education, as the brand name ‘Hoover’ stands in metonymically for ‘all’ vacuum cleaners of whatever marque, but it must be acknowledged that, as with household cleaning devices, other programmes of study are also implemented in a transnational or international context at primary and secondary school level.</p>
<p>Another approach to the description and analysis of international education, as practised in international schools and elsewhere, is to contrast ‘globalist’ and ‘internationalist’ discourses (Cambridge, 2002; Cambridge and Thompson, 2004). The globalist approach to international education is influenced by and contributes to the global diffusion of the values of free market economics. These values are expressed in international education in terms of an ideology of meritocratic competition combined with positional competition with national systems of education. This is accompanied by quality assurance through international accreditation and the spread of global quality standards that facilitate portability between schools and transferability between systems, and educational continuity for the children of the globally mobile clientele: described as the educational equivalent of ‘a Big Mac and a Coke’ (Cambridge, 2002). This perspective creates a conceptual space in which it is possible to make links between international education, international schools and discourses of performativity (Ball, 2003) and the so-called ‘McDonaldization’ of society, embracing efficiency, predictability, calculability and the use of information technology (Ritzer, 1993). Globalized international education serves a market that requires the global certification of educational qualifications. It facilitates educational continuity for the children of the host country clientele with aspirations towards social and global mobility. An outcome of globalist international education is global cultural convergence towards the values of the ‘transnational capitalist class’ (Brown and Lauder, 2011; Sklair, 2001). At IB regional conferences and elsewhere in recent years, the IB director general has presented the participation of learners in IB programmes as a preparation for entry as a worker into the global knowledge economy. Beard (2006: 2) identifies a role for the IB in the production of ‘knowledge workers’ and ‘knowledge technologists’. Resnik (2008, 2009) characterizes the <italic>IB Learner Profile</italic> (IB, 2006) as a template for the production of the ideal worker in the global knowledge economy. Resnik (2008: 147) draws attention to attributes such as ‘reflection, multiculturalism, self-learning and flexibility’ which she identifies as ‘crucial skills needed for the ideal global worker to attain the highest status jobs’. However, she also argues that ‘because of the highly selective nature of international schools and their close match to market demands, international education might contribute to the reproduction of social inequality. As such, IB schools established in the past in order to encourage peace and understanding among peoples become today a source of growing inequality in society’ (Resnik, 2008: 148).</p>
<p>Internationalism in politics has been described in terms of ‘the antithesis of both nationalism and isolationism … a cosmopolitan, non-parochial stance toward obligation beyond borders’ (Lynch, 1999: 83). The internationalist approach to the practice of international education is based on theories of international relations, with aspirations for the promotion of understanding between nations in ‘a transformative discourse which locates all fields of enquiry in a supra-national frame of reference and upholds the cause of peace’ (Rawlings, 2000: 365). Internationalist international education offers a progressive (learner-centred) existential and experiential educational philosophy that values the moral development of the individual and recognizes the importance of service to the community and the development of a sense of responsible citizenship. It celebrates cultural diversity and promotes an internationally minded outlook (Cambridge and Thompson, 2004). In the context of the history of the IB, and in common with Resnik (2008) discussed above, Tarc (2009a, 2009b) identifies contradictions between the aspirations and implementation of its programmes, in terms of the wider normative aims in its dreams (internationalism, making a modern and more peaceful world) as opposed to how it actually operates in the world (increasing inequality through utilization in local positional competition).</p>
<p>Bernstein’s (2000) theory of pedagogic identities has been applied independently to the characterization of the IB Diploma Programme by at least two researchers. Bernstein (2000) proposes that contrasting educational discourses inscribed in the school curriculum are projected onto contrasting retrospective, prospective, decentred (market) and decentred (therapeutic) pedagogic identities. Cambridge (2010) argues that in different times and geographical locations the IB Diploma Programme has been projected onto a variety of pedagogic identities. In its earliest years there appears to have been vacillation between a weak form of conservative retrospective identity, expressed as nostalgia for a grouped curriculum such as that which prevailed before the UK Education Act 1944, which led to the introduction of GCE A-level in England, and a neo-conservative prospective educational discourse projecting selected elements of the past into the future. A ‘progressive’ decentred therapeutic identity, exemplified by the <italic>IB Learner Profile</italic> (IB, 2006), is the version the IB currently appears to project. However, the IB is assailed by market forces and the IB Diploma Programme is being driven towards a neo-liberal decentred (market) identity. This analysis may be triangulated with a study by Doherty (2010: 6) who concludes that, in the context of its implementation in Australia, the IB Diploma Programme can be characterized as fulfilling a market orientation at the level of school strategy, but its internal principles of curricular selection and assessment characterize it as a prospective orientation because it presents a curriculum ‘re-centring around fairly conservative principles’. However, Doherty (2010: 5) argues that the market identity is ‘an empty signifier, contingent on external conditions, through which the other identities can speak, according to their “market value” or desirability in the economic, political and cultural fashions of the times’. Doherty (2010: 6) describes this situation as an ‘ironic marriage of neo-conservatism (re-asserting centralized power) and neo-liberalism (divesting power from the centre to the market)’ in which the IB Diploma ‘thrives in this ideological space of being both a market/choice strategy and a fashionably conservative solution at the same time’.</p>
<p>Following from this argument, it may be concluded that the search for a single definitive account of international education, as practised in international schools and elsewhere, is likely to be fruitless. This is because international education is best interpreted as an ‘empty signifier’ that constitutes a hollow semiotic space that can be filled in a variety of ways, according to context. From this perspective, international education may be subject to multiple interpretations, as enumerated by Cambridge and Thompson (2001: 6):</p>

<p>How international education is characterized – its ontology – will have an impact on how reliable propositional knowledge about it – epistemology – might be constructed. In other words, how international education is defined will determine how it is studied. The section following will discuss the production of knowledge about international education, which will be problematized from the perspective of Basil Bernstein’s sociology of the production, distribution and evaluation (assessment) of knowledge.</p>

<sec id="section3-1475240912461988">
<title>Singulars, regions, generics</title>
<p>What is being studied when international educational research is being conducted? It appears that at least two contrasting tendencies to characterization of the field can be identified. One approach treats international education as a novel and discrete academic subject cognate with other subjects of educational inquiry. Another approach is to argue that there is no discrete academic subject identifiable as ‘international education’. Instead, it is proposed that an ‘international’ dimension can be applied to a variety of fields of educational studies, so that ‘international curriculum’ or ‘international management’ constitute international extensions to existing fields. Hence, the question may be asked: Can international education be said to constitute a focus for study in its own right, or is it an ‘add-on’ to other disciplinary fields? One way of responding to this question is to explain this apparent dichotomy in terms of Basil Bernstein’s sociology of knowledge. Bernstein (2000) draws a distinction between three contrasting modes of ‘pedagogized knowledge’, or knowledge that has been transformed or recontextualized into a form suitable for transmission, reproduction and assessment in education. The modes comprise <italic>singulars, regions</italic> and <italic>generics.</italic> Beck (2002: 619) recognizes continuity between these modes and earlier versions of Bernstein’s theorization of pedagogic discourse by stating that ‘the language of collection and integrated codes has been replaced by the terminology of singulars and regions’.</p>
<p>Singulars are ‘knowledge structures whose creators have appropriated a space to give themselves a unique name, a specialized discrete discourse with its own intellectual field of texts, practices, rules of entry, examinations, licenses to practice, distribution of rewards and punishments’ (Bernstein, 2000: 52). They constitute the recognizable subjects of the academic curriculum such as physics, mathematics, history and economics. Singulars appear as discrete subjects because they are demarcated by strong boundaries, characterized as strong ‘classification’ in Bernstein’s (2000) terms. However, singulars can also be ‘narcissistic, orientated to their own development, protected by strong boundaries and hierarchies’ (Bernstein, 2000: 52). That is to say, the maintenance of boundary strength can make singulars appear to be exclusive, self-perpetuating and self-serving institutions. To treat international education as a discrete academic subject is to approach it as if it were a singular. The adoption of this point of view is to argue that ‘international education’ is a distinct field that is separate from other fields of educational inquiry, that it has particular ontological and epistemological perspectives, and that it constitutes a unique way of describing and analysing propositional knowledge about education. It could be argued that such perspectives form the rationale for the continuing existence of a journal, such as the <italic>Journal of Research in International Education</italic>, that is uniquely positioned to address the specific needs of a particular community of interest.</p>
<p>According to Bernstein (2000), a second mode of pedagogized knowledge is the <italic>region</italic>. Regions are ‘knowledge structures in which a number of singulars are brought together within an integrating framework’ (Young, 2008: 154). ‘While singulars “face inwards”, regions face outwards to various fields of practice in the everyday world’ (Beck and Young, 2005: 187). That is to say, regionalization of knowledge is interpreted as a response to market conditions that dictate its transformation into a commodity in the knowledge economy.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>The terms on which singulars contribute to regions are increasingly shaped by external forces; singulars themselves are increasingly fragmented; insulations between higher education and business become weaker; ‘good’ managers of higher education institutions become those with the skills to successfully market their educational ‘product’, attract ‘customers’, respond to the needs of employers. (Beck and Young, 2005: 189).</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Middleton (2006) proposes that, from its earliest days as a university subject, education exemplified a region of knowledge. McCulloch (2002: 100), who draws on the inaugural lecture of Professor Richard Peters in 1963, notes that ‘education is not an autonomous discipline, but a field, like politics, where the disciplines of history, philosophy, psychology, and sociology have application’. From this perspective, it may be argued that international education is a region in which singulars are brought together in an integrating framework. Applying the arguments of Walford (2002) concerning classification and framing in examples of evangelical Christian home education, Cambridge (2011: 134) proposes that the ‘international’ of international education can be interpreted as constituting a ‘master viewpoint’ that provides ‘an overarching construction in the curriculum that weakens the classification (that is, boundary strength) between the academic subjects’. This overarching master viewpoint has been compared to the ‘interstitial’ components that bind disparate elements of the integrated ‘international’ curriculum together and give them coherence (Thompson, 1998).</p>
<p>From where does this discourse about singulars and regions arise? Bernstein (2000) draws on the sociology of Émile Durkheim (1858–1917) and his analysis of medieval education at the University of Paris – the <italic>Trivium</italic> (grammar, logic, rhetoric) and the <italic>Quadrivium</italic> (arithmetic, astronomy, geometry, music) – to distinguish between ‘sacred’ and ‘profane’ forms of knowledge, which constitute knowledge of ‘the word’ and ‘the world’, respectively. However, Bernstein’s perspective constitutes a revision of Durkheim:<disp-quote>
<p>Bernstein’s appropriation of Durkheim’s dyad was less ‘pure’ because Durkheim insisted that the sacred-profane separation divided ‘the whole known universe’ … whereas for Bernstein – at least in certain ways – the profane could co-exist with the sacred within the same individuals and the same modalities of identity. Those whose ‘inner’ identities were centred in dedication to the intrinsic value and purity of their scholarly pursuits were also actors implicated (to different degrees) in the ‘profane’ world of what we would now call educational macro and micro politics. (Beck, 2002: 619)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In other words, whereas Durkheim considered sacred and profane knowledge to belong in mutually exclusive categories, Bernstein’s revision of Durkheim saw them interpenetrated in a dialectical relationship. This is exemplified by the metaphor utilized by Bernstein (2000) that these categories constitute the two faces of the same coin, that is to say ‘authentic inner dedication [can] co-exist … with a finely honed capacity to protect self-interest where necessary’ (Beck, 2002: 619).The advantage of such a view is that ‘this dual conception of singulars is crucial to avoiding the two opposing tendencies in debates about professions – a sense of self-justification and a cynicism which sees them as no more than an ideology of privilege’ (Young, 2008: 157).</p>
<p>Sacred and profane categorizations appear to describe archaic medieval forms of knowledge but it should be emphasized that this typology continues to have currency and relevance today. This is because the dichotomy (representing form) can persist even if the contents of the knowledge categories change. Hence, sacred knowledge in the present day may be identified with ‘high culture’ (fine art, classical music, literature) and the propagation of ‘official’ school knowledge – that is, the knowledge that schools aspire (and are required) to reproduce. The valorization of official knowledge is reinforced by its identification as the legitimate content of formal educational assessment. Official knowledge constitutes the knowledge that is examined at school. On the other hand, profane knowledge may be identified with ‘popular culture’ (street art, pop music, television and cinema, consumer goods and services associated with digital media) and the propagation of ‘unofficial’ knowledge which is relayed informally at school, but not in the classroom. School reproduces unofficial culture, albeit unintentionally, because unofficial knowledge is the cultural currency of the school playground. Unofficial knowledge might be explicitly discouraged by official pedagogic discourse through being excluded from the discourse of educational assessment, but it still flourishes as an oppositional <italic>samizdat</italic> culture at school. Occasional attempts to legitimate unofficial knowledge or to co-opt it into the official curriculum are invariably accompanied by moral panics about schooling and accusations of ‘dumbing down’ the curriculum. The critical issue for the production of international curriculum for use in the context of international education lies in <italic>what</italic> knowledge is recognized as official knowledge, and by <italic>whom</italic> and <italic>by what criteria</italic> the selection of such knowledge is made (Scott, 2008).</p>
<p>The regionalization of international education orients a body of knowledge towards professional practice in international schools and the continuing professional development of international school teachers and managers. However, at the same time, a discourse that purports to treat ‘international education’ as a discrete entity, and which might be termed a ‘quasi-singular’, has arisen. This perspective is exemplified in the purity or idealism of the ‘internationalist’ discourse of international education – as an educational practice to make ‘a better world’. It is proposed that contrasting sacred/profane discourses inscribe the ideology driven/market driven dichotomy outlined by Matthews (1988). However, the view of international education as a singular or quasi-singular can be criticized as the reification of international education ‘in terms of turf creation’ (Carroll, 2003: 4). What are the affiliations of the protagonists of the singular or quasi-singular discourse? Might the site of this discursive struggle be identified in the attempts by academics interested in ‘international education’ to draw a sharp distinction between their field and the adjacent field of ‘comparative and international education’? This argument is untested. However, the production of an archaeology of knowledge of this discursive struggle, which unpicks critically the changing usage of the term ‘international education’ over time, is long overdue.</p>
<p>Having discussed singulars and regions, a third mode of pedagogized knowledge will now be addressed. <italic>Generics</italic> constitute pedagogized knowledge linked to the acquisition of skills and competences. Whereas a balance is maintained in regionalized knowledge between introjection, or the inward-facing professional discourse of an academic subject, and projection, or the outward facing discourse towards the market, generic knowledge is uncoupled from introjection and is projected solely towards current demands of the market. Generic knowledge is pragmatic knowledge of ‘what works’ that is shorn of theory. Hence, it may be characterized as a reductive discourse that couples training, as opposed to education, to the acquisition of skills and competences:<disp-quote>
<p>The generic mode … and its associated concept of trainability [is] essentially empty – it has no inwardness, only an ability to respond to every new pedagogic initiative. Followed to its logical conclusion, genericism implies the end of professions as we know them. (Young, 2008: 157)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The <italic>IB Learner Profile</italic> (IB, 2006) constitutes ‘a public statement of desired student outcomes arising from common values and vision about the nature and purpose of education’ expressed in cognitive, conative, affective and social dimensions (Bullock, n.d.: 2). A proposition that might be discussed critically and evaluated in the international education research community is that the <italic>IB Learner Profile</italic> might best be interpreted as pedagogized knowledge in the generic mode. As such, it may be criticized for being divorced from context and over-extended in application to contexts beyond that for which it was developed. The <italic>IB Learner Profile</italic> was first introduced as a prescription for characterizing the primary learner and there has subsequently been a ‘retcon’ onto the IB Diploma. That is to say, the IB Diploma was extant before the introduction of the <italic>IB Learner Profile</italic> but there has been an attempt by the IB to establish retroactive continuity between the more recent document and the earlier programme. The <italic>IB Learner Profile</italic> is now being applied not only as a template for an ‘employee profile’ within the IB organization itself (IB, 2012b) but also potentially beyond IB employees as a ‘teacher profile’ in schools offering IB programmes of study. This latter point will be the focus of a future article.</p>
<p>Generics are typically characterized as ‘key skills’, ‘thinking skills’, ‘problem solving’ and ‘teamwork’. They are concerned with ‘trainability’ rather than with education:<disp-quote>
<p>The concept of trainability clearly has similarity with the more widely used term ‘learning to learn’. Both declare the inevitable obsolescence of accumulated knowledge and prioritise the value of developing the skills and flexibility to acquire and put to use whatever is needed next. (Beck and Young, 2005: 191)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>From this reading, it might be expected that the tendency of the IB towards the extension of generic knowledge in the form of the <italic>IB Learner Profile</italic> to professional development of teachers would be viewed with alarm in higher education institutions. The International Baccalaureate has attempted to shape the landscape of continuing professional development of teachers by implementation of the <italic>IB Teacher Award</italic> which has now been superseded by the IB Educator Certificates (IB, 2012a). Furthermore, it has also attempted to influence the conduct of international educational research by means of the <italic>Jeff Thompson Research Award</italic> (IB, 2012c). Interventions such as these can be double edged. They can be instrumental in encouraging professional development and research in the field, but they may also have a less benign effect. To the disinterested external observer, this may be interpreted as a potential site of conflict between higher education institutions and the IB as they each attempt to protect their respective vested interests and impose their own standards on the production of advanced professional qualifications. A change in direction towards generic knowledge is likely to exert a profound effect on the development of research policy in international education. For example, it may be argued that the IB Educator Certificates (IB, 2012a), which supersede the IB Teacher Award, close down the scope and range of subjects that may be studied by teachers:</p>
<list id="list2-1475240912461988" list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>The IB certificate in teaching and learning offers students the opportunity to examine the principles and practices associated with one of three IB programmes (Primary Years, Middle Years and Diploma Programmes). The courses that lead to this certificate shape pre-service, new and experienced educators into reflective practitioners and teacher researchers.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The IB advanced certificate in teaching and learning research offers students the opportunity to supplement their existing IB experience with rigorous, systematic investigative work to further their knowledge and experience. Participants delve deeper into curriculum development, pedagogy and assessment through exploring relevant literature and their own IB practices. (IB, 2012a).</p></list-item></list>
<p>The course outlines listed here suggest that there may be a focus on certain forms of educational knowledge, such as pedagogy and curriculum and their production, at the expense of others. The apparently uncritical championing of hypotheses such as ‘multiple intelligences’ and neuroplastic ‘brain-based learning’ (Andain and Murphy, 2008) are examples of tendentious forms of educational knowledge currently valorized by the IB. Evaluation of such a proposition would require further research. From the evidence of the research pages on the IB website, there appears to be an institutional interest in the production of reliable knowledge about the development, quality assurance, and assessment of impact of IB programmes and services (IB, 2012d). However, personal experience of attendance at presentations given by IB personnel at international education conferences such as those held by the European Council of International Schools (ECIS) suggests that the definition of what is worth knowing about international education is limited to studies of which universities recognize the IB Diploma. As Beck and Young (2005: 193) propose, generic modes of knowledge involve a process of silencing. In the context of teacher education this is the outcome of ‘the excision … of all but the most instrumentally relevant educational theory’. Beck and Young (2005: 195) illustrate ‘the dangers of situations in which independent professional judgement becomes co-opted, intimidated or silenced’. It is evident that the production of valid and reliable knowledge by research could be compromised by the vested interests of the powerful players in the field. Consequently, the continuing presence of active, disinterested researchers in the field, who are independent of the vested interests of curriculum and assessment organizations on the one hand, and higher education organizations, acting as the suppliers of training services, on the other, is vital.</p>

<title>Possible directions for international education research</title>
<p>Based on consideration of the foregoing arguments, how might possible future directions of international education research be conceptualized? A variety of issues appear to be pertinent, of which three will be discussed here. These include the problematization of the production of global citizenship in the context of the (re)production of national citizenship; the sociology of the production, recontextualization, distribution, reproduction and assessment of knowledge in international education; and the management of boundaries in the classification and framing of international education.</p>
<sec id="section5-1475240912461988">
<title>Citizenship</title>
<p>It is axiomatic that a central function of education in national systems is the (re)production of docile (that is, educable), governable citizens. In many national educational systems, the study of history in school is intended to foster a sense of national identity. It was powerfully argued by Leach (1969) that an international education curriculum could not include history taught from a partisan, nationalist perspective. In a recent comparative review of the IB Diploma Programme and the College Board Advanced Placement (AP) conducted for the Thomas P. Fordham Institute, a US-based conservative education policy think-tank, the strengths of IB World History Standard Level (one of the two levels, with Higher Level, at which IB Diploma subjects may be offered) were identified in terms of ‘demanding, well-constructed, content-rich exams; strong content within narrowly defined course parameters’ (Byrd et al., 2007: 14). Conversely, it was also reported that ‘US students in IB programs could miss exposure to almost all core US history content; even as a world history course, its 20th century focus is too narrow; lacks emphasis on important chronological knowledge’ (Byrd et al., 2007: 14). While the report noted that an Americas option, covering the US, Latin American and Canadian history was available, it was observed that ‘this option contains some good information, but because it includes much more than US history, the course inevitably slights important topics, events, and people that all US high school students should know’ (Byrd et al., 2007: 15). The point about the Fordham Institute report is that it identifies the crucial role of American history in US high school education for the (re)production of American citizens. Any programme of study that does not fulfil this specific role cannot be valid for the production of citizens in this context. Hence, there are points of contradiction between the discourses of international education programmes that aspire to promote critical historiographical accounts of history, rather than narratives that promote national identity. The former may be considered to be ‘un-American’. As Bunnell (2009, 2011, 2012) argues, this is a source of some tension in the expansion of the IB in North America in particular.</p>
<p>It may be argued that, <italic>pace</italic> those protagonists for widening international understanding, a function of international education as practised in international schools is, for a great proportion of its consumers, the (re)production of national identity in an expatriate context. Lave (2003) offers a fascinating account of the discursive struggles associated with the production of a particularly constituted expatriate British identity in a British community school in Portugal as it transformed into an international school. In this case study, members of a long-term expatriate British community who saw the function of the school as a preparatory school for entry into the English independent school sector were challenged by an incoming class of peripatetic managers who sought what might have been termed a ‘global international education’ for their children. The problems of national cultural (re)production in a cosmopolitan setting are frequently instantiated in terms of metaphors such as the ‘global nomad’ and the ‘third culture kid’. Such discourse frequently concentrates on issues of identity that are devoid of any reference to the economic, social or political context. Lave (2003: 499) draws attention to ‘an unusual facility on the part of the British to continue reproducing their position as arbiters of class culture in the transnational ambience’. Reference is made to ‘palpable fears of pollution’ experienced by long-term expatriates ‘through contaminating contact with Portuguese people of all kinds and a variety of differently but robustly British others’ (Lave, 2003: 506). As Pennycook (1998: 219) argues, the ‘expatriate’ concept is a discourse loaded with assumptions of ‘otherness’, distinctiveness and inherent superiority:<disp-quote>
<p>The term ‘expatriate’ itself is an interesting one, on the one hand distinguishing a certain group of people clearly from ‘immigrants’ and other darker skinned arrivals, and on the other locating their identity not as ‘foreigners’ or ‘outsiders’ in a host community … but rather as people whose identity is defined in a decontextualized English/American, etc. person overseas. Being an ‘expatriate’ locates one not as an outsider in a particular community but as a permanent insider who happens for the moment to be elsewhere’.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Education for global citizenship may be considered as a countervailing discourse in contrast to forms of education for the formation of national identity. However, this field is fragmented in terms of the varied meanings that are in use. Pike (2000) identifies contrasting pluralist and assimilationist discourses of global citizenship education in British and US contexts, respectively. This view draws attention to a dilemma of international education. To what extent is the international mindedness promoted by international education a monoculture of values ‘mitigated by tolerance of exotic detail’ (Zaw, 1996)?</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1475240912461988">
<title>Knowledge</title>
<p>This would appear to be a particularly fertile area for critical scholarship because the application of singular, regional and generic modes of knowledge to international education is likely to be productive. For example, what is the relationship between discourses of international education and preparation for entry into the global knowledge economy? Can the implementation of the <italic>IB Learner Profile</italic> be interpreted in terms of generic concepts of ‘trainability’? To what extent are international education programmes of study inscribed with discourses that ‘instrumentalize the expressive’ (Hartley, 2003) or promote ‘strategic cosmopolitanism’ (Mitchell, 2003)? Hartley makes the point that specifications of affective and conative competences can render them visible for the purposes of assessment. It is frequently asserted that a curriculum that is not assessed is a null curriculum. In order to make generic modes of knowledge legitimate in the eyes of teachers and learners, they need to be made available (instrumentalized) for assessment. Mitchell’s argument is that cross cultural competences and the internationally minded values promoted by international education may be interpreted as forms of social or cultural capital that can be exploited to enhance social and economic position. Other examples of how the sociology of knowledge might be researched in the context of international education include the application of Bernstein’s (2000) theories of pedagogic discourse, the pedagogic device, and pedagogic identities to the practice and outcomes of international education.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-1475240912461988">
<title>Boundaries</title>
<p>The sociology of knowledge leads into discussion of boundaries in education. As Bernstein argues, boundaries in education may be characterized in terms of relations <italic>between</italic> curriculum contents (classification) as well as <italic>within</italic> curriculum contents (framing). However, these are abstractions. How can they be operationalized for the conduct of research? The IB Diploma Programme can be characterized as a collection code because the candidate must perform according to a specific set of rules, including rules about combinations of subjects, in order to qualify for the award of the Diploma (Cambridge, 2011). How could the relative strengths of classification and framing in the IB Diploma be characterized, and how could they be compared and contrasted not only with other IB programmes of study (Primary Years Programme, Middle Years Programme, Career-related Certificate) but also with programmes such as those of the College Board AP or Cambridge International Examinations (CIE)? Little research in the field of pedagogic discourse applied to international education appears to have been conducted or published hitherto. However, Bernstein’s published work offers the researcher a rich and well-theorized conceptual framework combined with the prospect of being able to make links with other academics in the field of educational research. It is hoped that this is an intellectual challenge that might be taken up by interested persons in the field of international education.</p>
<p>In her study of the history and development of subject departments in schools, Siskin (1994: 37) draws attention to the relationship between ‘the formal organization of the school and the disciplinary organization of knowledge’. That is to say, the boundaries between subject departments in schools are inscribed with the discursive boundaries that represent classification between the subjects. What forms do these boundaries take? In the context of organization studies, Hernes (2004) proposes that boundaries may be physical, normative or cognitive. In other words, physical boundaries can be recognized in terms of the walls and fences surrounding a school, but many international schools are enclaves in which business is conducted in a language not used in the surrounding community. Language constitutes a normative social boundary between those who speak it and those who do not. The discursive boundaries between different school subjects can be considered to be cognitive boundaries that allow different forms of official knowledge as well as discriminating between official and unofficial knowledge. Hernes (2004) develops these ideas about the nature of boundaries by discussing their relative strengths and the thresholds that must be overcome in order to cross them. This would provide a rich and productive conceptual framework for inquiry into boundaries in international schools and international education.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>This article has attempted to make sense of the place of international education in the wider context of educational inquiry by considering questions about ontology. What is being researched when international education is addressed? By reference to the work of Basil Bernstein, it is proposed that a pure form of discourse may be identified that sees international education as a singular mode of pedagogized knowledge. However, this perspective can be criticized for being jejune and idealist. An alternative view of international education as a regional mode of pedagogized knowledge acknowledges the hybridity of the field, with various strands of knowledge drawn together under an overarching master viewpoint. The view of international education as a region also acknowledges the dual faces of the field, combining introjection towards an academic identity with projection towards the requirements of the market. A third interpretation of international education as a generic mode of knowledge is currently gaining territory. Generic knowledge is a pragmatic, reductive discourse that couples training to the acquisition of skills and competences. It is devoid of introjection and is considered to constitute a danger to the future development of academic inquiry into the field. The proposition is discussed that the <italic>IB Learner Profile</italic> (IB, 2006) may be interpreted in terms of a specification of generic skills and competences. Various possible future directions of international education research are discussed. These include the problematization of the production of global citizenship in the context of the (re)production of national citizenship; the sociology of the production, recontextualization, distribution, reproduction and assessment of knowledge in international education; and the management of boundaries in the classification and framing of international education.</p>
