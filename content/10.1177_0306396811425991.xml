<p>Islamophobia, some critics have suggested, could be construed as Orientalism updated. These two books offer alternative, but complementary perspectives for such a narrative, describing the historical trajectory that so suggestively leads from ‘Orientalism’ to ‘Islamophobia’. The more than thirty contributors to Iskander and Rustom’s collection of essays, celebrating and commemorating the critical work and political career of the late Edward Said (d. 2003, whose 1978, still foundational study, <italic>Orientalism</italic>, continues, even now, to agitate academics and activists alike), have each been, albeit differently, influenced by the Palestinian-born, US-educated and internationally outspoken critic. By contrast, Salama’s <italic>Islam, Orientalism and Intellectual History</italic> re-engages with much of the same historical narrative, but under the lingering and pernicious shadow of 9/11. Or, as Salama notes in his epilogue, the ‘protracted modern history of [Islam’s] encounters with the West’ and the ‘conflict with Islam today, for which both Western Europe and America are fully militarized’.</p>
<p>Divided into three substantive sections with two introductory essays, <italic>Edward Said</italic> assembles a notable roster of contributors from multiple public spheres, who individually and collectively highlight both the range of the professor’s academic influence and the exiled Palestinian’s insights into cosmopolitan political provocations. The editors maintain in the introduction to their volume, some five years in the compiling, that they seek to present a ‘biographical chronology, [but] one that historicizes his writings’, an aspiration echoed by Joseph Massad’s contribution on ‘affiliating with Edward Said’, which champions not only Said’s emphatic ‘secular criticism’, but also his persistent ‘political atheism’. Although Part 1, ‘On Colony and Aesthetics’, focuses largely on Said’s academic contributions, the essayists develop the interdisciplinary and international scope of those contributions, from ‘theory’ to anthropology (Wood, Nader Dirks), to comparative literature (Brennan), women’s studies (Narain, King), Arabic literary studies (Ramazani, Hafez, Valassopoulos, de Groot). As Brennan argues in his tribute to Said, ‘Edward Said’s authority was always ultimately literary’, duly crediting his professor with the ‘reinvention of the field of comparative literature’, but asserting, too, that ‘Said’s writing has [also] always been biographical’.</p>
<p>This biography emerges no less assertively under yet another ‘Saidian’ banner in the following section, ‘Palestine, Israel, and Zionism’, which opens with an extended interview (Rustom) with the Israeli musician and conductor, Daniel Barenboim, who collaborated with Said in the creation of the West-Eastern Divan Workshop, dedicated to furthering dialogue and reconciliation through music education for Israeli and Arab youth. Ardi Imseis brings an international law perspective to the Palestine question, with historical analyses of the League of Nations, the Balfour Declaration and the Sykes-Picot Agreement. It is a perspective that is complemented by other critics (Shlaim, Ashcroft, Rose, Ellis) regarding Said’s opposition to the capitulations of the 1993 Oslo Accords, and further complemented by analyses of Said’s controversial resonances within Israeli discourse itself (Pappé, Shohat). The culminating section, ‘The Intellectual at a Crossroads’, recapitulates some of the recurring themes in this combined curriculum vitae/career path: Said’s opposition to the Oslo Accords, his transition from support for a two-state solution to the ‘question of Palestine’, to the endorsement of a one-state solution, and – a repeated refrain throughout the essays – the imperative of ‘speaking truth to power’, particularly regarding the posthumously published <italic>Humanism and Democratic Criticism</italic> (2004). Like the preceding section, this one also begins with an interview (Iskander) with one of Said’s renowned comrades, Noam Chomsky, on the culture of the public intellectual, a theme that is reiterated in subsequent essays on various topics from ‘homeland peace’ (Spencer) to theology (Hussein), humanism (Radhakrishnan, Rosenthal, Mitchell) and utopia (Varadharajan), concluding, perhaps most provocatively, with Benita Parry’s reaffirmation of the controversial and the contentious in Said’s career, the ‘countercurrents and tensions in Said’s critical practice’.</p>
<p>With the exception of the ‘conversation’ (Baer) with Gayatri Chakravorty Spivak that opens the first section of the work on Said, there is remarkably scant discussion in the volume of the events of September 11 and their aftermath. <italic>Islam, Orientalism and Intellectual History</italic>, for its part, opens with just that epochal catalyst towards the author’s project of rethinking Islamophobia as Orientalism updated. As Salama describes, he ‘began writing this book early in the summer of 2006’, he continues:</p>
<p>

<p>after I flew from San Francisco to Canada in order to obtain my new work visa. Immediately upon my arrival at the US Consulate in Toronto, I was singled out from a group of seven similarly circumstanced Europeans applying for the same type of work visa. I was profiled by the visa officer, who acting on specific orders from the US Department of State, fingerprinted me, put a ‘cancelled without prejudice’ stamp on all my previous US visas since 1992, and took my Egyptian passport.</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Salama’s study goes on to ask, ‘how did Islam become a sanctioned label for negative accusations in the USA and Europe?’</p>
<p>In his epilogue, Salama writes that, ‘Islamophobia began as a fiction and in fiction’, and the five main chapters expand on the history of those ‘fictions’. First, ‘Fact or fiction? How the writing of history became a discourse of conquest’ reviews assorted Euro-American critics of received historiography (such as Hayden White, Michel de Certeau and Michel Foucault) in discerning the competing paradigms of ‘historia’, on the one hand, and ‘<italic>tarikh</italic>’, on the other. ‘Postcolonial battles over Ibn Khaldun’ (Chapter 2) probes more specifically and referentially into the question of ‘What happened to Ibn Khaldun between the fourteenth and twentieth centuries?’ Ibn Khaldun was the great North African historian of the fourteenth to fifteenth centuries, whose <italic>Mudaddimah</italic> (or Prolegomenon) has been variously cherished, coveted and contested by western and Muslim/Arab scholars alike. In Chapter 3, however, a differently angled question is titularly raised: ‘How did Islam make it into Hegel’s <italic>Philosophy of History</italic>?’, followed by yet another interrogative: ‘How valid is the Hegelian legacy if employed by modern and contemporary scholars in re-examining Islam after September 11?’ These queries find further elaboration in Salama’s probing readings of the ‘emergence of Islam as a historical category in British colonial thought’ (Chapter 4), with special reference to the writings of Daniel Defoe’s <italic>Robinson Crusoe</italic> (1719, juxtaposed with Lord Cromer’s <italic>Modern Egypt</italic>, 1908), E. W. Lane’s <italic>Account of the Manners and Customs of the Modern Egyptians</italic> (1860), Lady Duff Gordon’s <italic>Letters from Egypt</italic> (1862–1869) and Mary Shelley’s <italic>Frankenstein</italic> (1818), in a persuasive demonstration of the persistent, but pernicious binarism of civilised/barbaric (and its various permutations over the course of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries) in colonial and postcolonial thought – and practice.</p>
<p>Remaining focused on Egypt, Salama turns, in the final chapter ‘Disciplining Islam: colonial Egypt, a case study’, to the infamous Denshawai affair in 1906, precipitated by a violent clash between British officers and Egyptian peasants, which notoriously resulted in either executions or harsh penal sentences for nearly thirty Egyptian locals. In addition to reading the early nineteenth-century preludes, from Napoleon to Al-Jabarti, to this critical incident in the rise of modern Egyptian nationalism, Salama more critically reads its rewriting by Egyptian writers: the contemporary poems of Hafiz Ibrahim (1906) and Ahmad Shawqi (1907), and Mahmud Tahir Haqqi’s 1906 novel, George Bernard Shaw’s <italic>John Bull’s Island</italic> (a ‘shamrock Denshawai’) and, finally, Ahdaf Soueif’s <italic>A Map of Love</italic> (1999). In sum, therefore, according to Salama’s epilogue, ‘Historicizing the enemy, globalizing Islam, giving violence a new name’, the fraught trajectory from ‘Orientalism’, so exposed and excoriated by Edward Said, to ‘Islamophobia’ can itself be read as evidence of the ‘lingering effect of a crooked history of oppression that not only legitimated colonial and imperial domination in the last century, but also managed to reproduce itself in the postcolonial and sustain its underlying xenophobic codes up to the present day’.</p>
