<p>The Internet and World Wide Web have woven together humanity in new ways, creating global communities, new forms of identity and pathology, and new modes of intervention. This issue of <italic>Transcultural Psychiatry</italic> presents selected papers from the annual McGill Advanced Study Institute (ASI) in Cultural Psychiatry on “Cultures of the Internet” which took place in Montreal, April 26–29, 2011. The ASI addressed four broad areas: (a) how the Internet is transforming human functioning, personhood, and identity through the engagement with electronic media; (b) how electronic networking gives rise to new groups and forms of community, with shifting notions of public and private, local and distant; (c) the emergence of new pathologies of the Internet, e.g., Internet addiction, group suicide, cyberbullying, and disruptions of neurodevelopment; and finally, (d) the use of the Internet in mental health care, for example, by consumer advocacy and support groups, as well as for the delivery of health information, web-based consultation, treatment intervention, and mental health promotion. In addition to some of the ASI papers, this issue includes other recent contributions to the journal on related themes. In this introductory essay, we set out some of the broad implications of the Internet and related new media and information communication technologies (ICT) for cultural psychiatry.</p>

<sec id="sec2-1363461513490626"><title>The Internet as medium and message</title>
<p>The Internet and associated technologies have been heralded both as a source of great boons and new human potentialities and as the cause of serious social problems and pathologies. Many have viewed the Internet as intrinsically democratizing, allowing the free-exchange of information and providing people with a more comprehensive view of their local situation and a kind of public voice or representation that would otherwise be available only to the wealthy and powerful (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-1363461513490626">Hand &amp; Sandywell, 2002</xref>). At the same time, reliance on these same channels renders people vulnerable to new forms of surveillance and social control by states and other powerful organizations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr100-1363461513490626">Morozov, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>Viewing the Internet as having intrinsic properties that shape the nature of its effects has its roots in technology and media studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr86-1363461513490626">Lievrouw, 2002</xref>). Marshall <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr93-1363461513490626">McLuhan (1964)</xref> famously claimed “the medium is the message,” capturing the essential truth that the ways that information is packaged, exchanged, and delivered may carry as much information as the message itself, exerting complex effects on whole domains of thought and practice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1363461513490626">Coupland &amp; Saul, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-1363461513490626">Hayles, 2012</xref>). At issue, however, is the extent to which the use of the Internet itself—independently of any particular content—has specific psychological or social consequences. Like other media, the Internet may exert biases on cognition and social practice, making some concepts or types of information easier to formulate and share, thereby putting its imprint on experience, but it also constitutes a flexible medium that can be used in myriad ways—which are constantly being discovered or invented. Although networks have their own dynamics, much of what is viewed as intrinsic to the Internet may have more to do with how it is currently configured and used than with any of its fundamental properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr101-1363461513490626">Morozov, 2013</xref>). Moreover, this configuration is not something that has emerged spontaneously, but is the result of a complex history driven by particular interests. A sketch of the development of the Internet is instructive both because of the rapidity and recency of its emergence, and because of the complex interplay of military, university, government, and commercial interests that have underwritten its development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1363461513490626">Green, 2010</xref>; J. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr120-1363461513490626">Ryan, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>The Internet is a global distributed data communications network built on an electronic backbone that began as a vehicle for military research. The precursor of today's Internet began in the 1950s amid the tensions of the Cold War and emerged as Arpanet in 1969, the first network using “packet switching” which initially connected Stanford University and UCLA, and then extended to Harvard, MIT, and other institutions (J. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr120-1363461513490626">Ryan, 2010</xref>). This backbone allowed for early forms of file transfer and message exchange, as well as the creation of electronic bulletin boards. Basic e-mail was developed in 1971 and the same year saw the start of Project Gutenberg, which aimed to make books and documents in the public domain freely available in electronic format.</p>
<p>The advent of the personal computer led to exponential growth of the Internet (J. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr120-1363461513490626">Ryan, 2010</xref>). Social media and games began to emerge with the advent of the personal modem in 1977, starting with the Bulletin Board System in 1978, and the first online social games (“Multi-User Dungeons” [MUD], inspired by the fantasy role playing game <italic>Dungeons and Dragons</italic>, and later generalized to “Multi-User Domains”). The development of protocols for network addressing (HTTP, URLs) and exchange of hypermedia (HTML) led, in 1990, to the creation of the World Wide Web. The first web page was created in 1991. Mosaic, the first widely used graphical browser, appeared in 1993, followed by Netscape Navigator in 1994. These tools accelerated the shift from primarily text-based information to increasingly elaborate visual and multimedia sites. The commercialization of the Internet began in 1995 with the shift from infrastructure owned by government institutions (e.g., the National Science Foundation and collaborating academic institutions) to increasing corporate support and control. Along the way there has been a constant elaboration of new media, giving us hypertext, and ever more complex animation, video, and audio content. Wikipedia was established in 2001 and, as with many of the later innovations, this allowed for new forms of social collaboration with much debate about how to insure quality and consensus while minimizing hierarchy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1363461513490626">Fallis, 2008</xref>). A further shift occurred around 2004 with the arrival of Web 2.0, characterized by highly interactive and user-driven software applications delivered over the Internet (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-1363461513490626">Han, 2011</xref>). At the same time, social networking media began to emerge with Facebook and other sites, each with their own character and communities. Mobile web technology became popular starting in 2007 with the release of the iPhone. Mobile communications technology has exerted a profound effect by moving access to the Internet away from the desktop and into the spaces and places of everyday life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1363461513490626">De Vries, 2013</xref>). The technologies of web-linked watches and eye glasses will accelerate this merging of virtual and everyday worlds in “augmented reality.”</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec3-1363461513490626"><title>Identity and virtuality: Ontologies of the Internet</title>
    <p>The Internet is transforming human functioning, personhood, and identity. It provides new modes of social presentation and positioning, new media for expression, and new ways of narrating the self. Some have considered the transformations so basic and far reaching as to mark fundamental evolutionary shifts toward the “posthuman” (Haney, 2006; Rahimi, 2000). The new technologies include blogging and other social media, as well as the virtual places and communities that constitute cyberspace (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1363461513490626">Crampton, 2003</xref>; Papacharissi, 2011). These provide novel ways of accessing information, organizing memory, and relating to others. To the extent these technologies change our modes of self-experience, understanding, and participation we can speak of new forms of self and personhood.</p>
<p>Many have claimed that the Internet not only changes how we communicate or interact with online information but that it also exerts more profound effects on basic cognitive functions including memory, attention, and thought, as well as our experiences of embodiment and community (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1363461513490626">Brockman, 2011</xref>). For some, these changes promise an extraordinary augmentation of human capacities (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1363461513490626">Chorost, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr126-1363461513490626">Shirky, 2010</xref>), while for others, the invasion of the Internet portends the loss of some of our most basic human qualities, values, and capacities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1363461513490626">Aboujaoude, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1363461513490626">Carr, 2010</xref>). Both optimistic and pessimistic accounts, however, recognize the changes are extensive, with implications for human knowledge, selfhood and consciousness. The philosopher <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1363461513490626">Hubert Dreyfus (2001)</xref> raised four basic concerns about the impact of the Internet on identity and meaning-making processes: (a) the limitations of hyperlinks as a way of organizing meaningful information and knowledge; (b) the limitations of distance learning, which are especially salient with the recent emergence of massive open online courses (MOOC); (c) more broadly, the lack of presence in telepresence; and (d) the problem of anonymity and nihilism when there is no physical encounter.</p>
<p>Much of what we attribute to the Internet reflects its role as a platform for new media, which have their own effects on flows of information, organization of memory, and expressions of identity. Hypertext changes the structure of reading, adding another dimension that allows trains of thought or associations to move out of the semantic frame of the phrase, sentence, paragraph, or larger narrative (M.-L. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr121-1363461513490626">Ryan, 1999</xref>). Hyperlinks can provide essential background knowledge, (the definitions and etymology of words, the provenance and history of ideas and events, etc.), encourage divergent thinking or a kind of Talmudic reading in which alternative viewpoints, commentary, and arguments are always ready-to-hand (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr119-1363461513490626">Rosen, 2000</xref>). At the same time, the digressions from the line of argument or distractions from a vivid narrative may undermine the cogency and coherence of a complex argument or story. Hypertext and the breadth of search engines may result in a horizontal leveling out of all information as potentially equivalent. Ease of access does not obviate the need for human expertise and integration to make “raw” information useful as knowledge.</p>
<p>The Internet as repository of knowledge is transforming from an aid or supplement to memory, to its functional core. In 2002, worldwide digital storage capacity overtook total analog capacity and by 2007, estimates are that almost 94% of all human information storage was in digital form (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-1363461513490626">Hilbert &amp; Lopez, 2011</xref>). Web-based databases allow us to access information in new ways, often with remarkable ease. Gone is the arduous labour of constructing manual concordances to the Bible or the works of Shakespeare; even indexes are quick becoming an archaic approach, since search engines can instantly find any word or phrase in a text and, if augmented by artificial intelligence, could perform much the same functions as a skilfully constructed topic index. The enormous volume of information served up by the Internet makes it a sort of auxiliary brain. Mobile devices extend these capacities of the web into our daily lives. This changes how we use our memories, moving beyond the book with a new level of accessibility to even arcane information. The challenge becomes how to filter and find what is needed and how to warrant its accuracy given the free circulation of idiosyncratic ideas, rumours, and misinformation. Ideas and images “go viral” not because they are true, beautiful, or edifying but simply because they are novel, amusing, or arresting to large numbers of people.</p>
<p>The Internet reduces the richly embodied nature of interpersonal encounters and individuals’ sensual engagement with the world to a few electronically mediated senses. The most common interface of the Internet is the computer screen or mobile phone, both of which privilege visual information. Although speech and sound are also readily available, other sensory modalities still have little presence. Hence, Internet use further strengthens an epistemic reliance on sight (“seeing is knowing”) that may have evolutionary roots but that was strongly reinforced with the advent of print culture and the book. However, while the book has a linear structure imposed by its physical nature—turning the page to follow the narrative (unless we skip ahead to find the finale on the last page)—the Internet and hypertext encourage something approaching simultaneity. This mode of information delivery certainly leads to changes in attention—at issue is whether these are temporary adaptations to the use of the medium or will have more lasting effects on psychological processes and give rise to qualitatively new modes of subjectivity and self-consciousness, with corresponding changes in neural functioning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1363461513490626">Greenfield &amp; Yan, 2006</xref>) and, perhaps, even become selective pressures on human evolution, leading to new kinds of brains.</p>
<p>More immediately, we face the dilemma of drowning in information, inundated with ideas, texts, and images that saturate attention, cognition, and imagination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-1363461513490626">Kegan, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-1363461513490626">Klingberg, 2009</xref>). Novelty seeking is among the more powerful human motivations and the Internet has capitalized on this in every domain, from storytelling and entertainment, to mass marketing, to exacerbating our appetites for sexual imagery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr110-1363461513490626">Paasonen, 2011</xref>). In the process, we risk being fragmented, morselized, scattered, and disorganized. Of course, as Suparna Choudhury and Kelly McKinney (2013) point out in their contribution to this issue, arguments about the deleterious effects of digital media on brains—and particularly developing adolescent brains—are supported by a relatively thin and ambiguous set of findings from cognitive neuroscience research.</p>
<p>Although memory is central to learning and identity, the fallibility of memory also affords us the opportunity to forget what is shameful, harmful, or derailing, allowing for the possibility of new beginnings. Indeed, for most of human history, the default mode of memory was forgetting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr92-1363461513490626">Mayer-Schönberger, 2009</xref>). Recall—at least of mundane events—took special effort, which was reflected in the ceremonies, ritual observances, and storytelling of oral traditions. Print culture created archives and paper trails, but these were scattered and often difficult to access. The Internet has allowed access to digital archives that take the persistence and accessibility of memory to new levels. The indelible memory of the Internet does not allow us to escape any of the vagaries of our personal histories. Past indiscretions, childish mistakes, and other errancies can come back to haunt us endlessly. This situation may ultimately demand a new level of caution and consistency (which few will be able to maintain)—or a new level of tolerance for human foibles—but it also lends itself to oppressive use and abuse, subverting our life narratives and efforts at self-presentation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr92-1363461513490626">Mayer-Schönberger, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>The Internet has led to the creation of novel kinds of virtual space and social life—with new worlds to explore and new people (or their simulacra) to meet (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1363461513490626">Baudrillard, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr125-1363461513490626">Shields, 2003</xref>). This, in turn, has changed the nature of embodiment and enactment, offering us the prospect of a virtual heaven (or hell) without bodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr143-1363461513490626">Wertheim, 1999</xref>). In fact, the experience of virtual reality itself involves forms of embodiment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr103-1363461513490626">Murray &amp; Sixsmith, 1999</xref>). Moreover, as Richard <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr117-1363461513490626">Powers makes clear in his novel, <italic>Plowing the Dark</italic> (2000)</xref>, virtuality is a basic capacity of the human imagination intrinsic to our ability to become immersed in stories or vivid images. Nevertheless, the virtual worlds of the Internet, whether abstract and text based or richly decked out in colour and texture like the avatars of Second Life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1363461513490626">Boellstorff, 2010</xref>), afford more elaborate forms of role playing. In the face of this imaginative freedom and power to reconfigure virtual identities, the forms of social life derived from our physically shared world may come to seem threadbare, confining, or redundant.</p>
<p>Sherry <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr138-1363461513490626">Turkle (2011)</xref> sounds a related note of caution in her recent study of how social networking technologies and the devices which make them portable and ever-present may be shifting our expectations of human relationships. Turkle is particularly concerned that the condition of always being connected or “tethered” to one's device—and thus having the potential to communicate with parents or friends—undermines young people in developing relatively autonomous selves, able to experience emotions and make decisions without continual feedback and support. More broadly, many of the young people and adults Turkle speaks to are simultaneously compelled by the possibilities for identity-play, sociality, and escape enabled by these technologies. While they are hopeful about their potential for managing their social anxieties and vulnerabilities, they are also troubled by the ways they may simplify and flatten relationships and intimacy. She writes, “we have to be concerned that the simplification and reduction of relationship is no longer something we complain about. It may become what we expect, even desire” (2011, p. 295). The writer Gary Shteyngart depicts the nadir of this flattening of social life in his comic novel <italic>Super Sad True Love Story</italic> (2010) in which the events of everyday life, including romantic encounters, are blogged and rated online in real-time and achieving high ratings counts for more than the quality of the human encounter.</p>
<p>Increasingly, the Internet is connected to the material world not only at the interface of screen and keyboard (or glasses and gloves of virtuality), and the technologies of robotic extensions and multisensory modalities that are on the horizon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1363461513490626">Goldberg, 2000</xref>), but also through economic, social, and political consequences. The real world is always present behind the virtual—both in the infrastructure that runs the web and in the very human interests and agencies that run the show (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1363461513490626">Goldsmith &amp; Wu, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr100-1363461513490626">Morozov, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>At the McGill ASI, the Mohawk artist Skawenatti Fragnito told a striking story of the interplay of virtual and material worlds.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1363461513490626">1</xref></sup> She used Second Life as a software environment in which to develop <italic>machinima</italic>, digital animations, for a project on Iroquois history and futures (J. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr84-1363461513490626">Lewis &amp; Fragnito, 2012</xref>). At one point in the project, some of the laboriously constructed graphic objects on their virtual island began to disappear. Attempts to find a software glitch were not successful. Finally, Skawenatti—or, rather, her Second Life avatar—flew up over their island and found a pirate ship floating there that was sucking up their virtual property. She went inside and confronted a group of “hackers” sitting around a table. They asked who she was and, in an inspired moment, she stated, “I am the land.” In this dramatic statement she was invoking not only conventional property rights, (she had paid real dollars to build and maintain the virtual space and resources for her movie sets), but also older indigenous notions of land-based identity. However, the digital pirates’ willingness to respond to this claim, or any other appeal to social order, law, or moral convention, depended on their knowledge and memory of the social order beyond the virtual world.</p>
<p>The intrusion of the real is not only a disturbing reminder of the conditional nature of virtuality and its dependence on the usual economic and political structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr100-1363461513490626">Morozov, 2011</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr101-1363461513490626">2013</xref>), it is also a return to the comfort of warm bodies on solid ground. We surely have a need for real presences, with us in flesh as well as in spirit. William Gibson, who coined the term “cyberspace,” and whose novel <italic>Neuromancer</italic> (1984) fully imagined the ethos of the hackers who prowl its back alleys, explored this hunger for the real in a later novel, <italic>Idoru</italic> (1996), in which the protagonist longs for physical union with a virtual pop idol.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1363461513490626">2</xref></sup></p>

<sec id="sec4-1363461513490626"><title>The new Leviathan: Culture, community and politics in cyberspace</title>
<p>On one reading, the Internet is a great tool for democratization, allowing a new populism and leveling out of access to information and expression. Virtual communities can form rapidly around any sort of shared interest or concern. This can include specialized groups for individuals with disabilities or unique modes of experience (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1363461513490626">Antze, 2010</xref>), support groups for those with stigmatizing or rare illness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1363461513490626">Gowen, Deschaine, Gruttadara, &amp; Markey, 2012</xref>), as well as online groups for diasporic communities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1363461513490626">Bacigalupe &amp; Cámara, 2012</xref>), or groups with often fleeting yet affectively powerful shared political interests, as we have seen in places like Iran, Tunisia or Egypt in recent years. ICTs provides new opportunities for the emergence of ad hoc forms of organization that allow groups to work together toward common goals (Dolan, 2010; Gasemiyeh &amp; Zariffard, 2012). In addition to human community, the Internet can provide resources, connections, and meaningful activities and employment for people with sensory and motor disabilities, the housebound, and those with other specific needs.</p>
<p>Research on diasporic Muslim communities has highlighted the need for a distinction between two separate “communities” when speaking of the “Muslim community”: a virtual digital community located in cyberspace, and a lived “real” community located within political and geographical borders. Ever since Benedict Anderson's (1983) work on “imagined communities,” the notion has been widely used and expanded by scholars of Islamic societies to theorize the central Islamic notion of <italic>ummah</italic>, which denotes an abstracted, transnational “community” consisting of all Muslims around the globe (Lewis, 2002; Roy, 2004; Shavit, 2010). With the advent of new technologies of information and communication, an increasingly active “digital <italic>ummah</italic>” is born of the serendipitous convergence of traditional ideology and postmodern technology, offering a radically new definition for the notion of imagined communities (Campbell, 2010; Roy, 2004, 2010). As Spalek and Imtoual (2007) report, the internet has given Muslim youth now more than ever the option of joining the digital <italic>ummah</italic> as “an imagined community that works through minds, attitudes and discourses rather than geographical locales or through social and familial ties” (p. 194).</p>
<p>Linked with mobile phone cameras, the Internet has become a vehicle for documenting and disseminating information on events with political implications. Many have attributed some of the dynamics of the Arab Spring to the ready circulation of information, which both motivated and coordinated protests and challenges to existing structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr133-1363461513490626">Stepanova, 2011</xref>). However, it is crucial to remember that governments and corporations retain control over the infrastructure of the Internet as well as mobile communication technologies and can not only throttle or block use of these channels, but actually employ them for surveillance of individuals they deem a threat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr100-1363461513490626">Morozov, 2011</xref>). The Human Rights Council of the United Nations issued a report in 2011 that linked access to the Internet to the right to freedom of opinion and expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr140-1363461513490626">United Nations, 2011</xref>). Hence, disconnecting people from the Internet is a human rights violation and against international law. This is clearly directed in part against states that seek to block content that would be damaging or destabilizing to their regimes.</p>
<p>While some have argued that the Internet is rapidly ushering in a new global culture, there is evidence that it also contributes to the differentiation of groups, allowing them to forge new hybrid identities or maintain various forms of ethnicity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr113-1363461513490626">Parker &amp; Song, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr139-1363461513490626">Tynes, Giang, &amp; Thompson, 2008</xref>). As Bhui and Ibrahim (2013) discuss in their contribution to this issue, the Internet can be used to promote identification with a radical political cause with potentially disastrous effects. Zygmunt Bauman suggests,
<disp-quote>
<p>rather than homogenizing the human condition, the technological annulment of temporal/spatial distances tends to polarize it. It emancipates certain humans from territorial constraints and renders certain community-generating meanings extraterritorial—while denuding the territory, to which other people go on being confined, of its meaning and its identity-endowing capacity. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1363461513490626">Bauman, 1998</xref>, p. 18)</p></disp-quote>The implication is that the collective identities forged through the Internet may have qualities they derive from the medium itself of being more or less divorced from their immediate circumstances and hence less responsive to local communities.</p>
<p>The networking afforded by the Internet is forging new social processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1363461513490626">Castells, 2010</xref>) and new types of community founded on common interests and emerging identities, leading some to speak of a new tribalism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1363461513490626">Adams &amp; Smith, 2008</xref>). These range from simple exchanges of information like business, to sharing creative projects of music or film, celebrating important life events, or sharing intimate confessions and <italic>cris du cœur</italic>. There are specific forms of social media suitable for each of these but individuals put a site conceived for a specific purpose to new and unexpected uses. Facebook has been used by many to narrate mundane life events. There are Aboriginal communities in Canada that chat online in their Indigenous language, keeping it alive in a new generation. For Indigenous peoples the Internet not only provides a platform for communication between remote communities and a way to preserve and share traditional knowledge both locally and with the wider world, it also is a natural medium for meetings between the generations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1363461513490626">Adamson, Daborn, Houston, &amp; Tootoo, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1363461513490626">Adelson &amp; Olding, 2013</xref>).</p>
<p>Although there is still a “digital divide” that excludes many in low-income countries from ready access, mobile phones have become ubiquitous and the Internet is increasingly available to people with limited means. Migrant and diasporic communities are making intensive use of the Internet and associated media to strengthen and maintain new forms of transnational identity and connectivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1363461513490626">Alonso &amp; Oiarzabal, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-1363461513490626">Hiller &amp; Franz, 2004</xref>). The Internet makes prolonged contact possible for people who, in the past, would have had limited opportunities for communication. For example, Filipino mothers who must leave children behind when they emigrate for work, can now maintain daily contact even leaving video connections open for long stretches of time to bridge the distance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr98-1363461513490626">Madianou &amp; Miller, 2012</xref>).</p>
<p>A key point here is that while the Internet has certainly allowed the development of new types of relationships and communities, the interactions which take place in these seemingly anonymized spaces may also have (often unintended) consequences for offline, face-to-face relationships. This is especially significant in the case of relatively small diasporic communities where the density of offline interpersonal networks can make online anonymity tenuous at best (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-1363461513490626">Humphrey, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Particular kinds of online spaces set certain conditions for social interaction which may have unforeseen potentialities as well as consequences. Facebook and other global social networking sites are especially apt examples. Facebook has about a billion active members in 127 countries and there are other social networks that also have massive size (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr116-1363461513490626">Popkin, 2013</xref>): QZone in China has over 500 million users; in Russia V Kontakte (“VK”) and Odnoklassniki have 190 million and 45 million users, respectively; while Iran's Cloob has one million users. As a medium for relationships, Facebook opens a new channel of communication with its own ambiguities due both to the medium and its imposed constraints and, especially, its quasipublic nature. It creates new zones of privacy and intimacy and new scope for projecting a public persona. Illana <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1363461513490626">Gershon (2010)</xref> argues that Facebook favors a neoliberal view of the self, framed in terms of personal preferences, interests and patterns of consumption. Indeed, Facebook and other social networking sites encourage participants to treat the self as a market commodity, on display for others to judge its attractiveness and seeking always to gain more attention and market share. This is, of course, explicit in business-oriented sites like LinkedIn, but readily extends to academic and other specialized social networks.</p>
<p>These new forms of social networking allow the creation of new selves (or personas) with qualities that can transcend some of the usual physical and social limitations of identity and community. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1363461513490626">Boellstorff (2010)</xref> argues that virtual worlds like Second Life afford individuals extraordinary new opportunities for self-fashioning, creative play, and community.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-1363461513490626">3</xref></sup> However, examining the links between the virtual world of Second Life and its real world corporate creator, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr89-1363461513490626">Malaby (2009)</xref> argues that certain limits, constraints, and even certain ideologies may be embedded in the structure of such online worlds and thus we must pay attention to their producers (in this case Linden Lab) as much as their users.</p>
<p>While the Internet and digital technologies have clearly transformed the channels, potentialities, and temporality of community and political action, they have also produced their own novel political movements and debates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr142-1363461513490626">Vinge &amp; Frenkel, 2001</xref>). This is a point taken up by several social scientists in examining the culture and political arguments associated with self-described “hackers” or “geeks,” who have focused on the attempts to reframe matters understood by the lay public to be “merely technical” in political, social, or aesthetic terms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1363461513490626">Coleman, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1363461513490626">Coleman &amp; Golub, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-1363461513490626">Kelty, 2005</xref>). For example, Gabriella Coleman shows how participants in the “Free and Open Source Software” movement have sought to frame code as speech, as a means of maintaining their highly valorized autonomy as producers of code—a process which has often involved as much tinkering with the law as with technology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1363461513490626">Coleman, 2009</xref>). More broadly, Chris Kelty has argued that the form of social imaginary specific to the Internet is that of the “recursive public,” highlighting the idea that “specific contemporary ideas of social or moral order that just as often take the form of argument-by-technology as they take the form of deliberative spoken or written discussion” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-1363461513490626">Kelty, 2005</xref>, p. 186). By this, Kelty means that self-described “geeks” not only argue about “the technical structure and legal rules” that make up the Internet's infrastructure, “but they consider sacred the right to change these rules by rewriting and reimplementing the core protocols (the “rules”) and core software that give the Internet its structure” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-1363461513490626">Kelty, 2005</xref>, p. 186).</p>
<p>Beyond the geeks and hackers for whom the Internet is something close to a <italic>raison d'etre</italic>, the new generations of “digital natives” who feel at home on the Internet will exert increasing influence on popular culture and the shape of our social worlds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr111-1363461513490626">Palfrey &amp; Gasser, 2008</xref>). A recent example is the growing movement of Kopimism, hailed as “the world's newest religion” (George, 2012). The Church of Kopimism, which was registered by the government of Sweden as an officially recognized religious organization (BBC, 2012), is a congregation of file sharers who consider copying and sharing of information to be not only a right, but a sacred act. The slogan of the Missionary Church of Kopimism is, “Information is Holy. Code is Law. Copying is Sacrament.” Whatever its merits as the basis for a religion, it remains unclear to what extent this creed is the rallying cry of a young generation accustomed to sharing digital media, a clever strategy to circumvent copyright law, or the genuine expression of a new ethos centered on the free flow of information.</p>

<sec id="sec5-1363461513490626"><title>Pathologies of the Internet</title>
<p>As Internet access has grown worldwide, so have various behaviors, practices, and social phenomena understood by many clinicians and social critics as pathological, harmful, or in some way problematic—ranging from “Internet addiction” to cyberbullying, social isolation, and the amplification of psychopathology. While few would question the claim that many people have experienced the Internet and related technologies in ways which are distressing or associated with a constriction rather than an opening of possibilities, such potentially Internet-related pathologies have provoked numerous debates and raised important issues for psychiatrists and social scientists. Many of these questions relate to the particular role played by the Internet and other information and communications technologies in shaping and enabling these behaviors and practices. Are technologies producing fundamentally new or distinct kinds of pathological behavior for which novel nosological classifications and clinical interventions may be necessary, or are they simply providing new channels for the enactment of familiar forms of distress? For example, while “cyberbullying” has attracted significant attention over recent years, researchers and policy makers differ over the degree to which it represents a set of dynamics relatively distinct from face-to-face bullying (e.g., M. A. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1363461513490626">Campbell, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr97-1363461513490626">Mitchell, Finkelhor, Wolak, Ybarra, &amp; Turner, 2011</xref>). These questions have an important ethical dimension as well; for in answering them clinicians and researchers must distinguish moral panic and unwarranted medicalization from conditions in which mental health interventions may be helpful.</p>
<p>In conjunction with the global spread of identity-based politics and broad social shifts which have encouraged greater patient autonomy over recent decades, the Internet has become a vital space for the creation of biosocial communities—with ethical, political, social, and clinical consequences which are yet being worked out and debated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1363461513490626">Bell, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1363461513490626">Charland, 2005</xref>). As in the case of <italic>apotemnophilia</italic> (body integrity identity disorder)—a condition in which individuals express (and often act upon) an urgent desire to undergo limb amputation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1363461513490626">Elliott, 2000</xref>)—the Internet has fostered the creation of communities around forms of pathology that would otherwise be exceedingly rare, acting as a new vector in what Ian Hacking has called “making up” people (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1363461513490626">Hacking, 1986</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-1363461513490626">2002</xref>). The networks of websites formed around delusion-like beliefs (in particular, mind-control experiences) are another example—with significant consequences for clinical conceptualizations of delusion vis-à-vis the consensual reality of communities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1363461513490626">Bell, Maiden, Muñoz-Solomando, &amp; Reddy, 2006</xref>). The significance of such cases is not only that otherwise isolated individuals may understand themselves differently when they communicate with people experiencing similar conditions, but that certain experiences, affective states, and beliefs may be reinforced or amplified, both through the social “looping effects” associated with identification and sociality, and through the triggering of embodied responses to certain images and ideas.</p>
<p>These developments require sustained attention from social scientists and cultural psychiatrists if we are to move beyond responses driven by alarmism and moral panic, particularly in those cases where the Internet is used to develop communities around what many understand as potentially harmful or pathological forms of behavior. For example, the emergence of online communities of self-identified “pro-anorexics” (“pro-anas”), “pro-bulimics” (“pro-mias”) and persons engaged in self-injury has been greeted with alarm by many mental health professionals, as well as the lay public—because they are often understood as potentially promoting, amplifying, or triggering harmful behaviors in vulnerable individuals with a history of self-injury or eating disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1363461513490626">Adler &amp; Adler, 2008</xref>; S. P. Lewis, Heath, St Denis, &amp; Noble, 2011; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr95-1363461513490626">Miah &amp; Rich, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr107-1363461513490626">Norris, Boydell, Pinhas, &amp; Katzman, 2006</xref>). Scholarly and clinical debates surrounding these communities hinge on the question of whether they actively promote harmful behavior—in part by framing eating disorders or self-injury as identities and legitimate ways of being rather than pathology—or whether they provide a safe, nonjudgmental (and potentially therapeutic) space for the discussion of one's problems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1363461513490626">Bell, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1363461513490626">Brotsky &amp; Giles, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1363461513490626">Dias, 2003</xref>). Some linguistic and ethnographic studies have found that pro-ana websites may have positive effects for participants in terms of helping to manage anxiety and gaining insight into one's condition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1363461513490626">Fox, Ward, &amp; O'Rourke, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr87-1363461513490626">Lyons, Mehl, &amp; Pennebaker, 2006</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-1363461513490626">4</xref></sup> While such findings are limited in that these studies have no access to the offline lives of forum participants, several experimental studies suggest that viewing pro-ana websites may have more negative effects in terms of affect, self-esteem, and likelihood to engage in disordered eating (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1363461513490626">Bardone-Cone &amp; Cass, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-1363461513490626">Jett, LaPorte, &amp; Wanchisn, 2010</xref>). A similar set of issues surrounds the various suicide-related Internet communities and websites, like those described in the paper by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-1363461513490626">Ikunaga and colleagues (2013)</xref> in this special issue. Many observers have raised concerns about Internet-based suicide pacts and the availability of instructions for effective methods online, while others argue that online suicide-related venues may have preventative effect by promoting communication and feelings of belonging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1363461513490626">Becker, Mayer, Nagenborg, El-Faddagh, &amp; Schmidt, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1363461513490626">Bell, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr109-1363461513490626">Ozawa-De Silva, 2010</xref>). In his article on suicide communities in this special issue, Ronald <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr105-1363461513490626">Niezen (2013)</xref> explores the possibility that both influences may occur, with consequences differing according to the contexts and vulnerabilities of individuals and even whole societies.</p>
<p>Debates about Internet addiction are similarly illustrative of the contentiousness and ambivalence surrounding questions of mental illness and new communications technologies. While the idea of “Internet addiction” or “computer addiction” had been suggested by others, the first formalized diagnostic tool to be widely taken up was developed during the mid-1990s by psychologist Kimberly <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr150-1363461513490626">Young (1998a)</xref>. In both specialist and popular publications, Young argued that her diagnostic questionnaire for Internet addiction, which was based on a pre-existing battery of questions on pathological gambling, successfully measured a syndrome of uncontrolled and harmful Internet use (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr150-1363461513490626">Young, 1998a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr151-1363461513490626">1998b</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr152-1363461513490626">2004</xref>). The subsequent 15 years have seen an explosion in research and debate about the validity of Internet addiction as a diagnostic category, with much discussion following proposals for its inclusion in the DSM-V (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1363461513490626">Aboujaoude, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1363461513490626">Block, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1363461513490626">Byun et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr108-1363461513490626">O'Brien, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr114-1363461513490626">Pies, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr137-1363461513490626">Tao et al., 2010</xref>). Proponents of the category have described it as a “compulsive-impulsive spectrum disorder,” and have argued that it involves key symptoms and behavioral patterns which mirror those of substance addictions: namely, excessive use, withdrawal, tolerance, and negative repercussions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1363461513490626">Block, 2008</xref>). For many researchers in the neurosciences, this argument is supported by the broader reframing of substance use disorders and various behavioral compulsions (pathological gambling, as well as, potentially, overeating) as variations of a single disorder: “addiction,” understood (in part) as a disruption of common neural pathways linked to reward and desire (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1363461513490626">Dackis &amp; O'Brien, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-1363461513490626">Kalivas &amp; Volkow, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr108-1363461513490626">O'Brien, 2010</xref>). According to this model of addiction as a “chronic, relapsing, brain disease,” activities such as online gaming may activate neural reward pathways intensely enough to make them analogous to alcohol, opiates, and other psychoactive substances (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr108-1363461513490626">O'Brien, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>Critics of the concept of “Internet addiction” as a discrete disorder (or even as a useful clinical heuristic) have pointed to the inconclusiveness of epidemiological studies (which are themselves beset by a lack of agreement on measures), as well as to more fundamental conceptual problems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr145-1363461513490626">Widyanto &amp; Griffiths, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr164-1363461513490626">Yellowlees &amp; Marks, 2007</xref>). Some researchers have argued that in the absence of clear evidence of physiological effects, the use of terms such as “withdrawal” and “tolerance” is essentially “metaphorical” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr114-1363461513490626">Pies, 2009</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-1363461513490626">5</xref></sup> Other critics have argued that a language of “addiction” is too suffused with non-specialist meanings to be useful as a set of analytical terms. Thus “addiction” is often used in North America as a shorthand for expressing an offhand ambivalence about the role of technology in everyday life (e.g., references to “CrackBook” or “Crackberry”) or as a positive descriptor of a technology's “holding power” (e.g., “This game is so addictive!”; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-1363461513490626">Johnson, 2009</xref>). Vaughan Bell and others have argued that the very notion of “Internet addiction” represents a category error, in that “the Internet” is a medium of communication or a particular kind of environment, rather than a behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1363461513490626">Bell, 2007</xref>). While one means of addressing this concern would be to create even more specific categories (such as “online video game addiction,” [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-1363461513490626">Hellman, Schoenmakers, Nordstrom, &amp; van Holst, 2013</xref>]) which would address particular computer-related activities, the broader point Bell and others make is that distressful patterns involving communications and information technologies may be adequately described using existing diagnostic categories (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1363461513490626">Bell, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr114-1363461513490626">Pies, 2009</xref>). In other words, a question which remains deeply contested in the literature on harmful Internet use is whether activities such as video gaming create the conditions for distinct kinds of disorder or whether they simply furnish a context for the enactment, precipitation, or amplification of behaviors associated with pre-existing conditions such as OCD or depression.</p>
<p>The issues at stake here are not only the global ones which confront any attempt at constructing psychiatric nosologies, but also include one that is somewhat specific to our entanglements with technology: namely, how to understand the etiology and causal mechanisms of disorders in which interaction with a technology (or material substance) is involved. In the history of thinking about substance-related addictions there has been a tension between emphasizing the addictiveness of the psychoactive substance and focusing on the vulnerabilities (whether understood in genetic, psychosocial, or cultural terms) of particular individuals or populations. Recent technology-related discussions have clearly tended toward the first of these tendencies, focusing on their purportedly inherently “addictive” characteristics (N. D. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1363461513490626">Campbell, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr141-1363461513490626">Valverde, 1998</xref>). In her recent ethnography of video machine gambling in Las Vegas, anthropologist Natasha Dow Schüll takes a conceptual approach which avoids “the tendency of strict materialism to treat technology as an autonomous, determining force, while also avoiding the tendency of human-centered approaches to regard technology as a passive, neutral tool” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr123-1363461513490626">Schüll, 2012</xref>, p. 19). Drawing instead on the work of Bruno Latour and other scholars of human–technology interaction, Schüll examines gambling addiction as a phenomenon which is coproduced by, or emerges in, a dynamic interaction between video gambling machines and the people who play them (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr81-1363461513490626">Latour, 1992</xref>). Schüll pays close attention to the accounts of players—particularly their descriptions of being “in the zone,” the “world-dissolving state of subjective suspension and affective calm” which some machine gamblers seek to attain again and again, despite experiencing extremely painful consequences in many domains of their lives as a result (2012, p. 19). Yet her investigation focuses as much on the designers of gambling machines and casino architecture—that is, those who “inscribe” machines and spaces so as to encourage such experiences—as it does on the people who find themselves caught in circuits of escape and enclosure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr123-1363461513490626">Schüll, 2012</xref>). Not only are the dynamics at play here similar in many ways to those of particular kinds of Internet use, but the conceptual focus on experiences and behavioral patterns as neither immanent to a particular technology, nor entirely ascribable to individual vulnerabilities, offers a productive vantage for new research on these issues (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1363461513490626">Ash, 2012</xref>). In fact, online gambling is an enormous industry which, ironically enough, has been a major source of revenue for some Indigenous communities already engaged in running casinos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr146-1363461513490626">Williams, Wood, &amp; Parke, 2012</xref>).</p>
<p>An additional problem with the “addiction” category is that it tends to frame research questions entirely around the question of pathological or harmful Internet use or video gaming. Much like other health-oriented research on substance abuse—which often forgets the socially productive factors which draw many people into drinking or drug-use to begin with—research premised on the notion of “Internet addiction” sets out to look only for harmful or distressful effects or results. In research reported in this issue, as well as elsewhere, Jeffrey Snodgrass and his colleagues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr130-1363461513490626">Snodgrass et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr131-1363461513490626">Snodgrass, Lacy, Dengah, &amp; Fagan, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr131-1363461513490626">Snodgrass, Lacy, Dengah, Fagan, &amp; Most, 2011</xref>) have developed a project which instead seeks to understand the factors shaping both harmful and positive trajectories of online gaming. Using a combination of ethnographic and survey methods, Snodgrass and colleagues have shown that players in the massively multiplayer online game, <italic>World of Warcraft</italic>, were more likely to experience distressful or problematic patterns if their game-play was motivated largely by a desire for or enjoyment of competition or in-game achievement, rather than social interaction or immersion in the game environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr130-1363461513490626">Snodgrass et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr129-1363461513490626">2013</xref>). Moreover, gamers who played with offline friends and acquaintances—and thus were able to “transfer in-game accomplishments and experiences to offline social networks” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr131-1363461513490626">Snodgrass, Lacy, Dengah, &amp; Fagan, 2011</xref>, p. 1211)—reported less problematic and disruptive relationships to their gaming than those who did not. This work contributes to literature focusing on “problematic Internet use”—rather than “addiction”—a term meant to index underlying psychosocial issues rather than a discrete disease entity (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1363461513490626">Aboujaoude, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr124-1363461513490626">Shapira et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr164-1363461513490626">Yellowlees &amp; Marks, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>As these discussions suggest, the category of “Internet addiction” remains highly contested—especially in North America, Europe, and Australia. Despite the efforts of its proponents, it will appear only in an appendix of the DSM-5, along with other diagnostic constructs for which additional research has been deemed necessary. The situation is strikingly different in China, (as well as other East Asian countries, particularly, Taiwan, South Korea, and Singapore), where “Internet addiction” has been much more readily accepted by clinical professionals and governing institutions and translated into (often controversial) intervention and social policy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1363461513490626">Bax, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr91-1363461513490626">Manjikian, 2012</xref>). Since the early 2000s, as Internet cafes became increasingly common sites for online gaming in China, a series of sensational suicides, murders, and other deaths (heavily covered by the media) understood as linked to online gaming, fuelled popular and expert anxieties over pathological Internet use, leading to the recognition of “Internet addiction” as a disease by Golub and Lingley (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1363461513490626">2008</xref>, p. 62). Interventions have included state efforts to regulate Internet cafes and online game operators, as well as the establishment of numerous boot-camp style Internet addiction treatment facilities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr91-1363461513490626">Manjikian, 2012</xref>). (In response to a series of investigative reports on the deaths of several young people, legislation was passed in 2009 outlawing electroshock therapy in such facilities in China [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr148-1363461513490626">Stone, 2009</xref>]). Some social scientists have interpreted the obsession with online games as a response to the intense familial pressures to achieve high grades experienced by many young people in China today (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1363461513490626">Bax, 2011</xref>), while others have argued that the moralizing and pathologizing media and expert discourses around Internet addiction in China represent a means of state-fostered social control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr91-1363461513490626">Manjikian, 2012</xref>), a site for the negotiation of shifting “moral relations in contemporary Chinese society” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1363461513490626">Golub &amp; Lingley, 2008</xref>, p. 72; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr136-1363461513490626">Szablewicz, 2010</xref>), and a focus for anxieties about the neo-colonial cultural effects of the Internet—crystallized in talk about online games as “electronic opium” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1363461513490626">Golub &amp; Lingley, 2008</xref>, p. 64). Such studies have generally focused on media reports, and there is much work to be done in expanding their insights with survey studies like that of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr147-1363461513490626">Yang and colleagues (2013)</xref> in this special issue, as well as finer grained ethnographic and interview-based research, drawing upon the rich literatures of cultural psychiatry and psychological anthropology.</p>

<p>The Internet has made vast resources of knowledge and opinion available to those able to navigate its shoals. This access to technical information and opinion has altered the dynamics of clinical negotiation. Many patients now arrive at the clinician's office with Internet printouts in hand, requesting a specific treatment that the doctor may not yet have heard about (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-1363461513490626">Heaton, 2010</xref>). This represents a significant change in the availability of the information that constitutes the professional expertise of the clinician. Indeed, it has led to real challenges for health care professions that are based on a model of the caregiver as expert. The accessibility of knowledge and the “flattening” of the knowledge-power hierarchy brought about by the new technologies of information confront psychiatry with a crisis of identity (Rahimi, Hannah, &amp; DelVecchio Good, 2012).</p>
<p>The use of Internet-based health resources has great potential to enhance mental health literacy, promote self-care, and improve health outcomes and well-being (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1363461513490626">Anderson, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1363461513490626">Dey, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr106-1363461513490626">Norman &amp; Skinner, 2006</xref>). Much of the information available on the Internet is of high quality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr118-1363461513490626">Reavley et al., 2012</xref>). However, laypeople may be ill-equipped to judge reliable guidance from idiosyncratic opinion.</p>
<p>The global reach of the Internet makes it a powerful tool for providing resources for rural and remote communities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1363461513490626">Griffiths &amp; Christensen, 2007</xref>). In many regions, small remote communities are the homes of culturally distinctive Indigenous peoples. Internet-based mental health promotion can address some of the basic needs of these communities for information, self-management techniques, and intervention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr148-1363461513490626">Ybarra &amp; Eaton, 2005</xref>). In these settings, Telehealth can provide an important adjunct to local resources and, when coupled with innovative media, can reach a wide audience (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-1363461513490626">Hunter, 2007</xref>). A wide variety of interventions can be delivered through the Internet and other ICTs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr135-1363461513490626">Strecher, 2007</xref>). In this special issue, Johana <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr98-1363461513490626">Monthuy-Blanc and colleagues (2013)</xref> discuss the potential for delivering psychotherapy using videoconferencing to remote Aboriginal communities in Canada.</p>
<p>The potential to access information privately and anonymously makes the Internet a particularly important resource for those coping with the social stigma often associated with mental health problems. There is evidence that Internet users with mental illnesses are more likely than those with nonstigmatized conditions to use the Internet to search for health information or to communicate with care providers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1363461513490626">Berger, Wagner, &amp; Baker, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr82-1363461513490626">Leach, Christensen, Griffiths, Jorm, &amp; Mackinnon, 2007</xref>). However, because Internet use requires technical skills, the reliance on web-based resources may aggravate existing disparities in access to health information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr104-1363461513490626">Neter &amp; Brainin, 2012</xref>).</p>
    <p>A growing body of research documents the impact of Internet-based technologies on clinicians (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr115-1363461513490626">Pluye, Grad, Dunikowski, &amp; Stephenson, 2005</xref>; West &amp; Miller, 2009). Internet-based communication strategies offer many advantages for clinical information exchange. First, they allow for networking, creating links between community groups, clinicians, and government organizations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr102-1363461513490626">Murero &amp; Rice, 2006</xref>). Secondly, they allow for much wider accessibility, making these materials and tools available in rural or remote locations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-1363461513490626">Hunter, 2007</xref>). At the same time, the flexibility of an electronically based resource can facilitate local cultural adaptation. For example, the same basic information structure can be recreated in multiple languages or with multimedia adjuncts that improve access to those with low levels of literacy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1363461513490626">Boiko, Katon, Guerra, &amp; Mazzoni, 2005</xref>).</p>

<p>The Internet provides us with new media, new connectivity, and new terrain to explore and colonize. This is coupled with new modes of self expression and participation afforded by specific types of social media, ranging from the instant correspondence of e-mail and the narrative of Facebook, to the monologues of personal blogs, the pseudo-aphorisms of Twitter, and the visual exuberance of YouTube. The Internet allows for new kinds of social amplification, in which videos produced by an adolescent in their bedroom can “go viral” with millions of viewers and sometimes translate into fame and fortune. At the virtual Hyde Park corner, anyone who has the energy and garrulousness can grab the electronic megaphone of the Internet and be heard far beyond what would previously have been possible. The linking of mobile telecommunications and recording devices to the Internet allows new forms of instant documentation and reporting that can challenge forces of repression and become tools to promote accountability and social change. However, these tools are also often regulated and controlled by powers beyond the individual or local community, and so can be used to silence and repress or to spread disinformation with potentially devastating effects.</p>
<p>The Internet is growing in scale and complexity, prompting some to herald the emergence not only of a global village (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr90-1363461513490626">Malamud, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr94-1363461513490626">McLuhan &amp; Powers, 1989</xref>), but a global consciousness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1363461513490626">Chorost, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr83-1363461513490626">Lévy, 1997</xref>). By 2007, all the general-purpose computers in the world computed 6.4 × 10<sup>18</sup> instructions per second—the same order of magnitude as the rate of nerve impulses within a single human brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-1363461513490626">Hilbert &amp; Lopez, 2011</xref>). Indeed, the emergence of consciousness within the Internet itself is a recurrent theme in science fiction. In David <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1363461513490626">Brin's novel <italic>Earth</italic> (1990)</xref>, for example, the planet itself becomes a sentient being able to protect its own welfare. More recently, Robert <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr122-1363461513490626">Sawyer (2009)</xref> has written a trilogy in which the Internet becomes self-aware and linked to human consciousness through a computerized visual prosthesis for a blind girl. The resultant web-mind intervenes to save humanity from itself. Whereas the Cold War visions of sentient machines generally ushered in the apocalypse, many of these newer visions herald a utopian world in which a benevolent consciousness that shares our ethical and aesthetic values solves many of our pressing problems. This utopian view echoes the vision of the Christian mystic Teilhard De Chardin who saw the emergence of a noosphere, a collective intelligence that represented humanity's capacity for self-transcendence.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-1363461513490626">6</xref></sup></p>
<p>The power and ubiquity of the Internet and ICTs transforms the meanings of culture in the contemporary world with implications for mental health and illness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1363461513490626">Barak, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr128-1363461513490626">Silver &amp; Massanari, 2006</xref>). To explore this new terrain, cultural psychiatry requires new theoretical models and research methodologies that include digital ethnography (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1363461513490626">Boellstorff, Nardi, Pearce, Taylor, &amp; Marcus, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1363461513490626">Burnett, Consalvo, &amp; Ess, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1363461513490626">Coleman, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr96-1363461513490626">Miller &amp; Horst, 2012</xref>). The issue at hand is not that the Internet will become self-aware but that our own awareness and self-understanding may be inadequate to comprehend and anticipate the consequences of this medium, which gives rise to new aesthetics, ethics, and politics. There are the effects of technology we intend and others that come along unbidden, creating new problems and predicaments as well as possibilities. Psychiatry must work with the social sciences to understand and engage these new forms of networking, knowledge production, identity and community which are changing the meanings of culture itself.</p>
