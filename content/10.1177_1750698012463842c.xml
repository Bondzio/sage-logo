<p>The results of more than three decades of fieldwork, <italic>They Say in Harlan County</italic> is a broadly chronological account of the history of Harlan County, Kentucky, from frontier settlement in the late eighteenth century to post-industrial community in the twenty first century. Like many histories of this storied place, located in the Appalachian region of the eastern United States, it pivots around, on one hand, the relentless exploitation of Harlan’s land and people, and on the other, the diverse ways individuals and communities have fought back–and sometimes submitted or simply coped—with this exploitation. What distinguishes this work from other histories of the region is, as the title suggests, its reliance on oral history to define and carry the story forward.</p>
<p>But <italic>They Say</italic> is no simple compilation of memories. Nor is it a paean to the heroic labor struggles of Harlan coal miners during the twentieth century, whose radicalism Portelli readily admits first drew him to the region, or a panegyric to the very real grit and determination of Harlan’s residents. Underlying the individual interview excerpts, giving the book a narrative coherence, is Portelli’s critical, if compassionate, intelligence. As he writes, “I saw my task primarily as constructing a coherent discourse and making my point out of the voices of many others. Thus the primary [organizing] principle is that of montage ... or, perhaps more to the point, quilting—a form of bricolage in which a new, significant whole is created out of an array of fragments, bits and pieces” (p. 11). These “bits and pieces” include, primarily, some 160 interviews, most conducted by the author, supplemented by, among other sources, published histories, newspaper stories, government documents, and song lyrics.</p>
<p>The “new significant whole” Portelli creates is as much grounded in a literary as an historical sensibility. There is, first of all, the way the “action” of the book, whether of singular events or everyday life, advances in novelistic fashion, through a succession of quotations, sometimes as long as a paragraph or two, sometimes as a rapid fire series of single sentences. Differing experiences and points of view are juxtaposed: Portelli often shows rather than tells, and the reader gets the point. Then, there are the quoted interviews themselves, well edited but still rendered in the rich vernacular speech of Appalachia. Even in print, one can “hear” the rhythm of the spoken word.</p>
<p>But equally, there is Portelli’s voice as literary scholar—he is professor of American literature at the University of Rome-LaSapienza—as he deftly deconstructs the language of both oral and written texts. Among the most original and thoughtful sections of the book is his discussion of the highly emotional evangelical Protestantism to which many in the region adhere. While representing the views of believers with respect and apparent integrity (and, it must be said, the occasional flash of impatience of a nonbeliever), he also assesses the language of religion in metaphorical terms. Writing of the snake handling practiced in some worship services, he understands the Biblical injunction to “take up serpents” this way: “[In Appalachia] snakes retain their deadly power: the danger is the thing. Perhaps, by taking up serpents and juggling them around, worshipers express and exorcise the awareness of daily danger by literally taking death and life in their own hands” (p. 89). Similarly, he reflects on the significance of the use of the passive voice in some narrative accounts and on the repeated use of “I don’t know” in response to questions about the US invasion of Iraq and penetrates the assumptions underlying notions of “the culture of poverty,” which has shaped much of the scholarship on Appalachia, and stereotypes of Harlan as “backwards,” populated by “hillbillies.”</p>
<p>It is his attunement to the narrative, and hence symbolic dimensions of oral history, that has opened up Portelli’s understanding of an oral history interview as an act of memory—and its counterpoint, forgetting. His theoretical essays, collected in <italic>The Death of Luigi Trastulli and Other Stories: Form and Meaning in Oral History</italic> (1991) and <italic>The Battle of Valle Giulia: Oral History and the Art of Dialogue</italic> (1997), have arguably done more than any other work in the field to reorient an understanding of oral history as not so much an accumulation of facts, to be assessed as true or false, but as deeply personal efforts to remember the past in ways that are meaningful to the narrator in the present. His statement in the first of these volumes that in an interview “errors, inventions, and myths lead us through and beyond facts to their meanings” has become something of a mantra among oral historians.</p>
<p><italic>They Say</italic> includes little of this theorizing about memory, although one does find evidence of the fieldwork encounters that informed Portelli’s earlier essays. Nor is the book explicitly about the memory of events, as is his previous <italic>The Order Has Been Carried Out: History, Memory, and Meaning of a Nazi Massacre in Rome</italic> (2003). Still, there are moments: conflicting versions of violent union battles of the 1930s through the 1960s are reported, reflected upon, and remain unresolved, for “memory, indeed, is the ultimate site of conflict” (p. 194). The chapter “Harlan on Our Minds” sensitively addresses the Harlan of the imagination, as it is remembered in music and literature.</p>
<p>However, in a larger sense, the book’s gestalt is shaped by memory, the individual memories of narrators and other commentators, and Portelli’s deeply informed efforts to make sense of them. The sense he does make, that “new significant whole,” is very much about trouble, loss, and death. But in a deeply humane final section he speaks of the power of oral history, of storytelling and cultural work in general, to heal “the wounds of the soul” that cut “deeper than broken backs and broken lungs” (pp. 361–62). <italic>They Say in Harlan County</italic> in its rangy, melodious, and insightful 400 plus pages suggests that this just might be true.</p>
