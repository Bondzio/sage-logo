<abstract>
<p><italic>Purpose</italic>: The purpose of the study was to establish normative data on pressure distribution under the feet (plantar pressure) in standing using a free-mapping device and to find out the association of arch type to that of the plantar pressures. <italic>Methods</italic>: A cross-sectional study was carried out among 628 participants aged between 6 and 81 years with no known foot problems or other ailments such as type 2 diabetes or neuropathy, which are known to have an impact on plantar pressures. Plantar pressure measurements were quantitatively recorded using a baropodometric platform (i-Step). <italic>Results</italic>: In both males and females of the specified age-group, metatarsal heads were overloaded in terms of magnitude. Increased overload noted in the static plantar pressure measurement is associated with type of the foot arch and gender. A statistically significant relationship between the pressures of left and right feet, pressures under 2 different areas of foot (forefoot and heel), and the average pressures of both feet was also observed. <italic>Conclusion</italic>: These data could be used to establish age-based normative plantar pressures in the Indian population and provide a basis to assess feet with planus and cavus deformities.</p>

<p>“Knowledge of the pressures under the foot is important in the assessment of various foot pathologies.”</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>The foot is one of the most ergonomically efficient structures of the body that not only sustains enormous pressures generated by dynamic activities but also provides sensory information regarding the contact with the ground.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1938640011434503">1</xref></sup> Knowledge of the pressures under the foot is important in the assessment of various foot pathologies. Study of large groups of asymptomatic feet (normative study) using plantar pressure measurements is fundamental to the understanding of the weight-bearing function of the healthy foot and pathological conditions are better understood.</p>
<p>Pressure distribution measurement techniques are useful in the analysis and understanding the biomechanics of human foot in bipedal standing. Although there have been many reports of normative studies, quantitative studies have produced contradictory results in terms of a “normal” pressure position, pattern, and value. Some investigators found that the heel experienced 2 or 3 times of the forefoot weight<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1938640011434503">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1938640011434503">3</xref></sup> and others found equal load on the heel and the forefoot.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1938640011434503">3</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1938640011434503">5</xref></sup> This controversy may be because of postural sway of the individual subjects due to respiration and heart variability or avoiding occlusion of the blood flow through some regions of the foot.</p>
<p>Although there are studies on normal barefoot standing using different pressure measuring systems, but the standard normal pressure distribution to compare the results is yet to be established. Static studies are quite useful in studying the basic mechanics of lower limb joints, information of prosthesis, leprotic feet, and in many other clinical situations where it is suspected that one foot is weaker than that other or is affected because of changes in the joint.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1938640011434503">6</xref></sup></p>
<p>It has been reported that age-related anatomical and physiological changes in foot bone and ligament structure affect foot pressure distribution during gait<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1938640011434503">7</xref></sup> and age was found to be independently associated with lower pressure under the heel, midfoot, and hallux.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1938640011434503">8</xref></sup> A study on foot arch height revealed that a relationship exists between foot arch height and foot pressure. People with low arched feet have a higher foot pressure when walking barefoot than people with high arched feet.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1938640011434503">2</xref></sup></p>
<p>Researchers such as Craxford et al,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1938640011434503">9</xref></sup> Hughes et al,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1938640011434503">10</xref></sup> Welton,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1938640011434503">11</xref></sup> and Plank<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1938640011434503">12</xref></sup> suggested another normative study using a map of underfoot pressure areas characterized by the site of the peak pressure in the metatarsal region. There is a dearth of literature in normative values within India and considering the spectrum of lifestyle variations within the subcontinent, the present study attempts to establish the normative values for static plantar pressures in the Indian population and assesses the relationship between type of foot arch and foot pressure.</p>

<title>Materials and Methods</title>
<p>A cross-sectional study was carried out in Manipal Hospital, Bengaluru, India to obtain the normative static plantar pressures. There were 628 subjects, aged between 6 and 81 years who participated in this study with no known foot problems or other ailments such as type 2 diabetes or neuropathy, which are known to have an impact on plantar pressures. Plantar pressure measurements were quantitatively recorded using a baropodometric platform (i-Step, Aetrex Inc, Teaaneck, NJ) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1938640011434503">Figure 1</xref>). Gait analysis and one-time barefoot plantar pressure assessment were carried out on the subjects. Height and weight of all the subjects were recorded and all of them were made to fill the information sheet to get the details on the type and preference of footwear used and any present/past injury, which can affect the findings. A video gait analysis was performed on a treadmill to capture the deviations in gait. Foot scanning was done using i-Step scanner under the supervision of a physical therapist.</p>

</fig>
<p>A brief training on how to stand on the scanner and treadmill walking was given 10 minutes before capturing the final readings. Subjects were familiarized with the testing procedure and details of the procedure were explained. The subjects were instructed to look straight ahead while standing on the platform. The subjects were told to stand on the baropodometer with both feet separated, based on their normal style of standing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1938640011434503">Figure 2</xref>). To reduce the error due to posture sway, 3 readings for every individual subject were taken. The most important information such as peak pressure plots were used for interpretation of clinical analysis. Highest pressure in each part of the foot that occurred during any point of the contact was recorded in relation to the reference maximum peak pressure.</p>

<p>The digital baropodometer manufactured by Aetrex Inc was used to collect plantar pressure information (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1938640011434503">Figure 3</xref>). I-Step software maps the entire baropodometry and calculates the value of intensity for every sensor. These values were displayed in terms of absolute pressure at any point (kilograms per sensor). The changes observed in peak plantar pressure of right and left foot were compared with each other and between genders. The forefoot pressures (metatarsal heads) and pressures under the heel were recorded. The forefoot pressures (U max) and heel pressures (L max) were considered for analysis.</p>

<title>Statistical Analysis</title>
<p>Data were explored for outliers, distribution and the normality was tested using the Kolmogorov–Smirnov test. Data were analyzed not only for the association of diabetes to arch type but also to check the difference between the pressures of both feet and at different areas of the individual foot in either gender. The distribution of arch type among males and females was obtained and the differences were tested using χ<sup>2</sup> statistic and Fisher’s exact test if the expected value of a cell was less than 5.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1938640011434503">13</xref></sup> Spearman’s correlation coefficient was calculated to assess the relationship between the pressures of left to right feet and under different areas of the same foot in either gender. The level of significance was fixed at 5%. All the statistical analysis were carried out using the statistical package SPSS for Windows (Version 16.0, SPSS Inc, Chicago, IL).</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>Age of the participants in this study ranged between 6 and 81 years (mean ± SD = 41.53 ± 12.6). Out of 628 participants, 61.62% (n<sub>1</sub> = 387) were males and 38.37% (n<sub>2</sub> = 241) were females. The data were analyzed after grouping them into 4 groups based on the age of the participants (≤20, 21-40, 41-60, and ≥61 years). The number of individuals in these groups were 26 (4.14%), 324 (51.59%), 237 (37.73%), and 41 (6.52%), respectively.</p>
<p>Normality assumption for the plantar pressure variables was checked by using the Kolmogorov–Smirnov test. As the data were not found to be following normal distribution, nonparametric tests were deployed to analyze the data. Findings in this study were considered statistically significant at 5% level of significance.</p>
<p>Distributions of the arch type across different age-groups are presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1938640011434503">Table 1</xref>. Most of the participants in the 21- to 40-year and 41- to 60-year age-groups had medium and high arches on both left and right feet suggesting complete skeletal maturity and the adaptations to the given ages. The incidence of low arched feet was relatively higher in the ≤20-year and ≥61-year age-groups.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The relationship between arch type and peak pressures is not entirely clear from the available literature on foot pressure. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate the effect of arch height and gender on plantar foot pressures in normal subjects.</p>
<p>Measurement of foot pressure distribution is clinically useful because it can identify anatomical foot deformities<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1938640011434503">7</xref></sup> and guide the diagnosis and treatment of gait disorders and falls. Foot pressure data can be collected using different techniques, including the 1-step, 2-step, and the midgait methods. Since the 2-step procedure reduces both the number of steps and the time taken, and has been shown to be reliable when compared with the midgait method,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1938640011434503">14</xref></sup> we opted for this method. The mean of 3 readings was considered, which is in accordance with the findings of Van der Leeden et al,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1938640011434503">15</xref></sup> who found that a minimum of 3 measurements were sufficient to obtain a consistent average.</p>
<p>With regards to pressure distribution, during barefoot standing, most of the studies have indicated controversial results with some researchers showing that the heel bore weight 2 to 3 times the forefoot<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1938640011434503">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1938640011434503">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1938640011434503">16</xref></sup> and others showing that the heel bears a similar load to the forefoot.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1938640011434503">17</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1938640011434503">19</xref></sup> The current study observed moderate correlation between the forefoot and hindfoot pressures, which is in concurrence with the latter group of studies.</p>
<p>We noted that the average pressures of both left and right feet are similar in all the 4 age-groups. This could be because most of the participants loaded symmetrical pressures not only on left and right feet but also under the various areas of the same foot. This deviates from the previous findings where the heel seemed to be bearing more pressure than the forefoot. However, we also observed a statistically significant relationship between the pressures of left and right feet, pressures under 2 different areas of foot (forefoot and heel), and the average pressures of left and right feet. The relationship in the findings explains the symmetrical loading of pressures on both feet and under different zones of the foot.</p>
<p>An extensive literature review has shown that there have been many reports on normative plantar pressure, but quantitative studies have produced contradictory results in terms of a “normal” pressure position, pattern, and value. In addition, there are no established normative plantar pressure studies with which to compare patient data and, thus, analysis of the results is based on the experience of the user.</p>
<p>The incidence of low arched feet was relatively higher in the ≤20-year and ≥61-year age-groups, which could be hypothesized to have relation with the immature skeleton and aging process, respectively. Children whose epiphyses are due to fusion could have paved way for the incidence of low arched feet in participants ≤20 years old. However, the authors could not capture the lifestyle and sporting interests of those young children, which could have an impact on the arch type in early stages of life. Participants in the age-group of ≥ 61 years had very few cases with known injuries to ankle and foot, which could add numbers to the low-arch category. A detailed assessment on the history of musculoskeletal injuries can help answer this observation appropriately.</p>
<p>Few studies reported the association of gender to arch type, but there is a definitive dearth of literature reflecting the association of arch type of the foot to plantar pressure distribution in normal subjects. The current study focused in filling up this gap and concluded that there is a statistically significant association between the 2 variables (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1938640011434503">Table 3</xref>). However, it was interesting to note that a high percentage of the participants in all 4 age-groups had high arches on both feet, which warrants explanation considering the flexibility changes in the tissue with age. The customary practice of barefoot walking within and around the house in south India could be a contributing factor for the presentation of high arches despite advancing age.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>The authors conclude that there are various factors that could influence the pressure loading on feet and can have an impact on the biomechanics of an individual. There is a statistically significant relationship between the pressures of left and right feet, pressures under 2 different areas of foot (forefoot and heel), and the average pressures of both feet.</p>
<p>However, as no detailed measurements were taken of foot alignment, such as forefoot varus, valgus, and first ray mobility, which are very important to explain the variable pressure distribution in normal and diseased subjects, the authors express their limitation and recommend future studies to assess these parameters while capturing data on plantar pressures.</p>
