<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Amyloid precursor protein (APP) and its degradation product amyloid β (Aβ) were previously mostly studied in Alzheimer’s disease (AD), where cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) Aβ levels provide diagnostic information;<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1352458512460603">1</xref></sup> however, the CSF levels of APP metabolites are also altered in other inflammatory conditions of the central nervous system (CNS), such as in Lyme neuroborreliosis, opportunistic cerebral infections in HIV patients, acute bacterial meningitis, systemic lupus erythematosus and multiple sclerosis (MS), where reduced levels of Aβ peptides and of the soluble APP (sAPP) ectodomains, α-sAPP and β-sAPP, are also described.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1352458512460603">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1352458512460603"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1352458512460603"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1352458512460603"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1352458512460603">6</xref></sup> MS is considered an autoimmune disease that eventually, after several years of a relapsing–remitting course, turns into the secondary progression form that possesses neurodegenerative features, and is characterized by slowly-increasing disability.</p>
<p>So far, it is not known what role APP metabolism plays in MS, but it should be noted that cognitive dysfunction is a major and early MS symptom<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1352458512460603">7</xref></sup> and that cognitive and cortical plasticity deficits in MS patients do correlate with low CSF Aβ levels.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1352458512460603">8</xref></sup> High APP immunoreactivity is found in actively demyelinating MS plaques, while chronic lesions possess lower APP immunoreactivity, indicating that there are differences in APP metabolism, across disease stages.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1352458512460603">9</xref></sup> These observations motivate a more thorough investigation of APP metabolism in MS patients.</p>
<p>APP fragments are produced <italic>in vivo</italic>, in the CNS, through the activities of several enzymes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1352458512460603">1</xref></sup> Briefly, α-secretase cuts APP within the Aβ domain in a “non-amyloidogenic” pathway, which inhibits Aβ formation and releases α-sAPP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1352458512460603">Figure 1(a)</xref>). Alternatively, APP may be processed by the β-site APP cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1) and γ-secretase, to release β-sAPP together with different Aβ peptides (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1352458512460603">Figure 1(b)</xref>). In a convergence of the α- and β-secretase pathways, short Aβ peptides are released, including Aβ1–15 and Aβ1–16<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1352458512460603">10</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1352458512460603">Figure 1(c)</xref>). Aβ peptides may also be truncated by other enzymes at its C- or N-terminal portion, producing a large number of possible final Aβ species in the CSF.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1352458512460603">11</xref></sup></p>

<p>(b) APP may be sequentially processed by BACE1 at the N-terminal portion of Aβ and by γ-secretase at the C-terminal. In fact, γ-secretase may cut APP at different positions, producing Aβ peptides with different C-terminal amino acids. Other enzymes are involved in the production of Aβ peptides having other N-terminal amino acids (for example: AβX-42, AβX-40 and AβX-38).</p>
<p>(c) APP may undergo combined α- and β-secretase processing, producing a range of short Aβ peptides.</p>

<p>Herein, we set out to study APP degradation products in the CSF of MS patients at different stages of disease. We used several orthogonal technologies to simultaneously study a large number of APP fragments in the CSF. Specifically, we tested the hypothesis that an effective anti-inflammatory treatment may normalize CSF sAPP and Aβ levels, similarly to what is seen after antibiotic therapy of Lyme neuroborreliosis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1352458512460603">6</xref></sup></p>

<p>CSF AβX-38, AβX-40 and AβX-42 were determined using the MSD Aβ Triplex kit (Human Aβ peptide Ultra-Sensitive Kits), as described by the manufacturer.

CSF Aβ1-42 was determined using the INNO-BIA AlzBio3 kit (Innogenetics, Ghent, Belgium) on the xMAP Luminex platform, as was described previously.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1352458512460603">20</xref></sup></p>
<p>The CSF α-sAPP and β-sAPP were determined using the sAPPα/sAPPβ Multiplex Assay for Meso Scale Discovery (MSD) platform, as described by the manufacturer (MSD, Gaithersburg, MD, USA). This assay employs the 6E10 antibody (epitope within amino acids 3–8 of the Aβ sequence) to capture α-sAPP and a neoepitope-specific antibody to capture β-sAPP. Both species are detected by the SULFO-TAG-labeled anti-APP antibody, p2–1.</p>
<p>We analyzed 13 samples by immunoassay in a second run, due to technical errors in the first run. We included 30 samples from the first run in the second run, to adjust for possible between-run variability. The between-run coefficients of variation (CV) calculated were 16–69%; however, the in-run CV were below 10 %, with the highest variations for α-sAPP and AβX-42. As both run measurements were highly correlated with the 30 control samples, with between-runs coefficients of <italic>R</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1352458512460603">2</xref></sup> = 0.75–0.97 (for AβX-38, AβX-40, AβX-42, Aβ1-42 and α-sAPP), we could construct conversion factors and merge the results. Due to a large between-run variability for β-sAPP (<italic>R</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1352458512460603">2</xref></sup> = 0.24), the results from the second run for this biomarker were excluded (<italic>N</italic> = 4 samples).</p>

<title>Immunoprecipitation and mass spectrometry</title>
<p>To characterize the CSF Aβ peptide pattern, we performed mass spectrometry analyses on a subset of samples where we had sufficient amounts of samples left (10 RRMS patients among those later starting natalizumab treatment, 11 SPMS patients among the untreated patients, and 10 healthy controls, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1352458512460603">Table 1(c)</xref>). These were analyzed using immunoprecipitation (IP) followed by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOFMS), by slightly altering a previously-described method.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1352458512460603">21</xref></sup> Aliquots (4µL/sample) of the monoclonal antibodies called 6E10 and 4G8 were separately added to 50 µl of magnetic beads, coated with sheep anti-mouse IgG (Life technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA) and incubated overnight on a rocking platform at +4°C. Antibody-bead-solutions of 50 μL of 6E10 + 50 μL 4G8 with 10μl 2.5% Tween in phosphate-buffer saline (PBS) were added to the CSF samples (900μL) and IP was conducted during 2 days of incubation. The solution was then transferred to the KingFisher Flex (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA, US) magnetic particle processor, for automatic washing and elution. The collected supernatant was speed-vacuumed until dry and then re-dissolved in 5μL 0.1% formic acid (FA) in 20% acetonitrile. The MALDI samples were prepared by the seed layer method and analyzed by MALDI-TOFMS using a Bruker AUTOFLEX (Bruker Daltonics) operating in the reflectron mode, as described elsewhere.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1352458512460603">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1352458512460603">22</xref></sup> Each spectrum represented an average of 1500 shots.

<p>Skewedness of quantitative variables was tested by the D’Agostino &amp; Pearson omnibus normality test. Normally-distributed quantitative variables were analyzed by paired <italic>t</italic>-test for within-subject comparisons over time; and by unpaired <italic>t</italic>-test and by one-way analysis of variation (ANOVA) with Tukey’s post-hoc test for the between-group comparisons.

For correlation analyses, we used the Spearman’s test, if not stated otherwise. Quantitative data were reported as median (IQR), if not stated otherwise. Tests with a <italic>P-</italic>value ≤ 0.05 indicated statistical significance. We corrected for multiple comparisons using Bonferroni-correction.

This algorithm finds the direction, called score vector, in the multivariate orthogonal space, spanned by biomarkers that give the best separation between the predefined groups. A stepwise variable reduction was performed until only the markers with positive contributions toward the separation were left, as judged by their relative contribution to the model. In order to control for over-fitting, the model was built using data only from the SPMS and control groups, while the RRMS group acted as a predictive set.</p>

<p>To test for possible age-based confounding, we analyzed the correlations between age and biomarkers in the different groups. The only significant correlation found was for age versus α-sAPP in the RRMS group (<italic>R</italic> = 0.30, <italic>P</italic> = 0.026), but as the RRMS patients were of equal age to the controls, we consider it unlikely that age confounded the between-group difference for this biomarker (also, the correlation was not significant after correction for multiple comparisons). In addition, we found no significant differences in biomarker concentrations between males and females within the diagnostic groups, making sex an unlikely confounding factor (data not shown).</p>
<p>In general, all CSF biomarkers correlated strongly to each other within the diagnostic groups, except for Aβ1-42 versus α-sAPP and β-sAPP, in the controls (Supplemental Table 1).</p>

Follow-ups were performed on the 29 RRMS patients who had started natalizumab. In these, measurements of CSF α-sAPP, β-sAPP, AβX-38 and AβX-40 increased after treatment, while there were no changes in AβX-42 nor Aβ1-42 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1352458512460603">Figure 3(a)</xref>). Follow-up was also performed on one RRMS patient and nine SPMS patients starting mitoxantrone at study initiation, yet we found no significant changes in biomarker concentrations after this treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1352458512460603">Figure 3(b)</xref>).</p>

The graphs show that follow-up concentrations normalized in relation to baseline levels (100%).

<p>Because natalizumab-treated patients were younger than the mitoxantrone-treated patients (<italic>P</italic> = 0.03), we first examined the correlations between biomarker changes and age within the groups, to test whether age might confound the results. In the natalizumab-treated group, there was a correlation found, showing that older treated patients had less absolute change in β-sAPP, than younger patients (<italic>R</italic> = -0.41; <italic>P</italic> = 0.03). The age differences seen between the groups may, therefore, partly have influenced the trajectories of β-sAPP in the two treatment groups; however, the overall dynamic biomarker response after natalizumab treatment did not seem to be confounded by age, and the correlation between age and β-sAPP was not significant, after correction for multiple comparisons. There was no significant difference in sex distribution between the treatment groups, making sex an unlikely confounding factor.</p>

<p>We then tested for whether the biomarker changes after natalizumab treatment correlated with any clinical effects. We found negative correlations between relative changes in several of the CSF biomarkers (AβX-38, AβX-40 and α-sAPP) and changes in quantitative measurements of EDSS or MSSS (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1352458512460603">Table 3</xref>). These correlations were not found to be significant, after a conservative correction for multiple comparisons, but were consistent across several biomarkers, plus in several cases came close to the corrected significance limit.</p>
<p>Since only 10 mitoxantrone-treated patients completed the follow-up, and no clear clinical or biochemical effects were seen anyway in that group of patients, we refrained from analyzing any correlations between their responses in the biochemical and clinical variables.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Herein, we confirmed earlier findings that CSF levels of sAPP and Aβ peptides become reduced in MS patients,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1352458512460603">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1352458512460603">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1352458512460603">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1352458512460603">26</xref></sup> and extended the previous data to include AβX-38, AβX-40 and AβX-42. Based on this study and the preceding literature, we propose the hypothesis that CNS APP and Aβ metabolism is ubiquitously changed in neuroinflammation,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1352458512460603">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1352458512460603"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1352458512460603"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1352458512460603"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1352458512460603">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1352458512460603">26</xref></sup> with reduced levels of α-sAPP and β-sAPP as a strong common denominator. Treatment with natalizumab, the potent inhibitor of transmission of immune cells into the CNS, shifted the reduced α-sAPP, β-sAPP, AβX-38 and AβX-40 levels in RRMS patients back toward normal concentrations. We saw the strongest effects with α-sAPP and β-sAPP, as all but 6 of the 29 treated patients exhibited increases in both or one of these, after treatment.</p>
<p>The trajectory of several of the biomarkers seemed to follow changes in the clinical response to natalizumab treatment, as determined by EDSS or MSSS. The correlations between changes in biomarkers and clinical scores were not significant after a conservative Bonferroni-correction for multiple comparisons, but because they were consistent across several biomarkers, and in several cases came close to the corrected significance limit, we still consider it likely that they represent a true underlying biological association. In all, these results suggests that CSF sAPP and Aβ biomarkers may be used as pharmacodynamic markers of treatment effect in MS, as has been suggested for CSF biomarkers in AD.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1352458512460603">1</xref></sup> Our results support a direct link between APP metabolism and Aβ generation to CNS inflammation. The relevance of this in the pathogenesis of other neurological diseases, including AD, has yet to be further studied.</p>
<p>In contrast to the other biomarkers, AβX-42 and Aβ1-42 levels did not increase in RRMS patients treated with natalizumab. Such observed discrepancies imply that specific, and not all, aspects of the APP and Aβ metabolism in MS are affected by anti-inflammatory treatment. The different mechanisms involved may include the production, aggregation, or clearance of peptides from the CNS; however, it should be remembered that Aβ peptides are unlikely to aggregate in MS brains, because amyloid plaques are rare.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1352458512460603">27</xref></sup> Neuronal Aβ release is related to synaptic activity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1352458512460603">28</xref></sup> and CSF Aβ levels correlate to CSF levels of granins, which are released during regulated neuronal secretion.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1352458512460603">29</xref></sup> Hypothetically, the reduced levels of sAPP and Aβ peptides could correspond to reduced neuronal activity. Interestingly, oligodendrocytes initiate myelin formation preferentially on electrically-active axons,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1352458512460603">30</xref></sup> which means that less active neurons may enter a vicious circle of reduced myelination and dysfunction, linking reduced neuronal activity, cognitive dysfunction, demyelination and ultimately, neuronal loss in MS. Our findings were consistent with the hypothesis that neurons are reversibly impaired in the early stages of MS (reflected by reversible reductions in sAPP and Aβ peptides in RRMS patients), but suffer irreversible down-regulation or destruction once in the progressive stage (reflected by irreversible reductions in sAPP and Aβ peptides in the SPMS patients). The reduced sAPP and Aβ levels in severely affected SPMS patients remind us of findings in severely affected patients with other neurodegenerative diseases, where reduced CSF sAPP and Aβ levels are proposed to be related to impaired neuronal activity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1352458512460603">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1352458512460603">32</xref></sup> Finally, the disturbed APP metabolism in MS may be related to BACE1 activity, which is important for myelination.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1352458512460603">33</xref></sup> The remyelination of MS lesions is limited. We previously found signs that there is reduced BACE1 activity in MS patients.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1352458512460603">5</xref></sup></p>
<p>In this study, we present the first characterization by mass spectrometry of a large number of CSF Aβ species in MS patients. Unfortunately, a lack of samples limited this to a small number of subjects, and so this section of the study must be considered as a pilot experiment. The combined pattern of Aβ peptide allowed us to distinguish between controls and SPMS patients, with RRMS patients having an intermediate pattern. This suggests that the CSF Aβ profile is dynamically altered during the MS process (this was also supported by negative correlations between disease scores and biomarkers, as determined by immunoassays).</p>
<p>Together with previous reports, this study illustrates the complexities of APP metabolism in neuroinflammation. Further studies are needed to increase our understanding of the role of APP metabolism in MS, as well as of the utility of an array of CSF biomarkers in MS.</p>
