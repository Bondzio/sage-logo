<sec id="section1-1071100712460366">
<title>Background:</title>
<p>The objective of the present study was to explore the effects of deficiencies in glucose regulation on the onset, regression, and block performance times in a group of patients with diabetes-related foot problems.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-1071100712460366">
<title>Methods:</title>
<p>Forty-eight patients with American Society of Anesthetists physical status 2-4 undergoing foot and ankle surgery with a popliteal fossa block were prospectively studied. Patients were stratified into cohorts based on 3 groups according to their HbA1c levels: group 1 (n = 15), HbA1c 5%-6%; group 2 (n = 16), HbA1c 7%-8%; group 3 (n = 17), HbA1c 9%-10%. A standardized local anesthetic mixture containing 10 mL of 2% prilocaine and 10 mL of 0.5% levobupivacaine was used in all study groups. The primary outcome of the study was the time for regression of the sensory block.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-1071100712460366">
<title>Results:</title>
<p>The onset times of sensory and motor blocks in group 3 were significantly longer than those in groups 2 and 1. Motor block regression time differed significantly between groups (<italic>P</italic> = .04), being longer in group 3 compared with group 1. In group 3, the sensory block regression time and the time of first analgesic use were significantly longer than the times in groups 1 and 2.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1071100712460366">
<title>Conclusions:</title>
<p>We found that sensory block regression time was longer in diabetic patients with poor glycemic control than in the patients with better glycemic control. Longer block performance time, probably due to reduction in sensory and motor conduction velocity in diabetic patients with poor glycemic control, should be taken into consideration when peripheral nerve blocks are used.</p>

<body>
<p>Patients with longstanding diabetes mellitus (DM) are likely to have multiple organ system failure. Diabetic damage becomes manifest in macroangiopathy as coronary artery disease, peripheral artery occlusive disease, or cerebrovascular insufficiency, and damage becomes manifest as microangiopathy in nephropathy and neuropathy.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1071100712460366">11</xref></sup> Polyneuropathy occurs in 5% to 80% of patients with DM. Worsening nerve function due to DM can be demonstrated before the development of diabetic polyneuropathy. El-Salem et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1071100712460366">4</xref></sup> recently showed that nerve conduction abnormalities commonly exist in diabetic patients in the subclinical stages of polyneuropathy and that abnormalities are highly correlated to glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) levels in a group of patients with DM. The severity of polyneuropathy depends on the duration of the illness and the degree of glycemic control. The American Diabetes Association states that HbA1c should be less than 7%.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1071100712460366">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>Diabetic foot problems often require surgical management. Although performing peripheral nerve block in diabetic patients who have peripheral neuropathy is controversial,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1071100712460366">6</xref></sup> the impact of DM on the practice of peripheral nerve blocks has not been fully evaluated. Lindström et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1071100712460366">12</xref></sup> showed delayed recovery of nerve conduction and vibratory sensibility after ischemic block in patients with DM compared with age-matched controls.</p>
<p>In animal studies of diabetic rat models, neuropathy induced by galactosemia showed that histopathological changes in experimental galactose neurotoxicity matched the histopathological changes found in sural nerve biopsies of humans with diabetic neuropathy.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1071100712460366">8</xref></sup> Kalichman and Calcutt<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1071100712460366">7</xref></sup> showed that more concentrated local anesthetic induced significantly more edema in diabetic nerves than in controls in a rat model of streptozotocin-induced neuropathy.</p>
<p>Peripheral nerve blocks in diabetic patients with impaired nerve conduction require less anesthetic to produce anesthesia and are more difficult when one is performing a peripheral nerve block using a nerve stimulator.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1071100712460366">20</xref></sup></p>
<p>To the best of our knowledge there has been no study investigating the effect of HbA1c levels on onset, regression, and block performance times in peripheral nerve blocks in the literature. Therefore, we hypothesized that elevated HbA1c levels would correlate with the presence of peripheral nerve dysfunction and that this would prolong regression time of sensory block. To test this hypothesis, we compared regression time of sensory block between 3 groups of patients with diabetic foot problems with high or normal HbA1c levels in the popliteal approach of sciatic nerve block. The primary outcome of the study was to determine the time for regression of sensory block.</p>
<sec id="section6-1071100712460366" sec-type="methods">
<title>Methods</title>
<p>The sample consisted of 48 patients with American Society of Anesthetists (ASA) physical status 2-4, aged between 18 and 75 years, who underwent foot or ankle surgery for diabetic foot problems in the Department of Orthopedics and Traumatology of Ege University School of Medicine. Patients were stratified into cohorts based on their HbA1c levels: group 1 (n = 15), HbA1c 5%-6% (normal glycemic control); group 2 (n = 16), HbA1c 7%-8% (worse glycemic control); group 3 (n = 17), HbA1c 9%-10% (the worst glycemic control). Exclusion criteria of the study included absence of patient consent, presence of a neuromuscular disease, known allergy to local anesthetic, presence of a coagulation disorder, and presence of an infection at the site of operation. The anesthesiologists who performed the block and did the assessment were blind to the groups of the patients. The study was started on February 1, 2010, and ended on September 30, 2010. Power analysis required 15 patients in each group; therefore, the study started enrolling the patients on February 1 and continued until there were at least 15 patients in each group. The Ethics Committee of Ege University School of Medicine approved the study. All patients gave written informed consent.</p>
<p>In the operating room, an 18G intravenous catheter was placed in the arm opposite to the surgical site, and midazolam 0.03 mg/kg was given intravenously as a premedication. Standard monitoring, including noninvasive arterial blood pressure, heart rate, and pulse oximetry, was used throughout the operation and the block procedure. An experienced anesthetist skilled in regional anesthesia techniques performed all blocks. The second author of the study, who was blinded to the study groups, performed the measurements.</p>
<p>For patients in all groups, the popliteal fossa crease, the tendon of the biceps femoris muscle (lateral), and the tendons of the semitendinosus and semimembranosus muscles (medial) were identified for insertion. The needle was inserted at a point 7 cm proximal to the knee flexion crease, between the tendons of the semitendinosus and biceps femoris muscles. A nerve stimulator was used for nerve location (Stimuplex, HNS 11, B. Braun Medical, Melsungen, Germany) with a 100-mm-long, 21G, short-beveled, Teflon-coated stimulating needle (Stimuplex, B. Braun Medical). A pulse duration of 0.1 milliseconds, current intensity of 1 mA, and frequency of 2 Hz were used for the stimulator. The 2 components of the sciatic nerve were identified according to their specific muscular responses (as foot plantar flexion and inversion for the tibial nerve and as foot dorsiflexion and eversion for the common peroneal nerve). After the appropriate response, the current was decreased to 0.5 mA. The correct needle position was confirmed if the nerve response faded at lower current intensities. A standardized local anesthetic mixture containing 10 mL of 2% prilocaine and 10 mL of 0.5% levobupivacaine (total volume 20 mL: 10 mL for tibial nerve and 10 mL for peroneal nerve) was used in all study groups.</p>
<p>The recorded data were as follows: block performance time (from time of injection of local anesthetic after insertion of the Stimuplex needle into the skin to the motor response and the withdrawal of the needle), onset time of the sensory block, onset time of the motor block, and the block regression time (time between the onset of sensory block and feeling pain on the operated limb).</p>
<p>Assessment for sensory and motor block was established every minute during 30 minutes after the local anesthetic injection. Both sensory and motor blocks were evaluated for each sciatic branch (tibial nerve and peroneal nerve) by the second author of the study, who was blinded to the groups. For the assessment of sensory function, a 22G needle was touched to the plantar skin (tibial) and dorsal skin (peroneal) of the foot as the pinprick test. The level of the sensation was evaluated as follows: 0 = no sensation, 1 = decreased sensation, 2 = normal sensation. The level of the motor blockade was evaluated as follows: 0 = muscle strength, 1 = incomplete motor block (minor movements of the toes or ankle), 2 = complete block. Patients who had normal sensation and normal muscle strength received general anesthesia. Patients with incomplete sensory or motor blocks and patients with pain were given fentanyl first. If the patients had complaints after fentanyl administration, they were converted to general anesthesia. The second author of the study made the decision to give fentanyl and to convert to general anesthesia.</p>
<p>Once the peripheral block was performed, patient demographics (age, sex, height, weight, body mass index, ASA physical status, type of operation, length of diabetes, insulin use, presence of diabetic neuropathy, HbA1c level) were recorded on a peripheral block follow-up sheet. Patient satisfaction was assessed using a scale whereby patients graded the block as 1 = very satisfied (did not feel anything), 2 = satisfied (felt touches but were not uncomfortable), 3 = moderately satisfied (felt pain at the beginning but not later), and 4 = unsatisfied (felt a lot of pain, general anesthetic).</p>
<p>To assess the block performance, the anesthesiologist who was blinded to the patient groups graded the block as 1 = excellent, accomplished in first attempt; 2 = good, accomplished in a couple of attempts; 3 = moderate, block was very difficult (nerve responses were weak, responses were obtained by increasing the current flow); and 4 = bad, general anesthesia should have been performed rather than nerve block (no motor nerve response).</p>
<p>The sensory and motor onset times of the block as well as the duration times and the perioperative need for supplemental intravenous fentanyl or general anesthesia were recorded. The patients’ complaints related to a nerve injury, such as hypoesthesia and motor weakness, and their replies regarding satisfaction about the anesthetic technique were recorded 24 hours after the operation and on day 7 during postoperative phone calls. Complications related to the block such as hypotension, arrhythmia, nausea, vomiting, and convulsion were recorded.</p>
<sec id="section7-1071100712460366">
<title>Statistics</title>
<p>Data were analyzed using SPSS 16.0 for Windows (SPSS Inc, Chicago, Illinois). Significance was assumed at <italic>P</italic> &lt; .05. In the current study, our primary outcome was sensory block regression time. We predicted a 25% to 30% increase in terms of sensory block regression time in group 2 and group 3 compared with group 1. Therefore, to reach a statistically significant difference between the 3 groups, sample size was calculated by accepting an alpha risk of 5% and a power (1 – β) of 80%. From this calculation, 15 subjects in each group were found to be necessary for a significant difference.</p>
<p>The Shapiro-Wilks test was used to determine normal distribution, differences between groups were evaluated by an analysis of variance for normally distributed variables, and a Bonferroni correction was also applied. For abnormal distribution, Kruskal-Wallis and Mann-Whitney <italic>U</italic> tests were used. Nominal and ordinal variables were gathered in tables according to the groups, and a chi-square test was applied. Statistical significance was established at <italic>P &lt;</italic> .05.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>During the course of the study, 55 patients underwent foot or ankle surgery for diabetic foot problems. Six patients refused to participate in the study. One patient was excluded for anticoagulant medication use. A total of 48 patients were included in the study. General anesthesia had to be induced in one patient in group 2 and in two patients in group 3 as a result of unsuccessful block.</p>
<p>There were no statistically significant differences in demographic data between 3 groups except duration of diabetes mellitus (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1071100712460366">Table 1</xref>).</p>

<p>Comparison of group 2 and group 3.</p>

</table-wrap-foot>
</table-wrap>
<p>Motor block regression time differed significantly between groups (<italic>P</italic> = .04), being longer in group 3 compared with group 1 (<italic>P</italic> = .04).</p>
<p>Statistically significant differences also appeared in sensory block regression time and the time for first analgesic requirement between 3 groups (<italic>P</italic> = .004 and <italic>P</italic> = .006, respectively). In group 3, the sensory block regression time and the time for first analgesic requirement were significantly longer than those in group 1 and group 2 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1071100712460366">Table 2</xref>).</p>
<p>The block was unsuccessful in two patients in group 3 and in one patient in group 2 because of absence of nerve motor response with the nerve stimulator. These patients were given general anesthesia. Two patients in group 3, one patient in group 1, and one patient in group 2 were administered 0.05 mg fentanyl and 1 mg midazolam intravenously for tourniquet pain during the operation because of incomplete block. One patient in group 3 developed paresthesia during the block. Sensory block regression time of this patient was 13 hours, but there was no neurological deficit during follow-up. The patients did not develop neurological or hemodynamic complications such as bradycardia, arrhythmia, or hypotension.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In this study, we explored the relationship between the glycemic control and peripheral nerve block. The most important findings of this study were (a) sensory block regression time was longer among patients with poor glycemic control (group 3) compared with the other 2 groups of patients with better glycemic control; (b) the onset times of sensory and motor block were longer in group 3 compared with other groups; and (c) the peripheral block performance time in group 3 was longer compared with the other groups.</p>
<p>Long-term micro- and macrovascular complications of diabetes have been held responsible for the majority of mortality and morbidity of diabetes. Studies have shown that glycemic control is directly related to the risk of development and progression of microvascular complications (retinopathy, nephropathy, and neuropathy) in patients with type 1 and type 2 diabetes. Glycosylated hemoglobin was used to measure glycemic control.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1071100712460366">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1071100712460366">19</xref></sup></p>
<p>Perkins and colleagues<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1071100712460366">13</xref></sup> followed sensory and motor polyneuropathy for a year in diabetic and nondiabetic patient groups and found that a decrease in the glycosylated hemoglobin level was associated with significant improvement in sensory nerve conduction.</p>
<p>Proposed mechanisms for nerve injury due to peripheral nerve blockade include transient or permanent nerve damage due to the needle or catheter insertion, inadvertent injection of the local anesthetic into the nerve, addition of vasoconstricting agents such as epinephrine to local anesthetics, secondary nerve damage as a result of compression due to hematoma, and direct toxicity of the local anesthetic.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1071100712460366">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1071100712460366">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1071100712460366">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1071100712460366">16</xref></sup></p>
<p>Gebhard and colleagues<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1071100712460366">5</xref></sup> carried out a retrospective study in which they reviewed the records of 1858 diabetic and nondiabetic patients who underwent supraclavicular brachial plexus block with the paresthesia method. The investigators found that the success of the nerve block was higher in diabetic patients compared with nondiabetic patients independent of body mass index.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1071100712460366">5</xref></sup> The authors attributed this finding to increased sensitivity of nerve fibers to local anesthetics in diabetic patients and to decreased response to surgical stimulation in the surgical field in patients with diabetic neuropathy. Kroin and colleagues<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1071100712460366">10</xref></sup> demonstrated that the duration of sciatic nerve block with local anesthetics is longer in diabetic rats versus nondiabetic rats. In addition, delayed recovery of nerve conduction and vibratory sensibility after ischemic block in patients with DM compared with age-matched controls was shown by Lindström et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1071100712460366">12</xref></sup></p>
<p>Our finding of prolonged sensory regression time in patients with poor glycemic control (group 3) compared with patients with better glycemic control (group 1 and group 2) is consistent with existing findings obtained from animal and human studies. We also found that block performance and block onset times were longer in patients with poor glycemic control (group 3). Moreover, in the postoperative period, the pain-free period was longer among patients in this group. This finding might be explained by slow nerve conduction velocity as a result of loss of myelinated fibers and demyelination due to diabetic neuropathy.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1071100712460366">20</xref></sup></p>
<p>The block was unsuccessful in one patient in group 2 and in two patients in group 3 because motor nerve responses could not be elicited. We suggest that unsuccessful nerve block in a total of three patients in this study might be related to decreasing sensory and motor responses of nerves due to the axonal degeneration that occurs in diabetic neuropathy.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1071100712460366">19</xref></sup> More recently, with the help of ultrasound (ultrasonogram) during peripheral nerve block, it has been possible to avoid intraneural injections of local anesthetics and increase the success of the nerve block, especially in diabetic patients, due to decreased sensory conduction velocity and amplitude.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1071100712460366">17</xref></sup></p>
<p>Kalichman and Calcutt<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1071100712460366">7</xref></sup> performed sciatic nerve block using high-dose lidocaine in rats and reported that nerve damage in diabetic rats exceeded that in nondiabetic rats. Furthermore, the investigators noted prolongation of block performance time related to the nerve damage in diabetic rats. In addition, Kocum et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1071100712460366">9</xref></sup> obtained adequate surgical anesthesia in their case series of patients with diabetic nephropathy with lower doses of local anesthetic. Therefore, we used a smaller amount of local anesthetic (20 mL of 0.5% levobupivacaine) in the current study in order to minimize the nerve damage secondary to local anesthetics in diabetic patients.</p>
<p>Rigaud and colleagues<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1071100712460366">14</xref></sup> showed that when nerve block was performed with nerve stimulation in diabetic dogs, an electrical current level below 0.5 mA resulted in an increase in intraneural injection. In the present study, even though the nerve stimulation current was kept at 0.5 mA, one patient in group 3 experienced long-lasting paresthesia, probably as a result of intraneural injection.</p>
<p>The results of the present study are difficult to generalize given the small sample size. The absence of comparisons between diabetic and nondiabetic patients and absence of confirmation of the nerve damage by electromyography are other limitations of this study.</p>
<p>Even though a control group consisting of nondiabetic patients was not included, patients diagnosed with diabetes were divided into 3 groups with regard to HbA1c levels and these groups were compared with each other. We believe the results of the study were reliable because 2 anesthesiologists participated in the study and were blind to the groups.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>We found that sensory block regression time was longer in diabetic patients with poor glycemic control than in the patients with better glycemic control. Longer block performance time due to possible reduction in sensory and motor conduction velocity in diabetic patients with poor glycemic control should be taken into consideration when applying peripheral nerve blocks.</p>
