<p>Scene 1: A sauna in Budapest. A child of about 7 years old enters and sits down, at which an ill-natured, disdainful adult makes a snide remark: “I wouldn’t have thought they’d allow children here!” The kid replies, “Indeed, I’ve read the information on the wall outside. Children are allowed to enter, but may only sit in the bottom row so as to avoid any possible harmful effects on their health. That’s why I’m sitting down here. May I turn over and start the hour-glass?” Isn’t this beautiful? The child first embarrassed its partner with a level of knowledge unheard of by the latter, then steps out of the role of the child and plays a different game—He obliges the person who just a minute before had tried to humiliate him. He is a genius of communication (based on <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://csermelyblog.tehetsegpont.hu/node/233">http://csermelyblog.tehetsegpont.hu/node/233</ext-link>).</p>
<p>Scene 2: A chemistry competition in Karcag, a small town. Teams of 10- to 12-year-old children are sitting at the tables and solving problems. There is only one child who just cannot sit still—He sits, and then practically lies on the table and wriggles in extraordinary positions, but all this time, does not let his eyes stray from the task. As chairman of the judges, I say to myself, “Well, well! Let’s see what will become of this!” Naturally, it was this child’s team who happened to win the competition and the contribution of that particular child happened to be highly important (based on <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://csermelyblog.tehetsegpont.hu/node/233">http://csermelyblog.tehetsegpont.hu/node/233</ext-link>).</p>
<p>The real challenge is to see value that is not yet in its true form. Becoming gifted is a process, during which characteristics of giftedness are present throughout, but not necessarily in forms that are perceptible or acceptable in that environment. Giftedness does not hide itself; it is only hidden to the extent that the environment believes it to be.</p>
<p>Giftedness is naturally present in everyday life but is easily pigeonholed based on superficial criteria. If the abilities of a person are more obvious, then his or her idiosyncratic habits are more easily accepted than in the case where abilities that lead to achievements are not as clearly observable. The latter kind of gifted individual presents the real challenge.</p>
<p>Observation is the best way to identify the gifted. I suggest the following truly precise definition of giftedness for observation-based identification—A gifted individual is an individual with great knowledge and the habits of a preschool child—which means activeness, questions, a naïve openness to the world, and strong goal-orientedness.</p>
<p>The two children from the stories above might not qualify for the category of giftedness on a standardized method of gifted identification. Of course, this would not necessarily hinder them, except if the environment created obstacles to their unique solutions and labeled their unconventional behavior and idiosyncratic development as a disorder instead of accepting it and paving their way toward achievements.</p>

<title>One Hundred Years of Gifted Education in Hungary</title>
<p>The beginning of the 20th century was a success story for Hungarian gifted education. Outstanding teachers and their students have reached outstanding achievements through gifted education that is linked to everyday education. Their methods and ideas are durable and are therefore worth recalling.</p>
<p>László Rátz (1863-1930) was a teacher of legendary fame of the Fasor Evangelical High School in Budapest. He taught some outstanding mathematicians, physicists, and chemists. Excellent minds were educated under him such as Nobel Prize-winning physicist Eugene Wigner, mathematician John von Neumann (founder of the field of game theory among other accomplishments), as well as Nobel Prize-winning economist John Harsányi.</p>
<p>Professor Rátz was one of the great reformers of Hungarian mathematical education. In 1906, he founded the Reform Committee of Mathematics together with Manó Beke and Sándor Mikola, among others. The committee declared that there are certain aspects of mathematics that are acquired subconsciously and these should be reinforced in the learner. The learning of mathematics should be full of direct experiences and doing a lot of measurements. They stressed the importance of mental arithmetic and of practicing estimating. The essence of this way of education, which begat Nobel laureates, is that learning requires facts to be built on practical experience, as well as the development and constant use of thinking abilities, and the development of a good sense of judgment and its utilization in the thinking process.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0162353212471587">Elek Szitnyai (1904)</xref>, a teacher at a main high school of Budapest, observed that school can provide nourishment only to a small part of the talents. “A lot of textbooks are a veritable outrage and an attack against children’s intellects.” Certain hidden talents are unable to manifest themselves in absence of certain highly beneficial effects. Therefore, every possible step should be taken to provide nourishment and a space for functioning to true and deserving talents. Often the greatest obstacle to this is ignorance and envy. The young literary historian <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0162353212471587">Jenő Dóczy (1910)</xref>, in his 1910 book <italic>Talent and School</italic>, already argued that only education that individualizes instruction can be eventually effective, which takes into consideration quantitative and qualitative differences between individual abilities.</p>
<p>Psychologist Géza Révész regarded the study of all possible aspects of talents as one of the prime issues of future pedagogy and psychology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0162353212471587">Révész, 1918</xref>). In line with the spirit of his era, he regarded intelligence as the chief criterion of talent, but he also saw the problems of defining intelligence. He believed that no intelligence test titled prognostic statements on the presence and possible future development of talent. Far beyond his time, Révész regarded intuition, spontaneity, and behavior relating to things, human activities, and creations as more characteristic of talent than intelligence. These characteristics, however, are even less tangible than intelligence and even more difficult to assess, which is why he considered observations based on previous experience with talent important along with the measurement of intelligence.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0162353212471587">László Nagy (1930)</xref>, similar to Révész, also regarded character and strength of will as important criteria in addition to abilities, as lack of these led to a talent being lost or never developed. He considered individual treatment the best solution, because “children are not grains of wheat in a bushel.” Their differences should be taken into consideration in education and “the iron clamps of uniformity” should be loosened. He championed the cause of taking the spontaneous interests of the child maximally into consideration in education and teaching. Beside this, he emphasized that different education and learning materials should be provided to different types of talent.</p>
<p>This was the approach that Hungarian gifted education was based on when it began in the 1920s and 1930s. The so-called talent exam—which primarily had its roots in the city of Sárospatak in the northeastern part of Hungary—favored ability and the greatness and flexibility of the mind rather than ready knowledge. The most typical institution of the second phase of the gifted protection movement was the boarding school system in Sárospatak. Lodgers of these attic rooms were the most excellent students in the city. This was one of the prototypical systems in Hungary for talent-based selection. All students, whether talented or not, learned together, while the talented ones also lived together. This way, they were aware of the value of their abilities, but also of the possibility of reaching an even higher level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0162353212471587">Harsányi, 1994</xref>). Their way of life made it possible to educate each other. The teachers didn’t need to press these youths to learn. The success of the Sárospatak method brought about the foundation of similar institutions, which were supported by the Reformed Church and the state. A significant amount of state money was set aside in 1941 for saving talents this way.</p>
<p>These were, however, the last days of gifted education based on the Sárospatak boarding school model, and, in fact, of Hungarian gifted education itself. By raising the school-leaving age to 16 years in 1948, the state considered support for the gifted solved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0162353212471587">Harsányi, 1994</xref>). Up until the 1980s, Hungarian gifted education took on an underground character. Gifted education was carried out in specialized classes and secretly elite high schools and was present in everyday education primarily as a result of the effort of some excellent teachers. Officially, however, it didn’t exist during this period, as individualization did not fit in with the received political view.</p>
<p>The newly evolving gifted education has to find the best options for developing a background for the gifted during the value crisis that arose at the start of the third millennium. After a long period of forbidden differentiation and elitism, it is difficult to find a balance between gifted education within everyday teaching and a special provision for the gifted as a developmental environment for the already manifest talent.</p>

<title>The Current Approach to Giftedness in Hungary</title>
<sec id="section3-0162353212471587">
<title>The Conception of Giftedness and the Development of the Gifted</title>
<p>In Hungarian gifted education, two approaches have been and are present simultaneously: one approach—that is often accused of elitism—which favors separate provision for the gifted, and a second approach that aims to reform education and promotes the inclusion of support for the gifted in the process of education through attention to the individual.</p>
<p>The view of giftedness currently still prominent in Hungary is the ideal of the 20th century, that is, the school talent, who learns his or her lessons and is tests well. A great part of the population who are identified as gifted comes from middle class students (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0162353212471587">Hatvani, 2011</xref>) who perform well in competitions. Children from a favorable family background are at an advantage, as selection is, in most cases, not preceded by wide-scale gifted education, which would increase the manifestation chances of gifted children with no effective background for development. Selection often begins as early as preschool age, although gifted children are typically chosen for gifted education classes at the age of about 10 years. One of the most prominent forms of this approach is the “Debrecen Paradigm” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0162353212471587">Pappné Gyulai &amp; Pakurár, 2011</xref>). In the Debrecen Paradigm, gifted children are identified early to be placed in special classes.</p>
<p>The easiest way to select children for gifted programs is to select those who have already demonstrated ability, but this comes at the price of rejecting many children who have potential but who have not yet demonstrated ability. Pursuing fast achievements results in the loss of many real talents and makes the evolution of true gifted education difficult. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0162353212471587">Révész (1918)</xref> maintained that the greatest enemies of talent are the untalented, who are numerous and try to protect themselves. The weakest areas of Hungarian gifted education are the manifestation of just this problem.</p>
<p>The official Hungarian concept of giftedness is based on the approach of the Renzulli model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0162353212471587">1978</xref>) and describes giftedness in the interaction of some important groups of properties: above-average general abilities, above-average special abilities, creativity, and commitment to the task or motivation. The National Council of Support for the Gifted accepted the following simplified definition in 2007: “Thus, individuals can be regarded as gifted if their excellent abilities—as a combination of the above four components—enable them to be capable of high-level achievement in some area of life” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0162353212471587">Balogh &amp; Mező, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>The Hungarian approach to giftedness, however, is captured in a more colorful way by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0162353212471587">Czeizel’s (1997)</xref> multidimensional, 4 × 2 + 1 factor model of giftedness, which reflects the interaction of abilities and external environmental effects. The four-ring figure illustrates the interaction of genetic traits (hereditariness) and environmental effects. Giftedness is seen to be rooted in four genetic factors—general mental abilities, specific mental abilities, creative abilities, and motivational abilities—and four environmental factors—family, school, peer groups, and the general social environment. Each environmental factor can be either positive or negative, and thus the set form a complex compound. This all is supplemented with the unpredictable “factor of fate” (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0162353212471587">Figure 1</xref>).</p>

<graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0162353212471587-fig1.tif"/>
</fig>
<p>An additional factor, according to Czeizel, is that it is necessary to reach an age suitable for creation, that is, a certain life span is necessary. He describes the most extreme form of talent loss as in relation to health and life span. In view of the increasing mortality in Hungary (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0162353212471587">Kopp &amp; Skrabski, 2009</xref>), this issue may be of considerable significance.</p>
<p>The Hungarian language is restricted in its ability to discriminate between different forms of giftedness. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0162353212471587">Czeizel (1997)</xref> suggested, basically in line with the model of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0162353212471587">Gagné (1991)</xref>, the use of giftedness (“tehetség”) to describe an individual with significantly above average, that is, exceptional abilities, potential, or promise. Potential and a fulfilled promise should be differentiated. He suggested the use of the term <italic>talent</italic> (“talentum”)—already used by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0162353212471587">Révész (1918)</xref>—in the case of individuals who display giftedness in creation. This concept, however, did not make it into either the professional terminology, or popular knowledge.</p>
<p>The officially accepted conception of giftedness also fails to make such distinctions. As a consequence, discussions of professional issues often stray into territories of vagueness. In addition, the gifted education that started in the 1980s is built on the psychometric approach of the 20th century (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0162353212471587">Vass et al., 2011</xref>) and can only slowly turn into a 21st century type of Hungarian gifted education.</p>
<p>A reason for this is that in the now classical description of gifted education, three basic stages are desirable, denoted as the three “Ds” in the literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0162353212471587">Rosemarin, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0162353212471587">Solano, 1979</xref>): Description, Discovery, and Development, which less wittily, but more precisely put, covers the following three basic issues relating to giftedness: (a) defining giftedness, (b) identifying giftedness, and (c) developing giftedness.</p>
<p>These three stages are each important parts of dealing with the gifted, but in the 21st century, when a change in culture and the tools of the digital age seem to be altering the thinking of children and the needs of society to an unprecedented degree, efficient gifted education appears to require exactly the opposite order. If a diverse selection of talents is to be available for society and human culture, these talents must be given the opportunity to manifest. To this end, gifted education should be included in everyday education and beyond that, into everyday culture, and premature restriction of the circle of talents through selection by identification should be avoided.</p>
<p>The most efficient way to identify giftedness is to develop it. If appropriate opportunities are given to the gifted, their identification becomes virtually automatic through the manifestation of talent. In this approach, the very last step is the definition of giftedness, that is, determining what kind of talents are needed and nurtured in society. The gifted education of the future therefore is as follows:</p>

<list-item><p>Developing giftedness</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Identifying giftedness</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Defining giftedness</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>The conception of giftedness has definitely begun to change in professional circles. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0162353212471587">Table 1</xref> offers an overview of the elements of this change. Professionals increasingly rely on observational data instead of a rigid psychometric approach. Assessments increasingly tend to focus on understanding giftedness rather than identifying it. Even practical gifted education is being permeated with the idea that the manifestation of talent requires a suitable environment, whereby an individual who wishes to achieve more than others in a given area and is willing to exert extra effort to this end is more likely to do so.</p>

<title>Misconceptions That Burden Gifted Education</title>
<p>A popular view is that “everyone is gifted.” This is probably a new manifestation of the old egalitarianism: In the communist era of the country, no one could be worth more than others. In today’s democracy, everyone “deserves” giftedness. In folk psychology, the Hungarian term for ability, like <italic>aptitude</italic>, is in the singular, and designates general intelligence, which is why its meaning is easily associated by many with the concept of giftedness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0162353212471587">Vass et al., 2011</xref>). The synonymous use of the terms <italic>good ability</italic> and <italic>giftedness</italic> in popular speech acknowledges giftedness as confined to abilities, and thus the idea that “everyone has some good abilities” easily leads to the idea that “everyone is gifted.”</p>
<p>Many are aware of the falseness of this view, however. If everyone is talented, then the concept itself becomes spurious and fails the Sternbergian criteria of rarity. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0162353212471587">Sternberg (1993)</xref> set up the criteria for giftedness in a pentagonal model, according to which giftedness is manifest in rare, outstanding, demonstrable, and value-producing achievement (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0162353212471587">Figure 2</xref>).</p>

</fig>
<p>Everyone can be excellent and have outstanding abilities or achievements. If, for instance, children were educated according to the method described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0162353212471587">László Polgár (2008)</xref>, father of the outstandingly successful chess-player Polgár girls, they would be capable of cognitive achievements far above their current abilities. Until this method becomes general, individuals who have had more opportunity to develop their abilities in their environment will appear to be gifted. Naturally, some may be extraordinary talents, but individuals whom we could call an “average talent,” whose achievements are attainable to many given the right environmental background, also make it to the group of gifted.</p>
<p>A much more sustainable and useful approach is “to regard everyone as a potential talent.” This approach is, in Hungary, primarily held by the Council for the Support of the Gifted With Special Education Needs and its members, but more and more people are beginning to see the advantages of the approach.</p>
<p>This approach is highly important because it promotes a more differentiated view of giftedness. A widespread notion is the “everything or nothing” motto, according to which every talent is talented in all areas. People tend to think that if someone is an excellent computer engineer or poet, then his or her financial advice should also be heeded, or alternatively, if someone is incapable of reading well, she or he must be incapable of outstanding achievements in all other cognitive areas as well.</p>
<p>Average or even below average knowledge in some areas, however, does not negate or undo the individual’s outstanding areas. Consequently, profiling tests are gaining ground in the assessments of giftedness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0162353212471587">Gyarmathy, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>A further burden on the gifted is the motto “Palma sub ponder crescit,” that is, “a palm grows under pressure,” which does substantial harm in gifted education. Overexertion increases anxiety, and achievements will often not occur. Too early achievement can undermine later outstanding creative work.</p>
<p>A twin brother of this view is the slogan “talent cannot be subdued,” according to which someone who fails to become a talent is in fact not a talent. The great Hungarian poet Sándor Petőfi wrote in a letter, “No talent is lost in this world. Nature is no fool to create strengths in vain. What it creates, it creates to have use thereof” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0162353212471587">Korompay, 2009</xref>, p. 13). But then, gifted education would be a superfluous activity. It is possible for an individual to possess an internal drive that would not let its talent rest and would force it to evolve even under the most unfavorable circumstances. This is, however, hardly something on which to base support for the gifted.</p>
<p>Turning potential into ability and then growing it into achievement requires enduring effort, which in turn requires a supportive environment. Outstanding abilities can sometimes also be an obstacle to outstanding achievements, because they lead to easy successes. Many gifted individuals with outstanding abilities are lost by choosing the easier way, and waiting for achievements to happen without effort. Popular thinking often regards diligence as a compensation for weak abilities and does not acknowledge it very much.</p>
<p>Finally, unfortunately a frequent mistake, though rarely explicitly voiced, is zero sum thinking. In essence, people tend to believe that if someone has more of something, this automatically means that someone else has less of it. This can generate a grudge against the gifted though the gifted, in fact, open up opportunities for everyone without taking from anyone.</p>

<title>Legislative Aspects of Gifted Education in Hungary</title>
<p>Although the new education act stresses the importance of gifted education in several places, in practice, it fails to provide real opportunities for it. Hungarian education management basically runs counter to the ideas of professionals in gifted education. The new educational reform confines education to a more rigid framework than before. The strict confines that are imposed by the central curriculum not only fail to take into consideration the diverse forms of talents but also the diversity of the not so outstanding individuals.</p>
<p>The law regards children who need special treatment as falling into at least one of the following groups:</p>
<list id="list2-0162353212471587" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>A child or student has special education needs if he or she was diagnosed by the relevant expert committee for some motor, sensory, mental, speech or multiple disability, autism spectrum disorder, or other psychological developmental disorder (such as learning, attention, behavior, or impulse control disorder).</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>A child has integration, learning, or behavior difficulties if he or she has specific problems whose levels are not as serious in the above categories, but whose simultaneous presence results in significant underachievement, social relation problems, or deficits of behavior control in comparison with the child’s age and school grade.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>A child is talented if he or she possesses above-average general or specific abilities and a high level of creativity, and a strong motivation and commitment to the task can be aroused in him or her.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>Participation in special education and boarding school provision, including participation in first basic education in music and arts, is free of charge in all cases for each child with specific education needs, or integration, learning, or behavior difficulties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0162353212471587">National Public Education Act, 2012</xref>). To gifted children, in contrast to the other two groups of children with special treatment needs, no support is made available other than listing them as requiring special treatment. Therefore, a gifted child can only receive the above-mentioned support if he or she has diagnosed integration problems at the least.</p>
<p>Gifted education is a designated activity in the public education act, whose framework is provided by the National Talent Program and which is subsidized by the National Talent Fund. The government designated the following as high priority areas in the 2-year action program for 2011-2012 to execute the objectives set out in the National Talent Program:</p>
<list id="list3-0162353212471587" list-type="alpha-lower">
<list-item><p>to sustain and enrich traditions of support for the gifted,</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>to ensure equal access in the area of support for the gifted and promoting value-based social mobility,</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>to increase the community-forming and social responsibility of talented youths,</p></list-item>

<list-item><p>to advance the development of a talent-conscious (systems helping spread programs and best practices that target equal opportunities) and talent-friendly society (local governments, ethnic minority governments, councils for the support of the gifted),</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>to assist in the collaboration of Hungarian gifted support communities in Hungary and in neighboring countries, and</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>to valorize the results of Hungarian gifted support in other member states of the European Union and other states.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>The minister assists gifted education through support of national gifted education collaboration, professional recommendations, as well as calls for project proposals and contest notices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0162353212471587">National Public Education Act, 2012</xref>).</p>
<p>Such grants for possible episodic activities described by the legislation bring about ad hoc types of gifted education programs. There is no continuous, ongoing funding of support and work with the gifted, either inside or outside regular education. When a project culminates, the work is done and it is uncertain whether and how it can continue.</p>
<p>A further problem is that gifted education is relegated as a task to public education institutions. Six- and eight-year high schools as well as special colleges are designated institutions for gifted education, and it is their duty to unfold students’ abilities and potential; to identify, register, and individually monitor gifted learners; to support and develop the gifted; and to take advantage of institutional and extrainstitution collaboration opportunities. The legislation allocates gifted education to the obligatory tasks of teachers, which are controlled, assisted, and monitored in each institution by a qualified gifted and talented coordinator teacher.</p>
<p>A great problem is that teachers are not suitably trained professionally—A great number of them are not even past the everyday level of understanding the concept of giftedness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0162353212471587">Vass et al., 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>A further unsolved issue in gifted education is involving the increasingly greater social classes that tend to fall behind. There is a specific gifted education program for socioculturally disadvantaged talents, the Arany János Program, that targets the gifted education of disadvantaged high school students. Unfortunately, however, the effectiveness of talent saving starting in the teenage years is quite low. Disadvantage turns into considerable deficit by this age.</p>
<p>Studies show that application rates into this program are low, which is in part due to the fact that disadvantaged children tend to lose their learning motivation in primary school. The participation rates of the socioculturally disadvantaged “Roma children” are particularly low in this talent program. The average academic record of classes consisting of disadvantaged children is lower than that of other high school classes already at the outset, and this difference tends to persist until the end of high school. Nonetheless, disadvantaged students do profit from being accepted to high school (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0162353212471587">Fehérvári &amp; Liskó, 2006</xref>). Disadvantaged children who are accepted into elite high schools, however, are under great pressure. Many of them feel anxiety over wanting to live up to high expectations, missing knowledge or skills, and the cultural change.</p>
<p>To solve these problems, the National Talent Council extends provisions for socioculturally disadvantaged talents to all ages in its Talent Bridges program that began in 2012. Preschool gifted education programs are also planned to increase the chances of disadvantaged children to develop their talent by preventing them from falling behind. An academically sound but practical book, <italic>Advantage in Disadvantage</italic>, was published within the framework of the Genius Project, which reviews the various areas related to and solution options for the provision of support for the socioculturally disadvantaged gifted in Hungary.</p>

<title>Important Contributions to Gifted Education in Hungary</title>
<sec id="section8-0162353212471587">
<title>Networks</title>
<p>Péter Csermely, a biochemist researching networks, has suggested basing gifted education on networks, drawing from his research results, according to which network-based organizations work much more efficiently than the simple sum of its members, irrespective of whether these are cellular networks or the Internet. On Csermely’s initiative, a national program was started to support the gifted in which so-called talent points play an important role. The organizational principle thereof is the network-based approach: The system is characterized not by a single centered uniform relational form but is also formed by local, professional, and skill-based relations. The collaboration and informational link between organizations and professionals working in gifted education can efficiently represent the case of talents at professional and education policy platforms, and even in front of economical decision makers.</p>
<p>In gifted education, as everywhere else, lack of resources leads to crises. Csermely and his colleagues have found that each bridging link increases the chances of collaborations, which make it possible to take a stand and—jointly—contend for new resources instead of taking part in the desperate fight for the redistribution of the old, and owing to the economic crisis, reducing resources.</p>
<p>An especially important element of building bridges is providing for the most talented, where in most cases, talent will need a brand new environment and network of relations for its optimal development. Gifted education constitutes a network, good examples of which are the talent points, which provide or recommend an appropriate environment for the gifted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0162353212471587">Csermely, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0162353212471587">Csermely et al., 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>The Hungarian model is unique in that it initiates the process of strengthening giftedness support through networking. Each node, that is, each talent point in the network does gifted education work, mostly with the help of qualified professionals. They undertake to assign not only teachers but also psychologists, if necessary, to working with the gifted, and in addition, they also keep in contact with the family. One of the most important components of the work, however, is cooperation with other talent points, exchanging information and willingness to get to know or transfer best practices in gifted education.</p>
<p>Talent points have been established all over Hungary, and even in some neighboring countries. These can be found in the form of a talent map on the Internet (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.geniuszportal.hu/tehetsegterkep">www.geniuszportal.hu/tehetsegterkep</ext-link>). By also involving regions across the board, several institutions and civil organizations in Hungarian communities in neighboring countries have also founded talent points.</p>
<p>Two thirds of the talent points are public education institutions, kindergartens, or primary or secondary schools, but local government and church institutions have also founded talent points. In many places, gifted education is realized as the cooperation of several sectors.</p>
<p>Talent points are not restricted in terms of organizational character or functioning. The goal is to involve every talent-supporting organization of a high professional level in the work of the network and make it a registered talent point. Programs offered by the institutions are extremely diverse and many of them are at an exceptionally high level. Importantly, talent points are required to have a worked-out and professionally sound program and methods of gifted education and should be able to record it and share it with others to promote the spreading of best practices. Best practices of gifted education are constantly collected and published on the Internet (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://geniuszportal.hu/content/best-practices">http://geniuszportal.hu/content/best-practices</ext-link>).</p>
<p>Organizations also benefit financially by becoming registered talent points, as they may more easily apply for grants at the National Talent Fund for talent support activities. In addition, institutions with more background experience, which have accumulated information and established relationships through the network, are able to use the resources more efficiently.</p>

<title>Preschool Gifted Education</title>
<p>The most innovative progress in Hungarian gifted education happens in preschool provision. Kindergarten teachers are far more active and creative in their solutions than teachers in any other area of education. Numerous art and science programs and projects are ongoing in kindergarten. A separate council for gifted support has been set up for the kindergarten level, and under the name “Antanténusz” (from a popular children’s nonsense verse), for playful thinking development at early childhood. In addition, kindergarten teachers stand out with outstanding innovations in this area.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-0162353212471587">
<title>Magic Box</title>
<p>One of the outstanding innovations is the work of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0162353212471587">Edina Nagy (2011)</xref>, a student at a kindergarten teacher college program, who also studies at a fine arts college. She owns a company, which pursues diverse fine art activities. She is also a youth of outstanding talent and has devised a modular game, which is a method for gifted development and gifted identification in one and may form the basis of further innumerable novel solutions. It is not only helpful in childhood but can be utilized at all ages.</p>
<p>It is a tool for remedial catching up and for supporting the gifted in one. The Magic box, a patented invention, has won several awards. The modules are made of natural and white cardboard in an environment-conscious spirit. The pieces can be easily assembled and taken apart, or even “turned inside out.”</p>
<p>Characteristics of the modular game are as follows:</p>

<p>Besides the basic package, modules with different types of surface have also been made. There are pieces with impregnated surface, which can be cleaned with water and thereby present an opportunity for renewed creation using the same pieces. There are also pieces whose outer part is covered with magnetic foil, thereby offering immense opportunities for experimentation.</p>
<p>The modules can be used to create strategic games, rhythm games, or even musical scales of different sizes. They can be filled with different kinds of material, they can be colored, or adorned with figures or linguistic materials.</p>
<p>The magic box can be used in the development of all major areas of abilities. It uncovers areas of interest and can be used to identify the following:</p>

<title>A New Approach to Creativity</title>
<p>An important change in the study of creativity is that researchers take the social aspects of creativity into account, as well, rather than exclusively its psychological characteristics. Today’s studies not only examine divergent thinking and diversity in itself, but complement this by linking it to the amount of work done. External acceptance from society and the personality of the maestros and mentors aiding the creative work are of particular importance in the activities of the creative person as a “chosen” individual. In essence, the change in today’s research on creativity is manifest in a different interpretation of the relation between the individual and the society (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0162353212471587">Pléh, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>Increasingly more data are processed on so-called “talent maps.” The distribution of talents is nonuniform. Some areas are under- or overrepresented in terms of manifestation of talent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0162353212471587">Pléh, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>Models have shed light on and quantified phenomena on which concrete data had been lacking or had been sparse. It has been proven that it is possible to model a real nonuniformity just as well as any other sociocultural phenomenon. Areas differ in terms of their talent production, talent retention, and talent attraction (see the study on the talent attraction potential of Hungarian counties between 1867 and 1990 by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0162353212471587">Győri, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>Further—geographical, historical, or professional—refinement of the patterns used for the design of the model may uncover more specific connections.</p>
<p>Another issue related to the social embeddedness of creativity is the identification of different types of creativity. Creativity as exceptional creativity in a specific area rather than general creativity bears a different significance in relation to the development of giftedness. While everyday creativity can be the result of general openness, outstanding professional creativity is specific to a given subject. Exceptional creativity presupposes exceptional knowledge. An immense amount of practice is necessary to exploit talent. School age is the period when it is perhaps easiest to devote the ten thousand hours of one’s time that is necessary for future achievement in an area, possibly only 20 years later (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0162353212471587">Pléh, 2010</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section13-0162353212471587">
<title>Atypical Brain and Giftedness</title>
<p>Gifted population is far from homogeneous in terms of creative functioning. The “big C,” that is, an exceptional creativity behind exceptional achievements is often rooted in an uncommon way of information processing. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0162353212471587">Gyarmathy (2009)</xref>, special attitudes characteristic of giftedness appear virtually as a rule in the case of outstanding talents as the result of an out of ordinary brain structure. A more random creative talent, as opposed to a more regular talent, might thus be more typically rooted in specific learning difficulties, hyperactivity and attention disorder, or even Asperger syndrome.</p>
<p>Giftedness is a special kind of perception, attitude, and reaction. Intense and obsessed activity and persevering practice are necessary for outstanding achievements and are highly different from normal cognitive processes, which lead to a behavior highly different from normal. Many of the gifted show uncommon cognitive structures, nonuniform structure of abilities, right brain dominance, language difficulties, or autoimmune diseases, which are often a sign of dyslexia and other specific learning difficulties to professionals.</p>
<p>In many cases, specific aspects of the personality of a gifted person, such as weakness in social abilities and an unbelievable level of motivation, may be identified as compulsive or autistic behaviors. Abnormally high levels of activity are often diagnosed as hyperactivity disorder. The signs of giftedness capable of outstanding achievements and the symptoms of attention disorder/hyperactivity correspond in many respects. For instance, both are characterized by quick reaction, Dabrowski’s overexcitabilities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0162353212471587">Dabrowski &amp; Piechowski, 1977</xref>), uncommon perception, above-average level of activity, desire for creation, curiosity, a predisposition to question authority, indefatigability, troublesome behavior in absence of a suitable challenge, and low tolerance for monotony (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0162353212471587">Gyarmathy, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Outstanding talent may not only arise as a result of irregular, atypical brain development; however, contrary to earlier theories, a genius appears to be a special neurological type rather than simply a high level of giftedness. Difference is, therefore, qualitative rather than merely quantitative. One of the great challenges of the third millennium is the increasing number of children with outstanding abilities incapable of integration. The provision of these children and the channeling of their potential require a change in the conception of giftedness and gifted education.</p>
<p>A vital condition of outstanding achievements is that the atypical gifted individual be able to live up to his or her abilities and more or less integrate into society. This would in turn require less rigid diagnostic approaches.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section14-0162353212471587">
<title>A Change in the Focus of Gifted Assessments</title>
<p>The 20th century giftedness ideal is a gifted individual who is capable of fitting in, who is in possession of outstanding abilities that are identifiable with tests, and who is characterized by creativity. Giftedness, however, cannot be measured. More and more data affirm that even the most thoroughly designed procedures will fail in the case of individuals with special brain structures, that is, the exceptions, a special minority of whom there are more and more, and of whom many may be capable of outstanding achievements.</p>
<p>One of the most important pitfalls of gifted identification is creativity. Creative power means, by essence, unidentifiability. Surpassing earlier existent instances is what makes something creative. Creative individuals most often manifest themselves as difficulties. An unbalanced profile of abilities and singular personality characteristic of exceptional talents renders the traditional assessment methods unreliable and unsuitable for identifying talents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0162353212471587">Gyarmathy, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>To detect incongruousness at a high level, the individual requires knowledge. Creativity is linked to abilities and knowledge. The link of creative thinking to knowledge is the reason tests of creativity tend to correlate more with intelligence tests than with each other. There are innumerable assessment tools of creativity, but despite all appearances, the assessment of creativity is unsolved. The applied procedures target the assessment of the “little-C,” or everyday creativity, but even for this, results are unreliable. The circumstances under which a test is recorded significantly influence the results of assessment methods. This factor has an increased effect in the case of creativity assessment.</p>
<p>Creativity is less effective in a tense environment. “When guns talk the muses fall silent” (Hungarian proverb, author unknown). Testing, however, is like a war with guns, which generates tension: It is an assessment, expectation of achievement, and a timed pressure that kills creativity. This applies to testing situations and school situations alike (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0162353212471587">Gyarmathy, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>Similar to school talent identification, a serious issue with intelligence tests is that they primarily identify school or lesson learner talents, who can also be called testing talents. Creative productive talent, on the other hand, is more difficult to identify. During an intelligence test, it can be observed that some children do not approach the tasks in the usual rational way, because their imagination leads them to find original solutions. Individual testing makes it possible to detect these phenomena, whereas in the case of group intelligence assessments and identification tests, the “over”-creative individuals with a restless mind are disadvantaged owing to their special way of perception and interpretations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0162353212471587">Gyarmathy, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>Studies show that of children accepted into gifted education programs, the ones who show truly substantial development are those who were selected because of their keen interest. Interest-based gifted identification is especially important in the case of talents who happen to be disadvantaged for some reason. For them, their environment has failed to provide an opportunity for harmonic development, and they are thus often underachievers. Their abilities do not reflect their true potentials in most cases, but their internal drive may be manifest in the strength and direction of their interests (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0162353212471587">Gyarmathy, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>The Map of Interest method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0162353212471587">Gyarmathy &amp; Herskovits, 1999</xref>) is ideal for the assessment of the disadvantaged gifted but is also highly informative in general. The method is based on the multiple intelligences model of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0162353212471587">Gardner (1983)</xref>, who distinguishes seven separate intelligences in his theory, which cover the major areas of ability: linguistic, logical-mathematical, spatial, bodily-kinesthetic, musical, interpersonal, and intrapersonal. The series of statements for the map were based on the questions assembled by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0162353212471587">Armstrong (1994)</xref> for Gardner’s intelligence areas. Two series of statements are used: one series is for the children to fill in and the other is for their parents and teachers to describe the children’s interests. The two series consist of the same items and both are used to discover the interests of the individual (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0162353212471587">Gyarmathy, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>The results can be used to determine the strengths of the individual where talent may manifest itself. At the same time, weaknesses can also be identified. Methods of development can be suggested to compensate for the weaknesses and for the use of strengths. The following are to be considered in the interpretation of the results:</p>
<list id="list8-0162353212471587" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>What and how strong are the preferred areas of interest?</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Which are the areas of rejection?</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>How much inconsistency is there in the choices?</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>The results of the assessment can be used not only in determining the directions of development but also in providing counsel. Differences between different stakeholder parties can be discussed and the different views reconciled.</p>

<sec id="section15-0162353212471587">
<title>Challenges of the Digital Age</title>
<p>A narrow background, in terms of stimuli, is less conducive to an early development of individual dispositions. Children’s development was much more uniform in cultures less rich in stimuli, even in the 20th century. Children formed more homogeneous groups by the time they entered school.</p>
<p>The developmental background for children in the digital age, however, is an environment immensely rich in stimuli. The development of children is much more heterogeneous compared with earlier times. Children’s nervous system today can receive sufficient stimuli for its individual development whether it is open to verbality, whether it has a stronger need for spatial-visual development, or some areas of auditory processing are the strongest, and which, given the right stimuli, can develop into outstanding ability. Satisfying stimulus hunger also means that other areas might not develop uniformly when the child’s stimulus hunger is restricted to some narrow area. Specialized areas of interest and activity, and—due to deficits—specific learning difficulties, as well, can develop at a very early age. Studies reveal that today’s children have a structure of abilities that show a much more diffuse pattern (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0162353212471587">Gyarmathy, 2012a</xref>).</p>
<p>School education has failed to adapt to these changes. Teachers are increasingly at a loss to treat children with a vast amount of knowledge that mostly fails to form a coherent system. School is unable to prepare them for methodical reception, processing, selection, and filtering of information.</p>
<p>Gifted children are characterized by a greater than average stimulus hunger. They have greater opportunities for acquisition of knowledge and autonomous learning in the informational society. Gifted education, just like everyday education, should take the significant changes in culture into consideration and adapt its methodology accordingly.</p>

<title>The Future of Gifted Education in Hungary</title>
<p>The professional basis of gifted education needs to progress in Hungary, so that it may contribute to an enhanced efficiency in research and gifted education programs alike. The following discussion is based on <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0162353212471587">Gyarmathy (2012b</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0162353212471587">2012c</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0162353212471587">2012d</xref>).</p>
<sec id="section17-0162353212471587">
<title>Conception of Giftedness</title>
<p>Giftedness is a combination of outstanding abilities, which may become a creative force in an environment suitable for its manifestation. Giftedness can help an individual fulfill himself or herself and is a way to the individual’s personal and social productivity. Thus, giftedness is an element of the psychological health of the individual and the society.</p>
<p>Giftedness is not an unchanging personality trait but a group of factors for outstanding achievement that is formed in a dynamic interaction of multiple intrapersonal and environmental factors. Environmental factors, especially expectations, significantly influence the manifestation of talent. Giftedness is rare, but probably not as rare as it currently appears. Everyone should be regarded and treated as a potential talent.</p>
<p>The later the selection, and the earlier the start of the development program, the more talents evolve and the richer the opportunities at the disposal of the society.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section18-0162353212471587">
<title>Gifted Assessments</title>
<p>The goal of gifted assessments is to ensure the appropriate developmental environment (mentors, procedures and tools, suggestion and development of possible individual/group gifted education programs), either for an individual or for a community. Therefore, an assessment should always culminate with drawing up a development plan. The assessment should make use of multiple sources, and information should be analyzed as an interaction of personal and environmental factors.</p>
<p>Gifted assessments should pay equal attention to the identification of strengths and weaknesses. Ability-, learning-, and motivation profiles are necessary to design a developmental environment and to have grounds to send the gifted children to program or to a mentor. Nevertheless, even the most carefully designed assessment only represents the current situation.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section19-0162353212471587">
<title>Gifted Education and Provision for the Gifted</title>
<p>Gifted education should extend to all individuals. Segregating the gifted can lead to talent loss. In case of segregated gifted education, special attention should be paid to deal with the unnatural situation caused by the separation. Talents should be kept as much as possible in a natural environment, and additional enrichment program should ideally complement this. Gifted assessment is only necessary when some talent programs are starting or information is needed for some decision or development plan concerning the gifted. Observation and detection of strengths, weaknesses, and interests, on the other hand, is essential from early childhood on in the case of all children.</p>
<p>Underachievers and irregular gifted individuals should be paid special attention in all forms of gifted education. Populations with some form of disadvantage, special education need, and/or integration difficulties are at least as involved in terms of giftedness as any other groups.</p>
<p>High-level cultivation of a specific scientific, artistic, sports, or other activity is important for everyone and offers an opportunity for the manifestation of talents in given areas. Specialization is only expected from adolescence and later, but an early start in a given area constitutes a great advantage for creative talent, and what is more, there are areas in which this is specifically necessary for the early development of abilities. However, a talent may not be restricted to a single area. It is important not to force the gifted to make a decision or choice and to give them an opportunity to develop in multiple areas of giftedness. Gifted education carried out in different areas leads to developmental processes that mutually strengthen each other.</p>
<p>Major forms of gifted education would include development built into everyday activities; pronounced cultivation of a specific scientific, artistic, or sport activity; gifted assessment; individual and group consultation with the family, professionals, and the gifted; mentor system; tenders for project proposals; contests, performances, and other appearances; vocational counseling; career building; conflict management; and therapeutic treatment.</p>
<list id="list9-0162353212471587" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Individual and group consultation with the family, professionals, and the gifted is a continuous support in development. Gifted education is teamwork, and as such, the professionals should consult each other regularly.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>One of the oldest and most efficient forms of gifted education is the mentor system. A gifted individual can receive support from a dedicated mentor throughout his or her life, who can open up roads in the development of the gifted. The role of the mentor system is to help matching up mentor and mentee.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Creative achievements should start to come to the foreground from adolescence. Regular opportunities to participate in contests, performances, and other appearances provide an opportunity to gain experience.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Vocational counseling and career development constitute an important background for young and adult talents.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>The specialty of talents may lead to a lot of difficulties. Therefore, counselors competent in provision for the gifted should be available during gifted education.</p>

<title>Talent-Friendly Society</title>
<p>A talent-friendly society is primarily manifest in its general approach, as well as more specifically in its educational institutions, sustenance of a gifted education system, and its recognition of outstanding achievements. A talent-friendly society regards all people as equal but not uniform. Acceptance of the different attitude characterizing the gifted helps the gifted in accepting the majority’s way of thinking that is different from theirs, whereby their integration into society and achievements become easier.</p>
<p>Outstanding abilities and achievements are built on the individual’s belief in himself or herself and the efficiency of her or his work. Development of a talent requires persistent and intensive preparation, which demands a substantial sacrifice from the individual and its environment.</p>
<p>Substantial gain is to be attained through substantial investment. A return, however, might not be instantaneous; to the contrary, the return on the effort made on talent is over the long term.</p>
<p>A talent-friendly society reinforces absorbed activity and perfectionism by leaving time for playing, learning, and creation. It ensures flexible and at the same time predictable and strict rules and a degree of freedom appropriate for the development of abilities and the individual. It enhances the individual’s responsibility for his or her own actions, development, and performance.</p>

<sec id="section21-0162353212471587">
<title>Gifted Assessment and Provision for the Talents With Dual Speciality (Double Exceptionality)—That Is, With Special Education Needs or Integration and Learning Difficulties</title>
<p>Talents with special education needs or integration and learning difficulties are more vulnerable because of their dual speciality than individuals belonging to just one group. An unbalanced structure of abilities and an uneven development may result in a lot of failure. Individuals with a dual speciality, therefore, often fall into the group of underachieving talents. Dual speciality, at the same time, has a number of advantages. As talents, they are usually highly innovative, outstandingly creative, and can draw upon more resources to compensate for their weaknesses than their peers with no giftedness.</p>
<p>In assessments of individuals with a dual speciality, attention should be paid to the distorting effects of adaptive (i.e., conducive to development, coping, and integration) and maladaptive (i.e., hindering development, coping and integration) methods adopted by the individual. In the case of individuals with a dual speciality, only profile assessments are able to reflect an at least marginally reliable image of the individual, and assessment of interests has a greater than average significance in gauging their abilities. As their structure of abilities consists of pinnacles and pits, an averaged mean might easily indicate a flat plain.</p>
<p>Individuals with a dual speciality can easily fall into the vicious circle of underachievement owing to their failures. When they do, their self-esteem is low, they tend to avoid making an effort, and appear unmotivated. Consequently, regular motivation assessments do not necessary reflect their true internal drive.</p>
<p>It is particularly true in the case of individuals with a dual speciality that the best way of identification is observation during gifted education. Individuals with a dual speciality should be offered the most appropriate developing environment for their characteristics like everyone else. If they receive this, then the environment should set up suitable expectations and need not hand out waivers. Achievements are rooted in coping and taking on challenges rather than avoiding making an effort.</p>
<p>Finding the appropriate vocation and building up a career is an important form of gifted education assisting integration. This type of talent fits less into its environment owing to its dual speciality, while effective use of its achievements requires finding the right place and vocation for creative work. The mentor system has an especially significant role in the provision of individuals with a dual speciality. The support from the mentor is not only important with regard to talent but also aids integration.</p>
<p>There is a greater need for teamwork than average in the case of individuals with a dual speciality. In most cases, more professionals than regular are involved.</p>

<title>The Provision of the Most Involved Groups of Talents With Special Education Needs or Integration and Learning Difficulties</title>
<sec id="section23-0162353212471587">
<title>Socioculturally Disadvantaged Talents</title>
<p>In absence of efficient interaction, sociocultural disadvantage increases with age. Gifted education should begin at an early age to ensure that socialization is suitable for gifted development. In the case of socioculturally disadvantaged individuals, the family is usually unable to provide a suitably developmental background even despite their efforts and constructiveness. It is important to monitor the social and personal factors and offer appropriate information to talented children of socioculturally disadvantaged families on their life opportunities. It is also immensely difficult for socioculturally disadvantaged talents to make up for the cultural difference between their own and even the average cultural background. In program for these individuals, significant emphasis should be on the development of cultural and ethical sense. This is particularly effective in the area of free-time activities.</p>
<p>Socioculturally disadvantaged individuals also suffer disadvantage in the educational system, as well, because school builds on verbal-analytical-logical thinking, while these individuals tend to be more efficient in holistic-visual-kinesthetic information processing. Everyone would benefit from an education that allowed for different modalities and cognitive functioning in the processing of the learning material.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section24-0162353212471587">
<title>Neurologically Based Achievement and Behavior Disorders and Conduct Disorder</title>
<p>School builds unilaterally on left hemisphere verbal-analytical thinking, whereas right hemisphere holistic-visual-kinesthetic approach is reduced to the background. Outstanding cognitive achievements and talent, on the other hand, requires the functioning of the whole brain. The unilateral nature of school has a significant role in the development of neurologically based achievement disorders, and it also has an adverse effect on the development of talents.</p>
<p>The neurological type often manifests as neurologically based achievement disorders is overrepresented in the outstandingly creative talent population. Increased stimulus hunger, strong energetic background, and lesser obstacles to the internal drive result at higher ability levels in a set of features characteristic of outstanding talent.</p>
<p>Conduct disorder is not rooted in a congenital or early brain trauma but is a reaction to regular and persistent negative environmental effects. Provision appropriate for the abilities of individuals with special education needs or integration and learning difficulties plays an important role in the prevention of conduct disorder. Underachievement and antisocial personality development invariably arise through the incongruence of the individual and the environment.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section25-0162353212471587">
<title>Talents With Sensory or Motor Disabilities</title>
<p>As the deficits are conspicuous in the case of this group, the attention of the environment is focused thereon, and thus although provision for the disability is ensured, gifted support is not necessarily aided and catered for. Deficits often beget extra (compensational) abilities, which may form the basis of outstanding achievements. The giftedness of disabled individuals may manifest itself in (a) areas unrelated to the disability, (b) areas of outstanding achievements despite their disability, or (c) areas beyond the majority of society, being an extra ability developed because of the disability.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section26-0162353212471587">
<title>Autistic Developmental Disorders and Giftedness</title>
<p>Autistic individuals are a highly involved population with respect to talent. The integration of autistic talents can depend in many respects on the approach of the environment, as well as on human and material resources. Understanding and accepting an autistic individual’s way of thinking can improve the quality of social relations irrespective of the level of the individual’s abilities. In the case of autistic individuals with outstanding abilities, this approach is indispensable with regard to the development of talent.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section27-0162353212471587">
<title>The Question of Mental Retardation</title>
<p>Whether autistic or not, any mentally retarded individual may possess outstanding abilities. An extreme manifestation of this is the savant syndrome, which is an outstanding ability in some highly specific area paired with mental retardation or autism. A savant is not a talent because a savant reproduces and copies rather than creates. Savants miss the high level of creativity in their activities, which are nonetheless desirable activities, because they bring joy to the individual and bring about an achievement.</p>
<p>Groups of individuals labeled mentally retarded and individuals who are actually mentally retarded, however, do not exactly coincide. It is not uncommon that talented individuals are diagnosed as mentally retarded, for instance, because of sociocultural disadvantages and/or their way of thinking that is significantly different from the norm.</p>
<p>It is especially frequent for individuals with a dual speciality to achieve very poorly in ability assessments, although their abilities are outstanding. In light of all this, the presence of gifted education in institutions working with mentally retarded individuals is of profound significance.</p>
<p>It is highly important to secure the diversity of gifted education programs in research and in practice, and the official recognition of this approach is indispensable. The digital age presents new challenges for gifted education, as well, and a background approach is necessary, which is of use in different sociocultural environments.</p>
