<p>On 21 April 1942, the Spanish film <italic>Raza</italic> (Race) premiered in Berlin. Spanish diplomats in Germany organized the event and top Nazi politicians attended the performance. The movie was a mediocre propaganda film devoted to justifying the military uprising that in July 1936 had plunged Spain into civil war. Yet its peculiarity lay in the fact that General Francisco Franco was personally responsible for the screenplay. The story of José Churruca, a military officer who rebelled against the republican government to save his nation from an alleged communist threat, is the fictional tale of Franco’s idealized alter ego and thus presents primary source material for psychological studies on dictators. The name of the film was also important. As in the rest of Europe, in early 1940s Spain, race was a crucial element in a number of right-wing ideologies and the basis of a series of governmental policies. In the case of the Franco regime, the concept of race was at the centre of the dictatorship’s testing of political prisoners to find out if they harboured a ‘red gene’, the application of eugenic programmes in concentration camps and the forced adoption of children away from republican mothers, among others.</p>
<p>Joshua Goode’s book is an analysis of the Spanish intellectual tradition of racial thought forged in late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, which was eventually to feed brutal Francoist policies. <italic>Impurity of Blood</italic> explores how the academic field of anthropology provided a new kind of racial analysis to explain the features of the Spanish nation, its supposed maladies and its potential cures. The first part of the book concentrates on the development of anthropology in Spain and the absorption of anthropological debates into non-scientific intellectual and cultural discussions in the context of the political struggles of the Restoration system (1875–1923). The second part considers the social application of scientific ideas, how racial ideas penetrated disciplines like criminology, and, crucially, the military appropriation of race after the 1898 defeat in the Spanish-American War.</p>
<p>Goode’s main argument is that Spanish anthropologists shared the view that Spaniards were the product of racial fusion in the period under study. Unlike some German and French anthropologists who defended the existence of racial purity, Spanish scholars steadily claimed that their compatriots were the result of ethnic hybridization. This understanding did not prevent a highly nationalistic use of the concept of race, because even if the idea of fusion was shared, the ethnic components and mechanisms of fusion were not. Depending on the distinct ‘original’ racial types and the way they mixed, anthropologists and social scientists inferred diverse mechanisms of national inclusion and exclusion. As a result, a variety of Spanish racial types were ‘discovered’ and different anthropological schools advocated different political measures to regenerate a nation.</p>
<p>Goode’s approach to race is one of the main strengths of the book. Following Peggy Pascoe’s concept of ‘racialism’, race is understood here not only as a biological notion but also as a cultural one. Moreover, race is presented as fluid, flexible enough to adapt to the changing historical contexts in which it unfolded. This open approach has been used by scholars of race and racism in America for some time now, but it is rare in the European context, where comparisons with the Nazi biological concept and its potential for genocide have heavily influenced the study of racial thought. As Goode shows, it was the very flexibility of the idea of race in Spain that allowed the concept to develop among a wide array of thinkers. Spanish liberals, conservatives, republicans, Basque nationalists and Catalan regionalists all indulged in ideas of race that linked biology and culture to substantiate their political views.</p>
<p><italic>Impurity of Blood</italic> does an excellent job in exploring the academic debates Spanish anthropologists had in the period 1870–1930, yet the analysis of the socio-political context in which these intellectual developments took place is hazy in places. Goode is right to point out that the historical context is crucial when it comes to understanding the transformations of the idea of race, but the variety of political regimes and the profound social transformations that Spain went through over those 50 years are not always explicitly considered in his investigation. Likewise, further scrutiny of how the anthropologists’ changing concept of the Spanish race was transmitted to different sectors of society via newspapers, illustrated magazines and school textbooks would have given the reader a better idea of how racial ideas reached the wider public.</p>
<p>Still, <italic>Impurity of Blood</italic> is a solid examination of racial thought in pre-Civil War Spain. It takes a fresh approach to the question of race, challenges the assumption that inter-war European racism is to be defined solely by Nazism, and demonstrates the racial connotations of the Francoist terror. It is, in sum, an excellent reminder of the importance of racial myths in Europe’s recent past.</p>
