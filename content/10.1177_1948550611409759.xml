<abstract>
<p>The own-race bias (ORB) is the tendency for perceivers to better recognize own-race than cross-race (CR) faces. Perceptual approaches to understanding this effect suggest that perceivers typically have low levels of processing experience with CR faces, resulting in poor recognition memory. However, social–cognitive models have demonstrated that perceiver motivation can also influence CR recognition accuracy. The current work bridges these two literatures by exploring how participants' CR experience might facilitate the ability to recognize CR faces when combined with perceiver motivation. In Experiment 1, we demonstrate that motivation translates into superior CR recognition only for perceivers who have relatively extensive prior experience with individuating CR faces. In Experiment 2, we find that a lack of experience with CR faces can be overcome in situations where perceivers are highly motivated to individuate CR faces.</p>

<body>
<p>The own-race bias (ORB) in face memory, or the tendency to more accurately recognize own race (OR) relative to cross-race (CR) faces (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1948550611409759">Malpass &amp; Kravitz, 1969</xref>), is one of the best-validated biases in face perception. Nevertheless, there is considerable theoretical debate surrounding the cause of the ORB (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1948550611409759">Meissner &amp; Brigham, 2001</xref>). Most current theories fall into one of two broad camps: experience (or expertise)<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-1948550611409759">1</xref></sup> accounts and social–cognitive accounts. According to experience accounts, greater experience processing OR relative to CR faces allows for more efficient encoding of OR faces, resulting in more accurate OR recognition (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1948550611409759">Rhodes, Brake, Taylor, &amp; Tan, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1948550611409759">Tanaka, Kiefer, &amp; Bukach, 2004</xref>). Alternately, social–cognitive accounts argue that greater motivation to process the individuating characteristics of OR and CR targets leads to more accurate OR recognition (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1948550611409759">Adams, Pauker, &amp; Weisbuch, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1948550611409759">Hugenberg, Miller, &amp; Claypool, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1948550611409759">Pauker et al., 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Both models have support in the literature. Supporting experience models, discrimination training with CR faces improves CR recognition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1948550611409759">Tanaka &amp; Pierce, 2009</xref>). Similarly, extended exposure to racial out-groups can also improve CR recognition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1948550611409759">Sangrigoli et al., 2005</xref>). Motivated social–cognitive accounts of the ORB have also elicited support. Experimentally induced motives to individuate CR faces substantially improve CR recognition, even in the absence of increased perceptual training (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1948550611409759">Hugenberg et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1948550611409759">Rhodes, Locke, Ewing, &amp; Evangelista, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1948550611409759">Young, Bernstein, &amp; Hugenberg, 2010</xref>). Additionally, CR faces who seem subjectively important (e.g., threatening or powerful) are as well recognized as OR faces (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1948550611409759">Ackerman et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1948550611409759">Shriver &amp; Hugenberg, 2010</xref>). Finally, nonracial in-group/out-group distinctions can elicit ORB-like biases in face recognition, even while holding perceiver experience constant. For example, OR faces belonging to social out-groups are recognized less accurately than OR faces belonging to social in-groups (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1948550611409759">Bernstein, Young, &amp; Hugenberg, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1948550611409759">Rule, Ambady, Adams, &amp; Macrae, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>Thus, there is evidence that both perceiver experience and motivation contribute to the ORB. However, each of these perspectives has failed to account for all of the available evidence. Against the experience account, the effect of intergroup contact on CR face recognition is fickle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1948550611409759">Ng &amp; Lindsay, 1994</xref>), and meta-analytic evidence finds that interracial contact accounts for only 2% of the variance in the ORB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1948550611409759">Meissner &amp; Brigham, 2001</xref>). Motivated social–cognitive accounts of the ORB are also subject to critique. For example, not all the motivational manipulations or in-group/out-group distinctions appear equally successful in creating or eliminating the ORB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1948550611409759">Rhodes, Li, Ewing, Evangelista, &amp; Tanaka, 2010</xref>).</p>
<sec id="section1-1948550611409759">
<title>Toward an Integrative Model</title>
<p>Rather than continuous debate between these two accounts, in the current work we test the integrative Categorization–Individuation Model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1948550611409759">Hugenberg &amp; Sacco, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1948550611409759">Hugenberg, Young, Bernstein, &amp; Sacco, 2010</xref>) that synthesizes experience and motivational/social–cognitive perspectives. According to the Categorization–Individuation Model, perceiver experience and motivation can act conjointly to produce the ORB. Thus, not only do perceivers often have more experience discriminating among OR than among CR faces, but the racial categories themselves serve as a signal that the identities of OR faces are more important to encode than are the identities of CR faces. More provocatively, the Categorization–Individuation Model predicts that perceiver experience and perceiver motivation can interact to create the ORB.</p>
<p>The Categorization–Individuation Model proposes that higher levels of CR experience mean that less effort is required to individuate and remember CR faces, but that experience alone does not translate into strong CR face memory. Instead, such experience translates into strong face recognition most effectively when perceivers are motivated to individuate CR faces. Consequently, the Categorization–Individuation Model predicts that CR experience will facilitate recognition for perceivers motivated to individuate such targets, reducing the ORB via an increase in CR recognition. However, CR experience alone, without such an individuation motive, is predicted to have little effect on CR recognition. Further, this integrative framework predicts that with very high levels of individuation motivation, even the relatively inefficient processing of low-experience perceivers will be sufficient to encode and subsequently remember CR faces well. Plainly stated, when motivation is weak, high- and low-experience perceivers will have equally poor CR recognition. However, at moderate levels of motivation higher levels of experience will facilitate strong CR recognition. Yet, very strong inductions of individuation motives are predicted to elicit strong CR recognition (and eliminate the ORB) for both high- and low-experience perceivers. Thus, the influence of experience on CR face memory will be most notable at moderate levels of motivation.</p>
<p>These predictions are tested in two experiments. Experiment 1 uses a moderate manipulation of the individuation motive (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1948550611409759">Hugenberg et al., 2007</xref>) and provides novel evidence that experience does reduce the ORB, but only in the presence of the individuation motive. Experiment 2 induces a more potent manipulation of the motivation to individuate by exposing participants to angry CR and OR targets. Past work finds that angry CR targets are recognized as well as OR targets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1948550611409759">Ackerman et al., 2006</xref>), a finding attributed to the critical importance of attending to and processing angry faces (Öhman, Lundqvist, &amp; Esteves, 2001). Experiment 2 replicates the capacity of angry faces to eliminate the ORB, but as predicted, this effect is not moderated by perceiver experience. Taken together, these results show that at moderate levels of motivation (experimenter instructions) perceiver experience improves CR recognition; at more extreme levels of motivation, using a stimulus for which perceivers are biologically prepared to attend to and encode (angry faces), motivation alone, but not perceiver experience, improves CR recognition.</p>

<sec id="section3-1948550611409759">
<title>Method</title>
<sec id="section4-1948550611409759">
<title>Participants and design</title>
<p>Sixty White undergraduates participated for course credit. We employed a 2 (Target Race: Own-Race; Cross-Race) × 2 (Instructions Condition: Individuation; Control) × CR Experience (Continuous) design, with target race manipulated within subjects.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1948550611409759">
<title>Materials</title>
<p>Materials consisted of gray-scale images of 80 neutral-expression male faces (40 Black and 40 White), 3 × 3 inches in size, displaying targets' face and hair. These 80 faces were randomly assigned to 2 sets of 40 faces each (20 Black and 20 White). The face set seen during encoding was counterbalanced between subjects.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-1948550611409759">
<title>Procedure</title>
<p>After providing informed consent, participants were seated at computers and instructed that they would participate in a face memory experiment. Subsequent instructions and stimuli were presented via computer. Participants in the control condition were instructed that they would see a series of faces and try to remember those faces for later recognition. Participants in the individuation condition received the same instructions plus an exhortation to “pay close attention to what differentiates one particular face from another face of the same-race, especially when that face is not of the same-race as you” (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1948550611409759">Hugenberg et al., 2007</xref> for full instructions). This manipulation of individuation motivation for CR faces has proven effective at significantly improving CR recognition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1948550611409759">Hugenberg et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1948550611409759">Rhodes et al., 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Next, participants viewed 40 target faces (20 Black and 20 White), presented sequentially for 2 s each, in a random order. After this encoding phase, participants completed an unrelated 5- to 7-min filler task before completing the recognition phase, in which they saw 80 faces presented sequentially. These 80 faces consisted of the 40 faces viewed during encoding (“old” faces) randomly intermixed with 40 novel faces (20 Black and 20 White). Participants were instructed to distinguish between faces seen during encoding (old faces) and novel faces (new faces) via keystroke. Each face was displayed on screen until participants responded, after which the next face was immediately presented.</p>
<p>Following recognition, participants completed a modified version of an interracial contact and experience scale developed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1948550611409759">Hancock and Rhodes (2008)</xref> altered to assess the participants' history of contact with African Americans (sample item: “I interact with African Americans during recreational activities”). For each statement, the participants indicate their agreement on a scale of 1 (<italic>very strongly disagree</italic>) to 6 (<italic>very strongly agree</italic>). This scale indexed participants' CR experience. Upon completion of the scale, participants were debriefed.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-1948550611409759">
<title>Results</title>
<p>Of interest was whether motivation affected the ORB, and whether this effect was more powerful for perceivers with relatively high CR experience. Recognition accuracy was measured using the signal detection index of sensitivity (<italic>d′</italic>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-1948550611409759">2</xref></sup> We calculated separate <italic>d′</italic> scores for OR and CR faces, with higher scores indicating greater recognition accuracy. An ORB index was calculated by subtracting participants' CR <italic>d′</italic> scores from their OR <italic>d′</italic> scores, with higher scores indicating a stronger ORB. Responses to the interracial contact items were averaged to form a composite of interracial experience (α = .825) for each participant.</p>
<p>In preliminary analyses, the ORB difference scores were compared to 0 (no bias) using one-sample <italic>t</italic> tests. The ORB was observed in the control (<italic>M</italic> = .28, <italic>SD</italic> = .70), <italic>t</italic>(28) = 2.12, <italic>p</italic> = .04, but not in the instructions condition (<italic>M</italic> = .23, <italic>SD</italic> = .87), <italic>t</italic>(30) = 1.49, <italic>p</italic> = .14, replicating past research showing that individuation instructions eliminate the ORB. Though these scores did not significantly differ from each other, <italic>t</italic>(58) &lt; 1, this is not surprising, given the prediction that the efficacy of individuation instructions will be most notable for perceivers with relatively high levels of OR processing experience.</p>
<p>Indeed, to test this core hypothesis that interracial experience and perceiver motivation interact to determine the ORB, a regression analysis was conducted with condition (instructions vs. control) as a between-subjects factor and interracial contact (centered) treated as a continuous predictor of the ORB difference score. Importantly, the predicted interaction between contact and condition emerged, <italic>b</italic> = .34, <italic>t</italic> = 2.10, <italic>p</italic> = .041 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1948550611409759">Figure 1</xref>).</p>

</fig>
<p>To better understand this interaction, we examined the relation between experience and the magnitude of the ORB in each condition. If the effect of experience on CR recognition is largest when perceivers are motivated to individuate CR faces, experience should only be related to the ORB in the individuation instructions condition but not in the control condition. As predicted, although CR contact was not correlated with the ORB in the control condition, <italic>r</italic> = −.04, <italic>p</italic> = .86, CR contact was negatively related with the ORB magnitude in the individuation instructions condition, <italic>r</italic> = −.51, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01. Further, correlations between experience and recognition accuracy (i.e., <italic>d′</italic> scores) for CR and OR faces in each condition were analyzed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1948550611409759">Figure 1</xref>). Consistent with the above analyses, in the control condition, experience was unrelated to both CR (<italic>r</italic> = .03, <italic>p</italic> = .89) and OR (<italic>r</italic> = .06, <italic>p</italic> = .76) recognition, and these coefficients did not differ from each other (<italic>Z</italic> = .01, <italic>p</italic> = .93). However, in the instructions condition, experience was positively correlated with CR <italic>d′</italic> scores (<italic>r</italic> = .33, <italic>p</italic> = .07) but not OR recognition (<italic>r</italic> = −.26, <italic>p</italic> = .15), and the magnitude of these correlations was significantly different (<italic>Z</italic> = 2.25, <italic>p</italic> = .03). Thus, as experience increased the magnitude of the ORB decreased, but only when the motive to individuate CR faces was activated.</p>
<sec id="section9-1948550611409759">
<title>Ancillary analyses</title>
<p>Our theory predicts that the reduction of the ORB in the individuation instructions condition would be driven primarily by an increase in CR recognition among high-experience perceivers. To test this hypothesis, we conducted ancillary analyses using a median split on the expertise scale, which allowed us to employ target race as a within-subject variable. Recognition scores (<italic>d′</italic>) were submitted to a 2 (Target Race) × 2 (Instructions Condition) × 2 (Experience: High, Low) mixed-model analysis of variance (ANOVA). This revealed the expected 3-way interaction, <italic>F</italic>(1, 56) = 4.49, <italic>p</italic> = .038, η<sup>2</sup> = .07. To understand this interaction, two separate Target Race × Experience ANOVAs were conducted for each instruction condition.</p>
<p>In the control condition, the 2 × 2 ANOVA revealed a main effect of target race, <italic>F</italic>(1, 27) = 4.46, <italic>p</italic> = .04, η<sup>2</sup> = .14, that did not interact with experience, <italic>F</italic>(1, 27) &lt; 1, <italic>p</italic> = .84, η<sup>2</sup> = .002. Thus, the ORB was not attenuated by experience in the absence of the individuation motive.</p>
<p>In the individuation instruction condition, the 2 × 2 ANOVA revealed a 2-way interaction, <italic>F</italic>(1, 29) = 7.45, <italic>p</italic> = .01, η<sup>2</sup> = .20, representing our negative correlation between experience and the ORB. Paired sample <italic>t</italic> tests revealed that low-experience participants had better OR (<italic>M</italic> = 1.40) than CR (<italic>M</italic> = .79) recognition, <italic>t</italic>(15) = −4.93, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01, <italic>d</italic> = 2.40. However, for high-experience participants, OR (<italic>M</italic> = 1.06) and CR (<italic>M</italic> = 1.23) did not differ, <italic>t</italic>(14) &lt; 1, <italic>p</italic> = .54.</p>
<p>Within the instruction conditions, comparing recognition accuracy for CR targets across high- and low-experience participants finds an increase in the high-experience, relative to the low-experience individuals, <italic>t</italic>(29) = −1.91, <italic>p</italic> = .06, <italic>d</italic> = .71. Comparing OR recognition accuracy for high and low experts finds no differences, <italic>t</italic>(29) = 1.13, <italic>p</italic> = .27, <italic>d</italic> = .42. Thus, the efficacy of the instructions was limited to high-experience participants, who were better able to individuate CR faces than low experts, who still showed the ORB despite the instructions.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-1948550611409759">
<title>Discussion</title>
<p>These results provide novel evidence in support of an integrative model of the ORB by showing that both experience and motivation are simultaneously implicated in eliminating the ORB. The beneficial effects of perceiver motivation on CR recognition are facilitated by experience, but CR experience alone, absent motivation, is insufficient to elicit strong CR recognition. Indeed, experience was unrelated to the ORB in the control condition. It was only in the presence of individuation motives and CR experience that the ORB was eliminated. Overall, these results demonstrate the significance of both CR experience and individuation motivation in the generation and elimination of the ORB.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-1948550611409759">
<title>Experiment 2</title>
<p>Experiment 1 suggests that perceiver motives and experience can act together to induce strong CR face memory. However, this integrative perspective on the ORB also predicts that when highly motivated to individuate CR faces, relatively low levels of experience can be overcome. From this position, even perceivers with comparatively poor CR experience should be able to accurately recognize CR faces when provided sufficient motivation to engage in individuated processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1948550611409759">Hugenberg et al., 2010</xref>). Put simply, low-experience perceivers are not absolutely incapable of recognizing CR faces, but instead need high levels of motivation to overcome the inefficient processing typical of insufficient experience. Experiment 2 was designed to test the hypothesis that more potent inductions of individuation motivation may overcome low CR experience.</p>
<p>To do so, we turned to a universal motivator: angry expressions. Angry faces rapidly capture and hold attention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1948550611409759">Öhman, Lundqvist, &amp; Esteves, 2001</xref>). Moreover, detecting anger has been so critical for human survival that dedicated neural pathways exist for the processing of anger expressions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1948550611409759">Adolphs, 2002</xref>). In short, anger expressions are critical social signals that demand attention and facilitate face memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1948550611409759">Jackson, Wu, Linden, &amp; Raymond, 2009</xref>). Indeed, past research has found that angry CR faces eliminate the ORB via an increase in CR recognition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1948550611409759">Ackerman et al., 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>Consequently, in Experiment 2 we presented White participants with OR and CR (Black) target faces displaying neutral or angry expressions. We expected the ORB to emerge for neutral-expression faces. However, we predicted that expressions of anger would prompt equally accurate recognition of both OR and CR faces, replicating the finding that angry targets eliminate the ORB (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1948550611409759">Ackerman et al., 2006</xref>). Critically, because anger induces a highly potent motive for CR face individuation, we predicted this would eliminate the ORB via an increase in CR recognition for both relatively high- and low-experience participants. In short, we predicted that anger would eliminate the ORB, but unlike Experiment 1, this motivational effect would not interact with perceiver experience.</p>

Participants then completed a 5- to 7-min filler task.</p>
<p>Next, participants completed the recognition phase. Here, participants observed 40 faces, comprised of the 20 faces viewed during encoding (“old” faces) and 20 new faces (10 Black and 10 White, with 5 angry and 5 neutral faces each), in a separate random order for each participant. Participants rendered old/new judgments in the same manner as Experiment 1. Following the recognition phase, participants completed the same modified version of the interracial contact scale (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1948550611409759">Hancock &amp; Rhodes, 2008</xref>; α = .796) employed in Experiment 1 to assess the participants' experience with Black faces. Finally, participants were thanked and debriefed.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>Of interest was how participants' ability to distinguish between new and old faces differed across target race, target expression, and individual differences in interracial contact. Recognition accuracy was measured by calculating separate <italic>d</italic>′ scores for neutral and angry OR and CR faces. Two ORB difference scores were calculated (<italic>d</italic>′<sub>OR</sub> − <italic>d</italic>′<sub>CR</sub>), one for neutral and one for angry faces, with larger scores indicating a larger ORB.</p>
<p>In preliminary analyses, we tested our prediction that the ORB would occur for neutral but not for angry faces. One sample <italic>t</italic> tests confirmed a significant ORB for neutral faces (<italic>M</italic> = .85, <italic>SD</italic> = 1.2), <italic>t</italic>(32) = 4.07, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001, <italic>d</italic> = 1.43, but replicating past research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1948550611409759">Ackerman et al., 2006</xref>), the ORB was eliminated when the participants viewed angry faces (<italic>M</italic> = .20, <italic>SD</italic> = .76), <italic>t</italic>(32) = 1.69, <italic>p</italic> = .10, <italic>d</italic> = .60. Moreover, a comparison of the neutral and angry difference scores finds a reliable decrease in the magnitude of the ORB in the angry condition, <italic>t</italic>(32) = 2.60, <italic>p</italic> = .01, <italic>d</italic> = .91 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1948550611409759">Figure 2</xref>).</p>

<p>A follow-up analysis investigated whether this motivationally induced elimination of the ORB occurred differently across perceiver experience. As predicted, participants' self-reported contact did not correlate with the ORB magnitude for either neutral (<italic>r</italic> = .07, <italic>p</italic> = .70) or angry faces (<italic>r</italic> = −.09, <italic>p</italic> = .64; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1948550611409759">Figure 3</xref>). Thus, although expressions of anger eliminated the ORB, this elimination was not dependent on perceivers' CR experience.</p>

<title>Ancillary analyses</title>
<p>We again conducted ancillary analyses employing an ANOVA on a median split on the contact scale, yielding the benefit of including target race as a within-subject variable to test for differential effects on OR and CR recognition. A 2 (Target Race) × 2 (Target Expression) × 2 (Experience: High, Low) mixed-model ANOVA revealed the main effects of target race, <italic>F</italic>(1, 31) = 15.45, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001, η<sup>2</sup> = .33 (replicating the ORB), as well as target expression, <italic>F</italic>(1, 31) = 4.19, <italic>p</italic> = .049, η<sup>2</sup> = .12, indicating greater recognition accuracy for angry faces. These main effects were qualified by the predicted Target Race × Target Expression interaction, <italic>F</italic>(1, 31) = 6.54, <italic>p</italic> = .02, η<sup>2</sup> = .17.</p>
<p>As noted above, the ORB was observed for faces displaying neutral expressions (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .001) but was eliminated for faces displaying angry expressions (<italic>p</italic> = .10). Additional analyses indicate that target expression did not influence OR recognition (OR<sub>anger</sub>: <italic>M</italic> = 2.31; OR<sub>neutral</sub>: <italic>M</italic> = 2.32), <italic>t</italic>(32) &lt; 1, <italic>p</italic> &gt; .90, but that angry expressions substantially improved CR recognition (CR<sub>anger</sub>: <italic>M</italic> = 2.09; CR<sub>neutral</sub>: <italic>M</italic> = 1.43), <italic>t</italic>(32) = −3.01, <italic>p</italic> = .01, <italic>d =</italic> 1.06. Thus, replicating <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1948550611409759">Ackerman and colleagues (2006)</xref>, the ORB was eliminated for angry faces via an increase in CR recognition.</p>
<p>The higher order interaction of Target Race × Target Expression × Experience did not approach significance, F(1, 31) &lt; 1, p &gt; .90, η<sup>2</sup> &lt; .001. Critically, this demonstrates that participants with both high- and low-CR experience showed the ORB for neutral faces (replicating the Experiment 1 control condition). However, when CR faces were angry and thus highly important to individuate, CR recognition improved for both high- and low-experience participants.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Experiment 2 was designed to demonstrate that a more intense manipulation of individuation motives would eliminate the ORB regardless of perceivers' CR experience. The results confirm that CR faces displaying expressions of anger, a biologically prepotent facial expression that motivates attentional scrutiny (Öhman et al., 2001) and accurate memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1948550611409759">Ackerman et al., 2006</xref>; Jackson et al., 2009) eliminate the ORB, and do so equally for both relatively high- and low-experience perceivers.</p>
<p>Notably, the null effect of experience in this context cannot be easily attributed to a lack of statistical power. For example, a power analysis using the effect size reported by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1948550611409759">Hancock and Rhodes (2008</xref>; adjusted <italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> = .232) indicates that 36 participants provide adequate power to detect an effect using the same index of perceiver experience. Yet, correlations of the magnitude observed in Experiment 2 (<italic>r</italic> = .07 and .09) require more than 700 and 300 participants, respectively, to reach conventional significance. Additional analyses find that our current sample yields an observed power of .78. Also, the significant relationship between experience and ORB magnitude in the instruction condition of Experiment 1 was obtained with a slightly smaller number of participants. The null effect is also not easily attributable to poor measurement of CR experience; past research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1948550611409759">Hancock &amp; Rhodes, 2008</xref>) and our own Experiment 1 indicate that this measure of interracial contact does predict the ORB in some contexts. Further, the current null finding is not readily explained as the result of the small stimulus set leading to an unreliable measure of face memory. Indeed, past research exploring the influence of interracial experience on memory (for neutral expression faces) has found correlations using similarly sized stimulus sets (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1948550611409759">Rhodes et al., 2009</xref>). Other research finds that White participants' self-reported contact with Black individuals predicts their ability to identify a single previously seen Black face (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1948550611409759">Brigham, Maass, Snyder, &amp; Spaulding, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1948550611409759">Platz &amp; Hosch, 1988</xref>). Similarly, the lack of relationship between experience and recognition is also not easily attributable to a ceiling effect for recognition artificially reducing correlations with experience. After correcting for prefect performance, <italic>d′</italic> = 3.38 represents functionally perfect performance. However, recognition accuracy in all cells of the current design falls below this threshold (all one-sample <italic>t</italic>s &gt; 7.09, all <italic>p</italic>s &lt; .001). Thus, recognition performance was not at ceiling. Therefore, although Experiment 1 found that the efficacy of experimentally induced motivation to individuate CR faces was limited to those with greater amounts of contact, more powerful inductions of the individuation motive can improve CR recognition even without much prior experience.</p>

<title>General Discussion</title>
<p>Across two experiments, we provide evidence for a novel, integrative account of the ORB. Rather than positing that either perceiver experience or motivation alone account for the ORB, we instead test a synthetic account (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1948550611409759">Hugenberg et al., 2010</xref>). The ORB is commonly the result of an interaction of both factors, with low levels of CR experience and low levels of perceiver motivation conspiring to create the ORB. Further, the current evidence indicates that neither an experience nor a motivational perspective alone can sufficiently account for the ORB across all contexts. As demonstrated in Experiment 1, the predictive ability of interracial experience is maximized in situations where perceivers have some motivation to encode the identities of CR faces. However, as demonstrated in Experiment 2, high levels of perceiver motivation can overcome relative deficits in CR experience. More specifically, increasing the subjective importance of CR faces by making them angry (and thus highly self-relevant, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1948550611409759">Öhman et al., 2001</xref>) allows even low-experience perceivers to improve their recognition accuracy.</p>
<p>Thus, when motivation to individuate CR faces is raised to high levels, in this case via the use of a biologically prepotent signal of threat, it seems motivation alone, absence of high levels of CR experience, can eliminate the ORB. Although face expertise is tuned to one’s own race (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1948550611409759">Michel, Rossion, Han, Chung, &amp; Caldara, 2006</xref>), most humans have extensive expertise at face processing more generally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1948550611409759">Tanaka, 2001</xref>), and this general ability appears sufficient to individuate even CR faces when perceiver motivation is at a sufficiently high level. Processing CR faces is almost certainly more challenging for perceivers with relatively poor CR experience, and therefore greater motivation may be required for these low-experience participants to devote the attention and the processing effort needed to recognize CR faces more accurately. However, this ability for low-experience perceivers to improve their CR recognition accuracy under very high motivation conditions likely only occurs because of the high levels of preexisting face expertise perceivers have already gained (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1948550611409759">Tanaka, 2001</xref>). Using nonface stimuli with which participants have virtually no expertise, such as greebles (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1948550611409759">Gauthier &amp; Tarr, 1997</xref>), may render even high levels of motivation less effective in improving within-category discrimination.</p>
<p>Future research should explore how interracial experience and motivational factors determine face memory in racially diverse samples. Importantly, there is evidence that the motivation to individuate CR faces stands at higher baseline levels in racially disadvantaged groups. To illustrate, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1948550611409759">Wright, Boyd, and Tredoux (2003)</xref> report that South African Black participants recognize White faces better than Black faces (i.e., a reverse ORB) even when the faces were all neutrally expressive. Notably, Blacks are the racial majority in South Africa and racial segregation is commonplace, meaning the interracial contact is relatively infrequent. Yet, South African Blacks have historically been disadvantaged. As a result, the CR recognition advantage observed by Wright et al. may reflect high baseline motivation to recognize a socially powerful out-group (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1948550611409759">Shriver &amp; Hugenberg, 2010</xref>) and more generally indicates that motivation may differ at baseline between racial groups. Notably, the pattern found by Wright and colleagues is consistent with the Categorization–Individuation Model, in that social and motivational factors can overcome relative deficits in CR face-processing experience.</p>
<p>Lastly, subsequent work may benefit from directly testing the mechanism through which motivation translates into improved CR recognition accuracy. One possibility is motivationally determined processing style differences. Many theorists have proposed that differential interracial experience leads to qualitatively distinct modes of processing OR and CR faces, with strong OR face memory being supported by relatively efficient configural encoding and poor CR recognition stemming from inefficient component-based processing (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1948550611409759">Hancock &amp; Rhodes, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1948550611409759">Michel et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1948550611409759">Rhodes et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1948550611409759">Tanaka et al., 2004</xref>). However, recent evidence indicates that these processing modes can be cued by manipulations that alter motivation and social relevance but hold constant factors such as race and intergroup experience (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1948550611409759">Hugenberg &amp; Corneille, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1948550611409759">Young &amp; Hugenberg, 2010</xref>). Thus, these differential processing styles are subject to conceptually similar manipulations as those used here and may be implicated in determining the accuracy of both OR and CR recognition in a given context.</p>
<sec id="section23-1948550611409759">
<title>Implications of a Synthetic Model of the ORB</title>
<p>The current work provides a first step toward genuine theoretical integration. Rather than serving as competing mechanism, perceiver experience and motivation can work together to create and eliminate the ORB in an interactive fashion. We believe that this integrative analysis provides a more fruitful means of understanding when and how experience and motivation affect face memory. Indeed, these findings may also begin to clarify some of the troubling discrepancies of experience and motivational/social–cognitive models of the ORB. For example, one well-documented concern with experience theories is the fickle nature of the experience–ORB relationship (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1948550611409759">Meissner &amp; Brigham, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1948550611409759">Ng &amp; Lindsay, 1994</xref>). Rather than attribute this weak relationship to poor measurement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1948550611409759">Sporer, 2001</xref>), the current perspective may provide a more theoretically gratifying explanation: the relationship between CR experience and CR recognition is dependent on perceiver motivation and this previously unaccounted for moderating factor that may explain the seemingly inconsistent results.</p>
<p>Finally, the current findings are partly compatible with previous models of the ORB. For example, the feature-selection model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1948550611409759">Levin, 1996</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1948550611409759">2000</xref>) suggests that the ORB is the result of perceivers quickly processing CR faces in a categorical manner, while instead processing OR faces in a more deliberate and individuated mode. From this perspective, the current findings may reflect motivational factors eliminating the ORB by virtue of inducing perceivers to move beyond categorical processing of CR targets, thereby improving recognition. Notably, the categorization-individuation model explicitly predicts that shifts in attention to category or individuating information predict the ORB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1948550611409759">Hugenberg et al., 2010</xref>). However, the categorization-individuation model uniquely predicts the current findings by explicitly addressing the influence of motives on face recognition, while making interactive predictions regarding perceiver motivation and interracial experience. Thus, the current results mark a clear advantage of a synthetic account of the ORB, namely that multiple processes can be hypothesized to co-act in theoretically novel ways.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>The current experiments present an initial test of hypotheses drawn from the Categorization–Individuation Model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1948550611409759">Hugenberg et al., 2010</xref>) and indicate that experience and motivation are both causal factors in the ORB. While future directions remain to be explored, the current results clearly outline the initial circumstances under which experience and motivational variables will both interact and operate separately to eliminate the ORB. Given the standing tension between perceptual and social/motivational perspectives on recognition biases, we believe the current studies represent a meaningful step toward a novel synthesis of two theories of the own-race bias.</p>
