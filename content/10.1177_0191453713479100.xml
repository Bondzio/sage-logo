It is divided into two parts, which will appear in two consecutive issues of <italic>Philosophy &amp; Social Criticism</italic>, 39(4–5) and 39(6). Part 1 proceeds by constructing an ideal type of political secularism, and then discussing the innovative American model of constitutional dualism regarding religion that combined constitutional protection for the freedom of religious conscience and exercise with the principle of non-establishment. The article analyses the strengths and limits of the ‘separation– accommodation’ frame that became hegemonic in 1<sup>st</sup> amendment jurisprudence from the 1940s to the 1990s. It challenges the standard caricature of the American model as strictly separationist and privatizing. It then critically assesses two contemporary alternatives to that frame: the integrationist approach and the equal liberty approach. The first, disguised as a concern for pluralism and fairness, challenges ‘separation’ and political secularism in a subtle attack on the non-establishment principle, aimed at drastically narrowing its scope. Successes of this approach in recent Supreme Court jurisprudence and politics have triggered a response by liberal egalitarians. The author addresses this response – the equal liberty model – in part 2, which will appear in <italic>Philosophy &amp; Social Criticism </italic>39(6), arguing that although on the right track, it fails to find a middle ground between political secularism and integration.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Constitutional democracy</kwd><kwd>equality</kwd><kwd>freedom of religion</kwd><kwd>non-establishment</kwd><kwd>political secularism</kwd><kwd>political theology</kwd><kwd>sovereignty </kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><disp-quote><p>Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof.

Savvy advocates of political religion deploy this rhetoric to narrow the scope of establishment clause restrictions on the use of public power and authority to aid or endorse religious activities. Settled constitutional law is being undermined in the name of ‘neutrality’ to all groups, while talk of separation and political secularism are cast as hostile to religion. Yet legal privileges for religious groups are still demanded, despite the principle of equal treatment that is now invoked. ‘Freedom of religion’ apparently requires that the state support religion, and the autonomy of religious association, while refraining from ‘intrusively’ regulating religious practice. The idea is to have it both ways: Religion is and is not special. </p><p>While this rhetoric has been around for some time, what is distinctive about the current context is that a majority on the Supreme Court now seems ready to revolutionize our constitutional understandings accordingly. In the name of religious freedom, recent Court rulings have undermined citizens’ standing to challenge state and federal establishments or to gain redress for discrimination on the basis of disability and other grounds by religious employers running schools, universities, hospitals, drug treatment centers, etc.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0191453713479100">1</xref></sup> In the most notorious recent case, ‘Obama-care’ barely escaped a ‘freedom of religion’ challenge (to its federally mandated contraception coverage under health insurance plans) thanks only to extensive opt-outs provided to ‘religious employers’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0191453713479100">2</xref></sup> Despite generous tax exemptions and other ‘indirect’ aid, the Court continues to uphold immunities from federal labor laws protecting the right of workers to organize and bargain collectively in enterprises owned by religious organizations.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0191453713479100">3</xref></sup> Moreover, state laws providing ‘indirect’ funding of religious organizations and schools, along with various endorsements of religion in displays on public property, have also been upheld.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0191453713479100">4</xref></sup> </p><p>Proponents see all this as a sign that American constitutional law is becoming more congruent with the religious nature of the American people and with international human rights law protecting religious freedom.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0191453713479100">5</xref></sup> The latter is unsurprising since there is no codified non-establishment principle in international law.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0191453713479100">6</xref></sup> Attacks on separation, non-establishment and political secularism in domestic constitutions are hardly restricted to the US. But in a world where politicized religious organizations (often with transnational links) seek public presence, privileges, tax support, their own jurisdictions, and authority as legitimating sources of law in democratic civil states, in the name of ‘freedom of religion’, the survival of other freedoms and rights, and indeed of liberal constitutional democracy itself – a political form premised on ‘political secularism’ and equal liberty for all individuals – is everywhere at risk. </p><p>In this article I defend a capacious understanding of the non-establishment principle, as crucial for protecting the core normative principles of liberal constitutional democracy. I also defend ‘political secularism’ and a suitably formulated ‘separationist’ understanding of it. Neither presupposes that the state must refrain from regulating religion, or that religion must be relegated to the private sphere. As will become clear, political secularism constitutive of a civil liberal-democratic republic does not entail the decline of religion, nor does it presuppose a secular, irreligious society or privilege a comprehensive ‘secularist’ ethical worldview.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0191453713479100">7</xref></sup> But it does require a baseline of separation and, ideally, a constitutionalized non-establishment principle alongside constitutional protection for the liberty of conscience and free exercise of religion. I argue that the American founders ultimately got it right when they constitutionalized two religion clauses along these lines.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-0191453713479100">8</xref></sup> <italic>This innovative constitutional formula, the first of its kind, enabled religious actors and the democratic civil state to develop the requisite autonomy and capacity to pursue their own distinctive and legitimate ends.</italic> Yet it did not accord absolute autonomy or untrammeled self-determination to religious association (a type of ‘strict separation’ tantamount to dual sovereignty). Nor did it coopt religion for civic purposes or require congruence between the norms of religious and democratic political association. Instead, the dualistic formula provided the basis for the regulation of religious self-regulation so that it comports with liberal democratic and critical republican constitutional principles. A dualistic constitutional framework along these lines is indispensible for securing the liberties of individual conscience and religious association, as well as the political principles central to a civil democratic polity: equal civil standing and political freedom for all citizens and the pursuit of genuinely public purposes by the political community as a whole. Constitutional dualism, in short, helps make liberal democracy work. Contemporary advocates of political religion and its twin, political theology, aim at a counter-project of reintegration of theology and politics aptly labeled ‘constitutional theocracy’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-0191453713479100">9</xref></sup> Given the success of this project in many parts of the world, the stakes are high indeed. </p><p>I begin by constructing an ideal type of political secularism appropriate to a democratic polity (I). I then turn to the standard jurisprudential approach to the American establishment clause since its incorporation in 1947, the separation–accommodation frame, discussing the strengths and weaknesses of this version of constitutional dualism (II). The next two sections take up critiques and alternatives to that frame. The partisans of ‘political’ religion attack separation, seeking to replace it with an ‘integrationist paradigm’, in the hopes of reducing the establishment clause to a mere adjunct to free exercise. That their attack on separation is also an attack on political secularism is made clear by their core slogan: ‘the American state is and should be religiously pluralistic, not secular’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-0191453713479100">10</xref></sup> I argue that their project is not to defend religious freedom or public religious expression, both long protected in the US, nor to ensure that vulnerable members of religious minorities are treated as equal citizens, nor even to secure fair treatment for diverse and public forms of religious practice. Rather the stake for integrationists politicizing religion is influence over the state – to make public policy and public law congruent with pro-religious views, to suffuse the public sphere with religious symbols, and to back up religious commitments and rules with state authority and/or sanctions. So that this form of religious populism can succeed, the establishment clause has to be radically restricted. For it is the principle of non-establishment that prevents religious groups from using state power and authority to impose their views on the rest of us or to help enforce their special laws on their members (III). Sections IV and V will appear in Part 2 of this piece. There I will discuss how an innovative liberal alternative, both to separation and to the integrationist project, has emerged, dubbed the ‘equal liberty’ approach. The egalitarians’ argument that separation rhetoric cannot provide clear guidelines in the epoch of the regulatory state with respect to religion–state relations is correct. But the equal liberty approach, focused on issues of discrimination against minorities, throws out the baby with the bathwater when it denies that religion requires special constitutional attention and rejects the separation frame as unworkable and anachronistic. Its reductionist analysis screens out democratic and civil republican values that transcend the anti-discrimination principles it relies on, inadvertently playing into the hands of the populist integrationists. Moreover this approach fails to apply equal liberty principles ‘all the way down’ despite the abandonment of the separation– accommodation frame and despite its focus on liberty of conscience (IV). I argue for reorienting, rather than replacing, that discursive frame with a radicalized equality analysis. Equal liberty properly construed can help provide criteria for determining when an accommodation, a regulation or no regulation of religion, is appropriate. But it must be supplemented by other values – democratic and civil republican. Together these can orient line-drawing in a dualist constitutional framework predicated on symbolic separation and institutional differentiation but requiring flexibility with respect to regulation and accommodation (V). I conclude with a typology of the forms of regulation that are warranted under the conditions of the contemporary regulatory state, now the target and prize of politicized religion. </p><sec id="section1-0191453713479100"><title>I Political secularism, separation and non-establishment</title><p>Political secularism and separation are part of a field of ideal-typical relations between religion and the state. Rajeev Bhargava has argued that a democratic constitutional civil state may be disconnected from religion on three levels: <italic>ends</italic>, <italic>institutions</italic> and <italic>law and public policy</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-0191453713479100">11</xref></sup> The <italic>ends</italic> of a politically secular state are distinct and free-standing. Salvation, the truth of religious doctrines, and the ultimate meaning of life are not political ends and the state is ill-suited to pursue them.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-0191453713479100">12</xref></sup> The second level of disconnect is <italic>institutional</italic>: the offices, institutions and structures of the civil state and religious organizations are disaggregated. Bhargava takes this to mean that political secularism requires non-establishment: no state privilege, penalties, or official status for any religion.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-0191453713479100">13</xref></sup> The third level pertains to <italic>laws and policy</italic>. Here, flexibility is advisable – a constitutional democracy based on equal citizenship may require intrusive regulation of religion and indeed of some religions more than others as in the Indian case that made penalties attached to untouchables and suttee illegal.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn14-0191453713479100">14</xref></sup> </p><p>The point is that liberal constitutional democracy must be politically secular, and is predicated on separation on the first two levels. I agree that a state can be interventionist with respect to religion without relinquishing either its politically secular or its liberal-democratic constitutionalist character, and without undermining the principle of religious freedom, provided that its regulations target unjust restrictions on freedom, morally indefensible inequalities and restriction of capabilities, inter-communal domination and so forth. Indeed from a legal perspective the idea of ‘strict separation’ is incoherent because the state, qua sovereign, with the presumptive legal supremacy and monopoly over publically relevant law-making, governs religious conduct to the extent to which it commands or permits it.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn15-0191453713479100">15</xref></sup> The sovereign state cannot avoid regulating religion. Even when its policy is to accord religious groups a great deal of autonomy it must decide which groups are religious and what form of autonomy with respect to which practices they may have. Accordingly, separation is a type of state policy with respect to religion. From the sociological point of view, however, there is separation as soon as the modern and especially the democratic constitutional sovereign state comes into existence, for it is ipso facto characterized by its differentiation and relative autonomy from civil society and religion.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn16-0191453713479100">16</xref></sup></p><p>But we need more distinctions. There are four more levels on which religion and the state can be disconnected pertinent to constructing an ideal type of political secularism, of importance to democratic theory: the level of <italic>legitimacy</italic>; the level of <italic>justification</italic> of public law and policy; the level of <italic>power and jurisdiction</italic>; and the <italic>symbolic level of recognition–endorsement</italic>. As for <italic>legitimacy</italic> of constitutional essentials and ultimate foundational authority, political secularism requires differentiation and mutual autonomy between religion and the state. A politically secular constitutional democracy is incompatible with a fusion of sources for authority or of principles of political obligation between the religious and the civic. Democratic legitimacy and constitutional authority must be immanent, reflexive, fallible and contestable by those subject to it. Religious legitimacy tends to be grounded in absolute truths, transcendent sources, unquestionable authorities and meta-social guarantees. Differentiation rather than merger of foundational authority and legitimacy for the religious and the civil orders respectively are thus required with regard to constitutional essentials and public law. This rules out the duality typical of constitutional theocracies that ground the legitimacy of the state and its constitution on religious sources alongside democratic civil sources and it rules out a dual system of courts adjudicating relevant legal matters. </p><p>The <italic>level of justification</italic> of public law and policy is related to this yet is analytically distinct. At issue is the type of reasons offered by public officials and the citizenry. Unless translated into ‘public reason’, religious reasons exclude those who do not share the faith and who could not understand or accept them as their own.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn17-0191453713479100">17</xref></sup> Political secularism requires this-worldly justifications for coercive public laws and policy, which, unlike religious reasons, everyone can, in principle, accept and which can become the stuff of compromise. Separation on this level is important because the kind of disagreement religious reasons entail cannot be resolved discursively across faiths. Epistemic standards of publicness in the sense of accessibility of reasons are requisite to a democratic civil polity predicated on equal citizens with an equal right to justification regarding coercive public law and policy. Whether this means that only public officials should refrain from giving religious reasons to justify law and policy or whether there is also a ‘duty of civility’ for citizens to translate their religious views into public reasons is hotly debated.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn18-0191453713479100">18</xref></sup> Since political secularism pertains to the separation of church and state, not to the articulation of religious beliefs by the citizenry, it entails only the former position.</p><p>Religion and the state can also be disconnected on the level of <italic>power and jurisdiction</italic>. Political secularism associated with the modern state presupposes that the latter is sovereign: the supreme authority within a territory. The state has the monopoly over coercive legal power. As supreme, it may regulate any human activity including religion. Indeed, every modern constitution has clauses referring to religion. It is this law that unilaterally determines the relative autonomy, degree of self-regulation and acceptable practices of religious organizations.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn19-0191453713479100">19</xref></sup> Thus differentiation and separation cannot mean no relation between religion and the state. In a democratic republic, freedom of association is a constitutional essential and this includes religious association, but the latter must be voluntary, it must not violate individuals’ other basic constitutional rights and it may not exercise coercive public power.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn20-0191453713479100">20</xref></sup> </p><p>This does not mean that there is no such thing as religious ‘law’ or that religious authorities do not have power over members. It does mean that if the state enforces ‘autonomous’ religious law or delegates its law-making power to religious authorities, as per ‘multicultural jurisdiction’ or ‘legal pluralism’, political secularism is undermined.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn21-0191453713479100">21</xref></sup> Such enforcement or delegation would have two possible consequences: either religious ‘law’ would lose its relative autonomy and become state law, since everything the sovereign’s law touches becomes its law, thus turning it into a form of single or multiple establishment; or if religious authorities’ law-making capacity were really fully autonomous and sealed off to state jurisdiction, regulation and delimitation, the authority of the state’s sovereign legal order would be impugned, public political power fragmented, and equal citizenship in the political community seriously compromised.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn22-0191453713479100">22</xref></sup> Politicized segmental pluralism undermining the unity of the polity – a sort of neo-medievalism – would rear its ugly head. Political secularism and non-establishment exclude mergers of state and religious law along these lines, while the egalitarian principles of democratic constitutionalism preclude ascribing jurisdiction over civil law to religious groups. </p><p>Finally there is the <italic>symbolic</italic> level on which religion and the state may be connected or separated. At stake are symbolic power and its exclusionary effects on the citizenry attendant upon official endorsements of religion, even absent state coercion, distributive injustice, or the denial of individual rights. A distinctive problem arises when the prestige of the democratic constitutional state is symbolically connected to religious understandings as when it promotes religious symbols (or prayers) or permits their display in the public buildings, schools, on public land, etc. Even if they do not pronounce on doctrinal truths, endorsements symbolically connect the state to religion sending the message that non-adherents are not really one of ‘us’ whatever their legal citizenship status.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn23-0191453713479100">23</xref></sup> State endorsements conflate religious with political identity, creating insiders and outsiders, making a citizen’s civic standing in the community turn on religious affiliation. This opens the path to other sorts of informal discrimination on the basis of religion. Political secularism requires that political institutions, public spaces and national identity are civic, so that every citizen can come to see them also as her or his own and be considered full and equal members of the polity. As others have pointed out, endorsements do not necessarily violate liberal distributive justice-based principles, freedom of conscience, or individual rights.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn24-0191453713479100">24</xref></sup> But close connection of the state to the symbols of one or more religion undermines the inclusive, egalitarian, civic and independent character of the ‘<italic>res publica</italic>’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn25-0191453713479100">25</xref></sup> </p><p>That is why it is important to understand that dualistic democratic constitutionalism aims to protect individuals’ and minorities’ religious liberty from the state, <italic>and</italic> to shield the political values and legitimate public purposes of the democratic civil state from encroachment by powerful religious factions.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn26-0191453713479100">26</xref></sup> That is also why in the US at least, symbolic endorsements can be challenged under the establishment clause. </p><p>As I have constructed it, political secularism is an ideal type with a range of possible subtypes, depending on the combination of variables. Existing constitutional democracies could be assessed accordingly. But recall that every empirical entity is a hybrid and none will fully approximate the ideal type. Thus ‘laic’ states like France and Turkey, states with ‘vestigial’ establishments like Britain, Denmark and Greece, states with an established religion and legal pluralism in personal law like Israel, states without an established religion but with religious legal pluralism like India, states that collect a ‘church tax’ and funnel the funds to certain officially recognized religious organizations like Germany and states with constitutional guarantees against establishment and for free exercise like the US can be situated along the spectrum of ideal types and subtypes of political secularism and constitutional democracy.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn27-0191453713479100">27</xref></sup> All of these separate religion and the state on the key levels of ends, institutions, legitimation and justification but they vary with respect to the other levels. They thus can be assessed in terms of the degree to which they fulfill the egalitarian principles of democratic constitutionalism in the domain of religion–state relations. </p><p>Falling off the map of political secularism are two types at opposite ends of the spectrum: theocratic and caesaro-papist states. Ideal-typically both integrate religion and the state on all the levels discussed above, in varying degrees. The former subordinates the secular to the theological: religious authorities and institutions partially or fully merge with and control the state, religious legitimacy is predominant, law and public policy are deemed to be God’s law or must conform with religious principles. Religious authorities, in extreme versions, control the selection of political authorities and decide the norms regulating society. Today Iran comes closest to this.</p><p>The latter invert these relations, subordinating clerics to temporal rulers. A term coined by Max Weber, a caesaro-papist ruler, ‘exercises supreme authority in ecclesiastic matters by virtue of his autonomous legitimacy’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn28-0191453713479100">28</xref></sup> <italic>Raison d’état</italic> can be mixed with sacro-magical principles like divine right, as was the case with the old regime in western Europe. In its extreme form, the head of state is also the head of the Church fusing the power structures of church and state at the top. In less extreme forms, caesaro-papist rulers establish one official religion, make church membership compulsory, regulate church doctrines and rituals, and play a key role in appointing church officials and finances, and in enforcing conformity. </p><p>Every absolute monarchy in Europe established caesaro-papist regimes, in conjunction with the state-making processes. The principle ‘<italic>cuius regio eius religio</italic>’ was linked to ‘Erastianism’ – state supremacy and interference in church governance and ecclesiastical matters.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn29-0191453713479100">29</xref></sup> Indeed the establishment of a Church was, in these contexts, a means to assert state control over religion for state purposes. Christendom in the sense of compulsory, geographically defined established Churches prevailed throughout Europe, distinctions between various Protestant and Roman Catholic versions notwithstanding. In each case the state established a national Church, partially merging with it so as to subordinate priestly to secular power and to foreclose the emergence of relatively autonomous religious organizations within civil society. Typically legal jurisdiction over members with respect to personal law and education was granted to certain minority religions (Jews), creating multiple establishments always hierarchically inferior to the dominant established one. Later, more aggressive forms of Erastianism ranging from strict policies of privatization to attempts to eradicate religion have their roots here, as do the milder forms of establishment that go together with religious toleration, societal secularization, and the decline of religiosity, characteristic of much of western Europe today.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn30-0191453713479100">30</xref></sup></p><p>The first politically secular democratic constitutional state, the US, was the outstanding exception to the Erastian trend. The federal constitution coupled with the bill of rights made a radical symbolic break with previous European approaches to church–state relations. It eschewed even the ‘liberal’ version advocated by Locke that was gradually institutionalized in various European countries, extending toleration to minority religions while maintaining an established Church. Indeed, the US chose a different route to that of the ‘twin tolerations’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn31-0191453713479100">31</xref></sup> Instead of the couple establishment–toleration it chose non-establishment and equality. Instead of removing disabilities for minority religions and tolerating them while retaining legal privileges for the dominant national Churches, the US Constitution instituted equality and disconnection. The constitutional dualism of the 1<sup>st</sup> amendment, guaranteeing the free exercise of religion and non-establishment on the national level, thus laid the ground for two important innovations. First, it allowed religion to become an autonomous civil society institution, facilitating religious pluralism, freedom of individual conscience and voluntary association.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn32-0191453713479100">32</xref></sup> Second, it fostered the creation of a modern civil, liberal constitutional democratic republic that brought religion–state relations into alignment with democratic principles of equal citizenship, and participatory parity in public, political spheres of life. There are multiple ways of construing the 1<sup>st</sup> amendment’s religion clauses. But the basic principle undergirding and linking them to liberal democracy is constitutional dualism: constitutional guarantees that protect the state from religion, religion from the state, and promote equal citizenship for all. There are also various conceptual ways to capture the idea of dualism, ranging from the minimalist and typically non-egalitarian ‘twin tolerations’ approach to the more demanding free exercise–non-establishment model.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn33-0191453713479100">33</xref></sup> Finally there are a variety of paradigms or ways of conceptualizing what free exercise, non-establishment and separation mean. I turn to a discussion of the separation–accommodation frame that was hegemonic in the US from the 1940s incorporation of the religion clauses until the 1990s, and which is now under attack.</p></sec><sec id="section2-0191453713479100"><title>II The separation–accommodation frame</title><p> The US Constitution makes no mention of a transcendent authoritative source, nor does it define America as Christian.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn34-0191453713479100">34</xref></sup> The text has only two references to religion, both negative. Article 6 declares that ‘no religious test shall ever be required as a qualification to any office or public trust under the United States’. The second place is the 1<sup>st</sup> amendment. The founders created a constitutional-democratic federal civil republic, whose mottos on its seals were ‘<italic>novus ordo seculorum</italic>’ and ‘<italic>e pluribus unum</italic>’. They were intent on preventing the federal polity from becoming a political stake in the competition among the diverse religious groups. The risks of divisiveness, injustice and oppression by a religious majority inherent in religious factionalism could be avoided only if a civil republic were created that guaranteed freedom of religious worship to all and accorded the political power of the state to none.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn35-0191453713479100">35</xref></sup> </p><p>Yet neither the word ‘secular’ nor the phrase ‘separation of church and state’ appear in the Constitution. And there has long been contestation over the meaning of the religion clauses. One side of the ideological divide insists that America always understood itself as a Christian nation and that Christianity is the ultimate foundation of the religious liberty secured in the Constitution. The ‘god in the constitution’ discourse first appeared in the 19th century and has resurfaced periodically ever since.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn36-0191453713479100">36</xref></sup> Here the stress is on the theological sources of the religion clauses: congregational Puritanism and Free Church evangelicalism (Baptists among others). The former conceived of church and state as two separate covenantal associations. Puritan-controlled Massachusetts thus legally separated church and state institutionally and with respect to personnel.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn37-0191453713479100">37</xref></sup> But to the Puritan, separation did not entail disestablishment or toleration. The other ‘religious source’, Dissenting Protestantism, thought separation should go together with non-establishment, although both were advocated for theological reasons, to protect the purity of religion from external sources of corruption and to secure religious freedom. Liberty of conscience, freedom of religious association, prohibition of religious establishments, religious tests and of governmental interference in and aid to religion, even in the form of ‘non-preferentialism’, were all required for the sake of true and uncorrupted religious principles:individual faith and voluntarism. Thus Baptists argued against the idea of a Christian commonwealth.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn38-0191453713479100">38</xref></sup> But rejection of an established official Church, and of laws imposing disabilities and penalties on Dissenters or funneling tax monies to dominant denominations, was not meant to challenge the generally Christian identity of the nation, nor did it mean that religiously based morals should not be legislated or taught in the schools. </p><p>The other side of the ideological divide typically stresses the political, ‘enlightenment-liberal’ and/or ‘civic republican’ sources and underpinning of the religion clauses in the ‘godless constitution’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn39-0191453713479100">39</xref></sup> Accordingly, a key goal of the establishment clause was to protect the liberal-democratic republic and individual rights and liberties against religious authoritarianism. If organized (corporate) religion merges with the state the risk is oppression and autocracy. Enlightenment thinkers argued for a ‘wall of separation’ between church and state (Jefferson) and for a ‘perfect separation between ecclesiastical and civil matters’ (Madison), viewing their combination as akin to a ‘mule animal’, capable only of destroying but not reproducing liberty (Paine).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn40-0191453713479100">40</xref></sup> The state should neither direct its laws to religious purposes nor base them on religious premises. While the ‘enlightenment liberal’ view stressing individual autonomy and rights was in the minority at the time, liberal individualism spread during the 19th century and there was a growing consensus that non-establishment – the legal and institutional separation of church and state – is important for republican liberty. The fact that by 1833 state legislators dismantled all of the remaining state establishments seems to confirm this. But the republican political theory informing the drafting of the religion clauses came in two distinctive forms. ‘Civic’, ‘civil-religion’ republicanism was premised on the assumption that a virtuous citizenry is necessary in a republic. Thus the state should inculcate a set of common values based on religion, to underpin morality and orient citizens to the common good. Civic republicans had an instrumental attitude toward religion viewing it as an essential pillar of a civil society and a stable republic. A common, non-denomi-national, shared, homogeneous religious ethos drawn from Christian understandings should thus become what Benjamin Franklin called the ‘Publick Religion’, to counterbalance inevitable factionalism and egoism in a large, diverse, commercial republic like the US. Its moral premises should be taught in the schools, imbue the public space and inform the common law.</p><p>However, there was a second republican tradition informing the religion clauses that dropped these classical civic republicanism assumptions.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn41-0191453713479100">41</xref></sup> What I shall call ‘civil’ republicanism sought republican political remedies for republican political ills. Accordingly connections between church and state tend to degrade civil society, and to foster the spiritual tyranny that invariably subtends political tyranny. The public good is undermined, not reinforced, by politically inflected religion. Instead of trying to create homogeneity through a civil-religion or a non-denominational Christianity, republican constitutionalism should embrace the plurality in civil society and design controls for its effects in political society. The use of religion to homogenize beliefs, habits and mores would result only in oppression and persecution, undermining the republic instead of preserving it.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn42-0191453713479100">42</xref></sup> Madison’s Federalist 10 is clearest on this point; arguing that a plurality of religious sects is salutary, when coupled with well-designed republican institutions that block the emergence of powerful religious–political factions. Civil republicans like Paine, Madison and Jefferson (all also ‘enlightenment liberals’) thus sought a constitution that secured liberty of conscience and free exercise while preventing state support for, connection with, endorsement or establishment of any and all religion.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn43-0191453713479100">43</xref></sup> Pluralism, free popular government, diversity of interests, could lead to factional conflicts. The remedy is separation and institutional designs preventing the emergence of politicized religious factions. Non-establishment was embraced not simply to protect religious liberty but, equally important, to protect the civil polity, republican freedom and democratic equality from religious authoritarianism. <italic>The establishment clause was not deemed a mere adjunct to the free exercise of religion, and the legitimacy of the religion clauses taken together was not theological but political, based on liberal-republican principles</italic>.</p><p>The egalitarian model of constitutional dualism and political secularism established on the federal level in the US thus had multiple sources. While both sides of the ideological divide sought to negotiate the meanings of non-establishment, separation and freedom of religion, what is striking is that they could reach an overlapping consensus regarding the overall framework of the 1<sup>st</sup> amendment. It came to be seen, by all but the most extreme, as a way to secure individual liberties against state-backed religious authoritarianism and to protect the liberal democratic republic from religious faction and majority tyranny. </p><p>Since the 1947 Supreme Court’s <italic>Everson</italic> decision formally made the establishment clause applicable to the states, the main jurisprudential battles have been over substantive laws and policies, the stakes being the place of religion in the public schools, in family law, in civil and official public spheres, and in state financial support.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn44-0191453713479100">44</xref></sup> Fluctuations notwithstanding, the overarching discursive frame for interpreting both clauses and American political secularism up to the 1990s was ‘separationist’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn45-0191453713479100">45</xref></sup> It is this frame that is challenged by contemporary critics of establishment clause jurisprudence. But it is important to understand what this frame entailed. Instead of misleadingly opposing ‘strict separationists’ depicted as comprehensive secular ideologues to accommodationists depicted as religious fundamentalists, we should construe separation as the overarching discursive and symbolic frame with which most juridical actors operated although they differed over what that entailed. Religion advocates pushed for exemptions, indirect funding, and expanded symbolic public presence of religion but they accepted America’s constitutionalized political secularism, and the basic separationist frame for both religion clauses. <italic>Indeed free exercise could not exist as an independent norm until non-establishment removed the idea that the former is dependent on the ‘toleration’ by the majority</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn46-0191453713479100">46</xref></sup> Only in conjunction with non-establishment and the separation logic that subtends it could exemptions for minority religious groups from generally applicable law (accommodation) become conceivable. Moreover, the more emphatic separationists on the Court also embraced accommodation, with respect to free exercise and establishment issues when they thought that liberty and equality of religious conscience was at stake.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn47-0191453713479100">47</xref></sup> <italic>In short, the separationist era of constitutional jurisprudence from 1947 to 1990 was also accommodationist.</italic><sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn48-0191453713479100">48</xref></sup> The Court’s apparently inconsistent application of separationist ideals involved flexibility regarding context and was not unprincipled – rather, considerations of equal citizenship and equal liberty tended to preclude or counterbalance ‘strict separationist’ ideology.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn49-0191453713479100">49</xref></sup> Despite the rhetoric, this jurisprudence was never rigidly separationist, yet <italic>pace</italic> its contemporary critics on the left and on the right, the discourse of separation did, nonetheless, do important equality- and democracy-reinforcing work.</p><p>The main themes in the separation–accommodation paradigm are that the religious majority cannot use its political dominance to enlist the government to endorse or advance its sectarian interests; citizens’ religious views (or lack of them) are irrelevant to their political status; rules regarding religious establishments are national rules prohibiting local religious majorities from exercising their dominance over minorities; and it is impermissible for the government to enforce any collective assertion of ultimate religious value.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn50-0191453713479100">50</xref></sup> </p><p>These themes rest on a set of basic principles that are distinct yet interrelated. It is not convincing to reduce the religion clauses to one underlying master value or function.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn51-0191453713479100">51</xref></sup> Nor is the separation of religion and state itself the ultimate value – it is important because of the more basic values it supports.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn52-0191453713479100">52</xref></sup> Indeed, unless one approaches the establishment clause in light of the plurality of the values behind it, one could not make sense of the fact that different groups from Baptist fundamentalists to enlightenment liberals, democrats, civic and civil republicans supported it. Nor could one understand the shifting meanings associated with non-establishment since the founding, the civil war and up to our own day.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn53-0191453713479100">53</xref></sup> Like all constitutional principles, meanings are contested and evolve over time, and learning about the moral and political stakes has always accompanied such shifts.</p><p>The incorporated establishment clause was linked, in the jurisprudence of this period to the following political values: (1) the liberty of individual conscience and expression (non-coercion, free exercise); (2) the freedom of religious organization (voluntary association); (3) equal citizenship irrespective of religion (equality of status, anti-discrimination); (4) religious and moral diversity in civil society (plurality); (5) protection against the ascription of state power to religious elites shoring up their dominance (non-domination); (6) protection of the political community through bracketing of religious faction tied to competition for state power and largess (civil republican constitutionalism); and last, but hardly least, (7) protection of democracy by ensuring the autonomy of the state from religious authority, and by requiring public-regarding reasons for law and policy (political freedom, voice, democracy).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn54-0191453713479100">54</xref> </sup></p><p>Despite its use of strict separation rhetoric, the Court’s ‘legal secularism’ did not preclude accommodation of religion when these values seemed to require it. Indeed, one can find the strongest separation language in the majority opinion in <italic>Everson</italic>, a case that accommodated religion. Chief Justice Black, writing for the majority, revived Jefferson’s metaphor stating that the 1<sup>st</sup> amendment erected a ‘wall between church and state which must be kept high and impregnable’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn55-0191453713479100">55</xref></sup> Yet this decision upheld a state law requiring reimbursement of parents for children’s bus fares to religious schools!<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn56-0191453713479100">56</xref></sup> </p><p>The Court’s apparent inconsistencies between rhetoric and practice subsequent to <italic>Everson</italic> have led some to argue that as a doctrine, separation was too indeterminate and rigid a standard to guide judges.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn57-0191453713479100">57</xref></sup> It is true that in many of the cases decided prior to the 1990s, the values subtending separationist rhetoric such as equality, liberty, impartiality and fairness did much of the work. Moreover the Court tempered the strict separation language over time accordingly, explicitly granting that ‘The line of separation, far from being a “wall” is a blurred indistinct and variable barrier depending on all the circumstances of a particular relationship’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn58-0191453713479100">58</xref></sup> <italic>But it is wrong to ignore the symbolic and practical impact of separationist rhetoric</italic>. The Court’s repeated avowal of the principle of separation mattered.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn59-0191453713479100">59</xref></sup> On the symbolic level it shored up the notion that the separation of church and state is a defining ideal of American constitutionalism nourishing an egalitarian political culture that links non-establishment and political secularism to democracy and fairness.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn60-0191453713479100">60</xref></sup> Continuous rhetorical invocation of <italic>separation as the baseline</italic> shaped Court decisions even when its actual holdings have been accommodating of religion. It forced the Court to justify exemptions from general laws for religious groups and indirect state support in political secular terms, as required by a legitimate political principle (liberty of conscience, non-discrimination against religious minorities, equal citizenship, etc.). Repeated avowal of the norm also constrained the ability of lower courts to do an end-run around the establishment clause by deferring to local majorities.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn61-0191453713479100">61</xref></sup> Permitting exemptions from general laws under the free exercise clause when basic equality and liberties are at stake, and indirect state help when public services given to all were at issue but no discrimination or endorsement were involved (non-violation of public purposes), the separation–accommodation frame did not undermine liberal democratic, critical- or civil-republican principles. </p><p>The separation baseline does require criteria, however, and much of the debate was about the doctrinal translation of the relevant values. In a 1971 case striking down a statute reimbursing religious schools for the costs of teaching secular subjects, the famous Lemon test devised a standard on separationist grounds that could be accommodating of religion when appropriate.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn62-0191453713479100">62</xref></sup> The three-part doctrinal test required laws to have (1) a secular purpose; (2) a primary effect that neither advances nor inhibits religion; and (3) no <italic>excessive</italic> entanglement of church and state.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn63-0191453713479100">63</xref></sup> For the next 43 years, the discourse of separation, secular purpose and entanglement coupled with de facto accommodation was the relevant establishment clause jurisprudence.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn64-0191453713479100">64</xref></sup> To be sure, subsequent to <italic>Lemon</italic> v. <italic>Kurtzman</italic>, the Court enunciated at least 9 other constitutional standards for enforcing the establishment clause, some aimed at expanding, others at restricting its reach.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn65-0191453713479100">65</xref></sup> O’Connor’s famous ‘endorsement test’ in the 1984 <italic>Lynch</italic> case modified the first two prongs of the Lemon test to ask ‘whether government’s actual purpose is to endorse or disapprove of religion’ and ‘whether, irrespective of government’s actual purpose, the practice under review in fact conveys a message of endorsement or disapproval’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn66-0191453713479100">66</xref></sup> The ‘endorsement test’ put the spotlight on public displays of religion supported by government. Insofar as state-sponsored displays send a message of exclusion and unequal citizenship-status to non-adherents, O’Connor argued that they would fail under the establishment clause.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn67-0191453713479100">67</xref></sup> The endorsement concept could be used to help refine the Lemon test, supplementing it with a standard explaining the importance of separation in cases where no coercion or individual right is at issue, but in which political equality of religious (and secular) minorities is at stake. </p><p>By the 1990s, however, the words ‘secular purpose’ began to disappear from establishment clause jurisprudence and <italic>Lemon</italic> was all but abandoned.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn68-0191453713479100">68</xref></sup> With the plurality decision in the landmark 2000 case of <italic>Mitchell</italic> v. <italic>Helms</italic>, regarding direct government aid for religious schools, it became clear that the endorsement test could be used to radically shift establishment clause jurisprudence away from its separation baseline in favor of a new integrationist understanding by the Court of equal treatment as ‘non-preferentialism’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn69-0191453713479100">69</xref></sup> Accordingly state ‘neutrality’ would now mean that the state should not ‘prefer’ one religion over another, endorse religion over irreligion, or irreligion over religion. Apart from these restrictions, it must treat religion and non-religion ‘neutrally’, i.e. equally!<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn70-0191453713479100">70</xref></sup> No state endorsement of religion was found to exist in <italic>Mitchell</italic> because the aid was equally available to all. Indeed the Court now argued, under the influence of the blossoming integrationist paradigm, that treating religious schools differently than other schools under the new neutrality and reoriented endorsement tests, would indicate hostility to religion!<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn71-0191453713479100">71</xref></sup> Instead of extending non-establishment principles to cover non-coercive state action that might have fallen through the cracks of the Lemon test, the endorsement test has been used to eviscerate them. It was also in this period that the separation–accommodation frame as a whole came under concerted attack. The challenges come not only from activists on the religious right and sympathetic jurists who now constitute a majority on the Court, but also from the religious left and liberal political secularists in the academy who do not share the former’s agenda. Both sides seem to want to operate between the poles of theocracy and Erastianism. More and more they are skeptical that what comes in-between can be represented as separation or even as political secularism. The Erastian alternative is dead for the United States and under attack wherever it still exists (France, Turkey, Great Britain) for violating ‘freedom of religion’ guaranteed in international human rights documents. But ‘constitutional’ theocracy and its cousins – religious legal pluralism, ‘mild’ and/or ‘multiple establishments’ – have not been laid to rest, and political religion is on the rise around the globe. </p></sec><sec id="section3-0191453713479100"><title>III Alternatives to separation: The integrationist paradigm</title><p> That is why the eagerness of the majority on the Roberts’ Court to replace the separationist frame of the 1<sup>st</sup> amendment with a new ‘integrationist’ paradigm is alarming.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn72-0191453713479100">72</xref></sup> Two important establishment clause decisions by that Court radically restrict the ability of plaintiffs to use their taxpayer status to obtain standing to challenge state financing of religious activity.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn73-0191453713479100">73</xref></sup> The school funding ‘voucher’ cases since <italic>Mitchell</italic> upheld ‘indirect’ state aid, as not violating the establishment clause because government is ‘neutral’ between religion and non-religion and the use of the aid by parents was an exercise of their choice, not direct government action.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn74-0191453713479100">74</xref></sup> Another recent decision extended the notion of ministerial exception to include teachers of secular subjects in religious schools, shielding the employer from federal anti-discrimination law on the basis of disability.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn75-0191453713479100">75</xref></sup> But make no mistake: the new majority on the Court is not interested in accommodating or protecting religious minorities. Rather in the name of restoring ‘evenhandedness’ (‘neutrality’) between religion and non-religion and the ‘freedom of religion’, the new paradigm would defer to legislative, religious majorities (or coalitions of religious groups) that manage to capture control of government (especially on the local level) and use it to endorse, fund and support their brands of religion, ‘family law’ and education.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn76-0191453713479100">76</xref></sup> The goal of the ‘integrationist’ paradigm is to establish a new baseline of coordination between religion and the state. When taken together and considered with other recent rulings, it is clear that what had been the constitutional approach of a minority of justices, in the late 1980s and early 1990s, expressed in their dissents, has now become the majority’s position on the Court.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn77-0191453713479100">77</xref></sup> This portends a radical reinterpretation of the entire constitutional approach toward the establishment clause. </p><p>At the heart of the new paradigm are six themes diametrically opposed to the assumptions undergirding the separation–accommodation frame: (1) the US is a religious country, its government is structured around the culture’s religious principles and precepts; (2) the religious majority should be allowed to influence the government; (3) local religious majorities have a legitimate interest in infusing their community’s public sphere with religious displays; (4) moral and theological relativism is not a constitutional command and government is not required to avoid incorporating moral religious absolutes into its legal mandates; (5) religion is intrinsically valuable and ‘free’ autonomous religious association is indispensible for cultivating the moral dispositions vital to a democratic republic; and (6) government should engage in non-sectarian, ‘non-preferential’ support of religion so long as it treats it in an evenhanded way with non-religion, passes facially neutral laws, enables individual choice and does not permit religious coercion especially in the public schools.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn78-0191453713479100">78</xref></sup> </p><p>These postulates are backed up by a strident critique of the separation paradigm. Before turning to this, it is important to emphasize that the Supreme Court does not act in a vacuum. It exists today in a domestic political context in which, unlike in countries in western Europe, there is a significant link between conservative politics and conservative religion in the US thanks to large numbers of evangelicals heavily concentrated in the South and the Midwest, mobilized by the ‘religious Right’ linked to the Republican Party. This distinctive constellation has helped conservative religious groups and their allies become politically effective regionally and on the national level even though they by no means constitute a national majority.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn79-0191453713479100">79</xref></sup> Indeed over the past 50 years the US has become more, not less, religiously diverse and it too has experienced an upward trend in the number of secular citizens.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn80-0191453713479100">80</xref></sup> Nevertheless, the shift from earlier Dissenting (Baptist) separationism, to today’s evangelical integralism allied with other conservative yet politicized religious entrepreneurs, is striking.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn81-0191453713479100">81</xref></sup> </p><p>Indeed, the ‘separation is hostile to religion’ discourse has now become a cornerstone of the integrationist position. This is curious in the American context, because the distinctive political secularism of the 1<sup>st</sup> amendment has long been credited as being religion-friendly – for fostering the flourishing of religion, religious diversity, and a highly churchgoing civil society! Nevertheless, the rallying cry of ‘freedom of religion’ is now invoked to drive a wedge between the establishment clause and the separation model and to dramatically narrow the scope of the former. Here I discuss two critiques from this perspective. </p><p>The first rests on an analysis that traces the success of the ‘ideology’ of separation to 19th-century nativist anti-Roman Catholicism.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn82-0191453713479100">82</xref></sup> Accordingly, Jefferson’s ‘wall’ metaphor and the idea of strict separation between church and state became the dominant rhetoric only in the mid-19th century and then, again, in the mid-20th because it suited the anti-Roman Catholic cause championed by Protestants fearing challenges to the de facto establishment of their religion in American culture and in the common schools.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn83-0191453713479100">83</xref></sup> Anti-Roman Catholicism allegedly motivated Chief Justice Black’s majority opinion in <italic>Everson</italic>, as it did the earlier infamous ‘Blaine amendments’ to state constitutions enshrining church–state separation particularly with respect to the funding of religious schools.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn84-0191453713479100">84</xref></sup></p><p> The strategy of this analysis is threefold: (1) to present separation as an ideology whose genesis and success are due to hostility to a particular religion; (2) to characterize separation in terms of its most extreme version; and (3) thereby to discredit separation and political secularism as extrinsic to the original purpose of the establishment clause, to the subsequent state disestablishments and to the general culture, then and now. Accordingly, Americans supported the intermingling of religious morality and public law (state morals legislation) at the founding and have ever since. Non-establishment did not and does not require separation, if separation means bans on the presence of religion in the public sphere, on neutral (‘fair’) public support for religion and religious education, or on laws that benefit religion or legislate religiously based morality. Instead, the historical record allegedly shows that non-establishment was meant only to preclude an official Church, direct coercion and legal discrimination against religious minorities.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn85-0191453713479100">85</xref></sup> </p><p>But this approach clearly uses history as ideology, as one cogent critic aptly puts it.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn86-0191453713479100">86</xref></sup> For it is unpersuasive to reduce the separation frame to a strict position no one believes in. It is also incoherent to attack the <italic>Everson</italic> separation–accommodation frame as anti-Roman Catholic since that was the decision that effectively ended Protestant non-sectarian de facto establishment.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn87-0191453713479100">87</xref></sup> Finally, even if the historical account were not misleadingly one-sided, one should avoid confusing genesis with structure. It is unconvincing to align contemporary interpretations of the meaning of non-establishment with understandings at the time of the founding or during the 19th century, as if interpretations of all constitutional provisions and rights do not shift over time.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn88-0191453713479100">88</xref></sup> Moreover, this particular analysis distorts the historical record. There were separationist principles associated with the establishment clause from the beginning and their extension to cover non-coercive actions of executives and legislatures that have accrued to modern understandings of what constitutes establishment cannot be discredited through this sort of historicist argumentation. Nevertheless, this analysis has influenced key justices on the Court and fits with the attempt of some to restrict the establishment clause to a non-coercion principle.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn89-0191453713479100">89</xref></sup> </p><p>There is another historical argument against separation put forth by the integrationists.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn90-0191453713479100">90</xref></sup> This version grants that separation was linked to the establishment clause at the founding, but in a one-directional way, to foster the freedom of religion, not to create a ‘secularized society’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn91-0191453713479100">91</xref></sup> Far from being tied to any political secular project, the constitutional separation of church and federal government and subsequent disestablishments on the state level were meant not to limit churches or religion, but rather to limit government with respect to both.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn92-0191453713479100">92</xref></sup> The religion clauses are allegedly predicated on a structure and logic of limited government. The idea was to free civil society from government control and regulation so that free enterprise, voluntary civil and religious association, etc., could flourish.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn93-0191453713479100">93</xref></sup> </p><p>In the contemporary context of the omni-competent regulatory state, however, separation is deemed an anachronism.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn94-0191453713479100">94</xref></sup> Church–state conflicts over funding, public display and education allegedly arise ‘not because of religious encroachments on the secular but because of governmental encroachments on the private’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn95-0191453713479100">95</xref></sup> In this context, separation unfairly disadvantages religious citizens. Once the regulatory state takes over functions formerly carried out by religious organizations, once it funds privately administered non-religious programs performing public services, once it provides other groups with benefits, subsidies, tax exemptions, etc., the game changes for those allegedly concerned with ‘religious freedom’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn96-0191453713479100">96</xref></sup> Turning the establishment clause on its head, the integrationists argue that to support, endorse, give tax-breaks to, or fund non-religious speech, schools, charities, or hospitals while refusing to do the same for religious speech or enterprise is discriminatory, undermines political equality and reveals hostility to religion.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn97-0191453713479100">97</xref></sup> Accordingly today free exercise requires state support for religion. Government funding does not violate, indeed it may even be required by the establishment clause!<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn98-0191453713479100">98</xref></sup></p><p>The Court has increasingly embraced this stance. Justice Kennedy already argued in a 1989 public display case that using the 1<sup>st</sup> amendment to rigorously enforce the separation of church and state would require government in all its multifaceted roles to acknowledge only the secular, to the exclusion and so to the detriment of religion.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn99-0191453713479100">99</xref></sup> He suggested that as the modern administrative state expands, it is difficult to maintain the fiction that requiring government to avoid all assistance to religion can in fairness be viewed as serving the goal of neutrality.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn100-0191453713479100">100</xref></sup> In his plurality opinion in <italic>Mitchell</italic> v. <italic>Helms</italic> (2000), Justice Thomas argued that were the government to exclude religious institutions from an educational funding program that was otherwise directed at public schools, it might run afoul of the Free Exercise clause! Accordingly, the religion clauses require government to include sectarian institutions in any public benefits program that finances secular aspects of the same activity.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn101-0191453713479100">101</xref></sup> So long as the law is facially neutral, individuals have a choice, funding is ‘indirect’, and does not privilege one religion over another; government aid to religious groups does not mean that it is endorsing their religious message or coercing taxpayers to support religion.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn102-0191453713479100">102</xref></sup> </p><p>Needless to say, this sort of ‘neutrality’ analysis is the opposite of the neutrality doctrine entailed in a separation–accommodation frame. The latter presupposed that separation is necessary (no aid, no hindrance) in order for the state to be impartial towards all religious groups, to protect freedom of individual conscience, and to avoid entanglement with any.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn103-0191453713479100">103</xref></sup> No funding went together with very little regulation. Now, however, the integrationists want it both ways: a regulatory state that ‘indirectly’ and substantially funds and supports, but does not ‘intrusively’ regulate, religion. That is why they declare the state to be religiously pluralistic, not secular.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn104-0191453713479100">104</xref></sup> When it comes to the regulating of religious self-regulation, the integrationists are very ‘separationist’ indeed. Insofar as it pertains to restrictions on funding, endorsements and the political influence of religious organizations, separation is rejected but it is insisted upon with respect to the autonomy of religious association irrespective of whether governmental aid is given or not. This effectively nukes the establishment clause.</p><p>While capitalizing on anti-discrimination and equality discourses to get ‘indirect’ funding and public presence, the integrationist approach nevertheless is not focused on constitutional accommodation or protection for religious minorities. The alliance between conservative Roman Catholics and evangelicals that began in the 1980s portrays itself as ‘the people’, i.e. as the moral majority.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn105-0191453713479100">105</xref></sup> This too has surfaced in Court opinions. The ‘deference to democratic majorities’ argument has been made most clearly by Justice Scalia in a telling dissent.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn106-0191453713479100">106</xref></sup> He insists the establishment clause does not preclude government from endorsing the existence of God or the religious beliefs of the ‘vast majority’ of American citizens.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn107-0191453713479100">107</xref></sup> Indeed, religion, Scalia asserts, cannot be practised ‘in secret’ – it requires public celebration.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn108-0191453713479100">108</xref></sup> So the religious majority should be able to infuse their religious beliefs into the public spheres and government. </p><p>Hence come the restrictions on the standing of individuals to challenge governmental endorsement and the use of public funds to ‘indirectly’ aid religion under the establishment clause. The integrationists on the Court now defend what they consider to be the ‘moral majority’ in America, while in other contexts claiming to protect religious freedom against discrimination by secularists.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn109-0191453713479100">109</xref></sup> This approach also informs the position of Justice Thomas who denies that the 14th amendment incorporated the establishment clause.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn110-0191453713479100">110</xref></sup> In what amounts to a revived state rightist perspective, the integrationists on the Court suggest that disputes over symbolic endorsement or ‘indirect subsidies’ should be left to the ‘political process’. Together with standing restrictions, this would effectively de-constitutionalize the establishment clause. No ‘secular purpose’ should be required for such subsidies and no questions regarding the fostering of religion are deemed pertinent to the integrationist understanding non-establishment. The idea is to remove roadblocks put up by the separationist–accommodation frame to the infusion into law and public policy of religious symbolism and values of groups who succeed in capturing government through the democratic electoral process. Indeed, there is, accordingly, nothing constitutionally amiss with public endorsement of the dominant religion, or of an ecumenical version of religion in general. </p><p>The theory of democracy at work here is a form of populist majoritarianism.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn111-0191453713479100">111</xref></sup> It is downright weird to see this embraced by Supreme Court justices! The US has never been a pure majoritarian democracy and constitutionalism here precludes the unqualified rule of simple majorities.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn112-0191453713479100">112</xref></sup> The gambit is obviously to change the baseline between political religion and the state. As we are in an epoch of state interventionism, separation talk allegedly has to go. Since the regulatory state penetrates society and separation is impossible, the project of a ‘religious people’ has to be one of reintegrating religion into the state by restricting the scope and reach of the establishment clause, and by expanding the political influence of religion. <italic>Indeed, not protection from but rather control over the regulatory state, is now at stake in the struggle</italic>. Obstacles put up by the separation–accommodation frame to the infusion into law and public policy of religion via the ‘democratic process’ have to be dismantled. But the idea is still to have it both ways: religious influence on the state, use of the state largess and power to fund and foster religion but no state interference in or regulation of ‘autonomous’ religious organizations. Indeed some integrationists also expressly endorse religious legal pluralism, under the guise of ‘accommodation’ demanding not only autonomy and immunity from the civil law of the state, but also the power to legally enforce, with state help, religious law on members of religious communities over a range of activities (family law, education), denying the normative superiority and authority of the state.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn113-0191453713479100">113</xref></sup> Strong versions of this approach envision a polity comprised of pluralist self-governing religious associations or ‘nomos’ communities with which the state must share its sovereignty.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn114-0191453713479100">114</xref></sup> Put this all together and we indeed arrive at a new ‘mule animal’ – an allegedly democratic version of the old millet system.</p><p>Were this project to succeed, the result would not be the ‘mild’ single or multiple establishments typical of some European democracies. For, the latter became mild only after Erastianism did its work, i.e. with the decline of religiosity among their citizenry. The outcome in the US would be different – more akin to Hirschl’s ideal type of constitutional theocracy in which religious and secular ends, justifications and even legitimacies merge, religious majority coalitions have their views enforced, a nexus of ecumenical religious bodies and tribunals is granted jurisdiction over recognized religious groups and operates in lieu of or in tandem with a civil court system with minimal state regulation of the internal processes.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn115-0191453713479100">115</xref></sup> This would indeed bring us into the domain of constitutional multiple establishments, and at best a minimalist ‘twin toleration’ regime. So far this has been blocked by the 1<sup>st</sup> amendment and the political secularism it instituted. If successful, the integrationist project of political religion would shift the constitutional settlement toward the theocratic rather than the Erastian end of the spectrum.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="other" id="fn118-0191453713479100"><p>*Part 2 of this article will appear in issue 39(6) of Philosophy and Social Criticism.</p></fn><fn fn-type="other" id="fn116-0191453713479100"><p>A version of this article was presented at the Reset-Dialogues İstanbul Seminars 2012 (‘The Promises of Democracy in Troubled Times’) that took place at İstanbul Bilgi University from 19–24 May 2012.</p></fn></fn-group><notes><title>Notes</title><fn-group><fn fn-type="other" id="fn117-0191453713479100"><p>A version of this article was presented at the Reset-Dialogues İstanbul Seminars 2012 (‘The Promises of Democracy in Troubled Times’) that took place at İstanbul Bilgi University on 19–24 May 2012.

A politically secular state does not require a unified worldview among the population nor is political secularism one itself. Whether a civil, politically secular state presupposes not only religious plurality but also ‘secularity’, i.e. a background condition of the social, cultural and structural context (and social imaginary) that constructs religion and secularism (non-belief) as one option among others, is not clear.

Twin toleration involves creating minimal boundaries of freedom of action for political institutions vis-à-vis religious authorities and for religious individuals and groups vis-à-vis political institutions. This does not preclude established religion with legal privileges. The focus is on toleration, not equality, and the argument is that democracy is compatible with the twin tolerations. This is correct from a ‘transitions to democracy’ and comparative politics perspective. From a normative perspective, however, establishment conflicts with the egalitarian premises and legitimating principles of a democratic republic. I argue that, ideally, democracy coupled with constitutional protections of fundamental rights requires more than toleration: it requires equality, political secularism and non-establishment.</p></fn><fn fn-type="other" id="fn32-0191453713479100"><label>32.</label><p>Jose Casanova, <italic>Public Religion in the Modern World</italic> (Chicago, IL: University of Chicago Press, 1994), pp. 1–11, 135–210.</p></fn><fn fn-type="other" id="fn33-0191453713479100"><label>33.</label><p>The twin tolerations is one version of what Amy Gutmann has called two-way protection but it is an inferior model from the normative democratic perspective compared with a version of political secularism that rests on democratic legitimation, guarantees liberty of conscience, free exercise and non-establishment so that no religion is privileged by the civil state and such that the latter draws its legitimacy from immanent political sources. See Gutmann, ‘Religion and State in the United States’. Next to this, a toleration–establishment model is normatively deficient from a democratic point of view. My point is not to deprive any really existing tolerant democracy with established religions of the moniker ‘democratic’. I agree with Stepan. A country’s ability to implement the principle of differentiation directly affects the successful development of democracy. Thus my point is that countries would be more democratic and more just were they to disestablish all religions, thereby treating all their citizens as equal members of the polity. It is also to argue against efforts to reduce the scope of non-establishment norms where they do exist in the name of accommodating majority or minority religious beliefs or practices. Toleration is a liberal but not yet a democratic ideal. Indeed it is liberal in the wrong way, if it does not extend to individual freedom of conscience but only pertains to religious groups. </p></fn><fn fn-type="other" id="fn34-0191453713479100"><label>34.</label><p>See Isaac Krammnick and R.

In <italic>Everson</italic>, until recently, neutrality meant ‘equipoise’ between aiding and harming religion on the terrain of the separation-accommodation frame (no aid, no hindrance). This allowed the establishment clause to counterbalance the free exercise clause. This principle of neutrality was then linked to standards such as secular purpose and non-entanglement. But the_<italic>Mitchell</italic> plurality reduced neutrality as equipoise to the sole test in funding cases and redefined it to mean ‘evenhandedness’ in aiding religion and non-religion. This, he rightly says, is a radical break that integrationist decisions followed. See <italic>Zelman</italic> <underline>v.</underline><italic>Simmons-Harris</italic>, in which a majority of the court including Justices Rhenquist, O’Connor, Scalia, Kennedy and Thomas affirmed the constitutionality of a school voucher program by which the state funded the ‘private choices’ of parents to send their children to sectarian religious schools on allegedly neutral grounds of evenhandedness and choice. The latest step in this trajectory was taken in <italic>Arizona Christian Schools</italic> in which taxpayer standing was denied for challenging funding for school tuition organizations funneling money to religious schools under the establishment clause because the funding was ‘indirect’.

Publicly honoring the Ten Commandments is thus indistinguishable, insofar as discriminating against other religions is concerned, from publicly honoring God. Both practices are recognized across such a broad and diverse range of the population – from Christians to Muslims – that they cannot be reasonably understood as a government endorsement of a particular religious viewpoint.’ Apart from the inaccuracies of this sociological description of religiosity in America, which relies on a census that excludes Hawaii and Alaska, Scalia fails to mention that it (nonetheless) found a total of 19.6% of Americans who give no religious affiliation or refused to reply to the question. He is perfectly happy to exclude from the majority mix Hindus, Buddhists, other polytheists or those with other forms of religious beliefs, not to mention religions that strongly endorse separation and non-believers.
