<abstract>
<p>Organ trafficking is an illegal means of meeting the shortage of transplants. The activity flourishes for several interacting reasons, such as medical needs, poverty and criminality. Other factors are fundamental conceptual structures such as the dream of the regenerative body as well as the view of the body as an object of utility and an object of value. The article aims to go behind the normative discussions that usually surround organ trafficking. Why this is happening, and what the societal consequences are, is examined through ethnographic fieldwork. The focus is on the shadow economies that govern existence and in which people, goods, weapons, money, bodies, etc. constitute components of the global market.</p>

<sec id="section1-0963662510372735">
<title>1. Background</title>
<p>On 12 August 2007 the State of Israel initiated an historic legal case. In the prisoners’ dock stood Muhammed Taha Jeeth and his partners. The indictment concerned five crimes relating to unlawful trade in human organs.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0963662510372735">1</xref></sup> The case was seen as a precedent. This is because organ sellers seldom turn to the courts, which means that even though organ brokers may be well known, no indictments are brought against them. Two of the accused were sentenced to four years in prison. Dr. Zis, a physician with a background in Moldova, was arrested in Ukraine.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0963662510372735">2</xref></sup></p>
<p>This case is an example of illegal means of meeting the shortage of transplants. In most countries, the trade is criminalized.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0963662510372735">3</xref></sup> In discussions of how the criminality should be countered, propaganda is produced primarily for organ transplantations to be based on altruism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0963662510372735">Delmonico, 2009</xref>). At the same time, voices are heard wanting to inaugurate a state-sanctioned organ trade to curtail the black market.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0963662510372735">4</xref></sup> The normative line of reasoning on how the organ trade should be handled is conducted primarily by physicians, ethicists and jurists. My ambition is to go behind the normative discussions that usually surround organ trafficking and investigate the process in itself.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0963662510372735">5</xref></sup> This means approaching individuals who are prerequisites for the trade, to illuminate policymaking discussions, and drawing up guidelines for how to respond to organ trafficking.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-0963662510372735">
<title>2. Purpose and material</title>
<p>I assume that alongside the social and material circumstances that drive organ trafficking, certain conceptual structures have significance for how the trade is done. I lean towards the critical cultural science which points out that power structures are connected to conceptions of the body (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0963662510372735">Lock and Scheper-Hughes, 1996</xref>). One of the more fundamental conceptual structures that pervade today’s biomedical society is the dream of the regenerative body as well as the view of the body as an object of utility. That is, knowledge about the body and that inner parts are interchangeable. The perception of how this body of ours should be used occurs against the light of a moral mobilization in which people, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0963662510372735">Rose (1999)</xref> discusses, are expected to be responsible, not least for their own health (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0963662510372735">Augustin, 2007</xref>). Transplant medicine, where citizens receive and donate organs, is an arena in which the view of the body and assumptions about responsibility are given concrete expression. This social economy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0963662510372735">Waldby, 2002</xref>: 305) might be challenged when demand is greater than supply. This means that an illegal organ economy can arise where responsibility is defined in new ways and where organ sellers – in the same way as biological resources used in health care and in the pharmaceutical industry – are reduced to commodities and circulated as global bodies on an international black market (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0963662510372735">Lundin, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>My empirical focus is on places where regular shadow economies – with reference to Nordstrom’s discussion of global shadow zones – govern existence and where goods, weapons, money, people and bodies, etc. constitute components of the international market (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0963662510372735">Nordstrom, 2004</xref>). The approach is ethnographic and the material – collected from Moldova and Israel – consists of observations, interviews and reports from authorities in these countries and global media reporting.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0963662510372735">6</xref></sup> I did studies in Moldova during two trips in 2008, when I accompanied the work of different non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and participated in meetings in villages where the organ trade existed. In addition, I interviewed people who have sold their organs, doctors and personnel in the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) as well as in the International Organization for Migration (IOM) in Chisinau. These latter meetings elucidated the links between Moldova and Israel – two countries, as discussed by Scheper-Hughes (2001), linked with each other through trafficking.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0963662510372735">7</xref></sup> This led me in 2009 to Israel’s National Coordinator of the Battle against Trafficking in Persons and the Israeli office of the public prosecutor, and instigated interviews with organ sellers. The article is arranged as follows. A selection of concrete cases from Israel and Moldova is presented. I then discuss how these organ sellers are viewed – by their surroundings and various NGOs – as revolving around the pair of opposites, “victim” and “responsible individual.” I argue that categorizations of this kind are morally loaded and relate to the view of the body and to transplantations generally. Finally, specific Moldovan and Israeli material is placed in a global context.</p>

<sec id="section3-0963662510372735">
<title>3. “Wanted – kidney donor”</title>
<p>Preceding the arrest of the two organ brokers in Israel a given pattern took place. The defendant Muhammed Ben Taha Jeeth, posing as a licensed physician, advertised in the Arabic newspapers <italic>Panorama</italic> and <italic>Kol Al-Arab</italic> with the following text: “Wanted – kidney donor of any blood type – blood type unimportant – a monetary prize during the convalescence – Dr. Muhammed 054–4423827.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-0963662510372735">8</xref></sup> Those who answered the advertisement were offered the opportunity to sell one of their kidneys. Some accepted at once; others were undecided but considered themselves forced due to threats by the organ broker. Next, all underwent a series of medical tests and were then transported to Ukraine, where Muhammed Ben Taha Jeeth’s partner, Dr. Zis, surgically removed the organ from their bodies. These kidneys were then transplanted into foreign patients who had each paid US$125,000–$135,000. Of the sellers, none received anything close to the promised sum of money; all, however, suffered physical and mental harm.</p>
<p>Among those who responded to Dr. Muhammed’s advertisement in <italic>Panorama</italic> and <italic>Kol Al-Arab</italic> was H.H.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-0963662510372735">9</xref></sup> The then twenty-two-year-old man suffered from health problems and had incurred debts in supporting his family. Dr. Muhammed offered H.H. US$7,000 – “or even a bit more.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-0963662510372735">10</xref></sup> H.H. did not hesitate to carry out the sale of the kidney but regretted it afterwards when he received only US$3,500. All attempts to get the promised sum were fruitless. Instead he was told that the sale had been illegal and that the result of protests would be that “both of them could be arrested.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-0963662510372735">11</xref></sup> Since the operation H.H. has had chronic difficulties that reduce his ability to work, and he finds himself today in an economic situation that is at least as difficult as before he sold his kidney.</p>
<p>Another person who responded to the advertisement was S.A., a single mother of two daughters. Since she had difficulty supporting her family on her income as a cleaning woman, she contacted Dr. Muhammed. Unlike H.H., S.A. regretted her decision immediately but was subjected to veiled threats, such as that she “would go to Paradise” if she did not undergo the operation,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-0963662510372735">12</xref></sup> and was locked in Dr. Muhammed’s home in Haifa until the transplantation. After the operation S.A. received half the promised sum of money. When she protested she was told that she had participated in a criminal activity and was silenced with a blow to her face. Today, S.A. has a disfiguring thirty-centimetre scar on her body and still suffers from the aftermath of the operation.</p>

</fig>
<p>H.H. and S.A. are two of five people who read Dr. Muhammed’s advertisement in 2007 and who – despite threats, and understanding that they had unlawfully participated in organ trafficking – decided to testify against the organ brokers. This is unusual. Organ trafficking is a widespread phenomenon in which parties involved seldom go to trial. Reasons for this should be sought in everything from global to national and individual situations. It may be due to authorities in some poor countries turning a blind eye to the trade and to medical tourism, since it can yield economic gains for influential groups in the society. It may also be a matter of the involvement of authorities themselves, e.g. through trading in organs from executed prisoners, as in China, Taiwan and Singapore (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0963662510372735">Westall et al., 2008</xref>). Other causes may be that in certain countries, as reported from Pakistan and India, there are situations almost resembling serfdom in which poor farmers can buy themselves free only by selling their organs to the landowner, who then conveys these body parts further (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0963662510372735">“Inside Story,” 2008</xref>). The trade may even be maintained by sellers taking on the role of organ broker themselves and then involving their families in the activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0963662510372735">Budiani-Saberi and Delmonico, 2008</xref>). Hence, regular organ-seller territories develop in which the sellers, in their newly won position as entrepreneurs on the fringes of the law, have no interest in testifying against organ brokers. Other grounds for silence – a motive far from the entrepreneurial spirit noted above – may be feelings of shame. Often, people who have sold an organ owing to poverty, experience humiliation as well as fear and prefer silence about what has happened. It was people with such experiences whom I met during my field studies in Moldova in 2008 and in Israel 2009.</p>

<sec id="section4-0963662510372735">
<title>4. Constantin</title>
<p>One oppressively hot morning in August 2008 I found myself, with the organization Renal Foundation,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-0963662510372735">13</xref></sup> in a village in Orhei district to participate in a discussion with local teachers, doctors, police, and others. Renal Foundation organizes regular meetings with key people in the countryside to prevent the organ trade, but also, through its Victim Programme, to follow up and when necessary assist those who already have sold an organ.</p>
<p>The meeting that morning was intense, and participants sometimes spoke at the same time in giving their view of the problem. Through my local partner I learned that economic conditions were one of the biggest problems for the village’s inhabitants. Moldova, which since 1991 has been an independent republic bordered by Ukraine and Romania, was the foremost supplier of wine, vegetables and fruit to other Soviet republics during the Soviet era, but is now destitute. Of its just over four million inhabitants, about one million have left the country to earn a living.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn14-0963662510372735">14</xref></sup> This involves illegal activity such as black-market labour and prostitution in many cases, but also the sale of organs. Especially affected are the formerly relatively prosperous agricultural regions. It is also to here that organ brokers make their way to entice people to sell their kidneys. Participants in the meeting were all agreed that a number of villagers had sold one of their kidneys. “Everyone in the village,” as my local partner said, “knows who these people who have sold a kidney are, but it’s also known that they don’t want to make themselves known.”</p>
<p>As the meeting drew to a close, a man stepped into the room and seated himself unobtrusively in a back corner. He proved to be an organ seller whom one of the participants had telephoned and persuaded to ask Renal Foundation for help. Another organ seller, who had received medical and economic assistance from Renal Foundation, is Constantin whom I interviewed. As the youngest son in a poor family of agricultural labourers, Constantin realized that his prospects for supporting himself in his village would be extremely small. He was twenty when he decided to change his life situation:</p>
<p>
<disp-quote>
<p>A person from my village asked if I would like to work abroad, in Istanbul. Actually, she already was a donor, and she said, “Let’s go and work!” But I knew from the beginning that it might also be about selling a kidney.</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>A few days later, he and some other villagers were picked up and driven to Chisinau, the capital, where they underwent a medical examination, received identity documents and were transported to Turkey, where Constantin started working in the same restaurant as his acquaintance. During the two months he worked there he decided not to sell his kidney. When he notified his employer that he wished to return home and requested his outstanding wages, he was told the money would be paid only if he sold one of his kidneys.</p>
<p>
<disp-quote>
<p>We wanted to take the passports and run home from the place. One ran away without his passport. I went back to my employer and said, “If you’ll pay, it’s okay. If not – just give me my passport and I’ll go home.” But I was told that if I refuse to give my kidney, I would be killed – shot. After that I was brought to a hospital, and then they did the surgery.</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Constantin was in great pain after the surgery and unable to move but was given no pain-killer. After six days a doctor brought medicine that made him start feeling better.</p>
<p>
<disp-quote>
<p>And when they saw that I was feeling better, they asked me, “Do you want to go back [to the place he had been working] to get some rest for a few days?” I agreed and they took me there. And then, once I felt a little better, I started work again.</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Constantin continued working at the same restaurant in Turkey. When he finally got permission to leave his job, he received US$2,900: total remuneration for five months of work and his kidney. On return to Moldova, he did not go back to his native village – the shame was too great – but moved to Chisinau. He lives there today with his wife and daughter in one room with a kitchenette. They cannot afford an apartment any larger. His wife has no work and Constantin’s income as a temporary construction labourer is variable. Because of problems with his remaining kidney since the operation he is unable to work full-time. “I’m not able to work and take care of my family,” he said at the end of our conversation with tears in his eyes, “and if I had known all this from the beginning …. But at the time, it seemed to me like a joke!” It is obviously not only Constantin’s body that has been injured, but also his mind and self-esteem.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0963662510372735">
<title>5. Victor</title>
<p>That some organ sellers become organ brokers, or that others feel ashamed, are common reasons for hushing up their involvement in the organ trade. Another motive, already visible in the stories from Israel and Moldova, is fear. On a visit in late autumn to another Moldovan village I received concrete proof of such fear. I had temporarily joined forces with journalists investigating trafficking. With them, an interpreter and a partner from IOM, I travelled by car to Mingir, a village known for at least eighteen inhabitants having sold their organs (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0963662510372735">Scheper-Hughes, 2008</xref>). My hope was to interview some of them. When we climbed out of the car, wind blew ice-cold round corners of buildings and the few people to be seen had pulled their caps and kerchiefs low on their foreheads. It was not much warmer inside the small village shop. On the shelves were flour, grain, biscuits and canned goods. Baskets of potatoes and root vegetables stood on the floor in one corner, while the display case beside the cash register gaped mostly empty. Having been without food for a whole day, we wanted to buy some. I pointed to a chocolate bar, but it was not for sale. It contained no chocolate, consisting only of the wrapper – a relic of what was once to be had.</p>
<p>My contact person told the women behind the counter that we wished to talk with villagers who had sold their organs. They exchanged glances and shook their heads, saying they knew nothing about this. When we persisted, however, they said that a neighbour had sold one of his kidneys. Just as one of them was telephoning the neighbour, the shop filled with a handful of men who turned to the women with heated words. The rumour had spread quickly that “foreigners were in the village,” I learned from the interpreter. On one hand, their anger was due to Mingir’s having gained a tarnished reputation in connection with journalists having discovered the presence of the organ trade in 2003: inhabitants were worried that the standing of the village would once again be negatively affected. On the other hand, it was apparent that the men’s agitation was about significantly more than concern with village honour. With the interpreter giving a simultaneous translation of the dispute, it was clear that the men felt threatened by organ brokers who had previously visited the village – people who wanted to hush up what had happened. None of the men we met were willing to expose themselves and their families to the danger of visits from these criminals. The knowledge of how easy it was to “lose a kidney or just disappear,” explained the interpreter, frightened them.</p>
<p>Accompanied by the men’s loud voices, we were ejected from the shop. Once in the car, it was revealed that by telephone – amidst the chaos – the women in the shop had arranged a meeting between us, their neighbour and the doctor who had been helping many of the village’s organ sellers. At the unheated hospital, which seemed empty of both staff and patients, the wait was long. The doctor arrived at last and immediately afterwards, Victor. Victor’s story began in 1999, when he was twenty-four and unemployed. A woman in the village, with contacts abroad, suggested that he look for work in Turkey. She saw to it that he got identity documents, and he and six others were driven to the village of Aksaray in Turkey, where they were locked up. It was not long before Victor started suspecting mischief, more distinctly when a nurse arrived to examine him and determine his blood group. Immediately afterwards, he was forced to sign a consent form for organ donation and was anaesthetized and operated on in the hospital’s basement premises. When he woke, one of his kidneys was gone.</p>
<p>Victor remained in hospital for six days. After receiving a payment of US$3,000 and his identity documents, he bought a bus ticket to Moldova. Before travelling home to Mingir, he stayed several months in Chisinau, where he lived with other men from his village who had also sold their kidneys abroad.</p>
<p>
<disp-quote>
<p>We stayed in Chisinau in order to improve our physical condition, so our parents wouldn’t find out the real story. I didn’t want to make them sad. But they found out anyway because I was still in very bad physical condition when I came home.</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Victor said he knew of eighteen people from his village who had sold a kidney. To my question whether he knew about the situation in other villages he said:</p>
<p>
<disp-quote>
<p>I was one of the last in my village, but there are a lot of people from other villages who had the same experiences. And two from my village have died. They were in such bad condition after the operation.</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Victor and Constantin were young men when they were confronted with the organ trade. The villagers I spoke with were agreed – like my contact people at IOM and OSCE – that in Moldova it is primarily men who sell their organs. This involves poor men between eighteen and about thirty who are trying by this means to establish an economically tolerable life for themselves and their families. Instead, they are deceived in several respects: their health is ruined, economic gain is insignificant, and they carry with them a sense of anxiety and humiliation. Being exposed to such multiple deceptions makes them ashamed – which leads to their not wanting to tell what has happened.</p>
<p>There are many indications that the men’s feeling of shame not only is a matter of material and physical exposure but also encroaches on sexual identity. As Scheper-Hughes points out, kidney selling in Moldova is stigmatized and viewed as male prostitution.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn15-0963662510372735">15</xref></sup></p>
<p>A psychologist with IOM in Chisinau who has met many victims of both sexual trafficking and organ trafficking, throws a slightly different light on why these men felt shame, linking sexual identity to Moldovan political history. She argued that women who become sexual merchandise see themselves more easily as victims than men in the same situation (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0963662510372735">Augustin, 2007</xref>). “Men,” she said, “whether they are sexually exposed or deceived by organ brokers, defend against landing in the role of victim”; it does lead to feelings of exposure, but of a wholly different kind than the women’s. She indicated that there might be historical explanations for the behaviour, having to do with “belief in our individual rights, or better said, men’s rights.” Despite the socialist idea of an equal society, Moldova was and is a patriarchal society (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0963662510372735">Blum, 2008</xref>). “And here in Moldova,” continued the psychologist, “we are all still Soviets in our heads and, though we know it’s wrong, believe that the state should provide us with our rights such as calling us to a health check-up, to the workplace or to the holiday resort.” Perhaps it is the notion of such civil (male) rights that – regardless of the repression the Soviet dictatorship exercised – contributes to male organ sellers in Moldova defending against their being defined as victims.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn16-0963662510372735">16</xref></sup> Cultural structures matter and the organ sellers’ shame makes mapping the organ brokers’ networks difficult.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0963662510372735">
<title>6. Victims and actors</title>
<p>There are similarities between the events in Israel and Moldova. All instances involved people who wanted to improve their life situation. But in Moldova, Constantin and Victor were sought out by a person who was giving them opportunities to earn money, while those who responded to the advertisements in <italic>Panorama</italic> and <italic>Kol Al-Arab</italic> contacted Dr. Muhammed themselves to sell their organs. To Constantin it was clear that organ selling was involved, while Victor thought it was about work. Regardless of differences in the narratives, the common denominator is that all have had their lives threatened, been cheated of money and experienced shame. Some of these defrauded organ sellers, like the rare witnesses in the Israeli legal case, decided to demand their rights against the organ brokers.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn17-0963662510372735">17</xref></sup> Constantin and Victor, like many other Moldovan organ sellers, never thought of turning to the courts but chose to hush up what had happened. Constantin did not travel back to his village but preferred an isolated, meagre life in Chisinau. Victor, however, returned and has today a wife and three children. Although he is back in his home environment, he, just like Constantin, experiences a sense of isolation because “everybody in the village knows and repudiates” what he has done. Some of the witnesses in Israel have similar experiences. A.E. from Kfar, Israel, stated that he wanted to earn “easy money,” but returned with empty pockets. What made him upset was not only the loss of money, but the reactions of his neighbours who “make jokes as: what do you have to sell today, a finger? They treat me as garbage!”</p>
<p>The villagers’ view of the organ sellers is divided and most likely a contributing cause of the disapproval experienced by Victor, A.E. and others. In conversations at the village meetings I attended in Moldova, feelings ran high in discussions of how people should relate to the trade in people and organs. One of these meetings was held in the village of Voinescu. The school assembly hall was filled with children and teachers who had come to be informed about the risks of seeking illegal ways out of poverty. Such strategies, was the message, seldom led to success but to prostitution, slave-like working conditions or even organ theft. Around the room were colourful brochures with pictures of men, women and children. Across the brochures were headings like “Has someone suggested that you work abroad?” “You’re in danger!” “What does trafficking involve?”</p>
<p>The meeting began with a filmed stage play, <italic>Abandoned People</italic>, made at IOM’s initiative (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0963662510372735">Crudu, 2006</xref>). The play showed the misery confronting many in Moldova and their efforts to free themselves from poverty and gave examples of how people were lured into prostitution and the body trade. There was the impoverished city-dweller who went abroad illegally to work, but the money sent home was drunk up by his unhappy wife, forcing the teenage son into the streets. And there was the woman who was offered work in Italy but was ruthlessly exploited instead and ended up in the gutter. During the ninety minutes the film ran, one sad story followed another. When I looked round the room, the entire assembly sat with serious faces, deeply concentrating. “They recognize themselves,” whispered the interpreter beside me.</p>
<p>After the film, a discussion took place led by a man from IOM, who turned primarily to the children with questions about how they perceived people in the play. A large consensus about certain people being pointed out as bad and others as good prevailed. The good ones were those who, illegally to be sure, left their homeland but strove by all means at their disposal to provide for their family back home. The crowned heroes were parents who forsook family life to earn money abroad for their children. These persons had not only shown power of initiative but had also taken responsibility. Bad characters in the play were those who had taken similar initiatives but had not lived up to the obligations of a breadwinner and had failed to send money home. There was not always compassion for them when they ended up unable to pay their debts, and to IOM’s question of whether the children could not see these adults as victims rather than scoundrels, the answer was that they had brought disgrace upon themselves and “so they have only themselves to blame.”</p>
<p>The dejection I observed in a number of people in the audience was due to the fact that some had experiences of what was shown in the play, i.e. of adults who went away and children who were left with relatives. These experiences were a reality, a fact that was not negotiable. Morally negotiable, however, was how individuals related to this reality – whether they did or did not act responsibly. What was seen as responsible, however, was not a matter of “black” and “white” work abroad, but more of affirming people’s striving for a better life for themselves and those nearest them. The audience’s views apparently differed in part from the actual message of the play, which was that strategies like illegal emigration or the trade in people and their bodies mean that individuals go under in the international arena.</p>
<p>The repudiation of the audience and the villagers, their unwillingness to see destitute illegal emigrants or cheated organ sellers only as victims, can be seen as moral imperatives and strategies for drawing up guidelines for how to act. The repudiation, however, is not unambiguous. Woven into ideas of responsibility is recognition of the shame, fear and anger that emigrants experienced when seeing possibilities of escaping poverty but instead being cheated of money and having their health destroyed. As with all painful identification based on experiences, complex feelings were bred in the audience – insight into vulnerability, but also a distancing from individual’s failed attempts to change their living conditions.</p>
<p>Much points towards the organ sellers – such as those I met in Moldova – being consigned to categories a lot like those the school children in Voinescu ascribed to characters in the play. The villagers’ repudiation and the children’s criticism are normatively loaded and express what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0963662510372735">Rose (1999)</xref> terms technologies of responsibilization. This concerns strategies for how people create themselves as subjects and responsible individuals. Such techniques, like all impositions, contain dimensions of power (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0963662510372735">Idvall and Lundin, 2007</xref>). In context, villagers’ dividedness and the isolation organ sellers experience are an expression not only of the society’s expectations about responsibility, but of power and powerlessness as well.</p>
<p>What played out in the school’s assembly hall and among the villagers is an example of consensus not always prevailing among outlooks of different groups on the commerce in human beings. Where organizations that want to combat oppression see afflicted beings, the villagers concerned perceive the same people as relatives or neighbours in the process of making various life choices. These different vantage points have consequences for how everything is treated, from illegal emigrants to organ sellers. Some such consequences – discussed in the next section – are that NGOs’ important and respectable activities tend to focus on victims, while villagers require actors.</p>

<title>7. The preferential right of interpretation</title>
<p>My material shows that people in the Moldovan countryside held rooted conceptual models such as ideas about responsibility. These conceptions were supported by the villagers – even by those who illegally sold their labour and/or organs. Much indicates that similar conceptions were governing factors in the Israeli material.</p>
<p>Parallel to my studies in Moldova and Israel, I participated in a series of international policymaking contexts aimed at countering organ trafficking. Here, participants come primarily from the world of medicine and bioethics, many of them also are representatives of various governmental and non-governmental organizations. In these arenas too I found edicts on responsibility – but in a different way than at the grassroots level.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0963662510372735">Augustin (2007)</xref> points to consequences that the cultural loadedness of norms has on the global market. In a study of the international sex trade and efforts of various assistance organizations, Augustin places the reader before a knotty scenario. What if the workers in these organizations are mistaken, and they are proceeding from a Eurocentric morality lacking sensitivity to other people’s wishes and values? From Augustin’s perspective the question is: who has the preferential right of interpretation on the global (organ) market? Why is it that the upset over people’s selling of their body parts, for example, can sometimes seem to have higher priority than finding explanations for why organ trafficking can occur at all? What are the grounds for various NGOs, doctors, and others to call people who sell their organs organ <italic>donors</italic>? Why are the Arabs who testified against Dr. Muhammed, as well as the agricultural labourers in Moldova or the illegal emigrants in IOM’s <italic>Abandoned People</italic>, described entirely as <italic>victims</italic>?</p>
<p>One way to approach questions of preferential right of interpretation is to examine links that exist between the view of the body and medical practices. It becomes apparent that among other things, the prevailing principles are based on at least two approaches that are not obviously compatible: the view of the individual as a unique being and the need of modern Western medicine for biological resources.</p>
<p>A consensus prevails internationally that the exploitation of the body is prohibited. This view of the human being is based on one of the more significant Western norm systems, resting on the idea that human beings must never be objects of utility for others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0963662510372735">Titmuss, 1970</xref>). There are a number of recommendations and statutory provisions against trade in body parts. Thus the Council of Europe establishes that, against the background of massive demand for organs, there is an obvious need to “counter the exploitation of the body” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0963662510372735">Council of Europe, 2003</xref>), and the World Health Organization states “a prohibition of any commercial dealings in the field of transplantation” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0963662510372735">WHO, 2009</xref>: A62/15).</p>
<p>These ethical principles of the individual’s integrity were challenged by medical achievements of the mid-twentieth century. New products that counteracted the rejection of non-endogenous organs enabled transplants which were previously unimaginable. It was no longer necessary to find organ donors who were almost biologically identical to recipients; this meant a completely new exchangeability between people’s bodies.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn18-0963662510372735">18</xref></sup> The consequences were expanding transplantation activities, saving the lives of many people, and an increasing demand for transplants. Cyclosporine and other anti-rejection drugs reduced demands for biologically unique organs and created a demand for standardization of organs instead (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0963662510372735">Waldby and Mitchell, 2007</xref>: 171). In this process, kidneys, livers, hearts, cells and tissues lost their individual biological specificity and were transformed into anonymous biological resources. Hand in hand with this commodification goes late modernity’s notion of the person as a unique being who can and should change herself. The human being is perceived as a flexible system with potential to reshape herself, e.g. by extending life with organ transplantations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0963662510372735">Martin, 1994</xref>).</p>
<p>This user perspective on the body – also rooted in the neoliberal economy – is one of the conditions for the increase in transplantations during the 1980s as well as for the black market in organs developing in parallel. The reification of the body thus characterizes not merely the organ trade but transplantations of all kinds. When organs can be transferred to ill people, they are transformed from being the individual’s obvious body parts to becoming life-sustaining and, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0963662510372735">Sharp (2006)</xref> highlights, valuable objects for other individuals.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn19-0963662510372735">19</xref></sup> This resource- and value-focused thinking is essential for medical work, but nevertheless conflicts with other societal and medical norms such as principles of the individual’s integrity permeating the medical world, various NGOs and the understanding of individuals in today’s (Western) societies.</p>
<p>In recent years I have attended numerous medical and medical-ethics meetings where the focus, implicitly, has been on balancing the clash between the integrity of individuals and the reification of the human body. One way is edicts about altruism: transplantations are to occur exclusively as gifts, and citizens are assumed to wish to donate body parts in life or after death. In 2008 I attended a meeting where scientific and medical organizational bodies from around the world outlined principles for how to combat the organ trade. There were different views on how to curtail the black market. A majority advocated altruistic donation while a minor group recommended a state-sanctioned organ trade. To increase altruistic donation, “we must inform people about the importance of donating.” Protests such as “you can’t educate people to be altruistic” were ignored, as were statements like “donations are only relevant in welfare states” and “poor people can’t afford being altruistic.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn20-0963662510372735">20</xref></sup></p>
<p>Hence, what intrinsically took place at the meeting, besides striving towards a mutual goal to combat the organ trade, was a clash of different societal conditions as well as a normative debate proceeding from a Eurocentric view where the gift of life is seen as a global solution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0963662510372735">Scheper-Hughes, 2008</xref>). In order to reconnect with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0963662510372735">Augustin (2007)</xref> on the consequences of normative hegemonic descriptions, it seems that one way of maintaining the balance between the inviolability of individuals and the need for organs, is through seemingly insignificant expressions that are actually normatively loaded. I have heard several such examples.</p>
<p>At many of the medical meetings and in discussions with NGOs – in Moldova, Israel and elsewhere – the talk has been of donors, although it has been about trafficking, not about voluntary gifts. Another meaning-bearing word is victim. It is understandable that in trials, as the prosecutor dealing with the Dr. Muhammed case explained, “we must show that he cheated vulnerable individuals and it’s necessary to define them as victims in order to prove that crimes are committed.” Less obvious is that individuals who sell their bodies by routine are called victims. In a discussion with IOM I learned that those who had illegally sold their labour abroad or their organs were, “even if some of them are brokers themselves,” called victims. Not infrequently the concept of trafficking victims is used synonymously with organ donors – something that the prosecutor in Israel self-critically comments on as “we call them <italic>victims</italic>, or, oddly enough, we also call the victim <italic>the donator</italic>.” Such blending of incompatible concepts can appear almost absurd. This is understandable, however, against the background in these international policymaking contexts, of proceeding from a pattern of thought in which transplanted body parts are automatically defined as gifts, never as commodities. And in which selling organs is unacceptable and more or less morally irresponsible. The talk of victims and donors upholds these principles.</p>
<p>Against this background, campaigns to promote altruistic donation become important tools. The difference between the medical campaign and education project of late modern society, and the conditions causing people in poor parts of the world to sell organs, is obvious. It is also evident that these conflicting strategies paradoxically are supported by similar ideas about individual responsibility and reflexivity. Ideas that are realized, however, have a tendency to manifest very differently depending on societal context. My previous studies, as well as the present one, show that several conceptions of the body often exist in parallel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0963662510372735">Lundin, 2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0963662510372735">2008</xref>). My field studies of village meetings in Moldova and interviews with organ sellers show that in <italic>one</italic> such conceptual structure the body is understood as private property, a resource to manage in the most prudent way. Therefore it was not just the sale of organs that upset people in the villages, but the men’s failure as well. Within medicine’s framework of understanding, however, that very failure becomes the only conciliation, while the organ selling threatens the created balance between the view of the individual and modern society’s need of biological resources. However understandable it may be that poor people who see the value of their bodies on the global market<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn21-0963662510372735">21</xref></sup> sell their organs, such actions mean that altruism – the solution to medicine’s dilemma – is endangered. Promotion of altruistic donation, as well as victimizing of people, stand out in this context as technologies of responsibilization (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0963662510372735">Rose, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0963662510372735">Augustin, 2007</xref>) in which divergent opinions, such as the taking or giving of payment for organs, are condemned as threats to the inviolability of the individual.</p>

<sec id="section8-0963662510372735">
<title>8. Organ economy</title>
<p>The fact that different ideas about what a body is exist at all, results in differing approaches to the body, especially when medicine intervenes in people’s lives. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0963662510372735">Cohen (2003)</xref> points out, transplantation technology has provoked fundamental epistemological questions about the body to become commonplace and also politically combustible. One can ask what it involves for the body to be seen as a possession with our right to use as we wish, and as something we are, and thus, unconditionally joined with our self. Woven into these existential issues, as I emphasize above, are culturally bound conceptions in which the body – and, with that, the individual – is perceived as everything from collective cogs of nature to individual biological apparatuses or as personal life projects.</p>
<p>One consequence of these suppositions about the individual, as Margaret <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0963662510372735">Lock (2002)</xref> stresses, is that Western medical knowledge starts from a view of the human being in which illness and death are defeats to be combated. It is in this conceptual climate – in the dream of the regenerative body – among others, that transplantation technology develops and, with that, society’s great need for biological replacement parts. One of the more obvious manifestations of this kind of resource perspective on the body is the hospital waiting list, used in many countries. In this priority system, biological values are easily transformed into economic values and, as always where demand exceeds supply, people may not accept waiting their turn, but seek alternatives. Such strategies involve other people and other countries.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn22-0963662510372735">22</xref></sup></p>
<p>Trade in organs occurs according to a pattern that can be described in terms of social but also geographic flow. Scheper-Hughes’s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0963662510372735">2000</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0963662510372735">2008</xref>) research has revealed a global trade where organs are taken from poor countries, such as Argentina, Brazil, India, Pakistan, Moldova and Russia, to be transplanted into inhabitants of richer countries, such as Israel, the US, Germany, Great Britain and Japan. The operations commonly happen in yet another country – for instance, the Philippines, Turkey or in South America (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0963662510372735">Watson, 2006</xref>). The quickest way to see this global flow diagram is on the Internet. On the “Dialysis &amp; Transplant City”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn23-0963662510372735">23</xref></sup> website, for example, “Babybutterflyblue” writes “I have heard many people suggest looking to get a kidney transplant overseas. Many suggested India or the Philippines. Does anyone have any information?”</p>
<p>The waiting list, and strategies to find shortcuts to an organ, illustrate not only the dream of the regenerative body, but also how societal conditions produce conceptions that justify the sale of organs. “Lojackd,” on “Dialysis &amp; Transplant City,”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn24-0963662510372735">24</xref></sup> is looking for a paying recipient, writing “I am a potential donor, contact me for arrangements.” Other offers are given by students in Romania who are trying to finance their studies by advertising their organs on the Internet (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0963662510372735">Demeny, 2009</xref>). These organ sellers – as those I met in Moldova and Israel – live under poor conditions. What further unites some, primarily those from Eastern Europe, is that they live in corrupt societies giving rise to a specific view of the body. As Martin Gunnarson shows in studies on renal transplantation in Latvia, corruption breeds distrust of the medical system making people negative towards altruistic donation and positive to a personal ownership of the body and selling organs.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn25-0963662510372735">25</xref></sup></p>
<p>There are different systems for how the trade is carried out, depending on whether the transaction happens in a semi-legal grey zone or an illegal one (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0963662510372735">Bos, 2007</xref>). The treatments advertised on the Internet, where hospitals often are named, require a donation contract and that sellers give their informed consent which means sellers and buyers only meet if a donation contract has been drawn up. In organ trafficking, such rules are eliminated. In Victor’s case, such a meeting did nevertheless take place – perhaps owing precisely to there being a donation contract of some sort, although it had been signed under duress. Victor described the events like this:</p>
<fig id="fig2-0963662510372735" position="float">

</fig>
<p>
<disp-quote>
<p>The operation took place in the basement of the hospital, and I was told that I had no alternative … I was given a paper and they told me, “You must sign here.” The paper was in Turkish, I didn’t know what I was signing. I was forced to.</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>When Victor awoke, he had lost a kidney. In a bed beside him lay the man who had received his organ. “He was not from Turkey,” Victor said, “but from some Western country.” A.E. from Israel had similar experiences: “The buyer and I were on the same flight to the Ukrainian clinic.”</p>
<p>The transition of the organ from gift to resource and finally commodity certainly is subtle! Victor’s and A.E.’s stories show how the organ trade can employ the gift principle – donation – as a market economy instrument in a global organ economy of some kind. In her examination of the politics of war and networks fuelling international profiteering, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0963662510372735">Nordstrom (2004)</xref> discusses that black money must be laundered to be used legally. Likewise, illegal organ transplantations must be made “white.” Further, the donation contract, voluntary or forced, opens a rare meeting between the affluent world’s patients/buyers and the poor world’s individuals/sellers.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-0963662510372735">
<title>9. Global bodies</title>
<p>Organ trafficking is a strategy of meeting transplant shortages. The activity flourishes for several interacting reasons, such as medical needs, poverty and criminality. Other factors are fundamental conceptions of the body as well as the reflexive approach in which people create themselves as responsible individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0963662510372735">Rose, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0963662510372735">Lock, 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>The dream of the perpetually reborn body – constantly in need of regenerative resources – is a cultural construction with extremely concrete effects. Without the assumption of demand (the patient risks dying without a new organ) and supply (organs are provided), neither a legal nor an illegal transplantation system exists. Likewise, it is these ideas that constitute a lowest common denominator for patients/organ buyers, organ brokers, donors/organ sellers and those performing transplantations. These conceptions of the body find special expressions in today’s global economic system. When the dream of the regenerative body cannot be fulfilled on home ground, through what Waldby and Mitchell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0963662510372735">2007</xref>: 180) call the national body in the form of voluntary donors, gaze turns towards global bodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0963662510372735">Lundin, 2008</xref>) – the bodies of the poor world – in hopes that these can be bought.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn26-0963662510372735">26</xref></sup> Medical tourism – it might be aesthetic surgery, orthodontics or reproductive technology treatments – is one manifestation of the kind of economic approach in which the buyer utilizes a market that is cheaper than that at home. Another consequence is organ trafficking.</p>
<p>Constantin, like other organ sellers whose experiences I have studied, shows that an understanding of organ trafficking is not yielded at levels of comprehensive policymaking alone. It must be studied against the background of the trade’s occurring in late modern society where people organize themselves according to a reflexive approach where the body can be perceived variously as an object of value, an object of utility and as an embodied “self” to be cared for. Organ trafficking should further be examined contextually and ideas taken into account about views of the body and conceptions about responsibility being interpreted differently depending on the socio-cultural situation. As my ethnography shows, people in the Moldovan countryside or illiterate people in Israel, do not necessarily share the view of modern Western society. Nevertheless they regard the body as an object of value, but for different reasons than the buyers.</p>
<p>This value approach that includes buyers and sellers, conflicts with the altruistic norm pervading the Western medical world and various NGOs. Efforts to combat trafficking often focus on the interaction between sellers and organ brokers, instead of examining the entire transplantation process including doctors and buyers. Thus there is a risk that normative strategies, condemning the selling of organs, may become more important than investigating societal and cultural realities underlying organ trafficking.</p>
<p>This means that organ trafficking should be studied in concrete situations – yielding insight into the complex conceptual models, relationships and networks behind official interpretations. It is a matter of approaching the shadow zones and the shadow economy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0963662510372735">Nordstrom, 2004</xref>) in which a special part of reality is occurring. The shadow- and grey-zone economy mirrors the premises and patterns of thought of the so-called white economy: the organ economy in which the dream of the regenerative body as well as ideas about the need to take responsibility for one’s own body makes claims on other people’s bodies – on global bodies.</p>
