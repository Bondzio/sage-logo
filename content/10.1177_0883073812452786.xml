<abstract>
<p>This study evaluated the brain activation state during error making in youth with mild spastic cerebral palsy and a peer control group while carrying out a stimulus recognition task. The key question was whether patients were detecting their own errors and subsequently improving their performance in a future trial. Findings indicated that error responses of the group with cerebral palsy were associated with weak motor preparation, as indexed by the amplitude of the late contingent negative variation. However, patients were detecting their errors as indexed by the amplitude of the response-locked negativity and thus improved their performance in a future trial. Findings suggest that the consequence of error making on future performance is intact in a sample of youth with mild spastic cerebral palsy. Because the study group is small, the present findings need replication using a larger sample.</p>

<body>
<p>Cerebral palsy is a group of disorders of movement and posture attributed to disturbances in the developing fetal or infant brain, causing activity limitations.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0883073812452786">1</xref></sup> A large proportion of cerebral palsy disorders is caused by periventricular leukomalacia, intraventricular/periventricular hemorrhages, or infarcts contributing to lesions of gray matter and white matter tracts. The latter lesions are in particular associated with executive dysfunctions,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0883073812452786">2</xref></sup> and indeed, youth with cerebral palsy are slower and make statistically more reaction time errors than peer controls on a variety of executive function tasks, as is recently reviewed.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0883073812452786">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0883073812452786">4</xref></sup></p>
<p>The present study examined whether youth with mild spastic cerebral palsy were aware of their own errors while carrying out an executive function task. Rabbitt and Rodgers’<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0883073812452786">5</xref></sup> pioneering research on error processing showed that error detection results in reaction time improvement in a future trial. This phenomenon is now widely used as a marker for cognitive control in developmental<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0883073812452786">6</xref></sup> and clinical studies on, for instance, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0883073812452786">7</xref></sup></p>
<p>Neurocognitive studies using the event-related brain potential methodology have shown that weak motor preparation before error making occurs, as indexed by the amplitude of the late contingent negative variation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0883073812452786">8</xref></sup> Error detection and its fine-grained adjustments in performance may be indexed by response-locked error-related negativity. The latter brain potential reaches its negative maximum just after an erroneous response, is substantially larger following errors than following correct trials, and originates in the anterior cingulate cortex, insula, and orbitofrontal cortex.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0883073812452786">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0883073812452786"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0883073812452786">11</xref></sup></p>
<p>Using the event-related potential methodology, brain activity just before, during, and after error making was compared between a sample of youth with mild spastic cerebral palsy and a peer control group during the execution of a stimulus recognition task. It was tested whether the group of patients was aware of their own error making and thus shows compensatory mechanisms to prevent future errors. The argument for studying error processing in youth with mild spastic cerebral palsy is that identification of error making and strategic response adjustments after error making are keys in learning.</p>

<title>Study Population</title>
<p>Eleven patients (4 girls) with cerebral palsy (mean, 14 years 3 months; standard deviation [SD], 3 years 9 months; range, 9-18 years) participated in the study. All were diagnosed with mild spastic cerebral palsy when they were between the ages of 1 and 3 years. Brain magnetic resonance imaging data during the first year of life or later were used to check the lesion site. Patients were recruited through the Department of Pediatric Neurology at Tampere University Hospital in Finland. All had experienced perinatal/neonatal complications. Four patients were born preterm (birth weight &lt;1500 g). None had severe visual or hearing impairments or epilepsy. One child had hydrocephalus.

<p>Twelve control children (6 girls) and adolescents (mean, 14 years 3 months; SD, 2 years 8 months; range, 10-18 years) participated in the study. They were recruited from mainstream elementary schools and upper secondary schools in the same city.</p>
<p>Several of the children with mild spastic cerebral palsy had intelligence quotients in the range of learning disabilities. None of these children were diagnosed as mentally retarded because their activities of daily living were intact. For instance, children were joining mainstream education, and part-time special education was provided if necessary. The 2 groups did not differ significantly with respect to age (t<sub>21</sub> = –0.04, <italic>P</italic> = .96). Informed consent was obtained from all participants. Ethical approval was obtained from the Tampere University Hospital Ethics Committee.</p>

<sec id="section3-0883073812452786">
<title>Study Design</title>
<p>The participants were seated in front of a monitor, about 80 cm from the screen. All stimuli were white letters (consonants only), measuring 1.5 cm on a black background. A memory set was presented of 2 target letters, which were to be memorized temporarily. These letters were simultaneously shown on a single row in the center of the screen. Subsequently, a new set of 4 letters was presented, making up a square of 8 × 8 cm. One of the letters of the memory set or neither was presented in this set. A varied mapping procedure was followed: targets and distracters were randomly mixed over trials.</p>
<p>Participants placed their dominant hand between 2 response buttons. When the target was present in the display set (positive set), patients were to press the left “yes” button with their dominant hand. When the target was not present (negative set), patients were to press the right “no” button with their dominant hand. The probability that the target was present in the display set was .5.</p>
<p>The letters in each trial were randomly selected with the restriction that no letter occurred as a target in 2 consecutive trials and that no more than 3 consecutive positive or negative trials occurred in sequence. In addition, it was ascertained that the frequencies were approximately equal for the target appearing in 1 of the 4 positions of the display set (left up, right up, left down, right down). All participants were presented the same random sequence of memory and display sets.</p>
<p>Starting from the appearance of the display set, participants had 4500 milliseconds to respond. For each response, the interval between onset of the display set and button press was measured as the reaction time. The study focused on correct and incorrect responses (button press errors). Failure to press a button within 4500 milliseconds (error of omission) and precipitate responses (reaction time &lt;200 milliseconds) were excluded from the analysis. Participants were given a short practice period, which generally lasted about 2 minutes, until they completely understood the task. The experiment, including instruction and practice, lasted about 15 minutes. During the test, the researcher sat out of sight of the participant, and no interaction was allowed.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0883073812452786">
<title>Behavioral Measures</title>
<p>Three response types were defined: correct reaction times, incorrect reaction times, and correct reaction times directly after an error.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0883073812452786">
<title>Electrophysiological Measures</title>
<p>Electroencephalograms were recorded by using Ag/AgCl electrodes at 9 electrode sites (F3, Fz, F4, C3, Cz, C4, P3, Pz, and P4). The reference electrodes were placed on mastoids. Four additional tin electrodes were attached for a bipolar recording of the vertical electro-oculogram from above and below the left eye and of the horizontal electro-oculogram from the outer canthi of both eyes. Impedances were kept below 5 kΩ at all electrodes. Digital data, together with triggers marking specific events, were stored on a hard disk for later analysis.</p>
<p>Data were first digitally filtered with a high-pass filter of 1.59 Hz and a low-pass filter of 30 Hz at 12 dB per octave for the response-related negativities. For the contingent negative variation, a high-pass filter of 0.01 Hz and a low-pass filter of 30 Hz at 12 dB per octave were employed. Epochs contaminated with artifacts (threshold for artifact rejection was ±100 µV in all channels) were rejected. Electroencephalograms from individual trials were visually inspected and corrected for horizontal and vertical eye movements.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0883073812452786">
<title>Contingent Negative Variation</title>
<p>Data were epoched into 5200-millisecond segments starting 500 milliseconds before the onset of the memory set. Possible artifacts (such as eye movements and body movements) were taken into account by visually inspecting the segments one by one and excluding the invalid segments from the further analyses. In order to investigate a change of the wave across the time, a baseline was set at 2500 to 2600 milliseconds, and an average time window was created at 4000 to 4500 milliseconds (500-millisecond period before the onset of the display set).</p>

<p>The negative polarity potential with a frontocentral scalp distribution was measured as the most negative peak during the first 100 milliseconds after correct and incorrect responses separately. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0883073812452786">Figure 1</xref> shows an overview of the time windows of the event-related potentials under study and essential task parameters and illustrates that the brain potentials studied do not overlap in time.</p>

<title>Statistical Analyses</title>
<p>Mean reaction times of correct and error responses, together with the response-locked negativities and the contingent negative variation, were analyzed using a MANOVA with repeated measures. Group (cerebral palsy vs control) was the between-patient factor. Response type (error vs correct response) was the within-patient factor. In the reaction time adjustment analysis, response type (error vs correct response directly after an error) was used as the within-patient factor, and group (cerebral palsy vs control) was used as the between-patient factor. An α level of .05 (2-tailed) was used for all statistical tests.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-0883073812452786">
<title>Results</title>
<p>The control group made 88% correct responses and 9% error responses (patients were indicating that the target was present, whereas that was not the case, or vice versa). The patient group made 78% correct responses and 12% incorrect responses. Groups slightly differed in their performance efficiency (t = –2.1, <italic>P</italic> &lt; .07). The mean reaction times of the error and correct responses ranged between 1250 and 1600 milliseconds. The group of patients tended to react slower than the control group: the group main effect was F<sub>1,21</sub> = 3.32, <italic>P</italic> = .08. In addition, error responses tended to be slower than correct responses: the main effect of response type was F<sub>1,21</sub> = 3.24, <italic>P</italic> = .09. This effect was the same in both groups: the interaction group by response type did not yield a significance level (F<sub>1,21</sub> = 0.69, <italic>P</italic> = .42). Motor preparation for correct and error responses is presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0883073812452786">Figure 2</xref>.</p>

</fig>
<p>According to neuroscience, the better the motor preparation, the more pronounced is the amplitude of the contingent negative variation before actual responding takes place. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0883073812452786">Figure 2</xref> shows that the amplitude of the contingent negative variation for the correct responses was the same in the 2 groups (–2.50 µV). However, for the error responses, the amplitude of this component was less pronounced in the patient group (5 µV) compared with the control group (–5 µV): the group by response type interaction was F<sub>1,21</sub> = 4.4, <italic>P</italic> &lt; .05. Consequently, this finding indicates that motor preparation of error responses was weak in the group of patients.</p>
<p>To test whether the patient group was detecting their errors, the amplitude of the response-locked negativity was calculated for error responses and correct responses. Findings are depicted in the left panel of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0883073812452786">Figure 3</xref>.

</fig>
<p>According to neuroscience, the more aware of error making, the more pronounced is the peak of the error-related negativity observed directly after the mistake. The left panel shows that the response-locked negativity was more pronounced in the patient group, especially after an error response: the group main effect was F<sub>1,21</sub> = 7.1, <italic>P</italic> &lt; .01, and the interaction response type by group was near significance (F<sub>1,21</sub> = 5.2, <italic>P</italic> &lt; .06). Consequently, findings indicate that the patient group was detecting their own errors.</p>
<p>The right panel shows that both patients and controls improved their reaction times directly after error making; that is, responses became faster after an error: the response type effect was F<sub>1,21</sub> = 10.83, <italic>P</italic> &lt; .003. This phenomenon was similar in both groups: the group effect was F<sub>2,21</sub> = 2.52, <italic>P</italic> = .13, and the group by response type interaction was F<sub>2,21</sub> = 0, <italic>P</italic> = .96. In addition, in the patient group, 87% of the errors were followed by a correct response. In the control group, the percentage was 86. Consequently, the performance improvement after error making was similar in both groups with respect to reaction time speed and reaction time accuracy.</p>

<p>Note that one methodological problem in exploring error processing is that, in general, the control group is producing fewer errors than the patient group. In addition, the contribution of the individual members per group to the mean average of dependent variables of interest may be skewed. In the present study, on average, 45.7 correct trials and 6.9 error trials per patient were included to calculate the event-related potentials. In the control group, the number of correct trials was 53.9, and the number of error trials was 4.5. Consequently, with respect to mean averages, the contribution of each participant in the study was about the same.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>This study addressed the issue of error detection and performance adjustment in order to prevent errors in a subsequent trial in youth with mild spastic cerebral palsy and a peer control group. The results indicate that, especially in the patient group, error responses were associated with poor motor preparation. However, patients identified their errors, as was reflected by an increase of their error-related negativity potential directly after error making. This error detection was an internal process because external feedback about their performance was not given to the participants. Also, detecting the error led to improvement of future performance in the patient group, as was also the case in the control group. Arriving at this point, it is important to note that a recent study<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0883073812452786">12</xref></sup> showed that, in normal adults, feedback activates the performance monitoring system and results in a similar reset of brain activity pattern as detecting errors without external feedback. All in all, findings of this modest study suggest that a critical key in learning, that is, error monitoring and subsequent performance adjustment, is intact in the group of patients.</p>
<p>Some researchers suggest that the amplitude of the error negativity is related to error significance rather than error detectability.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0883073812452786">13</xref></sup> Since the amplitude of the error negativity was most pronounced in the patient group, findings suggest that they were more sensitive about their error making than the control group. Consequently, a second key in learning might also be intact in the patient group, that is, motivation.</p>
<p>The suggestion of an intact top-down executive function ability (error detection and performance adjustment after error making), together with a compromised motor action system in the patient group (decreased contingent negative variation before error making), fits well with the outcome of 2 earlier event-related potential studies on this population. The first study<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0883073812452786">14</xref></sup> evaluated the frontal central N2 and the centroparietal P300 complex. It was concluded that orientation toward visual stimuli and evaluation of stimulus novelty are intact in the group of patients. The second study<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0883073812452786">15</xref></sup> explored the amplitude and latency of the parietal P300 during stimulus recognition. It was concluded that the ability to evaluate and recall complex stimuli is intact in the patient group. The results of the 2 earlier event-related response studies, together with the present outcome, may suggest that slowness of correct responses in youth with mild spastic cerebral palsy is not associated with weak executive function abilities but is probably the result of their compromised motor system.</p>
<p>In summary, in the patient group, patterns of brain activity 500 milliseconds before the presentation of the display set, and hence, before preceding action execution, might be causally responsible for error making, not correcting mechanism after error making. Therefore, in-depth investigation of patterns of brain activity preceding errors is needed to understand the source of error making in youth with mild spastic cerebral palsy. The key question to answer in the near future is why the motor preparation state in the patient group fluctuates from optimal to less optimal, resulting in respectively correct and error responses.</p>
<p>The outcome of the present modest study might challenge the popular poor executive function hypothesis in mild spastic cerebral palsy. The hypothesis is primarily based on research using manual, oral, and eye movements. Cognitive testing of youth with mild spastic cerebral palsy without controlling for motor preparation may lead to wrong conclusions about their cognitive abilities. This point has to be taken into account in future research.</p>

<title>Limitation of the Study</title>
<p>This article presents the data of a small sample of patients with mild spastic cerebral palsy. Using a larger sample, findings await replication. In addition, it has to be tested whether findings hold in other (more severe) subtypes with cerebral palsy.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>This modest study suggests that patients with mild spastic cerebral palsy identify errors and adjust their performance to prevent future errors. Error performance is foreshadowed with weak motor preparation.</p>
