<abstract>
<p>The main objective of this study was to validate Pender’s Health Promotion Model (HPM) as a motivational model for exercise/physical activity self-management for people with spinal cord injuries (SCIs). Quantitative descriptive research design using hierarchical regression analysis (HRA) was used. A total of 126 individuals with SCI were recruited through the National Spinal Cord Injury Association, other SCI support groups, and professors in rehabilitation counseling across the United States. Outcome measures used were the International Physical Activity Questionnaire and the Physical Activity Stages of Change Instrument. The HRA results indicated that preinjury physical activity/exercise level, severity of SCI, and commitment to a plan for exercise and physical activity were predictive of postinjury exercise and physical activity level. In addition, friend/family support, perceived self-efficacy, and perceived benefits were the strongest predictors of commitment to a plan of action for exercise and physical activity. The research findings support the applicability of Pender’s HPM as a motivational model for exercise/physical activity for people with SCI. The information can be used to design health promotion behavioral interventions for people with SCI living in the community.</p>

<body>
<p>Secondary conditions, such as pain, depression, pressure sores, and respiratory illness, often increase the functional disability of an individual and limit the ability to reach personal goals and engage in key life activities, such as employment and leisure pursuits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0034355212440732">Lynch &amp; Chiu, 2009</xref>). The United States’ national health agenda <italic>Healthy People 2010</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0034355212440732">U.S. Department of Health and Human Services [USDHHS], 2000</xref>) expanded the definition of secondary condition to include medical, social, emotional, mental, family, or community problems related to having a disability. People with disabilities are at greater risk of being physically inactive and experiencing a variety of secondary conditions that may reduce their health further, including obesity, skin breakdown, sleep disorders, gastrointestinal problems, osteoporosis, and chronic pain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0034355212440732">Rimmer, Yamaki, Davis Lowry, Wang, &amp; Vogel, 2010</xref>). These conditions are largely preventable, especially when they are caused or worsened by a sedentary lifestyle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0034355212440732">Rimmer &amp; Braddock, 2002</xref>), and rehabilitation and health promotion interventions can limit the scope, impact, and extensive costs associated with these secondary conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0034355212440732">Lynch &amp; Chiu, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Spinal cord injury (SCI) is a type of physical disability in which individuals are particularly vulnerable to secondary conditions due to physical limitations and sedentary lifestyle. According to the National Spinal Cord Injury Statistical Center (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0034355212440732">NSCISC; 2011</xref>), there were approximately 260,000 people in the United States living with SCI in 2010 and an estimated 12,000 new cases each year. Given that the majority of individuals who acquire an SCI have well over 20 years to live following injury, healthy adjustment and rehabilitation are vital for promoting quality of life and also for containing medical and care costs. The estimated lifetime costs directly attributable to SCI for a person injured at age 25 range from 1.5 to 4.4 million dollars, increasing with severity of the injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0034355212440732">NSCISC, 2011</xref>). Acquiring an SCI typically results in a level of physical inactivity and deconditioning that starkly contrasts the preinjury state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0034355212440732">Nash, 2005</xref>), and SCI is a disability that is certainly in need of effective health promotion interventions, with a particular focus on physical activity and exercise. For individuals with SCI, physical activity can have many health benefits, such as lowering risk for developing secondary complications, especially urinary tract infection, pressure sores, and respiratory illness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0034355212440732">Martin Ginis, Jetha, Mack, &amp; Hetz, 2010</xref>). Physical activity can also help people with SCI better manage problems such as spasticity, weight gain, and chronic pain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0034355212440732">Martin Ginis et al., 2010</xref>). Furthermore, numerous studies involving people with SCI have supported the positive relationship between physical activity and subjective well-being (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0034355212440732">Martin Ginis et al., 2010</xref>) and found involvement in work, education, and leisure activities to be associated with higher levels of reported life satisfaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0034355212440732">Nosek, Fuhrer, &amp; Potter, 1995</xref>).</p>
<p>In addition to the impact on health, functioning, and care costs, the presence of a disability has also been consistently linked with lower employment rates. Estimates suggest that more than 43% of people with disabilities aged 21 to 64 are not employed, compared with only 23% of people without disabilities in the same age range (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0034355212440732">U.S. Census Bureau, 2000</xref>). Unemployment is an important issue not only because of the related personal struggles but also because it diminishes the financial contribution to the health care system for a significant portion of the population. Addressing secondary conditions is an important consideration to develop more comprehensive care that addresses the person as a whole, which will help individuals lead fuller and more productive lives and ultimately reduce health care costs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0034355212440732">DeLisa, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>It is clear, with more than 49 million individuals in the United States with a chronic condition or disability, that health promotion for people with disabilities is a crucial goal of the rehabilitation process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0034355212440732">Waldrop &amp; Stern, 2003</xref>). A major objective addressed in the “Disability and Health” section of <italic>Healthy People 2020</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0034355212440732">USDHHS, 2010</xref>) is to reduce the disparity in employment rates between people with disabilities and the general population. A key to achieving this goal is through health promotion efforts for people with disabilities; yet health promotion interventions have not received much attention in the rehabilitation literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0034355212440732">Harrison, 2006</xref>). Due to the lack of available or accessible programs, there is a growing call to integrate health promotion programs into the health care and rehabilitation service systems that assist people with disabilities with vocational and health care issues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0034355212440732">Ipsen, 2006</xref>). This will require an increase in development efforts and utilization of such programs. Hence, the state–federal vocational rehabilitation program is a reasonable point of access for health promotion programs targeted at reducing health problems and secondary conditions that may pose barriers to employment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0034355212440732">Ipsen, Seekins, &amp; Ravesloot, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>Although there is certainly more recognition by the federal government of the negative impact secondary conditions have on health care, employment, and quality of life for people with disabilities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0034355212440732">Harrison, 2006</xref>), research focused on validating theory-driven health promotion models for people with disabilities remains remarkably limited. Although there have been promising findings from some notable intervention studies targeting health promotion (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0034355212440732">Ravesloot, Seekins, &amp; White, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0034355212440732">Zemper et al., 2003</xref>), currently, there are only a limited number of studies evaluating the application of models of health promotion to people with disabilities and no studies applying them to people with SCI. Research focused explicitly on validation of models of health promotion is also necessary to develop theory-driven and empirically validated health promotion interventions for people with SCI.</p>
<sec id="section1-0034355212440732">
<title>Pender’s Health Promotion Model (HPM)</title>
<p>The HPM developed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0034355212440732">Pender (1996)</xref> is relatively well known in the fields of nursing and public health. This model has been widely used to study cognitive and behavioral determinants of health promoting behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0034355212440732">Guedes, Moreira, Cavalcante, Araujo, &amp; Ximenes, 2009</xref>). This model is beneficial because it is not limited to only two or three explanatory variables (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0034355212440732">Shin, Yun, Pender, &amp; Jang, 2005</xref>) and incorporates key aspects of previous health promotion models, including the transtheoretical model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0034355212440732">Prochaska &amp; DiClemente, 1983</xref>), the health belief model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0034355212440732">Rosenstock, 1966</xref>), and theory of reasoned action and theory of planned behavior (TPB; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0034355212440732">Ajzen, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0034355212440732">Ajzen &amp; Fishbein, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0034355212440732">Fishbein &amp; Ajzen, 1975</xref>). The HPM is viewed as a competence-oriented model that focuses on positive values (e.g., the desire to improve one’s quality of life) as the source of motivation and omits negative factors (e.g., fears or threats that are a central part of avoidance-oriented models; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0034355212440732">Pender, Murdaugh, &amp; Parsons, 2006</xref>). It also aims to be holistic in an effort to capture the interactive roles of the interpersonal and physical environments in the individual’s pursuit of health.</p>
<p>The HPM groups behavioral factors into three specific areas: (a) individual characteristics and experiences, (b) behavior-specific cognitions and affect, and (c) immediate behavioral contingencies. The first area, individual characteristics and experiences, includes biological, psychological, and sociocultural factors related to the individual and prior behaviors (e.g., personality, ethnicity, socioeconomic status). The second area, behavior-specific cognitions and affect, includes perceived benefits of action, perceived barriers to action, perceived self-efficacy, activity-related affect, interpersonal influences, and situational influences. The interpersonal (e.g., family, peers, providers) and situational influences (e.g., options, demand characteristics) are sometimes highlighted as separate areas of behavioral determinants. The final area, immediate behavioral contingencies, includes commitment to a plan of action—that is, the intention to carry out a particular health behavior—and the response to immediate competing demands and preferences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0034355212440732">Pender et al., 2006</xref>). This model proposes that each factor in the individual characteristics and experiences area and the behavior-specific cognitions and affect area has a direct influence on health promoting behavior. In addition, the individual characteristics and experiences factors directly influence the behavior-specific cognitions and affect factors, and, though not illustrated by the model’s structure, greater emphasis is placed on the behavior-specific cognitions and affect factors as predicting and influencing health-related behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0034355212440732">Ronis, Hong, &amp; Lusk, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>Evidence supporting the validity of this model has been demonstrated through longitudinal and cross-sectional study designs with people with chronic illness and disabilities in several countries, and this model holds great promise in the study of the relationship of the various constructs involved in adopting (or not adopting) health promoting behaviors for people with disabilities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0034355212440732">Pender et al., 2006</xref>). The HPM has served as a framework in numerous research areas, including cardiovascular disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0034355212440732">Han, Lee, Park, Park, &amp; Cheol, 2005</xref>), osteoporosis and osteoarthritis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0034355212440732">Shin, Hur, Pender, Jang, &amp; Kim, 2006</xref>), diabetes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0034355212440732">Ho, Berggren, &amp; Dahlborg-Lyckhage, 2010</xref>), and HIV/AIDS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0034355212440732">Mendias &amp; Paar, 2007</xref>). In addition, there has been support for the usefulness of this model in explaining physical activity behavior among adolescents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0034355212440732">Garcia et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0034355212440732">Wu &amp; Pender, 2002</xref>), cardiovascular disease prevention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0034355212440732">Elberson, Daniels, &amp; Miller, 2001</xref>), and health promoting behaviors among Korean elderly women (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0034355212440732">Shin, Younhee, Park, Cho, &amp; Heitkemper, 2008</xref>). Although much of the research supports the constructs of the HPM in predicting health promoting behaviors, the model has not yet been validated with people with SCI.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-0034355212440732">
<title>Purpose of the Study</title>
<p>The primary purpose of the present study was to evaluate the applicability of the HPM for predicting physical activity and exercise behaviors in people with SCI. Specifically, we addressed the following research question: To what extent are HPM constructs (i.e., individual characteristics and experiences, behavior-specific cognitions, interpersonal influences, and commitment to action planning) predictive of physical activity/exercise participation for people with SCI? It was hypothesized that each set of HPM predictors would significantly impact the effect size of the overall regression model. This finding would lend support to the use of the HPM as a framework to design more effective health promotion behavioral interventions for people with SCI. Such programs have the goal of promoting greater engagement in society for people with disabilities through improved health and opportunity for employment and can logically and feasibly be incorporated into the vocational rehabilitation service system.</p>

<title>Method</title>
<sec id="section4-0034355212440732">
<title>Participants</title>
<p>A total of 126 adults with SCI completed an anonymous online survey that was advertised by the National Spinal Cord Injury Association (NSCIA) in a newsletter and in a mass email to members, or recruited other SCI support groups and rehabilitation counseling professors. To be eligible to participate, individuals needed to be 18 years of age or older with SCI and able to engage in some form of physical activity and exercise independently. Participants ranged in age from 19 to 76 years (<italic>M</italic> = 43.5, <italic>SD</italic> = 13.3). More than half of the participants were male (66.1%) and the majority described themselves as European American (81.0%), followed by Latino (8.7%) and African American (5.6%). The sample reported being relatively well educated: more than 95% of the participants completed high school and more than half (58.7%) earned a college degree. Nearly half of the participants were married or in a significant long-term relationship (49.2%), and most of the other participants described themselves as single (41.3%). In regard to employment, 41.3% worked either full-time or part-time, 23.8% were retired or not seeking employment, 20.6% were seeking employment, and 14.3% were volunteering. The current or most recent career category most often selected was “professional” (39.7%), followed by “manager” (18.3%) and “student” (17.5%). Most participants reported a spinal cord lesion at the cervical level (41.3%) or the thoracic level (43.7%). The majority of participants reported that they had partial movement in their arms and no movement in their legs (56.3%).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0034355212440732">
<title>Measures</title>
<p>In addition to the demographic information collected (age, gender, race, education), participants were asked to provide information specific to their SCI (time since injury, preinjury physical activity level, and functional limitations). Finally, participants were asked about their employment status, occupation, and income level.</p>
<sec id="section6-0034355212440732">
<title>Preinjury physical activity</title>
<p>A one-item measure was used to assess preinjury physical activity. Participants were asked,
<disp-quote>
<p>Prior to acquiring your spinal cord injury, how many times per week on average did you engage in moderate to vigorous physical activity and exercise (e.g., aerobics, fast bicycling, swimming, team sports, etc.) for at least 10 minutes at a time that made you breathe much harder than normal?</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Responses options included “0,” “1 to 2,” “3 to 4,” and “5 or more.”</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-0034355212440732">
<title>Severity of injury</title>
<p>The severity of SCI was measured with the <italic>Self-Report Functional Independence Measure</italic> (SRFM) basic Activities of Daily Living (ADL) subscale. The SFRM is a widely used functional assessment measured based on a modified version of the <italic>Functional Independence Measure</italic>, developed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0034355212440732">Keith, Granger, Hamilton, and Sherwin (1987)</xref>. The basic ADL subscale has 13 items to measure 13 basic ADLs, specifically for people with SCI. Sample items included, “How much help do you need to move around inside your house?” and “How much help do you need to transfer from the shower or tub?” Respondents were asked to choose from four response choices, ranging from 1 (<italic>total help or never do</italic>) to 4 (<italic>no extra time or help</italic>), with possible total scores ranging from 13 to 52. In this study, items were reverse scored so that high scores indicated high functional dependence/severity and low scores indicated high functional independence. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0034355212440732">Hoenig, Branch, McIntyre, Hoff, and Horner (1999)</xref> reported high test–retest reliability for a mailed survey, and the intraclass correlation coefficient and internal consistency, using Cronbach’s alpha, were .90 and .96, respectively. Construct validity of SRFM has been supported by significant correlations between SRFM scores and the hours of personal assistance needed, as well as the number of affected limbs, the amount of useful movement, and the amount of motor dysfunction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0034355212440732">Hoenig et al., 1999</xref>). Cronbach’s alpha coefficient for the SRFM in the present study was computed to be .95.</p>

<sec id="section8-0034355212440732">
<title>Normative and control beliefs about physical activity and exercise</title>
<p>A TPB physical activity and exercise questionnaire, adapted from a sample TPB scale provided by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0034355212440732">Ajzen (2002)</xref>, was designed specifically for this study to assess normative and control beliefs related to physical activity and exercise. The Normative Belief scale is composed of four items (e.g., “My family members think that I should be physically active and exercise on a regular basis”; “My doctor thinks that I should be physically active and exercise on a regular basis”), and the Control Beliefs scale is composed of four items (e.g., “How often do you encounter unanticipated events that prevent you from exercising and being physically active on a regular basis?” “How often do family obligations place unanticipated demands on your time, interrupting your plan to exercise and be physically active regularly?”). Participants were asked to rate the items for both scales on a 7-point Likert-type scale, ranging from “extremely unlikely” to “extremely likely.” Reliability and validity of items based on Ajzen’s standardized guidelines have been established (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0034355212440732">Courneya, Friedenreich, Sela, Quinney, &amp; Rhodes, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0034355212440732">Courneya, Vallance, Jones, &amp; Reiman, 2005</xref>). Cronbach’s alpha coefficient for the TPB Normative Beliefs scale in the present study was computed to be .92, and the alpha coefficient for the Control Beliefs scale was .77.</p>

<sec id="section9-0034355212440732">
<title>Interpersonal support for physical activity and exercise</title>
<p>Interpersonal support was measured using the <italic>Friend Support for Exercise Habits Scale/Family Support for Exercise Habits Scale</italic> developed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0034355212440732">Sallis, Grossman, Pinski, Patterson, and Nader (1987)</xref> to measure perceived social support specific to health-related exercise behaviors. The Friend Support for Exercise Habits Scale has 5 items to measure exercise encouragement (e.g., “Gave me encouragement to stick with my exercise program”), and the Family Support for Exercise Habits Scale has 15 items to assess family participation and involvement (e.g., “Discussed exercise with me”) as well as rewards and punishments (e.g., “Criticized me or made fun of me for exercising”). For this study, items were modified to reflect “physical activity” in addition to and exercise. Items were rated on a 5-point Likert-type scale (1 = <italic>none</italic> to 5 = <italic>very often</italic>). The test–retest reliability has been reported in the acceptable range, <italic>r</italic> = .55 to .79, and the internal consistency reliability coefficients reported are acceptable, coefficient alpha = .61 to .91 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0034355212440732">Sallis et al., 1987</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0034355212440732">Calfas, Sallis, Oldenburg, and French (1997)</xref> and Sallis et al. provided evidence of construct validity and predictive validity.

<p>Perceived benefits of physical activity/exercise was measured using a modified version of the <italic>Outcome Expectations for Exercise Scale</italic> (OEE), which was developed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0034355212440732">Resnick, Zimmerman, Orwig, Furstenberg, and Magaziner (2000)</xref> to measure the outcome expectations for exercise for older adults. The OEE has nine items that focus on the positive expectations of exercise (e.g., “Exercise improves my endurance in performing my daily activities”). We modified the items for this study to indicate physical activity and exercise. The OEE uses a 5-point Likert-type scale (1 = <italic>strongly agree</italic> to 5 = <italic>strongly disagree</italic>). There was evidence of internal consistency for the OEE scale provided by an alpha coefficient of .89 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0034355212440732">Resnick et al., 2000</xref>), and studies across settings have supported the reliability and validity of the OEE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0034355212440732">Lee, Chiu, Ho, Wu, &amp; Watson, 2011</xref>). Cronbach’s alpha coefficient for the OEE in the present study was computed to be .91.</p>

<title>Perceived barriers to physical activity and exercise</title>
<p>Perceived barriers to physical activity/exercise were measured with the <italic>Barriers to Health Promoting Activities for Disabled Persons Scale</italic> (BHADP; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0034355212440732">Becker, Stuifbergen, &amp; Sands, 1991</xref>). It is composed of 18 items and three subscales, Intrapersonal Barriers (e.g., “too tired”), Interpersonal (e.g., “other responsibilities”), and Environmental Barriers (e.g., “lack of transportation”). Items are rated using a 4-point Likert-type scale, with total scores ranging from 18 to 72, and higher scores indicating greater perceived barriers. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0034355212440732">Becker et al. (1991)</xref> reported that the internal consistency reliability of the scale was .82, and they found that people with disabilities had significantly higher barrier scores than people without disabilities. Cronbach’s alpha coefficient for the BHADP in the present study was computed to be .88.</p>

<sec id="section12-0034355212440732">
<title>Self-efficacy for physical activity and exercise</title>
<p>Self-efficacy was measured using the <italic>SCI Exercise Self-Efficacy Scale</italic> (ESES), which was developed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0034355212440732">Kroll, Kehn, Ho, and Groah (2007)</xref> to measure exercise self-efficacy for people with SCI. It is composed of 10 items that measure confidence in one’s ability to engage in exercise or physical activity (e.g., “I am confident that I can overcome barriers and challenges with regard to physical activity and exercise if I try hard enough”) on a 4-point Likert-type scale. Kroll et al. reported a Cronbach’s alpha of .93, indicating a high degree of internal consistency reliability and also found that all items loaded onto one factor. Statistically significant correlation with the Generalized Self-Efficacy Scale (Spearman’s ρ = .32; <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05) lends support to the measure’s construct validity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0034355212440732">Kroll et al., 2007</xref>). Cronbach’s alpha coefficient for the ESES in the present study was computed to be .90.</p>

<sec id="section13-0034355212440732">
<title>Commitment to a plan for physical activity and exercise</title>
<p>Commitment to a plan for physical activity/exercise was measured by the <italic>Revised Planning for Exercise Scale</italic> (RPES), which was developed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0034355212440732">Shin, Pender, and Yun (2003)</xref>. The scale is based on the original <italic>Planning for Exercise Scale</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0034355212440732">Pender, 1996</xref>) and is intended to measure the commitment to a plan of action for Korean adults experiencing chronic diseases. Seven of the 11 items were retained from the original Pender scale (e.g., “I keep written records of my exercise activity”), and 13 items were added following a qualitative procedure (e.g., “I have located a place or facility where I can exercise comfortably”). For this study, items were modified to reflect “physical activity and exercise.” Items are rated on a 3-point Likert-type scale, with higher scores indicating a higher commitment to exercising. Factor analysis revealed four latent exercise factors (conditions, cue expansion, interpersonal, recording/rewards; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0034355212440732">Shin et al., 2003</xref>). Internal consistency reliability coefficients (Cronbach’s alpha) for the subscales ranged from .80 to .87 and .93 for the overall scale (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0034355212440732">Shin et al., 2003</xref>). For the current study, two items were omitted because they were not appropriate for individuals with SCI (e.g., “I prepare my running shoes in order to remember that I have to exercise”), leaving a total of 18 items. Cronbach’s alpha coefficient for the RPES in the present study was computed to be .92.</p>

<title>Physical activity and exercise composite outcome measure</title>
<p>Measurement of physical activity and exercise levels by self-report poses several challenges for researchers, and there are additional challenges when measuring this variable for people with physical disabilities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0034355212440732">Washburn, Zhu, McAuley, Frogley, &amp; Figoni, 2002</xref>). In an effort to overcome measurement limitations and capture a greater amount of the variety of physical activity and exercise, two instruments, the <italic>International Physical Activity Questionnaire</italic> (IPAQ) and the <italic>Physical Activity Stages of Change Instrument</italic> (PASC), were used to develop a composite outcome measure.</p>
<p>The IPAQ was developed by an International Consensus Group between 1997 and 1998 as an instrument for cross-national monitoring of physical activity and inactivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0034355212440732">Craig et al., 2003</xref>). The IPAQ assesses physical activity of adults undertaken across different domains (leisure time physical activity, domestic and gardening/yard activities, work-related physical activity, transport-related physical activity). The items in the short IPAQ form were structured to provide separate scores on walking, moderate-intensity, and vigorous-intensity activity, and computation of the total score for the short form requires summation of the duration (in minutes) and frequency (days) of these activities. For this study, “walking” was modified to “using the wheelchair” to move around. Physical activity was computed by weighing each type of activity by its energy requirements defined in Metabolic Equivalents of Task (METs) to yield a score in MET minutes (MET Score of an Activity × Minutes Performed). Reliability and validity data have been collected in several countries. The IPAQ demonstrated acceptable test–retest reliability (Spearman’s r clustered around .80) and criterion validity (median r of about .30), giving it measurement properties equal or better than other established self-reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0034355212440732">Craig et al., 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>The PASC was developed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0034355212440732">Nigg et al. (2005)</xref> to operationalize the concept of readiness to engage in physical activities. It is composed of four items (e.g., “Do you currently engage in regular physical activity?”). Items are rated on a dichotomous “yes” or “no” format. Responses on the four items are converted to a 5-point rating scale to represent the degree of involvement in physical activity. Nigg et al. reported that the model of the scale has significant goodness of fit of the population estimates.</p>
<p>Although the PASC is a brief measure with a simple “yes” or “no” response format, the IPAQ is longer and asks more specific questions involving recall of the amount of time engaged in certain activities. The PASC is a more global measure, and participants can more easily recall general information to answer these questions. Although the IPAQ is more precise, it requires a great deal of specific information to be recalled, and participants are more likely to make estimates of time. It is expected that combining the scores of these different instruments more accurately measures physical activity and exercise levels. A moderate correlation between the IPAQ and the PASC (<italic>r</italic> = .47, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01) was found for this study. So, for this study, the IPAQ and PASC scores were converted to <italic>z</italic> scores, and the two scores were averaged to provide a composite score for the physical activity and exercise variable.</p>

<title>Procedures</title>
<p>The NSCIA was contacted to obtain their support in recruiting individuals with SCI for the current study. The NSCIA posted the survey announcement in the “Surveys and Studies” section of their website and sent out an email announcement about the study to each of their chapters to be posted in offices and to members with email addresses. This strategy was in keeping with the Internet research recommendation of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0034355212440732">Birnbaum (2004)</xref> to seek out the cooperation of a relevant agency with an established presence on the Internet. In addition, the authors wrote an article about health promotion for people with SCI and included information about the study for <italic>SCI Life</italic>, the NSCIA magazine for members. An email announcement about the study identical to the NSCIA announcement was sent to SCI support groups and professors of rehabilitation counseling asking them to forward it on to people or agencies who might be interested in participating. The survey was hosted on Survey Monkey (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.surveymonkey.com">www.surveymonkey.com</ext-link>). The option of only receiving one submission per computer (i.e., one IP address) was selected to avoid the problem of multiple submissions, which was one strategy to counter this issue noted by Birnbaum.</p>

<title>Data Analysis</title>
<p>The primary analysis was conducted using hierarchical regression analysis (HRA) to measure the incremental variance accounted for by each predictor set in the HPM. HRA is a flexible strategy for matching analysis to theory. It is particularly useful for hypothesis testing when hypotheses can be framed in terms of added or incremental Y variance accounted for by one set of predictors over and above what was explained by predictors entered at earlier steps in the model. In our study, the order of entry of sets of independent variables into the regression model is predetermined to address questions of theoretical interest. An a priori power analysis was conducted for the total <italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> value for the multiple regression analysis with nine predictor variables, power equal to .80, and an alpha level of .05. Results from this analysis using G*Power (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0034355212440732">Faul, Erdfelder, Lang, &amp; Buchner, 2007</xref>), a software tool for a general power analysis, suggested a sample size of 114 would be needed to detect a medium effect size (<italic>f</italic><sup>2</sup> = .15; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0034355212440732">Cohen, 1988</xref>). In the present study, a medium effect size was expected based on the medium effect sizes observed in exercise and physical activity research related to Pender’s HPM for people without disabilities and people with chronic illnesses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0034355212440732">Shin et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0034355212440732">Shin et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0034355212440732">Wu &amp; Pender, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0034355212440732">Wu, Pender, &amp; Noureddine, 2003</xref>).

<p>HRA was conducted with physical activity/exercise participation as the dependent variable and four sets of HPM predictors entered in sequential steps: (a) individual characteristics (preinjury physical activity level and functional limitations); (b) interpersonal influences (normative beliefs and social support factors); (c) behavior-specific cognitions (physical activity and exercise self-efficacy, perceived benefits/outcome expectancies, and perceived barriers); and (d) control beliefs and commitment to a plan of action. The correlations among the dependent variable and the predictor variables ranged from small to medium, and the correlation matrix for all variables is presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0034355212440732">Table 1</xref>.</p>

<p>In the first step of the regression analysis, individual characteristics and experience variables (preinjury physical activity level and severity of SCI) were entered. This set of variables accounted for a significant amount of variance in physical activity/exercise participation scores, <italic>R</italic> = .37, <italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> = .14, <italic>F</italic>(2, 123) = 9.67, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001. Examining the standardized partial regression coefficients, preinjury activity was found to significantly contribute to the change in variance in postinjury physical activity/exercise participation scores, with β = .17, <italic>t</italic>(124) = 2.03, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05. This result indicates that preinjury activity level was positively associated with postinjury physical activity/exercise participation. Severity of SCI also contributed significantly to the change in variance in physical activity/exercise participation scores, with β = −.32, <italic>t</italic>(124) = −3.80, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001. However, this relationship between severity and activity was negative, indicating that higher level of functional limitations was associated with lower level of postinjury physical activity and exercise participation.</p>
<p>Interpersonal influence variables (normative beliefs and family/friend support for exercise) were entered in the second step of the regression analysis. The addition of these variables did account for a significant increase in variance of physical activity/exercise participation beyond that explained by the previous sets of predictors, <italic>R</italic> = .43, <italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> = .18, Δ<italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> = .05, <italic>F</italic>(2, 121) = 3.32, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05. However, in examining the standardized partial regression coefficients for normative beliefs and interpersonal support, neither was found to independently contribute to the change in variance in physical activity/exercise participation scores.</p>
<p>Perceived benefits, barriers, and self-efficacy were entered in the third step of the regression analysis. These variables also accounted for a significant amount of variance in physical activity/exercise participation scores beyond that explained by the covariates entered in the first and second steps, <italic>R</italic> = .56, <italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> = .31, Δ<italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> = .13, <italic>F</italic>(3, 118) = 7.53, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001. At this step, perceived benefits of physical activity and exercise was the only variable of the three entered found to contribute significantly to the change in variance in physical activity/exercise participation scores, β = .21, <italic>t</italic>(119) = 2.27, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05, indicating that increased perceived benefits for physical activity/exercise was associated with greater physical activity/exercise participation.</p>
<p>In the final step, control beliefs and commitment to a plan of action were entered into the regression analysis. The addition of these two variables accounted for a significant amount of additional variance in physical activity participation scores beyond that explained by the individual characteristics and behavior-specific cognitions variables entered in previous steps, <italic>R</italic> = .64, <italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> = .41, Δ<italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> = .09, <italic>F</italic>(2, 116) = 9.57, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001. Commitment to a plan of action was found to contribute significantly to the change in variance in physical activity/exercise participation scores, β = .41, <italic>t</italic>(124) = 4.32, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001, indicating that increased commitment for an action plan was associated with greater physical activity and exercise participation. In the final model, preinjury physical activity remained a significant contributor to the variance in physical activity/exercise participation, β = .17, <italic>t</italic>(124) = 2.18, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01. Severity of SCI also remained a significant predictor of physical activity/exercise participation, β = −.20, <italic>t</italic>(124) = −2.41, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05.</p>
<p>The final regression model accounted for 41% of the variance in physical activity/exercise participation. According to Cohen’s standards for the behavioral sciences research, this is considered a large effect size (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0034355212440732">Cohen, 1988</xref>). Controlling for all other factors, preinjury physical activity level, severity of SCI, and commitment to a plan of action were found to be significant predictors of physical activity/exercise participation in persons with SCI. Preinjury physical activity level and commitment to a plan of action were positively associated with physical activity and exercise participation, and severity of SCI was negatively related to physical activity/exercise participation. Controlling for all other factors in the model, commitment to a plan of action was the strongest predictor of physical activity/exercise participation.</p>
<p>Because the commitment to a plan of action for physical activity can be considered a behavioral outcome and a modifiable determinant of health promoting behavior in Pender’s HPM, a logical follow-up analysis would be useful to determine whether individual characteristics and experiences, interpersonal influences, control beliefs, and behavior-specific cognitions can predict commitment to a plan of action. This secondary analysis can provide useful information on motivating people with SCI to make the commitment to a plan of action for physical activity participation, which in turn predicts exercise and physical activity participation. The HRA results of this secondary analysis are presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0034355212440732">Table 3</xref>.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>This is the first study to evaluate Pender’s HPM for physical activity and exercise with a sample of adults with SCI. The primary analysis, which used physical activity and exercise participation as the outcome variable, and the secondary analysis, which used commitment to a plan for physical activity and exercise, provide support for the use of Pender’s HPM in designing physical activity and exercise interventions for people with SCI. Secondary conditions often increase the functional limitations for individuals with disabilities, yet good health and physical stamina are important to obtaining and retaining employment and participating in other key life activities. The significant predictor HPM variables in this study can be used to design and validate future health promotion behavioral intervention programs for people with SCI in vocational rehabilitation.</p>
<p>In this study, the predictor variables of Pender’s HPM were divided into four sets (individual characteristics and experiences, interpersonal/situational influences, behavior-specific cognition, and control beliefs and commitment to a plan of action), aligning with the components of the model. Overall, the final model accounted for 41% of the variance in physical activity/exercise participation, which is considered a large effect size and provides good support for the use of Pender’s HPM in predicting physical activity/exercise participation for people with SCI. Preinjury physical activity/exercise level, severity of SCI, and commitment to a plan of action were significant individual predictors of the physical activity/exercise participation.</p>
<p>Commitment to a plan of action for physical activity was found to be most prominent in predicting physical activity and exercise behavior in this study. Because commitment to a plan of action is a potentially important and modifiable exercise determinant for people with SCI, a follow-up regression analysis was conducted to see whether the other predictor variables of Pender’s HPM could be used to predict commitment to a plan of action. Friend/family support, perceived self-efficacy, and perceived benefits were the strongest predictors of commitment to a plan of action for physical activity/exercise. Overall, the model accounted for 42% of the variance in commitment to a plan for physical activity/exercise. Prior physical activity behavior was found to be significant in the primary analysis but not in the secondary analysis. Conversely, friend/family support was not significant in the primary analysis but was significant in the secondary analysis. Therefore, prior physical activity behavior is more closely related to current physical activity behavior but not with commitment to a plan for physical activity/exercise. One possible explanation is that people who exercise frequently prior to the injury would have already developed the plan, habit, and routine to do exercise and have access to exercise equipment and facilities after they are injured rendering it unnecessary to make a commitment to a plan of action to exercise. They also have less need for friends and family members to motivate them to exercise or engage in physical activity. However, support and encouragement of friends and family members appear to be important in motivating people who need to make a commitment to make a plan to engage in exercise and physical activity.</p>
<p>The current study provides support for the structure of the HPM. The variables of self-efficacy and perceived benefits were found to enhance commitment to a plan of action, which in turn predicted health promoting behavior. Self-efficacy and perceived beliefs are constructs derived from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0034355212440732">Bandura’s (1977)</xref> social cognitive theory, and “commitment to a plan of action” is related to the “intention” construct in the TPB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0034355212440732">Fishbein &amp; Ajzen, 1975</xref>), providing support for the integration of the two theories in Pender’s HPM. Several variables in the HPM were not found to be significant contributors in the prediction model, and there are a variety of possible reasons. Normative beliefs was one variable that was not found to be a significant predictor, and this may be because of its similarity to friend/family support, and its effect may have been impacted by its moderate correlation with the friend/family support measure. Control beliefs is another variable that was not found to be a significant predictor, but it was correlated with commitment to a plan of action and may have reduced its independent contribution to the variance in reported physical activity and exercise. Control beliefs was also moderately correlated with perceived self-efficacy and perceived barriers. Perceived barriers was not found to be a significant predictor, but a strong inverse correlation with self-efficacy was observed, indicating that the self-efficacy variable may have overshadowed perceived barriers in the model. Finally, severity of SCI was found to be inversely related to physical activity/exercise behavior of people with SCI.</p>
<p>There appears to be considerable overlap of variables from different health promotion models, making it sometimes quite difficult to draw conclusions about the effect of the variables in various studies. For example, in the TPB, intention is the main predictor of behavior and has three components (attitude, subjective norms, and perceived behavioral control). At first glance, the components of this theory that were incorporated into Pender’s HPM did not seem to be strong predictors in this study. Attitude, which does not seem to be included in the HPM, was defined in the TPB to be a function of the individual’s beliefs about the consequences of carrying out the behavior and the positive or negative evaluation of those consequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0034355212440732">Hausenblas, Carron, &amp; Mack, 1997</xref>). This definition indicates that this variable is close to the “perceived benefits/outcome expectancy” variable in the HPM, which was a significant predictor of commitment to an action plan. There also appears to be a good deal of crossover between the TPB variable “intention” and the HPM variable “commitment to a plan of action,” though it was noted that “commitment” goes beyond “intention” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0034355212440732">Pender, 1996</xref>). It is important to continue efforts to clarify definitions of the variables used in different health promotion models. This will lessen confusion between similar health variables and enhance the ability to accurately measure the constructs.</p>
<p>Pender’s HPM incorporates many aspects of earlier health promotion models, but there may be additional variables in other models that should be included. The positive orientation toward life enhancing motivational factors has resulted in the omission of avoidance-motivated behavior variables, such as those based on fear or threat appraisal. The extended parallel process model (EPPM) is well known in the field of communications and approaches health promotion from a different perspective. It assumes a negative perspective in the use of fear appeals, which are persuasive messages intended to scare people by describing the negative consequences that may occur if they do not adopt the recommended health behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0034355212440732">Witte, 1992</xref>). Models like the EPPM offer additional predictor variables to consider including in a multidimensional health promotion model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0034355212440732">Carpenter, 2010</xref>).</p>
<sec id="section19-0034355212440732">
<title>Limitations and Future Research</title>
<p>There are several limitations in this study that should be considered when interpreting the results and addressed in future research. First, a convenience sample was used, which may have underrepresented people from a lower socioeconomic background because using the Internet requires access to computer hardware and an Internet connection. The participants who are members of the NSCIA and its chapters and visit the association website may also be more likely to be younger and more comfortable with technology and/or more educated, and may have more knowledge of health and health benefits and greater access to health care and supportive community resources. The majority of the participants in this study were European Americans, and people from racial and ethnic minority backgrounds were notably underrepresented. Future studies with higher representation of minorities with SCI may help clarify cultural factors and the intersection of cultural and disability factors that will affect physical activity self-management in people with SCI.</p>
<p>Second, the data collected using a self-report format may not be similar to that collected by more objective measurement techniques (e.g., measuring actual activities using pedometers that are modified for wheelchair users). There may also be some limitations due to the difficulty in measuring some of the abstract constructs. Measures of physical activity and exercise can be affected by recall bias, mood, and health status and have challenged researchers. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0034355212440732">Washburn et al. (2002)</xref> noted that the lack of a valid and reliable physical activity measure for people with physical disabilities was a major limitation in determining the benefits of a physically active lifestyle. The measurement of actual physical activity and exercise levels via a self-report survey should be interpreted with caution, and future research should incorporate objective indicators as well.</p>
<p>Finally, this study was limited in that we looked only at support from family and friends; however, there is emerging support to expand our understanding of people and relationships who may play a role in supporting individuals and their health promoting behaviors. For instance, a recent qualitative study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0034355212440732">Kerstin, Gabriele, and Richard (2006)</xref> found that the motivational power of role models was an important factor impacting motivation to engage in physical activity for the people with SCI they interviewed. Role models for people with SCI are much less likely to be family members, yet three quarters of the items measuring interpersonal support in the current study related to family members. The measure of normative beliefs used did not have any items about role models. This may be an important construct that is currently lacking in the extant literature. Moreover, the impact of professionals, such as rehabilitation counselors, to provide and/or facilitate role modeling and supportive relationships requires further exploration.</p>

<title>Implications for Rehabilitation Counseling Research and Practice</title>
<p>Findings from this study have several implications for rehabilitation counseling practice and research. First, there is tremendous need for effective health promotion efforts for people with disabilities. Relative to the general population, people with disabilities are at a greater risk of susceptibility to other chronic conditions related to health complications resulting from their primary disability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0034355212440732">Rimmer et al., 2010</xref>). This can result in limited participation in community life as well as high health care expenditures. Although secondary conditions are often preventable, it is unfortunate that health promotion efforts often fail to target the needs of people with disabilities, and they are often neglected in the development of preventative health activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0034355212440732">World Health Organization [WHO], 2011</xref>). In reviewing the website for the new national health agenda, Healthy People 2020 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0034355212440732">USDHHS, 2010</xref>), the related topics of “Physical Activity” and “Disability and Health” are particularly relevant to this discussion. There is little mention of people with disabilities in the overview and objectives pages of the “Physical Activity” topic, and there is little attention given to physical activity and exercise in the overview and objectives pages of the “Disability and Health” section. A concern for the health of all adults (including people with chronic health issues and disabilities) is expressed, but the general health promotion efforts targeted for all adults may not be adequate. To meet the health needs of people with disabilities, all rehabilitation and health professionals need to remain mindful of this population in the design and implementation of disease prevention and health promotion initiatives. Health promotion models are used to aid in the design of interventions, and preference should be given to the use of models that have been validated for people with disabilities to develop the most effective and successful intervention programs for the widest range of people. At the same time, future research is needed to better understand the applicability of these models to specific disability populations.</p>
<p>Second, our study’s findings support the applicability of Pender’s HPM in predicting physical activity and exercise participation for people with SCI. There were three significant variables in the model: commitment to a plan for physical activity/exercise, preinjury activity level, and severity of SCI. However, preinjury activity level and severity of SCI are variables that cannot be changed and are not realistic foci for health promotion interventions. Consequently, commitment to a plan for physical activity/exercise is a useful target variable for health promotion efforts. Rehabilitation professionals could focus efforts in working with people to help them progress and develop a plan of action, working with them to overcome any barriers impacting their commitment. A follow-up analysis in our study was done with commitment to a plan of action as the outcome variable. This secondary analysis revealed that “commitment” was predicted by self-efficacy, perceived benefits, and family/friend support. Counseling interventions focused on enhancing self-efficacy related to physical activity/exercise and perceived benefits of physical activity/exercise will increase the commitment to a plan of physical activity/exercise, ultimately increasing physical activity and exercise participation. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0034355212440732">Costanzo, Walker, Yates, McCabe, and Berg (2006)</xref> developed a behavioral counseling intervention for older women using the HPM as a framework and found the intervention was effective for helping the women improve in the area of cardiovascular fitness. Counseling interventions similar to this one, but tailored for people with SCI, may be appropriate for clinical application.</p>
<p>Third, it is important to consider the role of work and employment seeking with regard to health promoting behaviors. Exercise and physical activity indeed inhibit secondary conditions and functional limitations, consequently, promoting job acquisition and retention. Thus, a focus on health promotion complements rehabilitation employment services aimed at promoting independence and functioning. Rehabilitation counselors have the opportunity to play a pivotal role in promoting health behaviors at the consumer level. Rehabilitation counselors can assist consumers with decision making, problem solving barriers, and negotiating a balance between time demands of work-related (or job-seeking) activities and physical exercise. Moreover, rehabilitation counselors may be useful in addressing demand-side needs, such as assisting employers with developing inclusive health programs and initiatives for employees that ensures full inclusion and accessibility for workers with disabilities.</p>
<p>Finally, findings from this study suggest several areas for future research. There appears to be considerable overlap among the variables used in different health promotion models, and future research is needed to more clearly distinguish differences among constructs. Such efforts will require the continued development of effective and efficient instruments. Measurement of physical activity and exercise for people with physical disabilities remains a challenge in research, as noted by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0034355212440732">Washburn et al. (2002)</xref>, and movement toward a more uniform understanding of the constructs of physical activity and exercise and the subsequent development of sound measurement instruments will advance this line of study. In addition, the impact of cultural factors and motivation and volition of physical activity/exercise behaviors may shed light on person–environment (P × E) interaction issues related to physical activity exercise behavior in people with SCI from racial and ethnic minority backgrounds. Adding P × E factors may be useful for validating HPM as a culturally sensitive health promotion model for people with SCI.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Overall, the findings for this study provide good support for variables in Pender’s HPM. Variables from the HPM model were found to predict physical activity/exercise participation (the model accounted for 41% of the variance) and commitment to a plan for physical activity/exercise (the model accounted for 42% of the variance). All of the predictor variables in the HPM were found to be significant in either predicting physical activity/exercise or predicting commitment to a plan for physical activity/exercise with the exception of normative beliefs, control beliefs, and perceived barriers. This provides support for the validation of the model as a predictor of physical activity/exercise participation for people with SCI and the use of this model in the development of health promotion interventions for people with SCI.</p>
