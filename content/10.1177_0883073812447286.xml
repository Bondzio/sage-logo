<abstract>
<p>Fumarase deficiency is a very rare inborn error of metabolism caused by decreased activity of fumarate hydratase enzyme. We describe a fumarase-deficient infant who presented with encephalopathy, metabolic crisis, psychomotor retardation, hypotonia, seizures, and facial dysmorphism. To our knowledge, this is the first Indian child to be described with fumarase deficiency.</p>

<body>
<p>Fumaric aciduria, a rare autosomal recessive disorder, is caused by deficiency of fumarate hydratase enzyme that catalyzes conversion of fumarate to malate in the Krebs cycle. It exists in 2 isoforms: mitochondrial, which originates from the Krebs cycle, and cytosolic, which processes fumaric acid from the urea cycle, amino acids, and purine metabolism. Both isoforms are encoded by the same fumarate hydratase gene located on chromosome 1q.42.1 and affected in fumarase deficiency.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0883073812447286">1</xref></sup></p>
<p>Fumarase deficiency is characterized by progressive neurologic abnormalities that may present antenatally as polyhydramnios and cerebral malformations and in the neonatal period as infantile encephalopathy, metabolic crisis, developmental retardation, seizures, microcephaly, hydrocephalus, failure to thrive, and dysmorphism.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0883073812447286">2</xref></sup> Neonatal polycythemia, leucopenia, and mild hepatosplenomegaly may be associated. There is no known treatment. We describe here a 5-month-old infant with characteristic features and early presentation of this very rare disease. To our knowledge, this is the first reported case of fumarase deficiency in an infant from India.</p>
<sec id="section1-0883073812447286">
<title>Case Report</title>
<p>A 5-month-old male infant, born to nonconsanguineous parents, was admitted to our hospital with developmental delay, hypotonia, excessive irritability since birth and decreased feeding and generalized tonic-clonic seizures for the past 2 days. The child was born at term by spontaneous vaginal delivery in a hospital. Antenatally, the mother had oligohydramnios and intrauterine growth retardation. Birth weight of the baby was 2.1 kg. He had delayed cry by 5 minutes, for which he required resuscitation. At age 5 months, he did not attain social smile, head control, and cooing; he weighed 5.5 kg and his head circumference was 39.9 cm. He had facial dysmorphism-hypertelorism, brachycephaly, almond-shaped eyes with mild synophrys, depressed nasal bridge, and short philtrum with anteverted nares. He was extremely irritable, with an inconsolable cry. Cranial nerve examination showed no visual fixation or following and bilateral pale optic discs. He responded well to sound. Motor examination revealed hypotonia and normal power in all 4 limbs. Deep tendon reflexes were normally elicitable. Primitive reflexes were intact. The rest of the systemic examination was unremarkable.</p>
<p>At admission, hemoglobin was 10.9 g/dL, total leucocyte count 7 × 10<sup>3</sup> cells/µL (neutrophils 78%, lymphocytes 21%, monocytes 1%), serum Na<sup>+</sup> 133 mmol/L, K<sup>+</sup> 5.8 mmol/L, urea 35 mg/dL, and creatinine 0.5 mg/dL. Lumbar puncture was not suggestive of meningitis. C-reactive protein was negative. Electroencephalography showed diffuse encephalopathy with no epileptiform discharges (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0883073812447286">Figure 1</xref>).</p>

</fig>
<p>Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain showed cerebral atrophy and multiple areas of T2/fluid-attenuated inversion recovery hyperintensities in bilateral cerebral hemispheres (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0883073812447286">Figure 2</xref>). In view of multiple seizures, the child was taken off feeds, and seizures were managed with phenytoin 8 mg/kg/d and levetiracetam 40 mg/kg/d. Child was noted to be symptomatically better the next day. Inadvertently, milk was restarted and the child deteriorated again. In view of the absence of infection and symptomatic improvement after stopping feeds, a metabolic disorder was strongly suspected. In addition, pH was 7.30, serum bicarbonate 11.2 mmol/L, anion gap 26 mmol/L, serum lactate 31.5 mg/dL (6.3-18.9 mg/dL), and ammonia 296 µg/dL (15-56 µg/dL). In view of acidosis and hyperammonemia, organic acid defects were strongly suspected. Urinary organic acid analysis by gas chromatography/mass spectroscopy showed increased excretion of fumaric acid (22 µmol/mmol creatinine, normal &lt;8 µmol/mol creatinine), succinate (20.3), and lactate (9.28). Other metabolic studies, including plasma amino acids, carnitine profile, and urine orotic acids, were normal. Abdomen ultrasonography did not reveal any organomegaly. He developed shock and oliguria with metabolic acidosis. In spite of sodium bicarbonate corrections, fluids, and inotropes, refractory acidosis persisted for which peritoneal dialysis was initiated, but the child succumbed to his illness on the 12th day of hospital stay. Inheritance of the disorder and chances of recurrences were explained to the parents.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Fumarase deficiency has a wide spectrum of clinical manifestations. Our patient presented with the characteristic neurologic and dysmorphic manifestations with optic nerve pallor as previously described in literature.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0883073812447286">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0883073812447286">3</xref></sup> Central nervous system malformations and antenatal polyhydramnios were not seen in the index case. Rather, intrauterine growth retardation and oligohydramnios was elicited in history. Dysmorphism has been observed in 40% of the patients in case-series, although the underlying mechanism in fumaric aciduria is unknown.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0883073812447286">2</xref></sup></p>
<p>An important laboratory feature of many of the inborn errors of metabolism during acute episodes of illness is high-anion-gap metabolic acidosis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0883073812447286">4</xref></sup> Organic acid disorders, including fumarase deficiency are one such distinctive group that may present early in infancy with metabolic acidosis as seen in our patient.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0883073812447286">3</xref></sup> The first patient of fumarase deficiency was described by Zinn et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0883073812447286">5</xref></sup> and until now, only 40 cases have been reported in the literature in the past 27 years.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0883073812447286">2</xref></sup> Although the survival is usually up to the first 2 years of life and fumarase deficiency has been seen in infants before,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0883073812447286">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0883073812447286">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0883073812447286"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0883073812447286"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0883073812447286">8</xref></sup> our case is one of the earliest presentations of infantile metabolic encephalopathy, with only 1 case reported at 4 months of age.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0883073812447286">8</xref></sup> Biochemically, elevated excretion of fumaric acid has been seen in all cases, being considered a hallmark of this disorder. Similar to our case, Elpeleg et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0883073812447286">9</xref></sup> and Bonioli et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0883073812447286">8</xref></sup> reported patients with lower levels of fumaric aciduria (38-137 and 110 kmol/mmol creatinine, respectively). It has been suggested that fumarate excretion is not correlated with the residual enzyme activity and severity of the clinical picture. Hence, all patients showing even a slight increase in fumarate excretion should be investigated for fumarase deficiency.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0883073812447286">8</xref></sup> Further confirmations can be done by fumarate hydratase enzyme activity measurement in fibroblasts or leucocytes and molecular genetic analysis. These could not be done in our patient because of the nonavailability of these tests in our country and financial constraints. Prenatal diagnosis has been achieved by measuring amniotic or chorionic villous fumarase activity and mutation analysis, thus aiding genetic counseling for future pregnancies.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0883073812447286">10</xref></sup></p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Fumarase deficiency should be included in the differential diagnosis of inborn errors of metabolism that cause neurologic manifestations, dysmorphism, and high anion-gap metabolic acidosis. Presentation as infantile metabolic encephalopathy is very rare. Treatment is supportive and outcome is frequently fatal in infancy or childhood.</p>
