<abstract>
<p>This article analyses a particular case of interactions between “Southern” and “Northern” nongovernmental organizations (NGOs). It considers a sample of Colombian social movements and organizations concerned with victims of Colombian armed conflicts as well as some Spanish NGOs working in Colombia. Specifically, it considers relationships, communication processes, and organizational patterns, and identifies an emergent practice of “transnational political echolocation” understood in terms of mobilizing and grievance strategies within a transnational arena shaped by information and communication technologies.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>This article builds on critical research traditions that have arisen in recent years, questioning international development policies and foreign aid strategies. Following Boaventura de Souza Santos, some of this questioning, which has become characteristic of movements concerned with postdevelopment, postfeminism, and postcolonialism, among others, can be categorized as oppositional postmodernism.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0304375412444810">1</xref>
</sup> Here we especially seek to engage with oppositional postmodernism’s proposal to reinvent the emancipation of social groups that have been excluded and forgotten by the deployment of various ideological systems arising from Western modernity, including capitalism, scientism, individualism, and rationalism. We are also interested in various proposals made by oppositional postmodernism to create a novel strategy for carrying out such an ambitious project by building on the transnationalization of local struggles both for socially excluded groups and for the social organizations that support them. We recognize in this attempt to reinvent emancipation some aspects of what is often called the premodern, including traditional forms of economy, the value of nonscientific knowledge, communitarianism, and links to the land and to place.</p>
<p>In the last twenty years or so, some emergent groups—new social movements, networks and global platforms, and international nongovernmental organizations (NGOs)—have adhered to versions of these objectives. They have gradually created transnational networks that act as a medium for working through and with socially excluded groups; in this article, we use the term excluded to refer to groups and individuals who suffer, in different ways and degrees, the violation of individual, social, economic, and cultural rights. Transnational networks promote emancipation when they support the initiatives and processes undertaken by the affected subjects themselves by multiplying their effects and strengthening the social and political influence to prevent or redress violated rights.</p>
<p>Here, we explore transnational political activism<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0304375412444810">2</xref>
</sup> in the context of case study material from Colombia and Spain. These connections are only partially explored in some of the English-language literature. Our first step is to review some of the positions encompassed by the term oppositional postmodernism. Our second step is to put forward evidence for a new concept, transnational political echolocation, which we use to outline a preliminary systematic framework, which we are still developing. This concept goes beyond the idea of the “boomerang pattern” and other significant points raised by Margaret Keck and Kathryn Sikkink in their book <italic>Activists beyond Borders.</italic>
<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0304375412444810">3</xref>
</sup> We use it to refer to a new communication strategy, civic action, and solidarity generated by emergent agents in a transnational space and the renovation of social emancipation.</p>
<p>We take the term echolocation from zoology, where it designates the guidance systems of cetaceans and chiropterans (bats, for example) which, by emitting sounds and picking them up after they bounce off objects and obstacles, manage to navigate and move around without colliding. We use this term metaphorically and attribute to it a political status to the extent that excluded groups emit appeals, statements, reports, or complaints to ensure the mobilization of social actors in such a way as to bring pressure to bear to transform the initial situation causing the action. Echolocation policy is especially useful in transnational space because the effects of the initial action travel through the interconnection of network nodes passing through local, national, and international space.</p>
<p>As a starting point, we will describe the conditions allowing us to speak of a new social emancipation and the processes of consolidating transnational networks through information and communication technologies (ICTs). We will then discuss the methodological guidelines of the research, particularly the central aspects of the fieldwork in Spain and Colombia. Finally, we present the results of the research, together with our main conclusions.</p>

<title>Social Emancipation and Collective Action Through Transnational Networks</title>
<sec id="section3-0304375412444810">
<title>A New Emancipation?</title>
<p>Modern conceptions of emancipation sought to release the premodern individual but produced only a halfway house; at least, this is the thesis put forward by Néstor García Canclini when he developed the concept of hybrid culture.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0304375412444810">4</xref>
</sup> Modern conceptions of emancipation seek to elevate human reason over the inevitabilities and determinisms characterizing the dogmas of religion, clan, tribe, or community, but this has led to the slow process of Indian deindigenization, proletarianization of the peasantry, and the uprooting of the traditional lives of rural populations.</p>
<p>Critiques of modern concepts of emancipation have been abundant in recent decades. The grand narratives celebrating modernity (even when qualified as having lost their utopian energies or as having produced disappointment and disbelief)<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0304375412444810">5</xref>
</sup> have attempted to release great liberating desires that have become deformed. Just as the enlightenment has long been understood to be a contradictory process, modernity has also been judged to have had perverse consequences.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0304375412444810">6</xref>
</sup> As writers like Walter Mignolo and Enriques Dussel have argued, the ideologies of modernity have had a double face, the genocidal and the emancipatory. Both Marxism and liberalism have oppressed and liberated people and societies.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0304375412444810">7</xref>
</sup> Consequently, such writers propose a new conception of emancipation that avoids universalist claims which end up legitimizing forms of power contradicting their principles of emancipation. They encourage a decolonizing emancipation of thought that leads people to think of themselves in terms of liberating projects. This critique of modernity, of course, has been provoked not only by engaged intellectuals but also by social sectors that have been made vulnerable by the material and symbolic forms of modern rationality.</p>
<p>We use the term “new emancipation” for didactic purposes only. It does not signify an emancipation that is radically different from modern conventions but takes a hybrid form by adopting some resources from modernity, such as the discourses of plural democracy and human rights and the use of ICTs, and mixes them with elements that are often understood to be “premodern,” most notably the resurgence of communitarianism and traditional knowledge. Faced with the question of what is new in this emancipation in comparison with emancipatory processes of the twentieth century, Santos and García Villegas<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-0304375412444810">8</xref>
</sup> identify two aspects: (i) exponentially increased border relations and ICTs that have produced spatial and temporal changes in social action (ii) the voracity with which hegemonic globalization<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-0304375412444810">9</xref>
</sup> has come to devour not only the promises of progress, freedom, equality, nondiscrimination, and rationality, but also the idea of fighting for autonomy and self-rule.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0304375412444810">
<title>Transnational Networks of Emancipation under Counter-Hegemonic Globalization</title>
<p>According to Anthony Giddens, globalization is characterized by the increasing intensification of social relations on a global scale.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-0304375412444810">10</xref>
</sup> Following Antonio Gramsci, we may say that this intensification of relations becomes counter-hegemonic when such relationships gather together to subvert or alter the conformity of the masses in the maintenance of order.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-0304375412444810">11</xref>
</sup> On something like this basis, Santos and García Villegas contextualize the transnationalization of local struggles in the field of counter-hegemonic globalization: “local-global initiatives of subaltern and dominated social groups that seek to resist oppression, and mischaracterization and marginalization produced by hegemonic globalization.”<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-0304375412444810">12</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>Beyond our fieldwork in Spain and Colombia,<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-0304375412444810">13</xref>
</sup> it is relevant to highlight empirical evidence of other researchers who have confirmed the emergence of an emancipation with innovative nuances that come with the strategy of transnational networks. Thus, Arturo Escobar and Mauricio Pardo have interpreted the consolidation of ethnoterritorial organizations in the Colombian region of Chocó on the Pacific Coast as a key aspect of counter-hegemonic globalization: “The indigenous movement and the black movement are embedded in complex networks of national and international relationships that enable them to overcome the isolation and anomie in which the hegemonic system has tried to place them, that in this way inscribes them in the counter-hegemonic globalization networks.”<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn14-0304375412444810">14</xref>
</sup> Colombian Pacific ethnic groups have gained a hearing at the national level as a result of the “echoes” of their complaints at the international level. They have opted to rely on networks of partners at local, national, and international levels. In addition, this new element constitutes not only the type of counter-hegemonic global networks but also shapes their “emancipatory characteristics, pushing for recognition of their rights, building alternative forms of internal authority to state power and capital and boosting alternative knowledge systems.”<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn15-0304375412444810">15</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>Other authors have stressed the idea that we are faced with a world that is no longer a space of places, but a space of movements and networks that are phenomena of flows and movements that are not unidirectional and linear.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn16-0304375412444810">16</xref>
</sup> Moreover, according to Smith and Guarnizo, and to Alain Drainville, transnationalism is a bottom-up process.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn17-0304375412444810">17</xref>
</sup> The origin of this process lies in local resistance to globalization: “From Below it faces the decentering local resistances of the informal economy, ethnic nationalism, and grassroots activism.”<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn18-0304375412444810">18</xref>
</sup> Similarly, these authors conceive transnationalism as a multifaceted and multilocal process which includes migrant networks, groups of cross-border families, and other emerging translocal forms such as the struggles of communities and movements highlighted in this article. For these authors, transnational practices are liberating processes that go beyond the borders of nation states. They connect collectivities located in more than one country and embodying specific social relations between groups and specific networks.</p>
<p>Transnational networks function as mobile and transient resistance systems in the face of the risk of social, economic, cultural, or political exclusion. Arjun Appadurai addresses this idea, when referring to dislocation.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn19-0304375412444810">19</xref>
</sup> For Appadurai, this is a configuration of fractured cultural forms lacking regularities and of porous and diffuse borders, giving form to multiple imagined worlds, making it possible for people to escape from the constraints of the official and commercial mentality that surrounds them.</p>
<p>Globalization often seems to be a process that reaches all places, but any potential homogenization is offset by the creation of new forms of cultural diversity in which imagination brings forth many human horizons. Appadurai postulates a transnational and translocal anthropology in the contemporary world in which habit is less important than new experiences; and every one of us, when faced with the onslaught of globalization, is challenged to imagine his or her own life.</p>
<p>The intensification of cross-border relations and the exponential growth of the flow of interwoven relationships with an emancipating character would be difficult to conceive without the rise of ICTs.</p>

<title>Virtual Spaces and ICTs: An Opportunity for Transnational Emancipatory Action</title>
<p>The alteration of social space for collective action has also transformed the context for thinking about renewed ambitions for emancipation. We place the novelty of this context in virtual spaces such as channels of expression and communication in which organizations, social movements, and communities can deploy their objectives, demands, and complaints without resorting to physical and geographical movement, or the transmission of information through the mainstream media such as newspapers, television, or radio.</p>
<p>Plans for protest action by social movements no longer focus only on territorial jurisdictions. According to Saskia Sassen, for example, “Cyberspace goes beyond any existing territorial jurisdiction.”<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn20-0304375412444810">20</xref>
</sup> We also agree with Sassen when she argues that the Internet as a transnational virtual space “has an intrinsic autonomy with respect to state power.”<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn21-0304375412444810">21</xref>
</sup> In this sense, it displays a set of possible actions that we set out below. At present, we might classify virtual spaces into three broad categories according to the partners involved and the nature of participation and interaction that occurs in them: commercial, institutional, and citizen virtual spaces.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn22-0304375412444810">22</xref>
</sup> Here, we are especially interested in the civic virtual spaces, which, in Araya’s terms “are directed to information, communication and action between individuals and civil society organizations, [. . .] various kinds of groups, such as communities of interests, tastes and hobbies, where the subjective feeling of belonging to all of this is given by sharing a hobby, an adversary, an ideal, and so on. [. . .] Within the virtual citizen spaces are a diverse range of transnational social movements and organizations, where group or community identity is given by having objectives, causes or common opponents. They share a discourse and have a vocation towards action in the real world.”<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn23-0304375412444810">23</xref>
</sup> This definition of civic virtual spaces highlights the heterogeneity of transnational actors and how links generated are focused on identity. This subjective feeling of belonging to a whole leads us directly to draw on the work of Manuel Castells because he places the identity of communities of resistance at the center of the virtual citizen spaces. For Castells, civil society is in crisis, and the construction of resistant identities is the key that generates significant changes in the lives of certain excluded social groups.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn24-0304375412444810">24</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>According to analysts like Araya, another feature of these virtual spheres is that they generate a new morphology of citizenship that moves between local and global action without going through the state.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn25-0304375412444810">25</xref>
</sup> Similarly, Castells considers that the network society reconfigures power relations,<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn26-0304375412444810">26</xref>
</sup> while Sassen claims that two major pillars of the modern state, territoriality and sovereignty, are weakening as a consequence of changes brought about by economic globalization.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn27-0304375412444810">27</xref>
</sup> Sassen argues that an example of the weakening of sovereignty can be seen in the vindication of human rights, which can make demands to international law without recourse to their own state bodies. Thus, some agents that were once confined to domestic spaces can now be part of global networks that move in transnational geography, understood as the variety of strategic and interconnected locations which go beyond the borders of the nation-states in which they operate and range from international drug-trafficking networks to finance capital networks.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn28-0304375412444810">28</xref>
</sup> We might say, therefore, that virtual spaces are subspaces in the context of transnational expertise, where transnationality is understood to mean both translocal and transglobal, so that the local is part of the global and the global is part of the local: glocal, as it is now often said. This also leads us to consider transnational and spatial transfers<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn29-0304375412444810">29</xref>
</sup> to be less formalized than global civil society and national states.</p>
<p>We assign an important role to the relative informality of poor communities and social movements because in Colombia, as in many countries of the “South,” the exclusion of many people is precisely the violation by act or omission of their formal citizenship as a consequence of both systematic violations of individual rights and socioeconomic inequalities in the distribution of the common goods of society. Social exclusion also means lack of access to institutions such as courts, legislative bodies, and other human rights protection bodies. The new space opens up other possibilities that can approach a virtual and global citizenship and reveals the invisibility to which millions of excluded people are subjected.</p>
<p>For example, this new space has allowed us to examine peasant communities displaced by violence, ethnic movements such as the indigenous and afro-descendents of Chocó, and various peace communities that were largely invisible in the local, national, and international space. These groups can come out of the invisibility that “condemned them to membership of the nation-state represented exclusively by sovereign power.”<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn30-0304375412444810">30</xref>
</sup> Overcoming invisibility through transnationalism does not signify the extinction or reduction of the modern state. As we shall see, the political impact of NGOs and, especially, the strategy of transnational political echolocation consider that it should be the state that should compensate the victims or recognize the violated rights of certain groups.</p>
<p>The creation of transnational spaces cannot be explained without understanding the role of ICTs. The extensive work of Dussel on an ethic of liberation in the era of globalization and exclusion emphasizes the importance of Habermasian communicative ethics to conclude that there is a necessity to build “communities of victim communication.”<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn31-0304375412444810">31</xref>
</sup> Others, like Jorge González call for “more and better communities of production and symbolic communication connected by physical, material and digital links based on feeling, solidarity […] that should be able to draw on this insolence of possible worlds of intelligent technologies.”<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn32-0304375412444810">32</xref>
</sup> However, ICTs do not automatically make excluded groups visible. This requires at least two fundamental conditions: the existence of previous social networks (which exist in cross-border geographies that connect places) and the capacity to create technical infrastructure and software so that organizations, movements, and communities can participate in virtual spaces.</p>
<p>Transnational civic networks may be postulated as an emerging type of actor for a new paradigm of development cooperation and international assistance. According to Castells, a network is a set of interconnected nodes, which may vary depending on the intensity and frequency of interaction.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn33-0304375412444810">33</xref>
</sup> Networks as social structures are emerging, but they are open structures able to expand without limits and integrate new nodes if they share the same codes of communication. For Castells, these networks are the new social morphology of the contemporary era. They are flexible, fluid and give grassroots voices the opportunity to be heard. They are forms of communication and information exchange. They represent a two-way street between the victims in the South and the solidarity of outsiders of the North. The former provide testimonies, stories, and information about their situation and give legitimacy to those campaigning on their behalf. The latter provides access to institutions.</p>
<p>Collective action based on communication, without the requirement of physical presence and regardless of spatiotemporal coincidence, is an evident transformation of conventional forms of solidarity, assistance, and cooperation. Digital platforms (Web sites, blogs, online campaigns . . .) are increasingly used by transnational networks seeking to promote the empowerment of excluded groups. Databases and online files of allegations of human rights violations, names of missing persons, and people displaced internally by the Colombian conflict are valuable resources for the organizations, movements, and associations. Mass e-mailings are an outreach strategy that expands the complaints, criticisms, and campaigns to target a larger number of people and countries, going beyond the capacities of postal mail and reducing the costs of telephone calls and faxes. Thus, ICTs have become a “sounding boards for local or regional problems, making them matters of global concern.”<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn34-0304375412444810">34</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>The strategy of sending e-mails to massive distribution lists enables an exponential movement of information with a high possibility of recipient reproduction, a high intensity, and a constant or variable frequency depending on the target. There is further significant characteristic: the qualification or relevancy of recipients can turn them into potential new transmitters forming a “reticulated and diffused structure” which is very useful to social movements and organizations.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn35-0304375412444810">35</xref>
</sup> ICTs have had a significant impact on the process of establishing “a shared new international awareness, and have made possible the collective development of alternative agendas.”<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn36-0304375412444810">36</xref>
</sup> Moreover, up to now, transnational civic networks had not taken “the media space is as visible a way as the demonstrations in Seattle, Washington, Prague and Genoa.”<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn37-0304375412444810">37</xref>
</sup> However, the new events in Tunisia, Egypt, and so on will offer a new practical reference on which to theorize. However, it is not only the “South’s” small local groups which are exploiting the advantages offered by ICTs. Transnational networks formed to fight for emancipation of the excluded also find support in the “North,” especially “in middle-class groups with academic training,”<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn38-0304375412444810">38</xref>
</sup> who identify with certain social causes. This is a new kind of activism based on identity ascriptions conveyed by ICTs, which are changing the conventional type of membership, so that formal membership of an organization is not necessary.<sup>

<title>Research Methodology</title>
<p>We are dealing with a complex subject. The methodology should therefore be appropriate for this requirement. Our research has focused on the case study, which provides insight into the dynamics present in specific contexts and allows us to describe this complexity. Also, the case study allows the combination of different methods for collecting qualitative and quantitative information in order to describe, verify, or generate theory.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn40-0304375412444810">40</xref>
</sup> The aim of our research is the exploration and documentation of the case study in the light of sociological theory. Accordingly, the case study uses different approaches to examine the object through different but progressive view points in order to discover new elements from various possible view points. Therefore, the case study is situated in a macro-sociological context (modernity, development, cooperation, international relations) in order to then focus on micro-sociological issues (interaction between NGOs and social groups, networking, petition campaigns . . .).</p>
<p>We have defined two types of interrelated populations with the corresponding selection of an intentional simple sample and conditioned sample in order to collect the data. The first population was the set of Spanish NGOs that had a presence in Colombia between 2000 and 2005. The corresponding sample was NGOs of a Spanish autonomous community, which allowed us to address different types of NGOs as classified by Ortega.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn41-0304375412444810">41</xref>
</sup> The second population defined was Columbian entities, associations, and groups, which were counterparts of the entities selected in the first stage. Consequently, the second sample was determined by the first sample, as only the Columbian partners or counterparts of the entities selected featured in the Spanish sample.</p>
<p>Initially, we chose Aragonese organizations that had been present in Colombia. We opted exclusively for Aragonese organizations for two reasons. The first was the fact that Aragon has international, national, and local agencies, which handle large, medium, and small budgets, so that with the NGOs of this autonomous community we would get a balanced representation of different types of organizations. The second was the selection of the conditioned sample: the larger the size of the first sample, the larger the size of the second, given that the next step was to select the counterparts of the Spanish entities in the South American country.</p>
<p>In the fieldwork we conducted a total of twenty-two semistructured interviews with representatives of the same number of NGOs. Half belonged to Spanish organizations of the autonomous community<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn42-0304375412444810">42</xref>
</sup> of Aragon and the other half to their counterparts in Colombia in four departments and the capital of the Republic (Antioquia, Bolívar, Valle del Cauca, Chocó, and Bogotá). The data were processed using qualitative content analysis, the discourses of various social actors were classified by categories for analysis (some planned and others emerging). Subsequently, classified data were interpreted in the light of the theoretical framework previously developed. Other techniques used were Participatory Action Research, the observation of digital content, and a type of online participant observation. We visited dozens of Web sites and blogs from NGOs, associations, social movements, networks, and platforms that defend human rights in Colombia. The observation was focused on how these entities transmit their information and the type of resources used to make their complaints, appeals, or campaigns most effective.</p>
<p>The online participant observation was done through chats and forums, and we became part of the e-mail distribution lists on human rights in Colombia. Although this technique was not planned from the beginning, inclusion in the e-mail lists meant the chance of obtaining a large amount of information that fell halfway between primary and secondary sources. Moreover, discussions on some forums and chats on Colombia brought spontaneity and proximity to the representations and symbols of readers and surfers on topics related to social exclusion in Colombia. The treatment of this information and the collection of information through conventional techniques were very useful, as we shall see below.</p>

<title>Results and Findings</title>
<p>The work of some NGOs is performed mainly on the Internet. This is one of our empirical findings, and we consider it to be a marker and symptom of the existence of virtual citizenship and an effective action of transnational emancipation networks. The case of the Nizkor organization, said to be the first intentional agreement to work on a global scale on human rights with information in Spanish, illustrates the effects of collective action on the Internet:<disp-quote>
<p>Our work is mainly developed through the use of Internet [. . .]: our network of information and expression of solidarity through email, which became operational in late 2001, reaches some 18,000 activists and human rights organizations in Spanish. [. . .] Our operatives work in some 40 countries and bring together more than 160 agencies. The information digitalized exceeds 20,000 documents, and reaches 120 countries [. . .] Nizkor has become the international body that distributes the most complaint reports and calls for urgent solidarity action throughout the world. [. . .] The sources of information are, without exception, Colombian human rights organizations.</p>
</disp-quote>In our study, some respondents were asked about reports conducted by Nizkor. Although in general they knew of the organization and its work, no one could identify its nationality. Indeed, on its Web site (www.derechos.org), it identifies itself as an international human rights entity and (and) states that it has bases in Latin America, the United States, and the European Union. This identity is a hybrid in that it specifies that the origin of its name is Jewish, that it has administrative offices in Spain and Belgium, and hosts its operations from California (United States). This NGO is an example of some of the emerging features of a broader phenomenon: the extent of coverage, ubiquity, speed of information, and the proximity between the complainant and the transnational emancipation networks.</p>
<p>In our research, we found Web pages offering victims the option of filling in report forms to describe events related to human rights violations that are verified by the organization before being published.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn43-0304375412444810">43</xref>
</sup> This system is based on one used by Amnesty International, “Urgent Action Alert,” in which victims of abuse can fill out an online form to enter their main personal details and report the facts of the violation of their rights.</p>
<p>The information on many of these pages is offered in several languages (English, French, Italian, and German). This facilitates the flow of information between various European and North American countries. Many of these Web sites have multimedia content, which facilitates the flow of information through images (photo galleries), sound (audio files), and downloading videos or links to videos “posted” on Youtube. Other formats of the virtual citizen spaces are blogs. These are often used by social movements or less stable and durable platforms than entities that have more sophisticated Web pages and greater capacity to store information. There are groups of Colombian refugees that create blogs to “post” previously downloaded videos on Youtube and thereby express the difficulties of forced migration or report abuses that they claim the Colombian government has committed. One of those blogs is <underline>http://refugiados.col.nu/</underline> which (as of June 3, 2007) carried the following headline: “Colombian Refugees on the WEB.” This site has a very simple content, with links to short videos denouncing human rights violations, strong criticism of President Uribe Vélez (2002–2006 and 2006–2010), details of street protests, and political statements by members of the political opposition party Polo Democrático Alternativo. Their presentation states “Our Web site was created in Europe and from here we will be united with hundreds of Colombian refugees who are in different parts of the world, and that we have had to leave because of persecution by state forces, who have tried to silence the cry of protest, we are trade unionists, teachers, workers, students, peasants, etc.”<sup>

</p>
<p>The virtual citizen spaces are an opportunity for collective action. Organizations and movements such as those referred to in this article are increasingly using it. However, networks are not effective unless they have the potential for expansion (technological and social) of their nodes and, above all, have effective advocacy in the defense and protection of the rights of the most vulnerable. Also, effectiveness depends on the leadership and protagonism of the victims; otherwise they will be objects of protection or passive recipients of external aid, which does not constitute full liberation. These virtual spaces can, therefore, broaden the spectrum of social actors so as to form virtual global communities fighting for local causes without limits.</p>
<p>Another feature is the visibility of victims. Before the Internet era victims were limited to the reporting processes within a state or the little time given by the major television networks for this type of information. Online databases for victims of human rights violations or information on missing people produce and disseminate relevant information to shed light on certain crimes that would otherwise remain in the realm of indifference and anonymity.</p>
<p>The main results of the interviews conducted during the fieldwork include the support given to local communities in Colombia by the Spanish NGOs, especially in highlighting complaints about violations of the human rights of many people in regions such as Chocó, Antioquia, southern Bolívar, and the Valle del Cauca. One informant identified this process as “making visible many problems that were outside of the knowledge of the Colombians themselves.”<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn45-0304375412444810">45</xref>
</sup> This woman said that in certain Columbian departments, white and mestizo citizens did not know that for centuries there had been indigenous communities living close to their cities. It was only with international cooperation that this coexistence had become visible.</p>
<p>Colombian local communities complain of systematic silence and indifference of state institutions. Therefore, they have established communication channels to amplify and reproduce their complaints. This was expressed as follows by a member of a peasant association in the poorest of Columbia’s departments, Choco:<disp-quote>
<p>For us it is very hard to access political decision makers, it is easier for an international agency to access this type of space. The proposal for a humanitarian agreement was published by local and Spanish NGOs, distributed to different parts of the world, and many people read it and wrote to the Government, and it is very bad(,) that a Spanish entity tells the central or departmental government of the needs and proposals of the people here, but it works. Political support for local proposals is often more important than economic support.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn46-0304375412444810">46</xref>
</sup>
</p>
</disp-quote>Here we observe that the emancipatory struggle begins with the affected population and then, with the support of organizations, can become transnationalized to influence the initial circumstances. Also, local communities and social movements interviewed valued political support more positively because development, in its economic aspect, is secondary to the social changes that lead to recognition of their rights.</p>
<p>Some members of the Spanish NGOs perceived the Colombian state as a passive actor in the face of suffering from some residents. “I felt that the institutions of the State were a burden. The Social Solidarity Network [state agency] did nothing, it was large and useless; . . . the Ombudsman's Office used to help, but it had no money, it was necessary to carry it, to take the burden, the CTI [Technical Investigation Corps, similar to the judicial police] used to come to ask me things, but they said the situation is that you can go where we can’t, at the health and education level it is a disaster.”<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn47-0304375412444810">47</xref>
</sup> The presence of an international observer in a conflict zone in part shields local organizations from possible reactions in the form of retaliation from armed groups. This is why it is paradoxical that a foreign aid worker could go into the jungle to see the consequences of a massacre and a local court officer could not.</p>
<p>Another example of the “protective shield” of the transnational networks that participate in the process of political echolocation is evidenced in the demonstrations and protests of local and national social movements. Simultaneous monitoring and support elsewhere in the world of local social protest may deter the country's security forces when faced with the possibility of overstepping the mark. This surveillance of public protest on the net has become a creative, innovative, and functional approach for the emancipatory objectives in the transnational space:<disp-quote>
<p>In the latest protests by the indigenous communities in various departments (Cauca, Valle, Quindio, Risaralda), [they] occupied one side of the road and were walking with women and children. […] In Pereira [capital of Risaralda] they didn’t let them in, the riot police came, they fired, threatened, there was one death […] then I called the Belgium and Spain Embassies, all of the NGOs in Zaragoza that I knew saying they were attacking and attacking . . . and could they please react in some way, sending letters to the Governor of Risaralda. The NGOs and embassies made phone calls, letters arrived, they sent material to the governors, . . . it has an impact on the governor that international cooperation agencies should call him.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn48-0304375412444810">48</xref>
</sup>
</p>
</disp-quote>This type of network communication with its high intensity and the quality of the nodes can be very effective for the protection of local community leaders. According to the Spanish organizations, the armed groups have even started to attack the communication devices that connect local organizations and communities abroad:<disp-quote>
<p>We reject the excesses and abuses committed by the security forces, [. . .] that led to reprehensible acts that threatened the life and personal integrity of members of the community. [. . .] In the attack on <italic>La Maria</italic> village the National Army entered by force, beat indigenous people and burned computers and communications equipment that were transmitting what was happening during the demonstration.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn49-0304375412444810">49</xref>
</sup>
</p>
</disp-quote>Even so, local organizations have seen the effects of the strategy of political echolocation. From the state to illegal armed groups there have been reactions when information has affected their corporate image:<disp-quote>
<p>Sometimes there were echoes, sometimes the guerrillas became angry because we had done this [reported something through announcements on postal and electronic mail], the paramilitaries were angry because we had done this, somehow we had hurt them, [. . .] sometimes the guerrillas came to throw out the NGOs in the area when they did not want them to know what they were doing, [. . .] I think they have all been a bit like this, suspicious and a little more careful about doing things when they knew that people may know, this does not mean that it [the presence of NGOs] was an impediment to doing so, but they were more careful.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn50-0304375412444810">50</xref>
</sup>
</p>
</disp-quote>As we have seen, a phone call or e-mail from Europeans has an impact on armed groups and political actors in Colombia. In the collective imagination of the Latin American, there are a number of values attributed to “European-ness” represented in “Spanishness,” high esteem, trust, and credibility. That is why representatives of Spanish and Colombian organizations believe that any communication of feedback to an internal issue has a high impact on the Colombian military and civil authorities: “Of course it impacts, even if the politicians are dreaming of going there [to Europe], a call or a letter is going to have an impact on us [. . .]. NGOs call and call, and that has an effect. Obviously, if it is a congressman or judge [Spanish] it’s going to leave him [Columbian Governor or Mayor] shattered.”<italic>

<p>The foreign aid worker can help to make a problem visible, which the native has always had in front of him but has not seen, such as the exclusion of other citizens. To make discrimination of the excluded visible within the country can help to show the profound imbalances in the democratic fiction in that not all are citizens. This visibility leads subjects to rethink the importance of their problems. If a foreigner, a European, goes to Colombia and “is interested in these unfortunates” then something will happen if they deserve a little attention. “It is important that the foreign aid worker is there.” Taking advantage of being a foreigner, handsome, beautiful, blue-eyed, tall, even if you are not, “that you are interested in some ‘unfortunates’ . . . it has an impact! [. . .] They believe that the foreigner, who usually comes from the north, lives a rich life, lies on a sun bed, drives a BMW, … has come here to be with these ‘unfortunates.’”<sup>

</p>
<p>The perception of the influential power of transnational networks is not based solely on their membership of the European and American imaginary. Other referents such as identitory and religious also become influential factors for organizations and communities. The churches also have transnational networks, which in some cases play a considerable role in the processes of social transformation. For example, we cannot ignore the mediating role of the German Bishops’ Conference in Mainz in the talks with the Ejército de Liberación Nacional (ELN) in 1998. The armed actors often have a certain respect for people working with the churches although have been killed in religious conflict.</p>
<p>Some of the religious NGOs studied, Asociación Marianista de Apoyo al Tercer Mundo (AMAT) and Entreculturas—formerly Fe y Alegría (Faith and Happiness)—base their operational capacity on a close relationship with the previous structures based on networks of religious communities, educational institutions, and parishes that have a territorial presence which, in the majority of cases, is made available to the NGO. These structures facilitate the installation of the NGOs in the host country as they become a factor in protecting and ensuring the implementation and monitoring of projects. However, their discourses are not usually too critical of the Colombian state. “We always coordinate with the priests, who already have their structures, for example, for sending money in an easy, fast and secure way . . . Also, they make you a filter, there are people who will ask for help, they are there, and they have a slightly more objective view.”<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn53-0304375412444810">53</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>Protestants and Lutherans have a strong presence in certain poor areas of the Pacific Coast (Chocó, Valle del Cauca, and Cauca) which, according to informants, bring with them a lot of money and sophisticated mechanisms for installing and integrating themselves in the territories: “These include, among other things, the Summer Institute of Linguistics, which has catalogued Colombia's 83 indigenous languages in order to translate the Bible.”<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn54-0304375412444810">54</xref>
</sup> The NGOs of religious groups also use echolocation strategy, although the networks are used directly or indirectly on behalf of all actors related to that religious belief.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>We would like to move toward a theoretical outline of the strategy of transnational political echolocation. The aim of the political echolocation strategy is to describe a mechanism for making visible and reporting the complaints made by groups facing exclusion of any kind, in particular, violation of human rights. In countries where there are armed conflicts, it is very important to respond with immediacy to the victims of such violations.</p>
<p>This strategy is quite close to the advocacy of the NGOs. However, the strategy of political echolocation is a type of incidence that is based on an initial action of communities and local social movements that aims to draw the attention of governments or other authorities to their conditions of vulnerability, risk, or violent disorder. In this type of action, the spotlight falls on the communities and movements, even though they have the support of NGOs, which amplify and multiply their demands or complaints in the transnational space.</p>
<p>The concept of echolocation is more eloquent than other comparisons such as the “boomerang pattern” proposed by Keck and Sikkink and used by Kaldor, Rodriguez Garavito, and Arenas (2004).<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn55-0304375412444810">55</xref>
</sup> The boomerang effect does not describe the magnitude and multiplicity of responses following emission of the initial message. In addition, the boomerang effect returns to the place of departure in the same way as it was released, while echolocation facilitates movement in the return of the radio waves emitted, modified by the intensity and frequency of the echo. Echolocation is political because it mobilizes various stakeholders, which puts pressure on state policy bodies, for example, to warn of a possible massacre or avoid the prescription of a crime committed by the armed forces. Political echolocation exposes the demand for respect for the rights of vulnerable people over and above the demands of the state. Consequently, political echolocation is useful primarily in transnational space. This is because the effect of the initial action issued travels by means of the interconnection of the network nodes, which, in turn, go beyond local, national, and global spaces.</p>
<p>In conclusion, we can summarize the main achievements of transnational political echolocation compared with other cooperation strategies and advocacy of NGOs as follows. First, it makes naturalized social pathologies within societies visible as well as discriminatory or exclusionary actions that are socially accepted because of their repetition in history or by unjust political and legal systems. Second, transcends political decision making that goes beyond the legal competence of states. Social groups that suffer injustice can find support in transnational networks that denounce the violation of their rights to supranational bodies. Third, it produces identity links that allow the attachment of new nodes to the networks. The cohesion of transnational networks does not depend on ideological affiliation but identity. Religious identities linked to new social movements (indigenous, ecology, and so on) are evidence of this. Fourth, it leads to mobility, flexibility, and immediacy of local, national, and global processes through virtual spaces, created by information technology and communication. Finally, the strategy of echolocation shields and protects aid workers, volunteers, and members of transnational organizations, movements, and networks against possible risks of retaliation from armed groups outside government through online tracking of campaigns, demonstrations, and protests.</p>
