<abstract>
<p>Health planners in Austin, Texas, are using a System Dynamics Model of Cardiovascular Disease Risks (SD model) to align prevention efforts and maximize the effect of limited resources. The SD model was developed using available evidence of disease prevalence, risk factors, local contextual factors, resulting health conditions, and their impact on population health. Given an interest in understanding opportunities for upstream health protection, the SD model focused on the portion of the population that has never had a cardiovascular event. Leaders in Austin used this interactive simulation model as a catalyst for convening diverse stakeholders in thinking about their strategic directions and policy priorities. Health officials shared insights from the model with a range of organizations in an effort to align actions and leverage assets in the community to promote healthier conditions for all. This article summarizes the results from several simulated intervention scenarios focusing specifically on conditions in East Travis County, an area marked by higher prevalence of adverse living conditions and related chronic diseases. The article also describes the formation of a new Chronic Disease Prevention Coalition in Austin, along with shifts in its members’ perceived priorities for intervention both before and after interactions with the SD model.</p>

<p>How do local conditions affect multiple risk factors for chronic disease, and how do those risks affect population health status and costs over time? How might local health leaders align their efforts given limited resources? Such questions can be vexing for planners who want to make a difference in the health and economic future of their neighborhood or city.</p>
<p>This article describes the tool that was developed, the systems approach, and the strategic planning and actions that were implemented to tackle such questions and improve the health of the community in Travis County, Austin, Texas (hereafter referred to as Austin). Leaders in Austin have a long track record working to assure healthier conditions for all through programs such as Comprehensive Tobacco Control, Diabetes Self-management, and Steps to a Healthier Austin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1524839910390305">Loyo, Valadez, &amp; Schwerfeger, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>Two years ago, in an effort to build on past investments and become even more effective, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Division for Heart Disease and Stroke Prevention created a collaborative partnership with the Austin/Travis County Health and Human Services Department officials to pioneer an innovative, system-oriented approach to understand the dynamic dimensions of health protection policies. This collaborative partnership included representatives from the CDC, the Sustainability Institute, RTI International, and the National Institutes of Health (NIH). Locally, the effort involved key staff from the Austin/Travis County Health and Human Services Department and the Integrated Care Collaboration. Members of this large and diverse team, guided by Jack Homer, a veteran system dynamics modeler, pooled their knowledge to produce a computer model capable of simulating some of the more significant processes driving chronic disease risk and prevention at a local level. They created a System Dynamics Model for Chronic Disease Risk and Prevention (hereafter referred to as the SD model) that allows interested stakeholders to explore various intervention options and begin to answer the strategic questions stated above. This article describes how the SD model is being used in Austin as a catalyst to align multiple stakeholders to develop a comprehensive strategy for reducing chronic diseases and related costs.</p>
<sec id="section1-1524839910390305" sec-type="methods">
<title>Method</title>
<p>System dynamics simulation modeling is a methodology that has been used effectively since the 1970s to study a variety of health priority areas, including chronic diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1524839910390305">Homer &amp; Hirsch, 2006</xref>; Homer, Hirsch, &amp; Milstein, 2007). The general approach involves mapping relevant causal factors supported by the literature. Each parameter and relationship in a map is quantified in a computer simulation model, drawing from available evidence. This effectively puts the map in motion, allowing users to see how different choices lead to different plausible futures. The maps are often powerful tools for communicating across sectors and for motivating stakeholders to work together to make systemic changes. However, simulation models can provide a compelling case for change by highlighting different performance trajectories, allowing a more rigorous assessment of the policy options.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1524839910390305">Figure 1</xref> shows which factors are included in the SD model for chronic disease risk and prevention. The local contextual factors, shown in italics on the periphery, are the user’s only points of influence in the system. They include access to primary health care and other services (e.g., for weight loss, smoking cessation, and mental health), quality of health care services, access to and marketing of healthy food options and safe physical activity options, sources of stress (e.g., poverty, crime, discrimination), policies regarding tobacco, and air pollution. Planners with an interest in neighborhood-based or city-wide change may develop relevant scenarios because the model includes an array of local contextual drivers, recognizing that social and environmental conditions not only have a strong bearing on people’s health status but also are amenable to change (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1524839910390305">Syme, 1996</xref>).</p>

<graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1524839910390305-fig1.tif"/>
</fig>
<p>Each of these interventions is a lever that can be adjusted to affect various health and economic outcomes over time. By moving one or more of these levers, users explore a range of “What if . . .” questions in their search for promising strategies to pursue in the real world.</p>
<p>The SD model tracks changes along each intervention pathway over a period of 35 years. For each scenario tested, the model displays results as trajectories of behavior over time (such as smoking or health service utilization), chronic disorders (such as hypertension), diseases (such as cardiovascular events), and costs (including the economic impact of premature deaths, excess morbidity, and service utilization).</p>
<p>The effect of each lever is determined by a network of causal links, the values of which were estimated using published studies, meta-analyses, and surveys of experienced practitioners.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1524839910390305">1</xref></sup> The primary endpoints reported here (found on the right side of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1524839910390305">Figure 1</xref>) are first-time cardiovascular disease (CVD) events and total complication costs. Two earlier publications provide additional information about the structure, empirical foundations, and results of the SD model at a national level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1524839910390305">Homer et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1524839910390305">Homer et al., 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>The SD model was also calibrated to simulate conditions in East Travis County, a community within Austin that has a higher burden of disease and risk factors than neighboring communities. The local calibration adjusted initial conditions and historical data to reflect local access to primary care, smoking bans, air quality, and local prevalence of cardiovascular risk factors, including high blood pressure, high cholesterol, diabetes, and smoking.</p>

<title>Aligning Community Action in Austin</title>
<p>Reflecting their commitment to public involvement, Austin health officials shared the results from the East Travis modeling with stakeholders in the context of a multistakeholder “action lab” on September 25, 2008. This interactive meeting was designed to allow participants to discover insights from the model and use them for strategic planning. By examining a variety of simulation results, leaders could explore which areas of intervention had the greatest influence on health outcomes and costs.</p>
<p>Austin, like many cities, has numerous health-related coalitions, each focused separately on different risks and diseases. As a result of the SD modeling, city leaders decided to create a more comprehensive Chronic Disease Prevention Coalition (CDPC) that would encourage synergy and alliance. Participants for the action lab were selected based on their leadership in the community, participation in existing coalitions, or as representative employees from various sectors. Austin health officials not only wanted to invite people to an action lab where they could learn about the SD model but also wanted to initiate a CDPC that would use the insights from the model as a starting point for future conversations and action. Austin health officials also identified a leadership team for the CDPC via this action lab. The leadership team would help guide the work of the broader coalition membership.</p>
<p>A total of 56 participants attended the action lab, representing all sectors included in the model. Participants represented a range of public health, health care, nonprofit, advocacy groups, businesses, and schools. There was comprehensive representation across intervention areas except for air quality, which was represented indirectly by people working in the area of tobacco or asthma. Each participant also belonged to at least one community-based coalition, and many were key leaders. After an introduction, participants were asked to decide which six intervention areas they thought would produce the greatest change in CVD outcome (pretest). Six interventions were specified to simulate limited resources for implementation. Participants were then provided with interactive results presentation containing results of different intervention areas in the model. Participants were again asked to select the six intervention areas they thought would produce the greatest change (posttest). These results can be found in a figure later. Next, participants worked in groups to develop additional intervention strategies to simulate. During the meeting, participants were also encouraged to learn more about each other and their organization’s work through two networking events. Finally, participants were asked to make written and public commitments to take action to prevent chronic diseases and to select at least one key priority on which the newly formed coalition could collectively take action.</p>

<title>Insights From the East Travis Model</title>
<p>Several bundled interventions were tested to understand the likely results from different strategic investments in East Travis. To test the effect of a bundle, the appropriate intervention options in the SD model were selected and the levers pushed to the maximum extent—representing maximum plausible impact. Three bundles were identified as potential priorities: <italic>Care, Air</italic>, and <italic>Lifestyle</italic>. See <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1524839910390305">Table 1</xref> for a definition of these scenarios. The <italic>Care</italic> bundle included interventions to expand primary care access, improve primary care quality, and intensify primary care marketing. The <italic>Air</italic> bundle included new tobacco taxes and sales restrictions, smoking bans, more intense social marketing against smoking, and reductions in air pollution. Finally, the <italic>Lifestyle</italic> bundle expanded both access to and social marketing for physical activity and healthy diet, along with new junk food taxes and sales restrictions, and reductions in chronic stress. For each simulation, we assumed that once interventions are ramped up, the improvements are sustained over time. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1524839910390305">Figure 2</xref> shows the graphical results of these intervention scenarios in East Travis for two major outcomes of interest: total cardiovascular disease deaths per capita and total costs per capita.</p>

<caption><p>Effect of Bundled Interventions on CVD Deaths and Cost per Capita</p>
<p>NOTE: CVD = cardiovascular disease. Base case: East Travis status quo scenario.</p></caption>
<graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1524839910390305-fig2.tif"/>
</fig>
<p>To compare potential cost savings, we simulated each bundle separately. Relative to the base case, enhanced primary care interventions in East Travis (<italic>Care</italic>) provide a quick and sustained reduction in cardiovascular events and deaths but produce little cost savings ($35 per capita/year over 30 years). Improvements in primary care quality and access, in particular, dramatically reduced cardiovascular events and fatalities. Although total costs associated with chronic diseases were reduced, direct medical costs increased. On balance, this generated a small savings in total complications and management costs.</p>
<p>The <italic>Air</italic> bundle in East Travis led to a quick and growing reduction in cardiovascular events and produced a relatively large cost savings ($355 per capita/year over 30 years). Smoking is very harmful at the population level, both in terms of CVD and especially costs related to cardiovascular and other complications for smokers (e.g., chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, lung cancer). It also harms others through secondhand smoke (triggering asthma and cardiac incidents). Of the smoking interventions, social marketing to promote smoking prevention and cessation as well as tobacco taxes and sales regulations have the greatest effect on reducing cardiovascular events and costs. Both help change the environment, making it conducive to smoking prevention and cessation. The most unexpected result for many users of the model was the immediate impact that air quality (2.5-µm particulate air pollution) had on CVD death rates and cost—even in an area with relatively clean air, such as Austin. Reducing air pollution saves money and lives quickly and substantially.</p>
<p>The <italic>Lifestyle</italic> bundle reduced CVD gradually over time. Although it had little effect in the short term, it produced increasing cost savings over time ($177 per capita/year over 30 years). These interventions are a good long-term health investment for a community because the cost benefit continues to grow substantially over time. Additionally, incremental cost savings are evident relatively soon. Increasing access to physical activity options alone has a long-term effect in reducing CVD mortality rates and costs related to complications and management of the disease. The results are delayed because it is an environmental change that makes it easier for people to be physically active, which reduces chronic conditions and then reduces cardiovascular events. Increasing access to healthy food options and reducing sources of stress also reduce costs related to complications and management somewhat in the long term.</p>

<title>Insights Gained by Action Lab Participants</title>
<p>Participants in the action lab identified the interventions they thought would have the greatest impact both prior to and after having the opportunity to interact with the simulated scenarios. The post-action lab results are presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1524839910390305">Figure 3</xref>. Items along the <italic>x</italic>-axis were sorted by the magnitude of impact they have on cardiovascular events, from the greatest on the left, to the least on the right. When determining the magnitude of impact, both short- and long-term effects were weighted equally.</p>

<p>At the conclusion of the meeting, participants were asked to rate their perceived levels of commitment, influence, and confidence in making the changes they had identified as most necessary. On average, people reported they were very committed, very confident, and had a moderate level of influence (<italic>n</italic> = 28; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1524839910390305">Figure 4</xref>). Furthermore, those who were completely or very committed tended to perceive themselves as having higher levels of influence in the community.

</fig>
<p>During the action lab, participants were also asked to make written commitments to prevent chronic disease by various means. Of the respondents,</p>
<list id="list7-1524839910390305" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>79% committed to work with CDPC to collaboratively prevent chronic disease in Austin/Travis County;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>88% committed to inform the coalitions, work groups, task forces, and organizations about what can collectively be done about chronic disease;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>94% committed to personally take steps to reduce their risk for chronic disease;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>88% committed to motivate and encourage others to adopt healthy lifestyles; and</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>45% specified what they would encourage their coalition/work group/task force to do.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>In addition to the individual commitments, this newly formed coalition was asked to identify at least one area that all participants could agree they could immediately influence. The coalition unanimously selected two action items: (a) to promote a tobacco use quit line fax referral form to provide potential quitters with telephone support and nicotine replacement therapy and (b) to help promote walking programs. Locally, Austin has two walking programs: WalkTexas is a 10-week challenge to be physically active, and Walk Across Texas is a 6-week team challenge to accumulate 832 miles of physical activity as a team.</p>
<p>Finally, select participants volunteered to be part of a CDPC Leadership Team and were ratified during the action lab by the coalition to lead the efforts.</p>

<title>Synopsis of Model Results</title>
<p>Participants noted the significant improvement in CVD events provided by the <italic>Care</italic> bundle, but were disappointed, although not surprised, to find little cost savings. Participants perceived an opportunity in taking action to impact the <italic>Air</italic> bundle as the model indicated interventions in this area would provide significant cost savings and decrease CVD mortality by more than 3.3%. The results of the <italic>Lifestyle</italic> bundle were received with initial surprise and skepticism, especially the impact of nutrition. This has prompted further exploration to better understand the components of nutrition and include a broader definition in a future model.</p>

<title>Supporting Change in Austin</title>
<p>SD modeling enabled leaders in Austin to synthesize much of their local information and experience into a framework that is well suited for multistakeholder planning. The ability to simulate various intervention scenarios revealed the likely consequences of different strategic options in a way that was convincing to most stakeholders. The project also reinforced a comprehensive view, initiated with the Steps to a Healthier Austin program, and generated enthusiasm as a leading-edge practice in public health. Helping to develop the model has increased leadership capacity, reinforced the systemic approach, increased the Austin team’s clarity and confidence about the preferred strategies, and provided a tool to communicate with partners. It is supporting Austin’s efforts to align existing partners and bring new partners to the table. For example, with the insight that air quality has a large and immediate effect on CVD, Austin saw the need to engage new partners in that sector.</p>
<p>Although the effects of various interventions in the East Travis model differ slightly from the nationally calibrated SD model, the overall policy insights (i.e., the trajectories for given interventions) were very similar. This is discussed in great detail in a prior article by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1524839910390305">Homer et al. (2010)</xref>. The interventions that resulted in the greatest reductions did so in both the national and the East Travis models, despite differing initial conditions in East Travis (e.g., younger population, higher obesity, and higher diabetes). The insights about time delays and long- and short-term characteristics of intervention results also remained the same and were independent of the local calibration differences.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-1524839910390305">
<title>Aligning Community Action in Austin</title>
<p>Austin health officials were delighted at the cross-sector representation attending the action lab and thus participating in the first CDPC meeting. Given the important impact of air quality, they intend to identify potential partners in that sector. They also committed to continue to identify additional partners and leaders within each sector of the model, thus building a broader and deeper commitment within the community.</p>
<p>After reviewing the simulated scenarios, participants placed greater emphasis than pre-test on air pollution reduction, quality of primary care, social marketing against smoking, tobacco taxes, and tobacco marketing restrictions, all of which are among the most influential levers in the model. Generally, participants’ selections also migrated from interventions on the right—those having smaller effects to those on the left having the larger effects. There were some exceptions to this including access to primary care, access to physical activity options, and access to healthy food. There are legitimate reasons for these exceptions. Participants have a great deal of knowledge of the context in which these interventions are already underway. This knowledge is not easily embedded into a model, and is precisely why models are best used with groups of stakeholders who have expertise. The model is limited in that it does not include any costs of interventions or tradeoffs among the interventions. The stakeholders however are keenly aware of those, and may have shifted their focus given that knowledge.</p>
<p>During the action lab, participants worked in groups to develop additional intervention strategies to simulate. The resulting group strategies were closely aligned with the more efficacious interventions. Groups then worked together to begin implementation planning. Although not part of the simulation model, implementation of the interventions is a vital part of the conversation that happened as an extension of model experimentation.</p>

<title>Catalyzing Action</title>
<p>The action lab attendees were already actively engaged in the community and participated in at least one coalition, work group, task force, or organization that represented key areas within the model, so it was not surprising to find a high level of commitment to CDPC.</p>
<p>The Austin team is optimistic that CDPC members will promote both action items selected during the meeting (promote specific tobacco quit services and walking programs). These intervention areas were recognized by the whole group as having strategic importance and as being underutilized—low hanging fruit that could have a significant effect. Austin has a history of successfully mobilizing organizations that work diligently to achieve the goals to which they are committed.</p>
<p>Next steps to develop a community-wide chronic disease prevention strategic plan have been taken. The strategic plan will include strategies to increase inter organizational collaboration; make desired community changes, and shape policy and legislative agendas.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>Bridging the divide between scientific research and community action presents several challenges. One is that community decisions need to be made even though the data are disparate and incomplete. Systems thinking can be used to synthesize that evidence, to reduce silo thinking, and to begin to build aligned relationships.</p>
<p>This and all models are inherently limited in their ability to capture all of the nuances of the real world. As such, it was used to guide strategic thinking, but not dictate a preferred strategy. In Austin, the SD model combined with local expertise, has proven to be a valuable tool to re-examine community priorities, justify the merits of proposed strategies or policies, obtain community buy-in, and determine the best use of limited resources. The maps and models introduced in the action lab provided a common language and highlighted the larger purpose of chronic disease prevention under which the effects of all current efforts are interrelated. The simulator allowed partners to explore the opportunity for future collaborations and to side-step competitive thinking with joint “what if” experimentation. By acknowledging others’ contributions and achievements, the inaugural CDPC meeting was a vehicle to connect the stakeholders’ goals and to unite them to benefit the community. The action lab using the SD model enabled 56 key community leaders to think more systemically about chronic disease prevention and the role their organizations play in a much larger effort. Although the Austin community has made only the first steps toward implementing the identified changes, this approach was a powerful mechanism for sharing information about the system and for energizing community leaders to take action. Further use of the SD model is warranted to support collaboration and action in Austin and other communities to improve the public’s health.</p>
