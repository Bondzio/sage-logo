<title>Background:</title>
<p>The most common treatment for old calcaneal fractures accompanied by subtalar joint injury is the use of subtalar in situ arthrodesis and subtalar distraction bone-block arthrodesis or osteotomy. This article describes the introduction of a novel surgical treatment, gradual subtalar distraction with external fixation and restoration of the calcaneal height, and presents an assessment of its efficacy.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-1071100712472039">
<title>Methods:</title>
<p>The protruding lateral calcaneus and the articular surfaces and subchondral bone of the posterior facet of the subtalar joint were surgically removed. An external fixator, attached with 2 pins in the subcutaneous tibia and 2 pins in the posterolateral calcaneus, was used to fix the subtalar joint for 7 to 10 days followed by gradual subtalar distraction at 1 mm/d. The lengthening procedure was stopped when the calcaneal height was restored according to radiography. The external fixator was removed after bone fusion. Seven cases of old calcaneal fractures accompanied by severe subtalar joint injury (8 feet) were treated using this method. Average follow-up was 14.3 months (range, 7-36 months).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-1071100712472039">
<title>Results:</title>
<p>In all 7 cases (1 case of both feet), the postoperative wound healed primarily. The calcaneal heights of all 8 feet were partially restored. Subtalar joint bone fusion was completed within 4 to 6 months after the operation. The average preoperative American Orthopedic Foot &amp; Ankle Society (AOFAS) hindfoot score was 25.3, and the average postoperative AOFAS score was 76.3.</p>

<body>
<p>Calcaneal fractures are commonly observed in clinical practice and account for approximately 1% to 2% of all fractures. Additionally, 75% of calcaneal fractures are accompanied by fractures into the subtalar joint.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1071100712472039">1</xref></sup> Some calcaneal fractures with subtalar joint injury are accompanied by severe soft tissue injury, which delays the early reduction and internal fixation of the fractures, which may lead to arthritis and severe deformity. Clinical manifestations include heel pain and difficulty in walking, which severely affect daily life and job performance. Currently, the treatments commonly applied to old calcaneal fractures with subtalar joint injury are subtalar in situ arthrodesis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1071100712472039">8</xref></sup> and subtalar distraction bone-block arthrodesis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1071100712472039">4</xref></sup> or an osteotomy. The authors designed a new surgical strategy using subtalar distraction osteogenesis with external fixation.</p>
<sec id="section6-1071100712472039" sec-type="materials|methods">
<title>Materials and Methods</title>
<p>The study included 7 cases (6 cases of a single foot and 1 bilateral case). Three patients were male and 4 were female; the patients’ ages ranged from 16 to 54 years, with an average age of 29.4 years. All 7 patients were injured in falls from a height in which they landed on their feet. Four months to 1½ years after the injury, these patients had a calcaneal malunion with pain during walking. One patient suffered an L2 vertebral burst fracture and severe open comminuted fractures in both feet. The initial operation for internal fixation was delayed because of a wound infection in both feet. Two months after the injury, when the infection had been controlled, subtalar distraction with external fixation and gradual lengthening was performed. One patient was injured by a fall from a height that resulted in pelvic fracture, left femoral shaft fracture, right comminuted calcaneal fracture, bilateral lung contusion, and left renal contusion and laceration. The right foot was treated by gradual subtalar distraction with external fixation 3 months after the injury. One patient fell from a 3-m-high vehicle and suffered a left comminuted calcaneal fracture 8 months before being admitted to our hospital. In our hospital, the patient’s calcaneal fracture was later treated with open reduction and internal plate fixation. The wound drained and did not heal after the surgery, causing left calcaneal osteomyelitis with fistula formation. Four months later, calcaneal debridement was performed on the left foot, and the internal fixation was surgically removed. Steel wire fixation and a plaster support were used temporarily. The wound did not heal. We then performed osteomyelitis curettage, antibiotic bone cement filling, and wound lavage and drainage for the left calcaneus. Two months later, we performed left calcaneal debridement, flap transposition, and gradual subtalar distraction with external fixation. The average follow-up was 14.3 months (range, 4-36 months).</p>
<sec id="section7-1071100712472039">
<title>Surgical Technique and Postoperative Care</title>
<p>The operation was performed under epidural anesthesia with a pneumatic tourniquet on the thigh in the supine position. First, an L-type lateral calcaneal incision was performed. The peroneal tendon sheath was opened to relieve tension. The flap was gently retracted while exposing the lateral wall of the calcaneus and the subtalar joint. The prominent lateral calcaneus bone fragments were excised to normal width. Second, the cartilage surfaces of the entire subtalar joint were removed with an osteotome to expose cancellous bone. The third step was to make a curved medial incision along the calcaneus, taking care to protect the posterior tibial vessels. The prominent inferior calcaneus bone fragments were removed, and the cartilage surfaces of the entire subtalar joint were further removed.</p>
<p>Two Orthofix external fixator screws (Orthofix, Inc, McKinney, TX, USA) were placed in the posterolateral calcaneus perpendicular to the lateral wall, and an additional 2 screws were placed in the lateral, middle-lower part of the tibia. An Orthofix external fixator was then placed and adjusted with fluoroscopy. The axial alignment of the calcaneus was adjusted to a neutral position. The subtalar joint space was evaluated by direct visualization and packed with bone chips previously excised from the prominent calcaneus so that the talus and calcaneus fit together tightly. Bone wax was used to stop the blood oozing from the lateral wall of the calcaneus. A drain was placed, and the wound was dressed.</p>
<p>After a latent period of 7 to 10 days, distraction across the subtalar joint was applied at 1 mm/d via the external fixator. This procedure was performed 2 to 3 times each day for 2 to 3 weeks. Distraction of the subtalar joint was monitored by weekly radiographs. The distraction was stopped when the height of the calcaneus and talus was restored to 90% to 100% of that of the opposite (healthy) side. After the distraction was complete, imaging was performed every month until subtalar bone fusion was complete, the external fixator was removed, and weight-bearing began (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1071100712472039">Figure 1</xref>).</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>For all 7 patients (8 feet), the postoperative wound healed primarily. Six patients (6 feet) showed a calcaneal height recovery of 87% of the opposite, healthy side. In the 1 patient with fractures in both feet, the postoperative calcaneal height was 74.2 mm for the left side and 75.8 mm for the right side. Compared with the preoperative heights, the left side gained 14.5 mm and the right side gained 13.4 mm. The average calcaneal height increase among all 8 patients was 12.5 mm. The average preoperative Bohler’s angle was 17.8 degrees (range, 4.2-29.1 degrees), the average preoperative foot arch angle (the angle between the line from the lowest point of the head of the talus to the lowest point of the first metatarsal head and the line from the lowest point of the head of the talus to the lowest point of the calcaneus) was 159.3 degrees (range, 165.0-152.3 degrees), and the average postoperative foot arch angle was 137.5 degrees (range, 130.8-143.9 degrees). The width of the middle of the calcaneus was corrected from a preoperative average of 44.2 mm (range, 39.8-59.3 mm) to a postoperative average of 34.5 mm (range, 27.9-45.1 mm) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1071100712472039">Table 1</xref>).</p>

<p>The subtalar joint achieved bony fusion by 4 to 8 months after surgery at an average of 4.9 months. The pain was categorized into 4 levels: no pain, light pain, medium pain, and severe pain. Three patients reported medium pain, and 1 patient reported severe pain before surgery. The other 3 patients (4 feet) did not walk preoperatively. After surgery, except for 2 feet with light pain, the other 6 feet had no pain.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Approximately 75% of calcaneal fractures are accompanied by subtalar joint injuries,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1071100712472039">2</xref></sup> and the majority are caused by falls from a height or vehicle accidents. Currently, the literature supports the surgical treatment of intra-articular fractures,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1071100712472039">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1071100712472039">6</xref></sup> but some controversy exists regarding this approach.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1071100712472039">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1071100712472039">7</xref></sup> Additionally, some patients also suffer polytrauma, which usually delays the early reduction and internal fixation of calcaneal fractures and results in old fractures. It is quite difficult to treat old calcaneal fractures accompanied by subtalar joint injury, which can result in severe sequelae, such as painful traumatic arthritis of the subtalar joint; subfibular impingement; loss of calcaneal height, causing foot plantar flexion weakness; or heel varus.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1071100712472039">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1071100712472039">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1071100712472039">10</xref></sup></p>
<p>Currently, common treatments are in situ subtalar arthrodesis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1071100712472039">8</xref></sup> and subtalar distraction bone-block arthrodesis with or without osteotomy.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1071100712472039">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1071100712472039">9</xref></sup> In situ subtalar arthrodesis can treat simple subtalar traumatic arthritis with satisfactory efficacy.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1071100712472039">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1071100712472039">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1071100712472039">8</xref></sup> For cases that are complicated by subfibular impingement caused by expansion of the lateral wall of the calcaneus, subtalar arthrodesis with calcaneal lateral wall decompression is an effective treatment. However, in situ subtalar arthrodesis cannot restore calcaneal height or correct abnormalities in the talar tilt angle and calcaneal axis. In situ subtalar arthrodesis has limited efficacy in the treatment of old intra-articular calcaneal fracture malunions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1071100712472039">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1071100712472039">11</xref></sup></p>
<p>Carr et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1071100712472039">4</xref></sup> first reported the use of subtalar distraction bone-block arthrodesis as a substitute for in situ subtalar arthrodesis. The advantage of subtalar distraction bone-block arthrodesis, in which autologous iliac bone can be implanted in the posterior facet of the subtalar joint through an acute distraction of the subtalar joint, it that it has the ability to partially restore calcaneal height and, therefore, improve foot function. Carr et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1071100712472039">4</xref></sup> initially reported the use of this method in 8 cases of severe deformities caused by intra-articular calcaneal fractures. The results, which were based on more than a year of follow-up, showed satisfactory efficacy in 6 patients. Amendola and Lammens<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1071100712472039">1</xref></sup> reported the use of this method in 15 cases of calcaneus malunion. The results in 11 of these cases were excellent or good; however, the other 4 cases were failures. Rammelt et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1071100712472039">9</xref></sup> reported the use of this method in 31 cases of calcaneus malunion. The average postoperative AOFAS score was 73.2, significantly greater than the preoperative score of 23.5. However, subtalar distraction bone-block arthrodesis restores calcaneal height through a 1-time implantation of an iliac bone graft into the subtalar joint. Therefore, this procedure presents some inadequacies: (a) Poor blood supply of the thin ankle skin and subcutaneous tissue increases the risk of skin nonhealing and skin necrosis after surgery; (b) the sudden stretching of the surrounding nerves can cause nerve damage and lead to neuralgia; (c) autologous iliac bone is needed for the bone graft, which causes greater surgical morbidity; and (d) the restoration of calcaneal height by a 1-time iliac bone implantation is limited. Additionally, to avoid skin and nerve problems, the height of the implanted bone is generally limited. Therefore, adjusting the calcaneal height requires reoperation.</p>
<p>To target the correction of the pathological and physiological characteristics of old intra-articular calcaneal fractures, the callus distraction technique was applied to the subtalar joint and a novel method of gradual subtalar distraction was proposed to treat old intra-articular calcaneal fractures. During this gradual distraction, osteogenesis occurred in the space between the talus and the calcaneus previously occupied by an arthritic subtalar joint. This new callus continually generated along the axis of distraction resulted in both fusion of the subtalar joint and increased calcaneal height. This method is suitable for the treatment of an old intra-articular calcaneal fracture with a severely collapsed calcaneus. However, this method is not suitable for old intra-articular calcaneal fractures without obvious calcaneal collapse, with a generally smooth subtalar joint or with subtalar joint traumatic arthritis. The features of this surgical plan are as follows:</p>
<list id="list1-1071100712472039" list-type="order"><list-item><p>The ability to partially restore calcaneal height and improve the shape of the foot arch and tibiotalar joint movement.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The ability to adjust the alignment of the calcaneus and to correct calcaneal varus deformity.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The ability to eliminate the pain caused by traumatic arthritis of the tibiotalar joint resulting from subtalar arthrodesis.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The ability to eliminate the pain caused by subfibular impingement with the lateral wall decompression.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Elimination of the need for autologous iliac bone implantation, which minimizes pain (in theory, bone graft can be eliminated entirely).</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Because of the application of external fixation for gradual distraction, the possible wound complications and neuralgia caused by 1-time distraction can be minimized. Furthermore, dynamic postoperative adjustment can control the precise restoration of calcaneal height.</p></list-item></list>
<p>The use of gradual subtalar distraction and arthrodesis is a novel surgical plan with improved clinical results in this group of patients. However, further improvements might be implemented. First, improvements to the external fixator are required to better adapt it to the anatomical and biomechanical needs of subtalar joint distraction. The use of conventional external fixators and the placement of external fixator screws at the current positions result in an initial distraction of 3 to 5 mm, which creates a false appearance of widening of the distracted ankle joint space rather than an actual effect of subtalar joint distraction. We expected the postoperative calcaneal height to be distracted to more than 95% of the healthy side at the end of the procedure. However, the postoperative follow-up showed that the average calcaneal height restoration was 87% of the healthy side. Additionally, 1 patient suffered severe pain in the ankle joint during distraction, which was likely related to an injury of the surrounding tissue when the ankle joint was distracted. The number of patients examined in this study was relatively small. Prospective studies that include a larger number of patients are needed to verify the effectiveness of this method. We are currently working on improving the external fixators and have initiated basic studies of the surgical procedure.</p>

<fn fn-type="other"><label>Editor’s Note</label>
<p>The authors achieved good results with this innovative method of restoring calcaneal height. I agree that a larger series of patients would be necessary before this method is widely adopted because I believe there would be a relatively significant risk of nonunion, which the authors did not find in their small series, distracting through a fusion site rather than an osteotomy.</p></fn>
