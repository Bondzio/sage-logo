<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Quantitative ultrasonography (QUS) methods are gaining ground as a reliable technique for measuring bone mineral status in a population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1759720X13475851">Gluer <italic>et al</italic>. 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1759720X13475851">Hollaender <italic>et al</italic>. 2009</xref>]. QUS has a number of advantages over the more commonly used dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) scan: it is radiation free, relatively inexpensive, easy to use and portable [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1759720X13475851">Economos <italic>et al</italic>. 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1759720X13475851">Mergler <italic>et al</italic>. 2010</xref>]. Furthermore, it has the possibility of independently predicting fracture risk. QUS makes use of the alteration of travelling vibrations when passing through a medium [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1759720X13475851">Baroncelli, 2008</xref>]. Information about bone density, structure and composition can be collected by measuring the change in velocity and amplitude when the sound waves travel through bone tissue. This makes the technique fast and easy to use, even for less mobile or less cooperative individuals. A relative disadvantage of QUS techniques measuring the heel bone is the fact that bone density between left and right foot usually differs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1759720X13475851">Mergler <italic>et al</italic>. 2010</xref>]. However, Roux and colleagues found in a whole population no significant difference between QUS results of right and left feet [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1759720X13475851">Roux <italic>et al</italic>. 1993</xref>]. Often the nondominant foot is measured, presuming it has the lowest value of bone density. However, in individuals with intellectual disabilities (IDs) it can be difficult to determine which foot is dominant. Nevertheless, a study investigating feasibility of calcaneal QUS in people with IDs concluded that it is a practical and nonstressful method for measuring bone status [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1759720X13475851">Mergler <italic>et al</italic>. 2010</xref>].</p>
<p>Although feasibility has been ascertained, evidence with respect to validity and sensitivity has not been established for all kinds of populations. Some studies suggest QUS correlates strongly with DXA, holding the potency to independently diagnose osteoporosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1759720X13475851">Frost <italic>et al</italic>. 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1759720X13475851">Huopio <italic>et al</italic>. 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1759720X13475851">Jin <italic>et al</italic>. 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1759720X13475851">Stewart <italic>et al</italic>. 2006</xref>]. Others find a weaker correlation and reject this potential [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1759720X13475851">Dane <italic>et al</italic>. 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1759720X13475851">Dubois <italic>et al</italic>. 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1759720X13475851">El Maghraoui <italic>et al</italic>. 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1759720X13475851">Lochmuller <italic>et al</italic>. 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1759720X13475851">Shin <italic>et al</italic>. 2005</xref>] or propose QUS as a screening method in the absence of or prior to DXA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1759720X13475851">Gemalmaz <italic>et al</italic>. 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1759720X13475851">Iida <italic>et al</italic>. 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1759720X13475851">Marin <italic>et al</italic>. 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1759720X13475851">Trimpou <italic>et al</italic>. 2010</xref>]. In one meta-analysis 25 articles were examined regarding QUS as an identification method for osteoporosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1759720X13475851">Nayak <italic>et al</italic>. 2006</xref>]. The authors concluded that the determined sensitivity and specificity of QUS were too low to diagnose DXA-determined osteoporosis.</p>
<p>There is an increasing body of evidence on the negative influence of antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) on bone density. Patients on chronic AED therapy may have a reduced bone mineral density (BMD) and an increased risk of fractures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1759720X13475851">Jancar and Jancar, 1998</xref>] even after correction for seizure-related fractures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1759720X13475851">Desai <italic>et al</italic>. 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1759720X13475851">Vestergaard <italic>et al</italic>. 1999</xref>]. Irrespective of the population, DXA is still the gold standard for the measurement of BMD. However, screening a population of epileptic institutionalized patients with DXA demands a great piece of effort from patients and their caregivers. In this specific population many risk factors for low BMD exist. Moreover, this is a population with frequent intellectual and physical comorbidities and therefore would profit most from a portable and noninvasive method that would allow early screening and follow up for the presence of osteoporosis and osteopenia. Also follow-up measurements for the evaluation of the effect of the implemented bone enhancing therapies (physical therapy with weight bearing exercise, calcium and vitamin D supplementation and sometimes also antiresorptive bone therapy) is necessary. In the light of the repeated measurements a method of BMD measurement that is noninvasive, patient-friendly and without radiation load is obligatory. QUS could be a good candidate for screening for low BMD in this population, under the condition that it has a high sensitivity and specificity. To investigate this, we conducted a cross-sectional study to determine the sensitivity and specificity of QUS in a high-risk population consisting of patients with refractory epilepsy on chronic use of AEDs, using DXA as the gold standard.</p>

<title>Study population/subjects</title>
<p>The study population consisted of patients living in a long-stay care facility for patients with epilepsy. A total of 205 patients were adults of 18 years and older. Almost all patients had a history of refractory epilepsy for which in most patients treatment with several AEDs was necessary. Most of the patients also had some degree of ID.</p>
<p>A cross-sectional study was performed, measuring BMD at lumbar spine and femur with DXA (Hologic) and using QUS of the calcaneus (Sahara, Hologic). In addition, characteristics regarding lifestyle, epilepsy, medication use, history of AED use, fracture history and potential secondary causes of osteoporosis were recorded in a database. The study was approved by the local and regional Ethics Committee and was in accordance with the Code of Ethics (Declaration of Helsinki). Informed consent was obtained from each patient or his/her legal representative.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-1759720X13475851">
<title>Methods: BMD by DXA</title>
<p>BMD of the lumbar spine and left femur was measured by DXA and expressed as the amount of mineral (g) divided by the area scanned (cm<sup>2</sup>). All DXA measurements were performed by the same densitometer (Hologic, Discovery W [S/N 70991]) and were performed between 30 August and 29 September 2009. <italic>T</italic>-scores (number of standard deviations [SD] below peak bone mass) and <italic>Z</italic>-scores (number of SD below age- and sex-matched controls) were calculated for total lumbar spine, femoral neck and total femur using the manufacturersâ reference database (reference values supplied by Hologic for the hip and lumbar spine as well as data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey part III (NHANES III) dataset. Manufacturer specific reference population (White) was used to calculate <italic>T</italic>-scores. World Health Organization (WHO) criteria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1759720X13475851">World Health Organization Study Group, 1994</xref>] were used to classify BMD and osteoporosis. A <italic>T</italic>-score of â1.0 and greater is considered normal, a <italic>T</italic>-score between â1.0 and â2.5 is considered low bone mass (osteopenia) and a <italic>T</italic>-score of â2.5 and less is considered osteoporosis. In patients aged 70 years and older also a <italic>Z</italic>-score of less than â1.0 was considered osteoporosis, because of the increased fracture risk and the advice to consider treatment for osteoporosis in this specific age group [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1759720X13475851">CBO, 2002</xref>]. The site with the lowest <italic>T</italic>-score was included in the diagnosis osteoporosis.</p>

<sec id="section9-1759720X13475851">
<title>Methods: BMD by QUS</title>
<p>Bone densitometry was performed by quantitative ultrasonography of the heel bone (Sahara, Hologic). Several devices using QUS are available, measuring at different parts of the body. A widely used measuring spot is the calcaneus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1759720X13475851">Gluer <italic>et al</italic>. 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1759720X13475851">Hollaender <italic>et al</italic>. 2009</xref>]. Two quantifiable variables are available: speed of sound (SOS), related to velocity of the ultrasound signal, and broadband ultrasound attenuation (BUA), related to the weakening of the ultrasound signal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1759720X13475851">Mergler <italic>et al</italic>. 2010</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1759720X13475851">Baroncelli, 2008</xref>]. In some techniques an additional variable, stiffness index (SI), can be assessed. Devices such as the Sahara (Hologic) require application of alcohol or gel to the foot, after which the foot can be placed in the device, measuring bone status within half a minute. The calcaneus of the left foot was measured to assess the lowest value of bone density. In three patients (1.5%) the heel bone of the right foot was measured due to anatomical restrictions (severe clubfoot). Derived variables consisted of BUA, SOS, QUI/Stiffness and <italic>T</italic>-scores using manufacturersâ database (Sahara Reference Ranges for White subjects). All QUS measurements were performed directly before or after the DXA measurements. A QUS <italic>T</italic>-score of â1.0 was taken as the cut-off value to distinguish between osteoporotic and nonosteoporotic patients. This value was based on data reported by Hologic, stating that 82â87% of people with a Sahara <italic>T</italic>-score of less than â1 are diagnosed with osteoporosis as determined by DXA.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-1759720X13475851">
<title>Analysis and statistics</title>
<p>Data are presented as mean Â± SD or as percentages. Tests determining the screening value of QUS in relation to DXA grouped osteopenia and osteoporosis together by using a cut-off value of â1.0 for DXA <italic>T</italic>-scores. This way not only patients with osteoporosis, but also patients in the risk group of low bone mass can be identified by a follow-up DXA scan. Correlation analysis was performed using a two-tailed Pearson correlation coefficient with a significance level of <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05. Furthermore a received operating characteristic (ROC) curve and the area under the curve (AUC) were calculated to assess the correspondence of QUS with regard to the gold standard of DXA. AUC reflects the discriminatory value of a test; in this case the potential of QUS to discriminate between osteopenic/osteoporotic and nonosteopenic/nonosteoporotic patients as diagnosed by DXA. An AUC of 1 indicates a perfect discrimination and an AUC of 0.5 indicates a very poor discrimination. In addition, discriminant analysis was used. This is a rotating procedure that stepwise searches the best solution to classify the patients according to a gold standard. We used the DXA <italic>T</italic>-score of the femur (total hip) as the gold standard with a cut-off value of â1.0, separating osteopenic and osteoporotic patients from the rest of the population. The QUS cut-off <italic>T</italic>-score of â1 was then used to compare overlaps of classifications. Discriminant analysis gives outcomes for concordance, âhitsâ (same diagnosis with both techniques) and âcorrect rejectionsâ (same rejection of diagnosis), and measures of disconcordance, âmissesâ (QUS <italic>T</italic>-score fails the DXA diagnosis) and âfalse alarmsâ (diagnosis with QUS <italic>T</italic>-score and not with DXA as gold standard). From a clinical perspective it is interesting to further examine the group of âmissesâ, because they are diagnosed as osteopenic or osteoporotic by DXA, but overlooked by QUS. Therefore, an additional analysis was done comparing the âmissesâ with the rest of the population in order to find a possible explanation for the false rejection of these patients. All statistical analyses were done using SPSS for Windows (Rel. 18.0.2, 2010, SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL) and Excel 2003 (Microsoft, Seattle, WA).</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>The study group consisted of 205 patients: 124 men (60.5 %) and 81 women (39.5%). Mean age was 47.0 Â± 16.8 years, range 18â88 years. A total of 54.6 % of patients were under the age of 50 years. Of the 205 patients 55 (26.8%) were wheelchair-bound, 28 (13.7%) walked with aid and 122 (59.5%) walked without aid. The DXA scan of lumbar spine and/or femur was successfully performed in 195 (95.1%) of the patients and QUS in 204 (99.5%) of the patients. Mean and SD of all QUS variables are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1759720X13475851">Table 1</xref>.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The goal of this study was to assess the validity of QUS as a screening method for osteoporosis in a population with chronic epilepsy and AED use. The results show a strong and positive correlation between <italic>T</italic>-scores measured by DXA and QUS. Furthermore, this study demonstrates QUS as a feasible method for measuring bone density in a population with IDs and epilepsy. For 10 (4.9%) patients it was impossible to perform DXA due to anatomical or behavioural restrictions; for one patient QUS could not be performed due to the history of fractures in both feet. In three patients QUS of the right calcaneus was performed because of anatomical deformities of left foot (foot clubbing). Although feasible, using a DXA scanner in this specific population turned out to be a high-effort undertaking, consuming a lot of time in preparation, instruction and application. These results confirm the advantages of QUS over DXA, regarding mobility and ease of use.</p>
<p>The manufacturers of the Sahara QUS device (Hologic) report that 80â82% of patients with DXA determined osteoporosis will score below â1.0 in the Sahara <italic>T</italic>-score. Around 5â10% with nonosteoporotic or nonosteopenic DXA results will score lower than â1 on the Sahara <italic>T</italic>-score and 6â9% with DXA determined osteoporosis will score above 0 on the Sahara <italic>T</italic>-score. Our results, including osteopenia as a diagnostic outcome, are marginally higher on the sensitivity level of the Sahara device in relation to DXA: 90.3% of patients with DXA determined osteoporosis or osteopenia fall under the QUS cut-off value of <italic>T</italic> = â1.0. The specificity was lower than the sensitivity: at a QUS cut-off <italic>T</italic>-score of â1.0, 40.8% of patients determined as nonosteoporotic by DXA will be classified as nonosteoporotic by QUS.</p>
<p>The results show a strong correlation between QUS and DXA. However, the correlation is not strong enough to rule out any occurrence of false positives or false negatives when choosing a cut-off value for Sahara <italic>T</italic>-scores. Results show that when the cut-off value is high (â1.0) there will be a large number of false hits, but when decreasing this <italic>T</italic>-value the number of false rejections steadily increases. Therefore, irrespective of the high correlation between DXA and QUS <italic>T</italic>-scores, using a single QUS measurement as a method for screening or diagnosing osteoporosis does not yet seem viable.</p>
<p>However, when screening with QUS, a relative higher number of false positives would be acceptable, given the follow-up examination performed by the gold standard of DXA. In particular, in a specific population of people with epilepsy and IDs, the prevalence of osteoporosis is so high that, despite a low specificity, only a small percentage of patients will be falsely diagnosed with osteoporosis. The same argument is true for the falsely rejected cases, as only 4 of the 15 missed cases were diagnosed with osteoporosis by DXA.</p>
<p>Repeated measurements with QUS in this specific high risk population could greatly increase the validity of QUS as a reliable screening method as it allows follow-up procedures with a portable machine in a noninvasive and patient-friendly manner without involving radiation. In particular, the chronic use of AEDs would make these patients eligible for follow-up screening with a 6-monthly, yearly or 2-yearly screening cycle. One way of approaching this method is repeated screening of a ârisk groupâ with a QUS <italic>T</italic>-score between â1 and 0. This would lead to coverage of a large number of the 15 patients that were falsely declared healthy in prior QUS measurements.</p>
<p>This study has a number of limitations. First of all we only measured the left foot in our population with QUS. In particular, in a population with IDs it is difficult to determine dominance and thereby higher bone density in a specific foot. In addition, only the use of calcaneal QUS was explored in this research. A different study suggests that phalangeal QUS might be a better method to assess bone loss in epileptic patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1759720X13475851">Pluskiewicz and Nowakowska, 1997</xref>]. Another factor not taken into account in this study was the supplementation of vitamin D. Pedrera and colleagues report that a group of patients using anticonvulsants regained normal bone status, measured by QUS, within a month after supplementation of high-dose vitamin D [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1759720X13475851">Pedrera <italic>et al</italic>. 2000</xref>]. Future studies might take this factor into account when trying to explain variability in measured bone status by QUS.</p>
<p>In conclusion, QUS is a feasible and a noninvasive method for measuring bone status in a population with ID and epilepsy. Moreover, future application of QUS as a screening method for the diagnosis of osteoporosis and osteopenia should be considered. Specifically in institutions with a population with epilepsy, chronic AED use and ID, the benefits of QUS as a screening method seem to outweigh the potential disadvantages. In a population with such a high prevalence of osteoporosis and osteopenia the actual number of misdiagnosed cases stays low. Also, its mobility and ease of use make it a suitable method for repeated measurements, thereby increasing its reliability.</p>
