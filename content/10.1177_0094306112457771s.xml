<p>In this collection of essays, the evolution, the functions, and the future of cities are dissected to demonstrate the beauty and the potential of cities, while also acknowledging the contradictory nature of cities. The essays keep an upbeat perspective on cities, and challenge opposing views directly. The authors also bring in the very social and demographic trends of cities—and champion the idea of cities providing freedom and hope to individuals. They also keep a very future-oriented outlook, warning against letting memories have too much power. The essays touch on many subjects including individual rights versus public benefits, following the increasing restriction from sanitization laws in earlier times to smoking bans today. The essays integrate social issues with the urban archetype of the city, using examples from cities all over the world. The authors caution that a balance between environmentally-friendly cities and the needs of the citizens of the city is needed, as without citizens there is no city. The imagination of future cities has been curtailed and the new visions for cities are constrained by current and past views of cities. The authors urge that the traditions of cities be challenged to make way for visionaries: the city is full of potential and a place for human imagination, and too much focus on making a better city ignores the role of the free will of the people. This book challenges the conservative beliefs about cities and brings to the forefront the citizens who inhabit these cities.</p>
