<p>The Irish National Seabed Survey (INSS) was launched in 1999 and, in combination with its successor INFOMAR (Integrated Mapping for the Sustainable Development of the Marine Resource), is one of the largest marine mapping programmes of its kind in the world. It is a joint project run by the Geological Survey of Ireland and the Irish Marine Institute and involves the mapping, using multibeam swath bathymetry, of the entire Irish seabed, in total an area of more than nine times the size of Ireland itself. The <italic>Atlas of the Deep-Water Seabed: Ireland</italic> showcases the results of that labour for those areas of the Irish seabed that are deeper than 200 m.</p>
<p>The atlas is divided into three parts. Part 1 provides the ‘Background and overview’ and includes sections on the background to the survey, data processing, geological history, modern oceanography and physiography. Part 2 is the main part of the atlas and is organised thematically with sections on canyons and channels, seamounts, escarpments, mound features and coral carbonate mounds, and iceberg ploughmarks. Each chapter follows the same broad structure with a short written piece, 3 or 4 pages in length that provides an overview of the specific feature(s), and then a series of seafloor images. The images primarily comprise multibeam swath bathymetric records of seafloor morphology, as well as underwater photographs showing details of associated habitats and fauna. They are generally of a very high standard and lavish use of colour is made throughout. The final section, Part 3, is a regional atlas which subdivides those areas of the Irish seabed below 200 m into seven areas: the Southwest Approaches and Goban Spur, Porcupine Bank, Porcupine Seabight, the Northernmost Irish Continental Margin, Rockall Trough, Rockall Bank, and Hatton-Rockall Basin &amp; Hatton Bank. For each an inventory of the seabed features occurring in that particular area is given.</p>
<p>The atlas achieves its goal to showcase the impressive diversity of seafloor morphological features and habitats recorded by the survey. The target audience is probably as much the interested layperson as the research scientist but the atlas will appeal to both. It is worth purchasing for the stunning images of the seafloor alone and it provides a clear, well written summary of the main morphological elements and background to the survey. It is a shame that those areas of the shelf that have been surveyed are not included, even in part, but the emphasis on the deep-water area makes for a very clear focus. Overall I congratulate the authors, research scientists at University College Cork and the Geological Survey of Ireland, for having produced an informative and beautifully illustrated atlas of the deep-water Irish seabed.</p>
