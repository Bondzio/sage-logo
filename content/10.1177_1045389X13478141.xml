<p>The ASME 2011 conference on Smart Materials, Adaptive Structures and Intelligent Systems (SMASIS) was held from 18 to 21 September 2011 in Phoenix, Arizona. Adaptive Structures and Systems by definition are intelligent, flexible systems that respond to changes in the environment. Recent rapid development and technological maturity are mainly due to the interdisciplinary efforts at universities, government, and industry. The main goal of SMASIS is to assemble world experts across engineering and scientific disciplines, such as mechanical, aerospace, electrical, materials, and civil engineering, as well as biology, physics, and chemistry, to discuss the latest findings and trends in the field.</p>
<p>The Symposium on Modeling, Simulation and Control, as one of the six symposia at the 2011 ASME SMASIS, focused on the dynamic modeling, simulation, and control aspects of smart material systems and structures. Topical areas included micro- and macro-level modeling, vibration and acoustic control, passive/semiactive/active damping and stiffness variation, actuation and motion control, intelligent and adaptive control, nonlinear control, hysteresis control, modeling simulation and control of micro-/nanosystems, nonlinear dynamics, and nonlinear vibration. More than 60 presentations and 3 invited talks included modeling, analysis, control, and experiments for active/passive dynamic and static structural systems in the presence of dissipative, gyroscopic, hysteretic, and nonlinear effects. This symposium was a forum that catalyzed discussions of topics ranging from system-level dynamics and control of smart structures to the development and modeling of new actuation, motion control, and sensing techniques for integrated systems and recent advances in dynamic modeling and vibration control issues in microscale/nanoscale smart structures and systems (microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) and nanoelectromechanical systems (NEMS)).</p>
<p>This special issue of the <italic>Journal of Intelligent Material Systems and Structures</italic> (<italic>JIMSS</italic>) is the first of two consecutive special issues derived from papers presented at the 2011 ASME SMASIS Symposium on Modeling, Simulation and Control. In these two special issues are included 18 articles out of the 67 papers presented at the conference.</p>
<p>I would like to express my sincere appreciation to my symposium co-chair, Professor Ralph Smith from the North Carolina State University, for his able assistance in organizing this symposium. We would like to thank all of the authors who participated in this special issue for their significant contributions. We are also grateful to the members of the organizing committee of the Symposium on Modeling, Simulation and Control, who in providing the three reviews required per manuscript, gave selflessly their time and effort. Finally, we would like to thank Professor Daniel Inman, Editor-in-Chief of <italic>JIMSS</italic>, and Professor Norman M. Wereley, Editor of <italic>JIMSS</italic>, for providing the opportunity to make this special issue and for their support and encouragement throughout its preparation.</p>
