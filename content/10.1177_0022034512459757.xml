<abstract>
<p>Sense of coherence (SOC) has been related to oral health behaviors and oral-health-related quality of life (OHRQoL) in observational studies. This cluster-randomized trial aimed to test the effect of an intervention to enhance SOC on OHRQoL in children. Twelve primary schools were randomly allocated to intervention and control groups. The intervention was comprised of 7 sessions over 2 mos, focusing on child participation and empowerment. The first 4 sessions were classroom activities, and the last 3 involved working on healthy school projects. Trained teachers who received a one-day course delivered the intervention. Socio-demographic and clinical data, together with self-reported measures of OHRQoL, SOC, and oral health beliefs, were obtained from 261 total 10- to 12-year-olds (133 in the intervention and 128 in the control groups). Data were collected at baseline, 2 wks after the intervention, and at three-month follow-up. Mixed-effects models indicated that the intervention increased SOC and improved OHRQoL, together with oral health beliefs and gingival health. The findings offer experimental evidence that OHRQoL can be influenced by SOC. SOC may also provide an avenue for oral health promotion (Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry ACTRN12612000547842).</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Oral-health-related quality of life (OHRQoL) is a multi-dimensional construct that refers to the extent to which oral disorders disrupt an individual’s daily functioning, well-being, or life quality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0022034512459757">Locker and Allen, 2007</xref>). It is an important outcome describing the subjective impact of oral conditions on everyday life and for evaluating care (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0022034512459757">Locker, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0022034512459757">Wilson and Cleary (1995)</xref> proposed a theoretical model linking clinical factors and quality of life at 5 levels—biological, symptoms, functioning, general health perceptions, and overall quality of life—with relationships among these adjacent levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0022034512459757">Fig. 1</xref>, Paths a-d). For example, clinical variables affect everyday functioning, partially mediated by symptom status (<italic>i.e</italic>., Paths a x b). There may also be indirect (mediated) relationships among non-adjacent levels, with individual and environmental factors affecting all these relationships (see Appendix 1 for full description).</p>

</fig>
<p>One individual factor that has been found to strongly predict general and oral health is sense of coherence (SOC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0022034512459757">Eriksson and Lindstrom, 2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0022034512459757">2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0022034512459757">Baker <italic>et al</italic>., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0022034512459757">Gururatana, 2011</xref>). SOC is a global orientation for viewing life in coherent, manageable, and meaningful ways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0022034512459757">Antonovsky, 1987</xref>). Individuals with high SOC assess situations as non-stressors (comprehensibility), perceive resources to be available and are able to use them to cope with stresses (manageability), and view life events and ill-health/disease as challenges and worthy of effort (meaningfulness).</p>
<p>High SOC has been related to fewer symptoms and better self-rated health and QoL in adults (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0022034512459757">Eriksson and Lindstrom, 2007</xref>) and better OHRQoL in children (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0022034512459757">Baker <italic>et al</italic>., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0022034512459757">Gururatana, 2011</xref>) and adults (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0022034512459757">Savolainen <italic>et al</italic>., 2005</xref>). It is linked to fewer snacks and drinks between meals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0022034512459757">Lindmark <italic>et al</italic>., 2011</xref>), less gingivitis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0022034512459757">Ayo-Yusuf <italic>et al</italic>., 2008</xref>) and caries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0022034512459757">Bernabe <italic>et al</italic>., 2010</xref>), more regular toothbrushing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0022034512459757">Dorri <italic>et al</italic>., 2010</xref>), and regular dental attendance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0022034512459757">Bernabe <italic>et al</italic>., 2009</xref>). Two longitudinal studies have examined prospective relationships between SOC and oral health (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0022034512459757">Baker <italic>et al</italic>., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0022034512459757">Gururatana, 2011</xref>). These considered many individual and environmental factors (SOC, locus of control, self-esteem, oral health beliefs, gender, parental education, income, and work status) and found SOC to be the only consistent predictor of OHRQoL, predicting fewer symptoms and less impact on everyday life in 12- to 13-year-old Malay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0022034512459757">Baker <italic>et al</italic>., 2010</xref>) and 10- to 14-year-old Thai children (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0022034512459757">Gururatana, 2011</xref>). No intervention studies have aimed to enhance SOC to improve (oral) health in adults or children.</p>
<p>Therefore, the aim of this study was to test the effect of a school-based intervention to enhance SOC on OHRQoL in children. A secondary aim was to examine the direct and indirect (mediating) determinants of OHRQoL in children, with the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0022034512459757">Wilson and Cleary (1995)</xref> model as an <italic>a priori</italic> theoretical framework.</p>

<sec id="section4-0022034512459757">
<title>Intervention</title>
<p>The intervention aimed to enhance SOC by improving its components (comprehensibility, manageability, and meaningfulness), and was developed based on literature searches, advice from educators, and previous work on SOC and OHRQoL in schoolchildren (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0022034512459757">Baker <italic>et al</italic>., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0022034512459757">Gururatana, 2011</xref>). It consisted of seven 40- to 60-minute sessions delivered by teachers over 2 mos, focused on child participation and empowerment. The first 4 sessions were classroom activities involving didactic teaching, discussion, activities, and games. The last 3 involved working on healthy school projects: brainstorming, planning, implementation, and evaluation. These projects involved the whole school, and all students and staff participated.</p>
<p>The intervention was delivered by six trained teachers who received an intensive one-day course run by the researcher (O.N.). Facilitators of successful interventions, including incentives, supportive leadership, the whole-school approach, teacher training, and pupil participation, were incorporated into the intervention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0022034512459757">Forman <italic>et al</italic>., 2009</xref>). The development and content of the intervention are detailed in Appendix 2.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0022034512459757">
<title>Recruitment and Randomization</title>
<p>Eligibility criteria for schools included size and location. Each school was in a suburban area in Khonkaen and had 200-300 students, including 20 to 30 Grade 5 students aged 10 to 12 yrs. Of the 25 schools that met the eligibility criteria, 12 were selected randomly. Group allocation used block permutation to balance the number of schools/participants in each group. The schools were listed and a random sequence of blocks of 4 created. A person not involved in the project selected the first point in the sequence. Schools were allocated to the 2 groups (control, intervention) according to the sequence. Six schools formed an intervention (n = 133) and six a control group (n = 128) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0022034512459757">Fig. 2</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0022034512459757">
<title>Ethics</title>
<p>Informed written consents and assents were signed and obtained from parents and children before the study. The project was approved by the University of Sheffield and the Ethical Review Committee for Research in Human Subjects, Ministry of Public Health, Thailand.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-0022034512459757">
<title>Measures</title>
<p>Clinical and self-reported measures were selected to populate an abbreviated version of the Wilson and Cleary model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0022034512459757">Fig. 1</xref>). All questionnaires were translated into Thai by the researcher (O.N.) and back-translated into English by a Thai linguist, conversant in both languages, who had not seen the original English versions. The original and back-translated versions were compared and minor amendments made (<italic>e.g</italic>., within the CPQ<sub>11-14</sub>, the word ‘klui’, a Thai musical instrument, was used instead of ‘clarinet’) while ensuring semantic equivalence (<italic>e.g</italic>., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0022034512459757">Saub <italic>et al</italic>., 2007</xref>). Reliability assessments of the questionnaires can be found in Appendix 3.</p>
<sec id="section8-0022034512459757">
<title>Clinical Variables</title>
<p>These included DMFT, dental trauma (0 = no trauma; 1 = trauma), gingival health (CPI = 0; CPI &gt; 0), and dental defects or anomalies (0 = no defects; 1 = defects) collected according to the WHO diagnostic criteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0022034512459757">1997</xref>). Malocclusion was recorded according to the Index of Orthodontic Treatment Need (IOTN) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0022034512459757">Brook and Shaw, 1989</xref>) aesthetic component; Codes 1 through 7 were categorized as ‘0 = No need/slightly need treatment’, and other codes were categorized as ‘1 = need treatment’.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-0022034512459757">
<title>Oral-health-related Quality of Life (primary outcome)</title>
<p>OHRQoL was assessed with the Child Perception Questionnaire (CPQ<sub>11-14</sub>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0022034512459757">Jokovic <italic>et al</italic>., 2002</xref>). CPQ<sub>11-14</sub> includes 4 domains: oral symptoms, functional limitations, emotional well-being, and social well-being. Participants responded on five-point Likert scales from 0 (Never) to 4 (Every day or almost every day). Children were asked whether, in the preceding 3 mos, they had experienced the problems described by each of the 37 items (possible range, 0 to 148). Higher scores represented worse OHRQoL.</p>

<title>Individual Factors</title>
<sec id="section11-0022034512459757">
<title>Sense of Coherence (intermediate outcome)</title>
<p>The 13-item sense of coherence scale (SOC-13) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0022034512459757">Antonovsky, 1987</xref>) was answered on a seven-point Likert scale coded from 1 to 7, for example, from ‘Never happened’ (1) to ‘Always happened’ (7) for the item ‘Has it happened that people whom you counted on disappointed you?’ After reverse scoring of some items, higher scores represented higher SOC (possible range, 13 to 91).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-0022034512459757">
<title>Oral Health Beliefs (intermediate outcome)</title>
<p>Oral health beliefs (OHBs) were measured with a 6-item scale regarding diet, oral hygiene practices, fluoride use, and dental attendance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0022034512459757">Broadbent <italic>et al</italic>., 2006</xref>), each answered on four-point Likert scales from ‘Extremely important’ (4) to ‘Not at all important’ (1) (possible range, 6 to 24). Higher scores represented more favorable beliefs.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section13-0022034512459757">
<title>Sample Size</title>
<p>This pilot study was carried out to assess the effect size for power calculations for a subsequent trial. The primary outcome for future sample size calculations was the difference between intervention and control groups in OHRQoL as measured by CPQ scores.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section14-0022034512459757">
<title>Procedure</title>
<p>Two hundred sixty-one children were clinically examined and completed all questionnaires at baseline (T1). Two wks after the intervention (T2), children completed all questionnaires again. At the three-month follow-up (T3), clinical and questionnaire data were collected for the final time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0022034512459757">Fig. 2</xref>). There were no protocol changes after trial commencement.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section15-0022034512459757">
<title>Statistical Analysis</title>
<p>Mixed-effects models were used to compare CPQ, SOC, OHBs, and gingival health scores between the intervention and comparison groups at T2 and T3 separately. Baseline data for the relevant outcome were used as covariates. Group allocation was the fixed effect and schools the random effect. All tables, effect sizes, and intra-cluster coefficients can be seen in Appendix 4. Structural equation modeling (SEM) was used to identify determinants of OHRQoL (reported in Appendix 5).</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section16-0022034512459757" sec-type="results">
<title>Results</title>
<p>The intervention and control groups were similar at baseline in terms of demographic, clinical, and self-report data (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0022034512459757">Table</xref>). CPQ, SOC, OHBs, and gingival health data at T1-T2 and T1-T3 are presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0022034512459757">Fig. 3</xref>. There were significant group allocation effects on OHRQoL at both 2 wks and 3 mos post-intervention after baseline scores were accounted for. The intervention group had lower CPQ<sub>11-14</sub> scores, representing better OHRQoL, accounting for 6.07 CPQ<sub>11-14</sub> points at T2 and 6.50 CPQ<sub>11-14</sub> points at T3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0022034512459757">Fig. 3a</xref>). The intra-cluster correlation coefficient for CPQ was 0.013. This compared the within-group and between-group variance, indicating that the intervention effect was explained by clustering effects to only a small degree.</p>

<p>Group allocation significantly affected SOC at T2 and T3, with the intervention group having SOC points 6.39 higher than those of the controls at T2 and 4.05 at T3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0022034512459757">Fig. 3b</xref>). While the intervention group had significantly better oral health beliefs, the effect sizes were smaller (1.10 at T2; 1.84 at T3) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0022034512459757">Fig. 3c</xref>). The intra-cluster correlation coefficients for SOC and OHBs were 0.049 and 0.040.</p>
<p>At T3, clinical status between the two groups was similar, except that more children in the intervention group had normal gingivae (31.81%) than the controls (19.51%) [χ<sup>2</sup> (1) = 4.41, p = 0.04] (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0022034512459757">Fig. 3d</xref>). There were no significant random (cluster) effects in CPQ, SOC, or OHB scores, <italic>i.e</italic>., schools <italic>within</italic> the intervention or control groups had similar scores.</p>
<p>For confirmation of these findings, supplementary mixed-effects models were run with CPQ, SOC, and OHB change scores (T2-baseline and T3-baseline) as the outcome variable. The results for CPQ and SOC were identical to the analysis with raw scores as the outcome variable. For OHBs, the analysis of change scores indicated no significant difference between intervention and control groups at T2. There was, however, a significant group difference at T3 for both analytic methods (see Appendix 4 for all statistical tables).</p>
<p>The secondary aim was to examine the direct and indirect (mediating) determinants of OHRQoL in children by SEM, which is the best technique for assessing complex interrelationships within <italic>a priori</italic> models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0022034512459757">Kline, 2011</xref>). The analytic strategy and findings are detailed in Appendix 5. In brief, in lagged analyses, worse symptom status at baseline predicted worse functional status at the three-month follow-up. Greater SOC predicted positive health beliefs and fewer symptoms. Compatible with the primary analysis, group allocation predicted symptoms, functioning, OHBs, and gingival health. Both SOC and group allocation indirectly predicted functional status <italic>via</italic> perceived symptoms. Contrary to predictions within the Wilson and Cleary model, neither gingival health nor OHBs were related directly or indirectly to functional status.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>This is the first study evaluating an intervention to enhance SOC in dentistry. The intervention enhanced SOC and improved OHRQoL. Analysis of these data provides experimental evidence that SOC influences OHRQoL and suggests that it may be a suitable avenue for oral health promotion in schools.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0022034512459757">Antonovsky (1987)</xref> proposed that SOC might promote health in 3 ways: first, through a physiological pathway whereby individuals with higher SOC experience less stress, leading to lower physical or biological effects, in this case oral disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0022034512459757">Lindfors <italic>et al</italic>., 2005</xref>); second, SOC might act if people select favorable behaviors such as brushing teeth frequently, less sugar consumption, or regular dental attendance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0022034512459757">Bernabe <italic>et al</italic>., 2009</xref>). In these pathways, effects of SOC on OHRQoL would be mediated by changes in clinical status or oral-health-related behaviors, evident as improved gingival status and oral health beliefs at follow-up in this study. The third putative mechanism is <italic>via</italic> an emotional pathway where SOC helps people cope better with stress and feel that their lives are more manageable, which may be evident as the lower perception of symptoms associated with the intervention.</p>
<p>Many oral health promotion interventions have been devised without any theoretical underpinning (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0022034512459757">Kay and Locker, 1998</xref>). Theory helps select the factors, place, time, and processes on which to intervene. Furthermore, much oral health promotion focuses on increasing knowledge and improving clinical outcomes. Cumulative evidence confirms that greater knowledge alone does not lead to behavioral changes and sustained oral health (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0022034512459757">Kay and Locker, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0022034512459757">Watt, 2005</xref>). Furthermore, clinical outcomes may not be suitable for assessing health promotion because they fail to capture subjective aspects of oral health. Clinical outcomes may be suitable for clinical treatments to improve clinical status, whereas oral disease is not strongly related to oral health (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0022034512459757">Locker, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0022034512459757">Baker <italic>et al</italic>., 2010</xref>). Interventions to improve clinical status might not improve oral health if health is seen as the interaction between state of mouth and individuals’ daily life in terms of functioning and well-being. Thus, more appropriate outcomes need to be considered for oral health promotion, most notably, oral-health-related quality of life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0022034512459757">Watt, 2005</xref>). In the present study, we demonstrated an effect of a psychosocial intervention on both clinical (gingival health) and OHRQoL outcomes.</p>
<p>Our intervention was the first to use SOC in relation to oral health. It was based on sound theoretical underpinnings and moved beyond dental health education. Its aim was to improve SOC, which is the ability to identify, organize, and use a range of available health resources to cope with stressors, and improve and maintain oral health, together with the modification toward a healthy environment where these abilities can be developed. Previous SOC-based interventions have focused on mental health (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0022034512459757">Hillert <italic>et al</italic>., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0022034512459757">Langeland <italic>et al</italic>., 2006</xref>); our intervention embraced a wide-ranging and whole-school approach, incorporating interactive health education, child participation, and empowerment. Classroom activities encouraged expression of feelings and ideas, and group discussion and sharing of experiences, together with the development of healthy environments as students and staff co-operated on healthy school projects.</p>
<p>Like all research this study has limitations. The study could not be powered <italic>a priori</italic> because it was the first to evaluate the effect of an intervention to enhance SOC in dentistry. Moreover, cluster randomized trials require intra-cluster correlation coefficients or design effects for power calculations. This study has provided data on which further trials can be planned. Future studies should evaluate whether the effects of the intervention persist, particularly during important transitions such as adolescence and the move to secondary/senior school (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0022034512459757">Marshman <italic>et al</italic>., 2009</xref>). For example, the SOC scores decreased slightly in the intervention group from 2 to 12 wks post-intervention, and the effects on gingival health and oral health beliefs at 12 wks, while significant, were modest. Future research might determine whether these effects persist (<italic>e.g</italic>., &gt; 6 mos). Such work should incorporate a more detailed investigation of the pathways (physiological, behavioral, or emotional) by which SOC affects oral health and OHRQoL. Thailand has a pedagogy different from that of Western countries. Future studies in countries with a less didactic teaching style may necessitate further development of the intervention. Finally, future process evaluation of the intervention would be helpful.</p>
