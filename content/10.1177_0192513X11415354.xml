<abstract>
<p>Child care is increasingly viewed as an opportunity to enhance children’s development and school readiness, with prekindergarten programs and early intervention programs targeting children at different moments of development. Results of existing research are mixed, and although many children experience different child care arrangements at different ages, little is known about the joint influence of early and later child care experiences. Using Early Childhood Longitudinal Study–Kindergarten Cohort data, the authors estimate a series of regression models, examining the unique and additive contributions of initial child care experiences and prekindergarten experiences on children’s school readiness. The authors find that early use of nonparental care is associated with negative sociobehavioral outcomes; prekindergarten center-based and Head Start care add to this negative association. Early participation in center-based care is associated with enhanced reading and math scores; those relationships are fully mediated by prekindergarten center-based care participation. Implications for policy, practice, and research are discussed.</p>

<body>
<p>Child care plays important roles both in facilitating parental employment and as an influence on children’s early growth and development. Some children begin nonparental care at very early ages, generally because of parental demands to return to work soon after a child’s birth. Other children begin care later, either because parents have more choice about work participation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0192513X11415354">Kimmel, 2006</xref>) or because nonparental care is being used as an enrichment activity and can be started whenever the parent feels it is going to be most beneficial. Understanding how different care arrangements at different developmental moments influence children’s development is important for informing child care policy. It is also important for informing the broader range of social and economic policies that shape family life at the nexus of work and child rearing.</p>
<p>Research on child care effects has been somewhat inconsistent, with some studies finding that children benefit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0192513X11415354">McCartney, Dearing, Taylor, &amp; Bub, 2007</xref>; The NICHD Early Child Care Research Network <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0192513X11415354">[NICHD ECCRN], 2002a</xref>), some finding that children may be harmed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0192513X11415354">Belsky, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0192513X11415354">L. Berger, Brooks-Gunn, Paxson, &amp; Waldfogel, 2008</xref>), and growing evidence that child care effects are complex and nuanced. Particularly important to the current study, research suggests that child care participation affects children differently, depending the child’s age. In general, negative effects of child care participation are associated with early entry to child care; children who begin nonparental care before 1 or 2 years of age demonstrate the largest behavioral and socioemotional deficits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0192513X11415354">L. M. Berger, Hill, &amp; Waldfogel, 2005</xref>). The beneficial effects of care are associated with later experiences; children who begin center-based care between the ages of 2 and 3 years demonstrate the largest cognitive/school readiness gains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0192513X11415354">Loeb, Bridges, Bassok, Fuller, &amp; Rumberger, 2007</xref>). Yet many children participate in both early and prekindergarten child care programs; we are aware of no research that has considered the joint influence of these experiences on children’s development and school readiness.</p>
<p>The current study examines the unique and additive contributions of initial child care experiences and prekindergarten experiences on children’s cognitive and socioemotional/behavioral development. Using data from the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study–Kindergarten Cohort (ECLS-K; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0192513X11415354">U.S. Department of Education, 2000</xref>), we first consider the relationships between children’s first nonparental care experiences and their prekindergarten year experiences. Next, we estimate a series of regression models, first examining the relationship between children’s first nonparental care experience and their school readiness and then introducing measures of children’s prekindergarten care arrangement. By comparing these models, we are able to assess the importance of different care arrangements at different developmental stages, and we expand on this assessment to consider implications for policy and for future research. Before presenting this study, we briefly review the relevant literature, focusing in particular on what is known about the influence of child care participation at different ages on children’s development.</p>

<title>Literature Review</title>
<p>The extensive use of nonparental child care arrangements in the United States is well documented, among children younger than 6 years and among 3- and 4-year olds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0192513X11415354">Children’s Defense Fund, 2005</xref>) and even among infants less than a year old (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0192513X11415354">U.S. Census Bureau, 2005</xref>). Child care participation has come to play a key role in the early development of a majority of children in the United States. Research is suggestive of both positive and negative outcomes associated with child care participation. For instance, a study conducted by NICHD ECCRN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0192513X11415354">2000b</xref>), using data from the Study of Early Child Care, examined the conditions and processes (quality, quantity, and type of care) through which early child care experiences affected cognitive-linguistic and socioemotional development among a sample of 1,200 children from birth to 5 years. After controlling for a wide range of background factors, such as family socioeconomic status, maternal well-being, and the quality of parenting provided by the mother, findings indicated that high-quality child care (including relative, nonrelative, and center-based care) enhanced the cognitive and linguistic functioning skills of children at 15, 24, 36, and 54 months.</p>
<p>Although high-quality child care appears to accrue benefits to children across the socioeconomic spectrum, some studies indicate that gains are greater for children from lower socioeconomic status families than for more privileged children (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0192513X11415354">Loeb et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0192513X11415354">McCartney et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0192513X11415354">Votruba-Drzal, Coley, &amp; Chase-Lansdale, 2004</xref>). Using prospective longitudinal data from a birth cohort of 1,364 children, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0192513X11415354">McCartney et al. (2007)</xref> considered a full range of types of child care arrangements (nanny care, center-based care, relative care, etc.) and found that across these care types, high-quality child care buffered children from the negative effects of low income in two ways: directly, through the compensatory experiences the child receives while in child care, and indirectly, through a positive effect on the child’s home environment.</p>
<p>Given evidence that child care is good for young children, there also appears to be reason for caution. For instance, exposure to center-based care versus informal care has been associated with cognitive gains in some studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0192513X11415354">Loeb et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0192513X11415354">NICHD ECCRN, 2000b</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0192513X11415354">2002b</xref>) but with increased behavioral and social problems as well (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0192513X11415354">Belsky, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0192513X11415354">Magnuson, Ruhm, &amp; Waldfogel, 2007</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0192513X11415354">Belsky (2006)</xref> found that increased hours in nonmaternal care, especially center-based care, during the first 4.5 years of life resulted in increased levels of externalizing behaviors at 54 months and later in kindergarten. More hours spent in child care has been associated with negative outcomes in general (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0192513X11415354">Loeb et al., 2007</xref>); however, high quality of care appears to diminish the possible negative effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0192513X11415354">Peisner-Feinberg et al., 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>Some of the differences in child care effects may be attributable to differences in the quality of care children receive both in child care and when they are at home (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0192513X11415354">Votruba-Drzal et al., 2004</xref>). Quality, most broadly, includes attributes of caregiver/child interactions, the degree of developmental stimulation in the physical and social environment, how time is spent, and structural domains such as amount of space for play and educational status of the caregiver (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0192513X11415354">Dowsett, Huston, Imes, &amp; Gennetian, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0192513X11415354">Phillips, Mekos, Scarr, McCartney, &amp; Abott-Shim, 2001</xref>). In general, the extant research suggests that children benefit from time in nonparental care when the quality of the child care environment is high (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0192513X11415354">Belsky, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0192513X11415354">Love et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0192513X11415354">McCartney et al., 2007</xref>), and particularly so for children in low-income households where child care quality appears both to buffer against the negative effects of a resource-poor home environment and potentially to improve the quality of the home environment by decreasing parental stress and enhancing parenting knowledge and skills (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0192513X11415354">McCartney et al., 2007</xref>).</p>

<title>Child Age and Child Care Effects</title>
<p>The effect of child care may depend also on the age of the child and the fit between what is offered in the child care setting and a child’s age-specific developmental needs. For instance, center-based child care settings tend to have more educationally oriented and child-directed activities, better educated care-givers, and more stimulating physical environments, and these center-based settings are associated with the greatest cognitive gains among preschool-aged children (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0192513X11415354">Bridges, Fuller, Rumberger, &amp; Tran, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0192513X11415354">NICHD ECCRN, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0192513X11415354">Vandell, 2004</xref>). This is likely because preschool-aged children are developmentally well-suited to take advantage of the particular opportunities for learning in high-quality center-based environments.</p>
<p>In contrast, although even the youngest children are involved in rapid cognitive, social, and emotional development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0192513X11415354">Shonkoff &amp; Phillips, 2000</xref>), the context in which optimal development can unfold is different for younger versus older children. For instance, “quality” in infant and toddler care centers on the warmth and responsiveness of adult/child interactions, with indicators including positive physical contact and affect, responsiveness to infant vocalizations and facilitation of infant behaviors, and use of language/reading to the infant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0192513X11415354">Tran &amp; Weinraub, 2006</xref>). A quality care experience for very young children may also depend on caregiver stability, a factor that has been shown to be related to child attachment among infants in nonmaternal care (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0192513X11415354">Raikes, 1993</xref>).</p>
<p>Research indicates that process quality is more strongly predicted by caregiver/child ratio and group size for infant and toddler care settings and by caregiver training and background in preschool-aged care settings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0192513X11415354">NICHD ECCRN, 2000b</xref>). In other words, infants and toddlers experience a more developmentally supportive child care process when they have more one-on-one attention, and this depends on low ratios and small groups. Older children are more independent and peer oriented and thus better supported by environments with rich opportunities for exploration, peer interaction, and structured learning activities. It follows that while center-based care is generally of highest quality for older children, less formal care arrangements appear to have higher quality for infants and toddlers. For instance, in a study focused on child care quality for children up through age 3 years, center-based care was found to have the highest caregiver/child ratios and group sizes and the least frequent positive caregiving behaviors, with child care homes being next best and relative or nanny care scoring highest on these critical quality domains for very young children (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0192513X11415354">NICHD ECCRN, 2000a</xref>). Assessing the influence of child care participation on children’s growth and development depends, then, on accounting for the age at which care is experienced and the type of care experienced at different ages.</p>

<title>School Readiness: What Is Important?</title>
<p>National attention to “school readiness” was spurred by a 1991 report of the Education Goals Panel, which established the goal that “all children shall enter school ready to learn” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0192513X11415354">U.S. Department of Education, 1991</xref>). The notion of “ready to learn” has since been met with criticism and the argument that all children <italic>are</italic> ready to learn; the emphasis should be on the degree to which a child is “ready for school,” or even whether the school itself is “ready” to meet the needs of all children (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0192513X11415354">Kagan, 1990</xref>). There is no general, national definition of “school readiness,” but currently accepted conceptualizations tend to focus on five domains: physical well-being, social and emotional development, approaches to learning, language usage, and cognition and general knowledge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0192513X11415354">Kagan, 1992</xref>).</p>
<p>Within this set of readiness domains, there is considerable debate about the extent to which hard skills such as reading and math versus soft skills such as social and behavioral skills should be the focus of intervention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0192513X11415354">Duncan et al., 2007</xref>). For instance, much research has focused on the cognitive outcomes associated with child care participation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0192513X11415354">Gormley, Gayer, Phillips, &amp; Dawson, 2005</xref>), and parents tend to report that “hard” skills such as counting, recognizing letters, and knowing colors are essential for entry to kindergarten (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0192513X11415354">Thompson &amp; Raikes, 2007</xref>). Teachers, however, are much less likely to be concerned about these “hard” skills and prioritize more general well-being and “soft” skill assets, including being well rested and in good physical health, being able to share and take turns, being sensitive to other children’s needs, and being curious and enthusiastic about learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0192513X11415354">Heaviside &amp; Farris, 1993</xref>).</p>
<p>The controversy about what skills children need to successfully begin kindergarten (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0192513X11415354">Thompson &amp; Raikes, 2007</xref>) is grounded in disagreement about which domains of kindergarten school readiness are most influential on overall learning and developmental trajectories. Although most studies indicate that cognitive outcomes, reflecting “hard” skill prereading and math knowledge, are significant predictors of academic development; it also appears that “hard” skill advantages at kindergarten entry diminish over the first years of elementary school (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0192513X11415354">Magnuson et al., 2007</xref>). Existing research is quite mixed on the social/behavioral “soft” skills side, with some scholars arguing that early behavioral and social skills are predictive of long-term academic achievement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0192513X11415354">Thompson &amp; Raikes, 2007</xref>) and other studies indicating little if any spillover of soft skill assets into hard skill gains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0192513X11415354">Duncan et al., 2007</xref>). Given the scholarly debates, it does appear that teachers and parents care about children’s social skills and behaviors as central aspects of school readiness, and social and behavioral concerns are not uncommon as a reason for delayed kindergarten entry and for grade retention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0192513X11415354">Jimerson, Carlson, Rotert, Egeland, &amp; Sroufe, 1997</xref>).</p>
<p>Approaches to learning is an additional “soft skill” area of school readiness that, despite being considered very important to both teachers and parents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0192513X11415354">Wesley &amp; Buysse, 2003</xref>), is less consistently addressed in standards and indicators for school readiness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0192513X11415354">Scott-Little, Kagan, &amp; Frelow, 2003</xref>). Approaches to learning include[s] factors such as inquisitiveness, task persistence, eagerness, self-direction, and inventiveness that are conducive to learning across domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0192513X11415354">George &amp; Greenfield, 2005</xref>). That is, a child who is curious, eager for challenges, and self-directed will likely take better advantage of learning opportunities in reading, math, and other areas than a child who is lacking in these attributes. In this way, approaches to learning may play a key role in a child’s ability to successfully transition into and benefit from the school environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0192513X11415354">Kagan, 1992</xref>). Moreover, approaches to learning may be the most important domain of school readiness for supporting at-risk students to transition into elementary school (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0192513X11415354">George &amp; Greenfield, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>As research continues to clarify what aspects of school readiness are critical, it will be important to consider the contextual and contingent nature of current understandings of good behavior and social skills. That is, teachers and parents may prefer child behavioral repertoires that are characterized by compliance, patience, and collaboration—such repertoires likely make the tasks of parenting and teaching easier! However, as more children are socialized in peer-dominated child care environments, different repertoires may emerge as both adaptive and potentially positive steps toward healthy development. A complete understanding of “school readiness” will, ideally, be inclusive of and responsive to the multiple ways that children can be supported to build on early development as they enter the elementary school environment.</p>

<title>Early Care and Prekindergarten Care</title>
<p>Children participate in different types of nonparental care at different moments in their years before starting kindergarten and often do so for different reasons. A parent returning to work tends to be the primary reason for nonparental care, particularly within the first year or two of a child’s life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0192513X11415354">Hofferth, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0192513X11415354">Peyton, Jacobs, O’Brien, &amp; Roy, 2001</xref>); but at the same time, very early childhood is increasingly seen as a time of developmental potential and thus an opportunity for delivering interventions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0192513X11415354">Knitzer, 2007</xref>). Evidence from model programs using nonmaternal care starting in infancy, such as Abecedarian, are suggestive that early nonmaternal care can accrue lasting benefits to children (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0192513X11415354">Campbell, Ramey, Pungello, Sparling, &amp; Miller-Johnson, 2002</xref>). The later preschool years have more traditionally been seen as a time for preparing children to start school. Head Start aims to boost the school readiness and general development of prekindergarten children who live in resource-poor home environments, and a growing prekindergarten movement has extended this type of approach to a wider range of children, with some places (e.g., Georgia) now offering universal prekindergarten programs in hopes of enhancing educational outcomes, with growing evidence of success (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0192513X11415354">Barnett, Lamy, &amp; Jung, 2005</xref>). Some research is suggestive that an earlier start is better, particularly for advancing children’s development toward “hard” skill domains of school readiness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0192513X11415354">Loeb et al., 2007</xref>). Other research suggests that early start to center-based care is particularly detrimental for the “soft” skill domains that teachers feel are so important (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0192513X11415354">L. Berger et al., 2008</xref>). Many children participate in nonparental care both early in their childhood (e.g., before age 2 or 3 years) and later on (e.g., in their prekindergarten year). These experiences may serve different purposes, and they may also have different benefits and drawbacks in terms of preparing children to be successful in school. Clarifying the influence of prekindergarten child care from that of earlier child care is important for informing child care practices and decision making.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0192513X11415354">
<title>Current Study</title>
<p>The current study examines the influence of child care participation at different developmental moments on children’s cognitive and socioemotional development. Specifically, we consider (a) how children’s early child care experiences relate to their prekindergarten child care experiences, (b) how children’s early child care experiences relate to kindergarten-entry developmental outcomes, and (c) the degree to which prekindergarten experiences mediate relationships between early child care participation and kindergarten-entry outcomes. Using data from the ECLS-K parent interviews and direct child assessments, we estimate a series of regression models explaining variation in children’s reading and math scores and in several domains of socioemotional development.</p>

<title>Data</title>
<p>The ECLS-K is a longitudinal study tracking the educational development of a nationally representative cohort of children who entered kindergarten in 1998/1999. Data collected from parents, children’s teachers, school administrators, and through direct observation of children’s development support nuanced analysis of many factors and contexts influencing children’s school readiness and academic development. For instance, the restricted use data files, which are used for this study, allow for linking child- and school-level data to geographic information. Given the strengths of this data set, ECLS-K has some limitations as a source of data on child care: measures of child care participation are taken from parents’ retrospective self-reports, and there is little and imprecise information on quality characteristics of different child care arrangements or duration of time a child has spent in arrangement. The strengths of ECLS-K for this study’s purpose, however, are its generalizability, its information on types of child care used at different ages, and its comprehensive measures of children’s school readiness.</p>
<p>The present study uses parent self-reports of their use of child care from the focal child’s birth up through kindergarten entry and on a range of demographic, socioeconomic, and family structural factors. These data were collected through phone interviews conducted with parents during the fall of their child’s kindergarten year. This study also uses data on children’s social and cognitive development, including both direct assessments of language and math skills and teacher assessments of social and behavioral skills, all taken during the fall of the kindergarten year.</p>

<title>School readiness outcomes</title>
<p>We use seven school readiness outcomes from the ECLS-K in these analyses, covering both cognitive and sociobehavioral dimensions associated with school performance. The reading and math measures are based on direct child assessments. The reading assessment addresses basic skills such as letter recognition, as well as receptive vocabulary and comprehension. The math assessment addresses math-related conceptual knowledge, procedural knowledge, and problem solving. Item response theory (IRT) scores are used in the current study as measures of children’s reading and math ability at the beginning of kindergarten (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0192513X11415354">U.S. Department of Education, 2000</xref>).</p>
<p>The remaining outcomes are teacher assessments of the child during fall of the kindergarten year on the five scales of the Social Rating Scale: <italic>approaches to learning</italic>, <italic>self-control</italic>, <italic>interpersonal skills</italic>, <italic>externalizing behaviors</italic>, and <italic>internalizing behaviors</italic>. <italic>Approaches to learning</italic> addresses factors thought to facilitate the child’s learning from the classroom environment, with items on attentiveness, task persistence, eagerness to learn, learning independence, flexibility, and organization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0192513X11415354">U.S. Department of Education, 2000</xref>). The <italic>self-control</italic> scale reflects how well the child respects property rights of others, controls his/her temper, accepts peer’s ideas for shared activities, and responds to pressures from peers. <italic>Interpersonal skills</italic> involve making and sustaining friendships, getting along with people who are different, showing sensitivity and providing help/comfort to other people, and expressing one’s self appropriately. <italic>Externalizing behaviors</italic> have to do with how frequently the child “argues, fights, gets angry, acts impulsively, and disturbs ongoing activities” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0192513X11415354">U.S. Department of Education, 2000</xref>, pp. 2-16). Finally, the <italic>internalizing behaviors</italic> scale has items about the appearance that the child is anxious, lonely, sad, and has low self-esteem. All items are rated from 1 to 4, where 1 means the behavior is <italic>never</italic> observed and 4 means the behavior is observed <italic>very often</italic>. Reliability for these scales is high, ranging from .79 for self-control to .9 for externalizing behaviors for the fall-kindergarten assessments.</p>

<sec id="section10-0192513X11415354">
<title>Child care participation</title>
<p>We measure child care participation through two categorical variables, one representing the <italic>first nonparental care experience</italic> and the other representing the <italic>prekindergarten care experience.</italic></p>
<p><italic>First nonparental care</italic> is taken from responses to a series of questions in which parents were asked whether they had ever used a particular form of care, and if so, at what age in months did the child first participate in that type of care. Care types included relative care, nonrelative care, center-based care, and Head Start. We combine relative and nonrelative care into a category we have labeled “informal care.” Parents were asked about each care type in turn, and we have coded the care type associated with the youngest age as the child’s first nonparental care experience. When a child’s first nonparental care experience involved more than one type of care, we have categorized care type as (a) Head Start if that is one of the types present and (b) otherwise the most formal type experienced (center based if both center based and informal care co-occurred, otherwise “informal”). Because of existing literature suggesting that more formal care early on may be associated with problematic outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0192513X11415354">Belsky et al., 2007</xref>), we decided to account for the most formal care experienced, even if informal care accompanied that arrangement.</p>
<p>To differentiate early care from prekindergarten care, we have top-coded first care experience at 1 year before the child’s age at kindergarten entry (in months). If a child began his/her first nonparental care experience later than 1 year before kindergarten (or never received nonparental care prior to kindergarten entry), we have coded early care as “parent only.”</p>
<p>In addition to distinguishing types of first care, we categorize first care experiences by the child’s age at first nonparental care, using age groupings that the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0192513X11415354">National Association for the Education of Young Children (2005)</xref> provides to describe “infants,” “toddlers,” and “preschoolers”: less than 15 months (Time 1), between 15 and 30 months (Time 2), and between 31 months and 1 year prior to kindergarten (approximately 48 months; Time 3). Since no children began Head Start care younger than 30 months, Head Start is only assigned as an early care type at Time 3. The resulting eight-level categorical variable is entered as a series of dummy variables with “parent only” as the omitted reference category throughout the analyses.</p>
<p><italic>Prekindergarten care</italic> experience is taken from parent reports of the child’s participation in child care during the year before kindergarten. Although arguably 3- and 4-year-old children may have more similar needs and experiences than do younger children, we keep the prekindergarten year separate because of the current policy focus on the prekindergarten year as a time to enhance school readiness of vulnerable children. The same child care types were asked about as before, and we have again combined relative and nonrelative care as “informal care” and distinguished this from center-based care, Head Start care, and parent-only care. The parent-only category was assigned when the parent responded that the child had not received any of the forms of child care in the year before starting kindergarten. For children who did receive nonparental care, the type of care in which the child spent the most hours per week was coded as the primary type of care (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0192513X11415354">U.S. Department of Education, 2000</xref>). As with first care we have used “parent only” as the omitted reference category when prekindergarten care was entered as a series of dummy variables in the multivariate analyses.</p>

<sec id="section11-0192513X11415354">
<title>Demographic factors</title>
<p>We account for a range of parent/child and family background factors that, based on existing research, are likely influences on child growth and development. Child age is measured as years from date of birth to the date on which testing was conducted; child gender contrasts girls and boys (girl = 1; boy = 0). Maternal race/ethnicity is reflected in a series of dichotomous dummy variables, with Black, Hispanic, Asian American, and “other” mothers contrasted with White mothers (reference category) in the multivariate models.</p>
<p>Family structure is also known to be a factor in child care dynamics, with the household demand for care (included in our models as “number of children under age 6”) and people available to provide care (“number of adults”) influencing costs and benefits of different child care choices and the time and resources available for meeting each child’s individual needs within the family environment. In addition to family structure, parental life stage may shape parenting practices that in turn influence child development. Mother’s age at first child bearing (in years) is included to account for potential differences between mothers who begin their parenting role at different moments in their own adult development. Mother’s age at the time of kindergarten entry (also in years) reflects age at birth of the focal child and is important because mother’s life stage at the time of the focal child’s early development may affect parent/child relationships and choices related to child care participation.</p>
<p>We tap into the resources available in the home to support the child’s human capital development in three ways. First, we account for home language use (“non-English”), measured from 1 to 4, where 1 = <italic>never speaks non-English language in the home</italic> and 4 = <italic>very often speaks non-English language in the home</italic>. Parents’ education reflects the educational level of the most educated parent and is measured as a series of dichotomous variables, distinguishing parents with a high school degree or equivalent, those with some college or vocational school, and those with a bachelor’s degree or more education from those with less than a high school diploma (reference category). Number of children’s books in the home is also included as a proxy for learning resources and family emphasis on learning activities in the home.</p>
<p>Two socioeconomic measures are included. <italic>Household income</italic> is a continuous measure reflecting the total household income (in $1,000s), and <italic>Job prestige scores</italic> indicate the average prestige score of jobs in the category reported by the respondent, based on the 1989 General Social Survey (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0192513X11415354">Nakao &amp; Treas, 1992</xref> We include the highest job prestige score for the parent(s) in the household. <italic>Welfare</italic> is a dichotomous measure indicating whether or not any member of the household has received welfare (TANF or AFDC) assistance at any time since the focal child was born.</p>

<title>Analytic Strategies</title>
<p>The analysis consisted of several steps. First, we conducted standard descriptive statistics on the variables for use in the study. Next, we examined the relationships between early and prekindergarten child care participation, describing the proportions of children who end up in different prekindergarten care arrangements given their first care arrangement. This is important both to our overall research aim of understanding relationships among entry to care, prekindergarten care, and school readiness. It is also important in establishing that there is enough variability between early and later care experiences that they can be treated as discreet constructs in the multivariate models. Finally, we estimate a series of regression models explaining variation in school readiness in each of the outcome domains discussed above.</p>
<p>For each outcome, we begin with a baseline model (not shown) that includes a set of demographic, human capital, and household resource factors as predictors of school readiness. Model 1 adds a series of dummy variables reflecting first nonparental care arrangement, with “parent only care” as the reference category. Finally, Model 2 adds information about the child’s prekindergarten child care experience, with again “parent only care” as the omitted reference category. These models are represented below in <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="disp-formula1-0192513X11415354">Equations (1)</xref> through <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="disp-formula3-0192513X11415354">(3)</xref>, respectively, where <italic>X</italic>

<p>In Models 1 and 2, we assess the magnitude, direction, and significance of the coefficients on the key child care variables, as well as any changes in other variable coefficients that are associated with the entry of the new block of variables. We also consider the overall model fit and the significance of change in explained variance (<italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup>) in our analytic process. In part, the inclusion of Model 2 variables is used to assess the possibility of mediation—that is, if there is a significant relationship between early care experiences and school readiness, does prekindergarten experience mediate that relationship? The reduction of a significant early care coefficient to one not significantly different than zero when prekindergarten care is included in the equation would be evidence of mediation. We discuss specific results later, but note here that because there were few and only minor differences in the coefficients in the baseline and subsequent models, we focus on the models that include child care variables in our presentation and discussion of findings.</p>
<p>To calculate nationally representative estimates of all children entering kindergarten in fall 1998, we used statistical weights to account for clustering and unequal probability of selection of respondents in the ECLS-K sampling design. All the analyses were conducted using survey command in Stata 10.</p>
<p>To handle the missing data, we employed a multiple imputation procedure using ICE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0192513X11415354">Royston, 2005</xref>) and MIM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0192513X11415354">Carlin, Galati, &amp; Royston, 2008</xref>) commands in Stata. ICE is a Stata version of multiple imputation using multivariate imputation by chained equations (MICE; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0192513X11415354">van Buuren, Boshuizen, &amp; Knook, 1999</xref>).</p>

<title>Findings</title>
<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0192513X11415354">Table 1</xref> reports descriptive statistics for the study sample on all variables included in the analyses. In addition to race/ethnic diversity (67% White non-Hispanic, 35% race/ethnic minority) and differences in family structure (e.g., more than 20% of children were living in a single-parent family at that time), the ECLS-K is valuable in capturing a wide range of home resource environments. For instance, families varied considerably in household socioeconomic status (average household income of $53,000) and welfare participation (22% received welfare). Children experienced large differences in how many children’s book were in the home (<italic>M</italic> = 74, <italic>SD</italic> = 59.5), and nearly equal shares of parents had a high school diploma or less, some college, and a bachelor’s degree of more education.</p>

<p>Children’s first care experiences varied, with 12% of children remaining in parent-only care up through their prekindergarten year and more than a third beginning either informal (39%) or center-based (7%) care before 15 months of age. As children got older, entry to care shifted from greater use of informal to greater use of center-based care, with the latest early care time point showing 8% of children entering to informal care, 18% entering into center-based care, and 5% entering into Head Start. Prekindergarten experiences ranged from 46% of children who were in center-based care to 11% of children who attended Head Start as their primary care arrangement during the year before kindergarten.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0192513X11415354">Table 2</xref> shows where children in each first-care setting ended up during the prekindergarten year. For instance, Row 1 indicates that although 91% of children who were in parent-only care up until their prekindergarten year remained in parent-only care until kindergarten, 4% of those children began center-based care in their prekindergarten year and 4% went into a Head Start program. Although most children who began center-based care as an early care experience did remain in center-based care during the prekindergarten year, a substantial number did not. For instance, 25% of children who began center-based care before the age of 15 months were in some other arrangement in the year before kindergarten. Children who began in informal care show the greatest variation in prekindergarten experiences, with many remaining in informal settings but nearly equal proportions moving into center-based care and many enrolling in Head Start. Overall, although prekindergarten care is clearly related to early care experience, there are also many children whose early care experiences are different from their prekindergarten experiences.</p>

<title>Child Care Associations</title>
<sec id="section15-0192513X11415354">
<title>Cognitive outcomes</title>
<p>Child care participation is associated, in general, with increased reading and math scores; the coefficients become larger as the age of entry to care goes up, particularly for center-based care. Model 2 indicates that prekindergarten participation in center-based care versus parent-only care is associated with significant increases in reading and math IRT score as well; and prekindergarten center-based care appears to substantially mediate the relationships between the early center-based care and these cognitive outcomes.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section16-0192513X11415354">
<title>Socioemotional outcomes</title>
<p>The findings on the remaining five socioemotional outcomes fall into three general patterns. First, self-control and externalizing behaviors are very similar, in that early care experiences are associated with significantly worse scores at school entry, particularly for center-based care, with earlier start of care related to larger effects. Early Head Start is associated with significantly worse scores for self-control and externalizing behavior as well, net of other variables in the model. The addition of the prekindergarten variables in Model 2 indicates that participation in either prekindergarten center-based or Head Start care is associated again with worse scores. These relationships are mostly in addition to (rather than mediators of) the early care relationships.</p>
<p>The second pattern of findings is for interpersonal skills and at the trend level for approaches to learning. There is a negative relationship between beginning center-based care earlier than 15 months of age and scores on each of these outcomes; this relationship is somewhat diminished when including the prekindergarten variables, which, themselves, are not significant. The final pattern of findings is for internalizing behaviors, in which there is no significant association between any of the child care participation variables and child behavior at kindergarten entry.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In this study, we aimed to examine the influence of child care participation over time on children’s cognitive and socioemotional development. Our main analyses focused on (a) how children’s early child care experiences relate to their prekindergarten child care experiences, (b) how children’s early child care experiences relate to kindergarten-entry developmental outcomes, and (c) the degree to which prekindergarten experiences mediate relationships between early child care participation and kindergarten-entry outcomes. Our preliminary analysis assessed the associations between first child care arrangements and arrangements during the prekindergarten year. We hypothesized that first child care experiences would influence later, prekindergarten child care experiences, and we found descriptive support for this. For instance, more than 70% of children whose first nonparental care experience was in center-based care remained in center-based care during the prekindergarten year. In contrast, more than 90% of children who experienced parent-only care early on continued in parent-only care in the prekindergarten year as well. However, we also found considerable change in child care experiences, with 39% of all sample children spending their prekindergarten year in a care type different than the type (informal, center based, Head Start, parent-only) in which they initiated nonparental care (or for parent only, the type in which they spent all their time up until the prekindergarten year). The greatest change in care type occurred among children who began in informal care arrangements; these children were fairly evenly split between informal and formal care during the prekindergarten year, and a considerable number participated in the Head Start program.</p>
<p>Existing research shows that parents’ preferences and child care choices depend in part on child’s age; cross-sectionally, parents of older children tend to use more formal child care arrangements. Our findings suggest that this tendency plays out longitudinally as well, with parents changing type of child care arrangement as their children get older. For instance, some children participate in care of increasing formality (parent only, to informal, to center based). Other children begin early in center-based care and go on to participate in center-based care in their prekindergarten year, whereas some children spend their entire preschool experience in parent-only care. We see little evidence for decreasing formality of care (center care transitioning to informal or parent only) or for randomness. With the limitations of our data, we were only able to take a rough look at these patterns—enough to establish that early and prekindergarten care are distinct but related contributors to school readiness. Subsequent study should consider with more nuance the trajectories through which different children experience parental and nonparental care settings.</p>
<p>Given this bivariate analysis, we went on to consider our primary research questions. Our findings suggest that entry to care is indeed important for understanding differences in school readiness. In particular, children who begin nonparental care earlier and in more formal settings on average had worse scores on social and behavioral measures than did children who remained in parental care longer. For instance, children who began center-based care when they were younger than 15 months scored, on average, more than a quarter of standard deviation (<italic>SD</italic>) worse in self-control and .34 <italic>SD</italic> worse in externalizing behavior when compared with children who received parent only care. These sociobehavioral associations are only slightly diminished after accounting for later, prekindergarten care experiences. Indeed, the differences associated with early and later nonparental care appear to be additive, with more care associated with more externalizing behavior and less self-control. This is consistent with other studies reporting negative social and behavior child care influences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0192513X11415354">Belsky, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0192513X11415354">NICHD ECCRN, 2002b</xref>), but as in other observational studies, the possibility remains that the negative association is because of some omitted child or family variable that is associated both with early nonparental care and with problematic child social and behavioral outcomes.</p>
<p>To the extent that the child care–related behavioral differences found in this study are substantiated through additional research, it will be important to isolate the causal mechanism. Are behavioral differences caused by separation from the parent per se or by particular and perhaps changeable aspects of the nonparental care experiences typically available for infants and toddlers in the United States? It will also be important to consider the meaning, significance, and predictive utility of the sociobehavioral measures that are now commonly used in early childhood and school readiness research, including those administered by teachers for the ECLS-K study. For instance, one item in the externalizing behaviors scale was “arguing.” Arguing may, at times, be reflective of a lack of problem-solving skills or other developmental deficits. But alternatively, it may be that children who come to kindergarten able to argue for their perspective, or to get their needs met, may be exhibiting greater self-efficacy that could stem from early experiences of navigating structured, peer-oriented caregiving environments. One potential limitation to current approaches to conceptualizing and measuring school readiness is the intertwining of child developmental expectations with a particular set of values and beliefs about appropriate child behavior. If these values and beliefs are produced and reinforced through models of family life in which a (generally middle-class and White) mother stays at home with the child until kindergarten begins, the increased use of nonparental care arrangements during early childhood may warrant a broader perspective on what is normal and healthy behavioral and socioemotional development. Further development of these ideas is outside the scope of the current article, but given the prevalence of child care participation, and the political, economic, and emotional implications, particularly for women, we conclude that a cautious interpretation of our findings on social and behavioral school readiness outcomes is called for.</p>
<p>Consistent with previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0192513X11415354">Loeb et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0192513X11415354">Magnuson et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0192513X11415354">NICHD ECCRN, 2000b</xref>), we find that participation in center-based care is associated with improved scores in both reading and math. Although a cognitive benefit is suggested for entry into center-based care versus parent-only care (see Model 1, “reading” and “math”; <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0192513X11415354">Table 3</xref>), the effect size is smaller than what was found for some of the social and behavioral outcomes (0.19 <italic>SD</italic> for reading and 0.17 for math, for initiation of center-base care between 30 months and prekindergarten age). In addition, the entry to care influence on reading and math appears to be substantially mediated by participation in prekindergarten center-based care (see Model 2, “reading” and “math”; <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0192513X11415354">Table 3</xref>). This is not surprising; since a majority of children who begin center-based care in the first few years of life continue to participate in center-based care up through kindergarten, we would expect to see a significant coefficient on the first care measures if the prekindergarten experience were not accounted for in the model. In this case it would mean that cognitive benefits really accrue in the prekindergarten year and that expanding access to structured prekindergarten learning environments makes sense as the focus of intervention. However, it may also be that early center-based care leads to later center-based care if, for instance, parents observe developmental and other benefits to their child’s participation and therefore continue to choose center-based arrangements over time. In this case, early initiation of center-base care would be important, not in directly enhancing cognitive development but as a step in promoting overall cognitive development prior to kindergarten.</p>
<p>It is interesting that the cognitive benefits of center-based care do not appear to extend to Head Start participation but the negative sociobehavioral outcomes do. It may be that there are quality of care differences, not captured in the ECLS-K data, that account for these findings. Alternatively, it could be that parents who choose to use Head Start are disadvantaged in their parenting efforts in ways that are unobserved in the data for our analysis. Head Start participation may be one consequence of unobserved disadvantage and diminished school readiness may be another. Finally, it may be that the social environment within Head Start programs provides diminished resources for child development. Head Start participation is generally limited to poor children who may share similar developmental risks. Other research has demonstrated negative outcomes for children whose preschool or school peers experience socioeconomic or educational disadvantages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0192513X11415354">Bankston &amp; Caldas, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0192513X11415354">Henry &amp; Rickman, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0192513X11415354">Reardon, 2003</xref>), and this could be the case for children in Head Start as well. In any case, since Head Start is intended specifically to boost school readiness, the lack of positive findings warrants additional study.</p>
<sec id="section18-0192513X11415354">
<title>Limitations</title>
<p>This study has several limitations that should be noted in evaluating our findings. First, our data on child care participation are retrospective and are not as rich as we would like. Without measures of child care quality, hours in care, or duration of care within a given arrangement, we are able to provide only a broad perspective on early and later child care participation. We look forward to replicating these analyses using prospective data and including a broader set of child care participation measures.</p>
<p>Second, we lack an adequate measure of maternal work participation. Our research question is not focused on maternal employment; children participate in nonparental care for a range of reasons and it is child care participation that is of interest to us here. However, maternal employment is clearly one driving factor, particularly for early use of child care, and the indirect effects of maternal employment may not be fully accounted for in our models. We expect that maternal employment influences children through their child care experiences and through the resources that additional earnings can make available; we account for both these indirect influences. However, maternal employment may be important in other indirect ways as well, if working mothers are more stressed or tired in their time with their children or alternatively if their time with their children is enriched because it is seen as a scarce resource. Given the relationship between maternal work participation and use of child care, it would have been ideal to be able to account for mothers’ work hours in these analyses; however, limitations in the data prevented us from doing this.</p>
<p>The generalizability of our findings also has some limitations. Although the ECLS-K is a nationally representative sample, we are unable to include a small proportion of that sample due to missing data on our analysis variables. Missing responses to the set of questions on child care arrangements is the primary reason for exclusion of cases from the analytic sample. Additional cases are excluded because questions about the child’s mother have responses that are either missing or “not applicable.” Nonresponse to questions about welfare participation, mother’s age at first child bearing, and language spoken to the child each may be caused by social desirability bias. This may remove some of the most disadvantaged children from the study sample. Finally, we exclude a small number of cases with one of two child care arrangements: use of multiple care types at the same time and care that changes location. These cases are excluded because too few children participate in each of these categories and estimates would not be reliable.</p>

<title>Conclusions and Implications</title>
<p>This study contributes to the child care knowledge base by providing additional evidence that child care participation is associated with school readiness and child development. Specifically, we extend understandings of child care effects by examining a sequence of child care experiences and distinguishing the influence of different types of care at different ages and within different patterns of child care participation. The influence of prekindergarten child care participation appears to vary, being associated with positive (i.e., beneficial) cognitive outcomes and negative (detrimental) social and behavioral outcomes. Positive associations between early center-based care and reading and math are substantially mediated by center-based care experiences during the prekindergarten year, suggesting that prioritization of prekindergarten makes sense when policy and practice goals are to improve “hard skill” domains of school readiness. But parents do not use child care only (or even primarily) with the goal of enhancing their children’s reading and math scores. Rather, child care performs a critical function in facilitating parental (and generally maternal) employment. Early care is often necessary to a families’ economic well-being and to a woman’s ability to balance child rearing and work responsibilities. It is concerning, then, that when we find a relationship between early child care and domains of school readiness that is robust, it is always a negative relationship (i.e., to a potentially detrimental outcome). Given our findings that earlier entry to care is associated with fewer benefits and more potentially detrimental outcomes, it is important for future research to clarify whether it is early child care per se that is associated with poor outcomes, or if perhaps there are aspects of early care, as it is currently delivered in the United States, that could be changed to enrich the experiences and development of infants and toddlers.</p>
<p>Early child care participation is increasingly common, and it is important for both parents and policy makers to have good information on the likely consequences of different care arrangements. Although our findings are concerning in light of the expanding use of nonparental care in the United States, our analysis is suggestive of caution as this field continues to examine the effects of child care participation in different settings and for children of different ages. There is a range of possible explanations for our findings, and we look forward to additional study that more fully accounts for both the nuances of child care participation and also the nuances of child development and behavior and the cultural, economic, and political contexts in which developmental expectations are produced and sustained.</p>
