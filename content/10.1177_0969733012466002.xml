<abstract>
<p>Suffering repeated experiences of moral distress in intensive care units due to applications of futility reflects on nurses’ patient care negatively, increases their burnout, and reduces their job satisfaction. This study was carried out to investigate the levels of job satisfaction and exhaustion suffered by intensive care nurses and the relationship between them through the futility dimension of the issue. The study included 138 intensive care nurses. The data were obtained with the futility questionnaire developed by the researchers, Maslach Burnout Inventory and Minnesota Satisfaction Questionnaire. It was determined that nurses who agreed to the proposition that the application of futility demoralizes health-care professionals had low levels of job satisfaction but high levels of depersonalization. It was determined that nurses had moderate levels of job satisfaction, emotional exhaustion, and personal achievements but high levels of sensitivity. Nurses’ job satisfaction and sensitivities are positively affected when they consider that futility does not contradict the purposes of medicine.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>It is of great importance for nurses providing services for individuals, families, and the community in every area of life to be satisfied with their jobs and to be productive, happy, and efficient. This will, in turn, improve the quality of the service they provide.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0969733012466002">1</xref>
</sup> Job satisfaction is an emotional response and behavioral expression and reflects an individual’s evaluation of his or her work, working life, and working environment.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0969733012466002">1</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0969733012466002"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0969733012466002">3</xref>
</sup> The higher a nurse’s job satisfaction, the higher the quality of patient care they provide.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0969733012466002">4</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0969733012466002"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0969733012466002">6</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>Issues such as working in an intensive care environment, heavy work overload, providing care for patients with severe illness or at the end of life lead to moral distress and can affect nurses’ job satisfaction and burnout.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0969733012466002">7</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0969733012466002"/>

</sup> Nurses frequently experience moral distress due to such issues as ever-changing nature of an intensive care environment, indefinite margin between life and death, and initiating and maintaining life support. One of the issues leading to moral distress is futility.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0969733012466002">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0969733012466002">13</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>Nurses working in intensive care units witness patients’ suffering from pain or agony lasting for weeks or months due to life support application and extensive treatments that are perceived as futile by nurses. Nurses take on new responsibilities due to advances in technology, their roles of a caregiver, and patient advocacy, and thus, they experience moral distress and ethical dilemmas while providing care and treatment for patients.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0969733012466002">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0969733012466002">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0969733012466002">15</xref>
</sup> These ethical dilemmas affect nurses both intellectually and emotionally and lead to burnout.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0969733012466002">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0969733012466002">17</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>In their study, Rice et al.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0969733012466002">18</xref>
</sup> stated that the nurses who witnessed futile treatments suffered extreme moral distress. In a study conducted in our country, it was reported that of the intensive care nurses who provided care for terminally ill patients, 68.1% felt distressed about undertaking their care and 48.9% experienced extreme levels of stress.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0969733012466002">7</xref>
</sup> Meltzer and Huckabay<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0969733012466002">17</xref>
</sup> reported a significant relationship between emotional exhaustion (EE) and frequency of moral distress that intensive care nurses experienced in situations which they perceived as futile treatments. In their study investigating the relationship between perception of futility and moral distress among intensive care unit nurses, Mobley et al.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0969733012466002">13</xref>
</sup> reported that the nurses who considered that they provided futile care suffered extensive moral distress, and that the longer they worked in intensive care units the more distressed they became. If a person’s work stress exceeds his or her coping capabilities or conflicts with his or her beliefs, he or she suffers EE.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0969733012466002">17</xref>
</sup> In their study performed to determine the causes of exhaustion in intensive care nurses, Poncet et al.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0969733012466002">19</xref>
</sup> reported a significant relationship between not applying life-sustaining treatments in intensive care environments and burnout.</p>
<p>There are limited national or international studies investigating the relationship between nurses’ opinions on futility and their job satisfaction and exhaustion levels.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0969733012466002">20</xref>
</sup> Problems regarding the implementation of futility in Turkey are considered as one of the most important and unresolved issues. It is suggested that suffering moral distress repeatedly in intensive care units due to perceptions of futility reflects on nurses’ patient care negatively, which might increase their exhaustion and reduce their job satisfaction. Therefore, studies to reveal how perceptions of futility in an intensive care environment affect exhaustion and job satisfaction of nurses should be carried out. In this context, our study was carried out to investigate the levels of job satisfaction and exhaustion suffered by intensive care nurses and the relationship between job satisfaction and burnout through the futility dimension of the issue.</p>

<title>Methods</title>
<sec id="section3-0969733012466002">
<title>Type of the research</title>
<p>The study is a descriptive one.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0969733012466002">
<title>Study population and study sample</title>
<p>The study comprises 206 nurses working in the intensive care units of three teaching hospitals in a city located in Central Anatolia in Turkey. The data were collected between 1 January 2012 and 1 February 2012. The study was designed as a cross-sectional descriptive study.</p>
<p>The questionnaires were given to nurses responsible for intensive care, and then the study data were collected in the participants’ own environments. The forms were filled in after the nurses who participated in the study were given information about the study, and their written consent forms were obtained. The nurses were told that it was entirely their own decision whether or not to participate in the study, that they were supposed not to write their names on the questionnaire, that the data obtained would only be used within the scope of the study, and that the confidentiality of all personal information would be strictly protected. The nurses handed in the forms to the researchers via the responsible nurse upon filling out the forms. Before the study was conducted, the approval of the ethics committee of Cumhuriyet University Faculty of Medicine Research Ethics Board was received (decision no. 2011/060). The study was performed in accordance with the principles of the Helsinki Declaration.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0969733012466002">
<title>Data collection tools</title>
<p>The data were obtained with three different forms: sociodemographic data and the futility questionnaire, Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI), and Minnesota Satisfaction Questionnaire (MSQ).</p>
<sec id="section6-0969733012466002">
<title>Sociodemographic Data and Futility Questionnaire</title>
<p>The form includes 11 questions on general sociodemographic characteristics and occupational information and 16 questions on futility. Researchers screened the literature regarding futility and designed a three-choice (agree, undecided, and disagree) Likert-type form with nine propositions.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0969733012466002">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0969733012466002">21</xref>

</sup> The pre-application of the 15-item questionnaire regarding the concept and practice of futility was performed on 30 nurses. The items that were not understood or that did not evaluate were removed from the questionnaire, and thus, the questionnaire had nine items. Cronbach’s alpha value of the futility questionnaire was 0.601.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-0969733012466002">
<title>MBI</title>
<p>This scale was used to determine the burnout levels of nurses. The validity and reliability of the Turkish version of the scale developed by Maslach and Jackson<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0969733012466002">26</xref>
</sup> in 1981 were accomplished by Cam.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0969733012466002">27</xref>
</sup> MBI is composed of three subscales and 22 items. The subscales are “Emotional Exhaustion (EE),” “Depersonalization (DPS),” and “Personal accomplishment (PA).” The EE subscale includes nine items, the DPS subscale includes five items, and the PA subscale is composed of eight items. Response options of 22 positive and negative items in this Likert-type scale are as follows: 0: never, 1: very rare, 2: sometimes, 3: most of the time, and 4: always.</p>
<p>Scores of MBI range from 0 to 36 for EE, from 0 to 20 for DPS, and from 0 to 32 for PA, and higher scores of EE and DPS and low scores of PA indicate exhaustion. In Cam’s study,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0969733012466002">27</xref>
</sup> Cronbach’s alpha coefficients for EE, DPS, and PA were reported to be 0.81, 0.70, and 0.77, respectively. In our study, Cronbach’s alpha reliability coefficients for EE, DPS, and PA were 0.88, 0.78, and 0.81, respectively.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-0969733012466002">
<title>MSQ</title>
<p>This questionnaire was used to determine job satisfaction level of nurses. MSQ was developed by Dawis et al., and its reliability and validity of the Turkish version was established by Baycan.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0969733012466002">28</xref>
</sup> Cronbach’s alpha was 0.77 in this study. Individuals are asked to rate their level of satisfaction with each of the 20 work-related needs on a point scale ranging from “not satisfied” (1) to “extremely satisfied” (5). The responses to all 20 items can be summed to produce a general satisfaction score. The scale’s scores range between 1 and 100. Job satisfaction increases as the score increases.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-0969733012466002">
<title>Data analysis</title>
<p>The correlation analysis was used to determine the relationship between the total scores of MSQ and MBI. The significance of the difference between two means test was used to determine the difference between the mean scores of MBI and demographic characteristics such as education, service time, duration of intensive care service, and receiving training related to ethics after graduation working hours. The one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) test was used to determine the difference between the items included in the Futility Questionnaire and the total scores of MSQ and MBI.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-0969733012466002">
<title>Limitation of the study</title>
<p>The study was conducted in the intensive care units of hospitals located in only one province. Therefore, the results cover only these hospitals and cannot be generalized.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-0969733012466002">
<title>Results</title>
<p>Results are given under the following five subtopics: (a) demographic features; (b) futility; (c) job satisfaction; (d) burnout; and (e) the relation between futility, job satisfaction, and burnout.</p>
<sec id="section12-0969733012466002">
<title>Demographic features</title>
<p>The mean age of nurses was 29.17 ± 4.90. Of them, 87.7% were in the age group of 22–34 years, 94.9% were female, 44.2% were married, and 73.9% had bachelor degrees. It was determined that 47.8% of the nurses had been working ≤4 years, and that 65.9% of them had ≤4 years of intensive care unit experience. It was also determined that the majority of the nurses (81.2%) worked in shifts, and that the average number of patients per nurse was 4.36 ± 2.18 (range: 1–15). It was found that 63.0% of the nurses had postgraduate training on intensive care, and 51.4% had postgraduate training on ethical issues (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0969733012466002">Table 1</xref>).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>As a result of the study we conducted to investigate the intensive care nurses' views on futility, job satisfaction, burnout levels and the relationship between them, it can be said that job satisfaction scores the nurses achieved were moderate. Several studies in the international and national literature also report that intensive care nurses have moderate levels of job satisfaction.<sup>

</sup> In this context, our findings are in line with those in the literature. According to the correlation between job satisfaction and burnout, it can be said that there is a weak but significant relationship between these variables, and that nurses who suffer EE and DPS have lower scores for job satisfaction but that nurses whose personal achievement is high have higher levels of job satisfaction.</p>
<p>According to the findings of this study, it can be said that the nurses had moderate levels of EE and personal achievement but high levels of sensitivity. It has been indicated that nurses working in intensive care units in Turkey suffer burnout particularly in the EE subscale.<sup>

</sup>In the literature, it has been reported that as an individual’s age and work experience increase, he or she becomes more interested in his or her profession, adapts to working conditions more, and gains more experience in coping with stress.<sup>

</sup> Mollaoğlu et al.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0969733012466002">42</xref>
</sup> report that nurses having worked longer in their careers experience exhaustion less, whereas especially young nurses who are new in their careers experience DPS more. In some other studies too,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0969733012466002">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0969733012466002">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0969733012466002">43</xref>
</sup> it is stated that with an increase in age and work experience, EE decreases while personal achievement increases.</p>
<p>It can be said that most of the nurses included in the study were young and at the beginning of their professional life, and that they were inexperienced in interventions in intensive care units. Meltzer and Huckabay<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0969733012466002">17</xref>
</sup> reported that younger nurses experienced DPS more than did older nurses. Maslach and Jackson<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0969733012466002">26</xref>
</sup> reported that young health-care providers are more susceptible to burnout than the elderly caregivers.</p>
<p>In this study, those nurses who were younger, with less work experience, and those who had undergraduate education had high EE and DPS scores but low personal achievement scores, which is consistent with the findings in the literature. In our study, it can be said that nurses working in shifts suffered work-related stress and EE more, and thus as the number of shifts the nurses worked increased so did the level of burnout they had. In other studies,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0969733012466002">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0969733012466002">43</xref>
</sup> it was reported that working in shifts increased burnout among nurses. In our study too, nurses working in shifts suffered more EE and DPS and had lower personal achievement scores compared to nurses who regularly work in the daytime, which is consistent with the findings in the literature.</p>
<p>There are very few national or international studies performed on this topic. Therefore, the findings of this study were debated in the light of limited research and literature knowledge. In our study, nurses who considered that futile treatment contributed to an individual’s quality of life minimally had lower EE scores (Proposition 1), which might be due to their opinion that through these treatments, patients suffered from pain/agony less and patients’ human dignity was protected. The finding from Öztürk’s study<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0969733012466002">44</xref>
</sup> that nurses are in conflict with the proposition that invasive treatments and applications provided in intensive care units benefit patients seems to support our finding.</p>
<p>In our study, nurses who agreed to the proposition that provision of futile care demoralized health-care professionals had lower scores for job satisfaction and higher scores for DPS (Proposition 2), which supports the presence of moral distress and moral distress-related burnout among intensive care staff. The main cause of moral distress may be associated with the fact that approaches such as respect for life, instinct to survive, and desire to live play the primary role in the decision-making process. In Faith and Chidwick’s study,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0969733012466002">16</xref>
</sup> it was emphasized that intensive care nurses became demoralized and experienced moderate levels of moral distress when decisions were made to terminate one’s life, which is consistent with our findings. Intensive care units are environments where the staff frequently experience moral distress and thus become demoralized<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0969733012466002">14</xref>
</sup> and have low levels of job satisfaction.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0969733012466002">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0969733012466002">45</xref>
</sup> The vast majority of nurses stated that they became demoralized, which supports the above finding.</p>
<p>It can be said that the majority of the participants agreed to the proposition that every patient has the right to benefit from all the treatments and care provided in the intensive care unit till the last moment of their lives (Proposition 3). When this finding and nurses’ professional values are considered together, it can be proposed that nurses respect patients’ right to receive a dignified and qualified care till the last moment of their lives.</p>
<p>In line with our findings, it can be said that nurses who consider that patients’ or their relatives’ decision is of importance in futile care are more sensitive, have low levels of EE, high levels of personal achievement, and thus high levels of job satisfaction (Proposition 4). This finding may be associated with the fact that nurses consider that patients and their families play the central role in treatment, that nurses share the responsibility, and that they give a primary importance to the patient’s and family’s autonomy. In their study, Öztürk et al.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0969733012466002">46</xref>
</sup> stated that nurses working in intensive care units indicated that patients and their relatives should be included in decision-making processes. In our study and in several others, nurses put patients and their relatives in the first place in decision-making processes; however, the general belief in the health professionals is that physicians have the priority to make a decision about futile treatments. <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0969733012466002">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0969733012466002">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0969733012466002">46</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0969733012466002"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0969733012466002">48</xref>
</sup> Similarly, Carvalho and Lunardi<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0969733012466002">49</xref>
</sup> reported that physicians played a more active role in decision-making processes for futile care, and patients, relatives, or the team had a more limited share in the process.</p>
<p>Nurses who are undecided about the proposition that futile treatment should be implemented in intensive care settings upon the request of family members (Proposition 5) suffer more EE and DPS and have lower levels of personal achievement, which might stem from the fact that nurses’ thoughts on this issue conflict with the existing applications. In Solomon et al.’s study,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0969733012466002">50</xref>
</sup> half of the nurses stated that they acted against their consciences while providing care, and that they administered aggressive therapies that did not serve the purpose. Meltzer and Huckabay<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0969733012466002">17</xref>
</sup> indicated that EE occurs when a person’s appraisal of occupational stressors exceeds his or her coping capabilities, or they conflict with the person’s values and belief system so that he or she cannot cognitively reconcile or cope with the stressors. The fact that nurses who state that futile treatments are not the result of poor communications within the team have higher levels of personal achievements indicates the importance of communication between the team members in personal achievement (Proposition 6). In the literature too, it is stressed that decisions about treatment and care should be made through collaboration within the team.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0969733012466002">46</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0969733012466002">51</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0969733012466002"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0969733012466002">53</xref>
</sup> In addition, in our study, it was observed that nurses who considered that the team’s decision is important for uses of futile treatment were more sensitive (Proposition 7). In studies on intensive care nurses, it has been indicated that there is a strong correlation between the relationships within the team, and job satisfaction and burnout, which is consistent with our findings.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0969733012466002">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0969733012466002">16</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>The nurses who stated that there were no efforts to prevent futile treatment in their units were more sensitive (Proposition 9), which suggests that there exists discomfort on this issue, and there is a need for further studies. This is because, although withholding or withdrawal of life support treatments or applications is supported ethically and medically, it is still a problem in Turkey due to the vagueness of the regulations regarding the conditions and criteria about the use of life support systems. If the policies on this issue are defined more clearly, possible violations of the rights and moral integrity of health-care workers can be prevented.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Our findings suggest that the nurses experienced moderate levels of job satisfaction, EE, and personal achievement but high levels of sensitivity. It can be said that nurses who consider that futile care does not conflict with the purposes of medicine, that patients or their relatives’ demand is important to make the decision on such care, and that futile treatments stem from poor communication within the team have higher levels of job satisfaction. However, nurses who think that futile treatment demoralizes health-care professionals have lower levels of job satisfaction.</p>
<p>It can be said that nurses who consider that futility does not conflict with the purposes of medicine and that the decision on futile care should be made together by patients, relatives, and the team members have higher levels of sensitivity. However, nurses who think that futile treatment demoralizes health-care professionals have high levels of DPS.</p>
<p>This study revealed that futility was one of the factors affecting job satisfaction and burnout experienced by nurses working in intensive care units, and thus, it is expected that it would contribute to the literature since it could raise awareness among health professionals. It can also be said that the study gave magazine readers and literature an important dimension since job satisfaction, burnout, and futility were discussed together. The study can also be used as a guide while national legal regulations about end of life are made. It is recommended that studies that will include different populations and that will improve the validity and reliability of the questionnaire related to futility should be conducted.</p>
