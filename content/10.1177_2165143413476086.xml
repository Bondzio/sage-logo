<p>Iva Dean Cook, charter member and sixth president of the Division on Career Development and Transition (DCDT) of the Council for Exceptional Children (CEC) passed away after a brief illness on October 17, 2012. Her obituary described her as “a much loved wife, mother, grandmother, sister, aunt, and friend.” This memorial tribute to her is an addition to those roles she lived out, that of a much-loved teacher educator and respected colleague.</p>
<p>Iva Dean, a native West Virginian, attended and received both her bachelor’s and master’s degrees from Marshall University and served on the faculty in special education at the West Virginia College of Graduate Studies before retiring as professor emeritus. Prior to her service as a teacher educator, she was instrumental in founding and developing Fairfield School in Huntington, West Virginia. She was among the CEC special interest group members who petitioned the CEC Assembly for the formation of a new division devoted to career development education for students with disabilities and became a charter member. She served as president of DCDT from 1962 to 1983.</p>
<p>Iva Dean’s legacy to teacher education in West Virginia and her vision for providing the best possible services to youths with special needs in the areas of working, living, and learning will endure. She published a teacher’s guide for an occupational notebook program as early as 1972, 4 years before the chartering of DCDT. She coauthored <italic>Serious Business: Volume 4 of Learning Through Reading</italic> in 1988, demonstrating early on the connection between academics and life skills. She was also a coauthor of a 1991 position paper, “Career Development for Students With Disabilities in Elementary Schools: A Position Statement of the Division on Career Development” that embodied her long-term vision for career development and transition education starting at an early age.</p>
<p>DCDT honored Iva Dean’s excellence in teacher education by establishing the Iva Dean Cook Teacher of the Year Award, a prestigious award for teachers in the field who exemplify the advocacy and commitment she had. This honor reflected the deep respect and appreciation of DCDT members for her competence, loyal service, leadership, and graceful and gracious mentoring of teachers and colleagues. She was a special person we will miss but remember with affection.</p>
