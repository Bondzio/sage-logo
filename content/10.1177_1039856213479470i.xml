<p>The Indian Psychiatric Society recently awarded 10 International Young Psychiatrist Fellowships to attend their 65<sup>th</sup> Annual Conference in Bangalore (ANCIPS) from the 10<sup>th</sup> to the 13<sup>th</sup> of January 2013. The Fellowship provided an honorarium, accommodation, meals and conference registration. Psychiatric Colleges, Societies and Associations from around the world were invited to nominate a psychiatrist under the age of 40 to be considered for the Fellowship. I had the good fortune to be the RANZCP nominee. Ten young psychiatrists from the USA, UK, Italy, Czech Republic, Russia Thailand, Indonesia, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, including myself from Australia, were selected to attend the conference.</p>
<p>Under the leadership of the President of the Indian Psychiatric Association, Professor Roy Kallivayalil, a special young psychiatrists track was developed for the Annual Conference in Bangalore. Sessions included training in research methodology, developing research proposals, grant writing, research ethics and how to get published, presented by esteemed psychiatrists from India (Professors Andrade and Jain), the UK (Dr Dave) and the USA (including the American Psychiatric Association President Dr Dilip Jeste and Professor Tandon).</p>

<p>Each Fellowship awardee was invited to give an oral presentation at the conference. I presented recent work on frequency protocols for ECT that I conducted with my colleagues at the Queensland Centre for Mental Health Research and Metro South Mental Health Services in Queensland. Professor Norman Sartorius took on a mentoring role for the Fellowship awardees, providing feedback on our presentations and advice about how to build on this experience.</p>
<p>The conference had a strong Indian cultural program including dance and music. As a fan of South Indian cuisine, I was in paradise with a seemingly endless supply of dosas, idli and uttapam.</p>
<p>The conference was held on the grounds of the Indian National Institute of Mental Health and Neuro-Sciences (NIMHANS). NIMHANS is a sprawling campus with psychiatric inpatient and outpatient units, a recovery and rehabilitation unit and a new Ayurvedic treatment centre. Psychiatrists from NIMHANS were generous in providing campus tours for the Fellowship awardees, providing an insight into the delivery of mental health services in India. NIMHANS is at the forefront of mental health research. Visiting the facility allowed me to strengthen existing research collaborations with clinical academic psychiatrists from NIMHANS.</p>
<p>The highlight for me was talking with and learning from the other Fellowship awardees. The Fellowship awardees have a breadth of clinical and research interests, ranging from child and adolescent psychiatry, informatics, intellectual impairment and temporal lobe epilepsy. Their personal experiences, clinical insights and camaraderie made for an enriching experience.</p>
<p>I am deeply grateful to Dr Kallivayalil and the Indian Psychiatric Association for awarding me a Young Psychiatrist Fellowship and providing me the opportunity to attend ANCIPS, visit NIMHANS and learn from the other Fellowship awardees.</p>
