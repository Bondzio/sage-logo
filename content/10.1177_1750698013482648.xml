<abstract>
<p>This article concerns itself with exploring some of the ways in which we can move beyond the ‘cognitive bias’ within social memory studies. A key obstacle to engaging with the kinds of manifestations of remembering that cannot be reduced to intentional and conscious articulations or representations of the mediated past is a deeply entrenched opposition between representational and non-representational (or declarative and non-declarative) mnemonic practices. It strikes me that this opposition is, at least partially, a product of early thinking on memory and trauma, in which affect and representation were opposed to each other, and the notion of non-representational memory was subsumed in the idea of the traumatic. In this article, I intend to try out the idea of ‘more-than-representational’ coined in the field of human geography to reach out to mnemonic processes and practices that operate on various levels not fully reducible to cognition, with the products of these processes exceeding representational form (rather than being completely outside or beyond it).</p>

<body>
<p>This is what I remember now – <italic>remember</italic> in Australia of all places, where I have lived for over 20 years. I am in my grandmother’s one-bedroom flat in the Ukrainian town of Kharkov where I grew up. My grandmother, my memory tells me, is an old woman. I am vaguely pre-pubescent. I eat a sandwich with sausage and cheese, and crumbs fall on the plastic tablecloth. My grandmother picks the crumbs up and puts them in her mouth, one by one. ‘Jesus Christ’, I think to myself – or some kind of Soviet–Ukrainian pre-pubescent equivalent. ‘My grandmother is a freak’. I take the remainder of my sandwich into the lounge-room, away from her. She follows me silently and picks the crumbs up off the floor. There are not that many, trust me, but she finds them all.</p>
<p>I remember the methodical manner in which my grandmother hunted out those crumbs, the way she carried each crumb to her mouth and the sickly feeling of unease that would rise up in me every time I sensed the force of her compulsion. In her book on second-generation Holocaust survivors, the late Australian linguist and second-generation survivor <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1750698013482648">Ruth Wajnryb (2001)</xref> wrote, ‘children can smell narrative the way airport police dogs can smell drugs. And they are drawn to it in the same way’. I <italic>smelt</italic> it, yes, but I had no idea what I was smelling. And so I filed this memory away under the ‘inexplicable behaviour of family members’ category.</p>
<p>It was only when my family – minus the grandmother who did not come with us – immigrated to Australia in 1990 that this memory became unhinged. It was in Melbourne, following the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, that I sat in the city’s State Library and read about all kinds of things I had no idea about, including the Ukrainian famine of the 1930s. No one had ever told me. Not at school and not at home. The artificially engineered genocidal famine – known in Ukrainian as <italic>holodomor</italic>, ‘death by starvation’ – in which millions died, was, for the duration of my childhood and adolescence, written out of history. My grandmother certainly never breathed a word about it to me. This is what it all meant: this was how my grandmother carried the memory of her survival. She did it against the thick public silence in which the history of the famine – determinedly and vastly murderous in its intent – was buried. She did it <italic>with</italic> her body and <italic>with</italic> her silences and <italic>with</italic> her habitual persecution of those like me who could not imagine – who had, more to the point, no need to imagine – what real hunger felt like. She was deeply grateful, no doubt, for the extent of my ignorance. And she was furious with me for it too.</p>
<p>This past – buried, secreted away – lived inside of me, preserved in the memory I had not understood till that moment at the library. It occurred to me then that for decades I carried the memory of my grandmother’s obsession with crumbs like a drug mule carries heroin in a tightly packed condom submerged in her intestines and then one day, in sunny, faraway Australia, this memory exploded in me. Or perhaps I carried this memory like a latent virus, unaware that I had it in the first place, and in that way, for decades, I was not the author of my memories, not even their keeper, but merely their unwitting host.</p>
<p>What to make of this surge of memory taking <italic>place</italic> in Australia – the country, where food had come to reign supreme on TV, where famous chefs, for the moment at least, were more famous than famous rock musicians and where top-selling books were almost uniformly about food? How is it that I was (finally) able to remember my grandmother’s dance with the crumbs in this place unmarked by famines and endemic food shortages? Perhaps, the self-evidently vast distance between the Ukraine and Australia was <italic>not</italic>, after all, unbridgeable. In both cultures, in both historical moments, food operated as something of a cultural cipher, a special language, in which important conversations, public and private, were being conducted.</p>
<p>Of course, mnemonic encoding and decoding – intentional and not – is part of every family’s inter-generational patterns of transmission. We are passed on our family’s history not merely as a collection of stories and artefacts but also as what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1750698013482648">Eva Hoffman (2005)</xref> calls ‘emanations’ that are always on the verge of ‘erupting in flashes of imagery’ (p. 9). This is what I think <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1750698013482648">Marianne Hirsch (2008)</xref> is talking about when, in seeking to elucidate the notion of prosthetic or post-memory, she directs us to view post-memory not as an ‘<italic>identity</italic> position but a <italic>generational</italic> structure of transmission’ (p. 114). What is being transmitted, as Hirsch is at pains to point out, is always more – much more – than an archive of processed and explicitly articulated memories. And when what is being transmitted happens to be, say, an inexplicable but persistently repetitive gesture or an embodied, habitual practice that carries within it a history that cannot be voiced or that must be forgotten, how we think of transmission itself – the way memory might move and be made to move between generations – is inevitably altered. Within such an extended frame, notions of encoding and decoding<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1750698013482648">1</xref></sup> could be a useful way of conceptualising a mode of engagement with memories that could only be made meaningful decades later (when a child becomes an adult, for instance) or that can only be fully accessed <italic>somewhere else</italic>, away from their original location. It is significant, I think, that I remembered my grandmother’s crumbs in Australia, as far away as one could get from her life – physically, symbolically and geopolitically – and its many (I imagine now) secrets.</p>
<p>Bread, of course, figures persistently in what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1750698013482648">Carol A. Kidron (2012)</xref> calls ‘intergenerationally transmitted practices of survival’ (p. 203). In her research on survivor households, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1750698013482648">Kidron (2012)</xref> notes that ‘the great majority of second- and third-generation interviewees recounted bread-related survivor practices’ (p. 203). She quotes one such interviewee, Chana, whose parents were Holocaust survivors:<disp-quote>
<p>Bread was the most holy object in the house. They almost worshipped it. Every piece they ate was like … I don’t know … like reliving the moment they almost died of hunger and were saved by <italic>that piece of bread</italic> … that meant that you eat old bread until it’s dry and then turn it into toast, then bread crumbs, which become meatballs … and then when the bread crumbs are stale you feed it to the birds … (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1750698013482648">Kidron, 2012</xref>: 203)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>My grandmother was a different kind of a survivor – one who was forced into accepting the unspeakability of her experiences by the forbiddingly high price of remembering in the country where she was born. Yet, I can see now that her behaviour mirrored that of Chana’s parents, except that, unlike Chana, I had no interpretative context for what my grandmother did and no sense at all of a diffused community of survivors of war and famine in the world beyond my grandmother’s flat doing what my grandmother was doing – worshipping bread, and torturing (in a manner of speaking) their kids and grandkids along the way.</p>
<p>I tell this story here because three decades later, I cannot think of a better reminder of how much is being missed when we think about the intrapersonal forms of remembering and transmission either in exclusively declarative and representational terms or as profoundly overshadowed by trauma. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1750698013482648">Anne Fuchs (2002</xref>: 237) points to an ‘over-narrativizing of memory’ in much work on social memory. ‘The emphasis on narrativity’, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1750698013482648">Fuchs (2002)</xref> argues,<disp-quote>
<p>has ultimately produced an assimilationist theory of cultural memory which fails to take account of alternative modes of cultural transmission that communicate through the unsaid, the sous- entendu, through innuendo, and silence. (p. 235)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>A further point must be made here: we stand to lose a great deal if we choose to view these <italic>alternative modes of cultural transmission</italic> as primarily traumatic manifestations and residues.</p>

<title>‘More-than-declarative’/‘more-than-representational’</title>
<p>Cognitive scientists (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1750698013482648">Eichenbaum, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1750698013482648">Schacter, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1750698013482648">Squire, 1992</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1750698013482648">2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1750698013482648">Squire and Zola, 1996</xref>) have long since distinguished between declarative and non-declarative processes and memory systems within individuals. They have found that different parts and functions within the human brain are responsible for these systems. To simplify, <italic>declarative</italic> memory describes our remembering of whole bodies of conceptual information, which underlie our general knowledge about the world (otherwise known as semantic memory), <italic>and</italic> accessing whatever of our lived lives is available for our conscious retrieval (otherwise known as autobiographical or episodic memory). In contrast, <italic>non-declarative</italic> memory systems process patterns of perception, emotion and action ‘without representing the past in terms of any consciously accessible content’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1750698013482648">Davis, 2001</xref>). Perhaps we can fruitfully think about declarative and non-declarative memory as <italic>explicit</italic> and <italic>implicit</italic>, with <italic>explicit</italic> memory being accessible to consciousness, while <italic>implicit</italic> memory is expressed and decoded in ways that eschew conscious recall and representation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1750698013482648">Graf and Masson, 1993</xref>). Non-declarative memory, in other words, is hard-coded into us: it snakes its way into our individual hardware. The best-known kinds of non-declarative memory are <italic>procedural</italic> – what philosophers such as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1750698013482648">Henri Bergson (1988)</xref> referred to as ‘habit memory’ (<italic>memoire-habitude</italic>) – and <italic>traumatic</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1750698013482648">2</xref></sup> Philosopher <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1750698013482648">Paul Ricoeur (2004)</xref> notes that ‘in the case of habit what is acquired is incorporated into the living present, unmarked, unremarked as past’ (p. 24). Our living present, as individuals and members of families as well as all kinds of cultural and transcultural communities, is similarly infused with memories, which remain <italic>unmarked, unremarked</italic> as memories.</p>
<p>The opposition between declarative and non-declarative or representational and non-representational memory pervades, and shapes much of the current scholarship on social, cultural and now transcultural forms and processes of remembering. The dominance of this opposition is, at least partially, a product of early thinking on memory and trauma, in which affect and representation were opposed to each other and the notion of non-representational memory was subsumed in the idea of the traumatic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1750698013482648">Bennett, 2003</xref>). Indeed, there is, I feel, a sort of two-speed economy when it comes to the current research culture. On one hand, mnemonic processes, products and traces that escape or defy representational forms and practices are generally understood through – or as belonging to – trauma cultures (and these are often explored with reference to affect, ethics, aesthetics, body, haunting repression and forgetting). On the other hand, outside of the intensely complex and far-reaching trauma framework, much of the research on social memory treats memory sites and memory media as essentially reducible to intentional and conscious articulations and/or representations of the mediated past. These representations are often viewed as complex, diffused, contested, constantly evolving and multiply mediated, but, as a rule, research not directly informed by trauma theory does evince a strong tendency towards the cognitive bias. It is this bias that informs a great deal of contemporary research and writing on memory in Australia and beyond.</p>
<p>The question of how we can move beyond the implicit opposition between representational and non-representational mnemonic practices strikes me as particularly urgent. At a bare minimum, we need a language to talk about mnemonic practices and processes that are neither merely representational nor merely non-representational but that are both at the same time and in the same discursive location. Yes, I am thinking here about my grandmother’s crumbs. This is why, for the want of a better term, I intend to borrow the notions of ‘more-than-declarative’ and ‘more-than-representational’ from the field of human geography (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1750698013482648">Lorimer, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1750698013482648">McCormack, 2003</xref>). My objective in this act of cautious appropriation is to try to give a tentative name to mnemonic processes and practices that operate on various levels not fully reducible to cognition, with the products of these processes exceeding representational form rather than being completely outside or beyond it.</p>
<p>There is, of course, a whole host of reasons to explain why, in thinking about the social dimensions of memory, we may want to stay well away from extending our focus beyond the declarative and representational domains. For one, it is hard to conceive how exactly we can move beyond the cognitive bias within social and cultural memory studies without reigniting and replaying yet again the debate about whether there is, in fact, such a thing as social memory or whether, rather, there are, simply collections of individual memories, or individual’s remembering in socially inscribed settings and frameworks. At the same time, a great deal of energy in the last decade or so was spent on taking the metaphor out of social and cultural memory. How then can we embrace the forms, practices and products of ‘more-than-representational’ kinds of social remembering without going back to trading in metaphors? In other words, how can we avoid treating the notion of cultural memory as if it possessed an infinite semantic elasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1750698013482648">Berliner, 2005</xref>)?</p>
<p>The idea of more-than-representational forms of mnemonic processes and exchanges is one way of thinking of transmission in terms that are not delineated by the opposition between trauma and cognition, between affect and representation. Philosopher <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1750698013482648">Edward Casey (1987)</xref> suggests we should thicken our understanding of memory:<disp-quote>
<p>‘thick’ as it applies to matters of memory means centrally: possessing depth not easily penetrable by the direct line of consciousness […]; resistant to conceptual understanding; sedimented in layers (as occurs when an entire set of memories clusters around a particular place) and having ‘historical depth’. (p. 265)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>This thickness also refers to temporal density, concentrated emotional significance and a particular ‘coarse’ texture produced by ‘the overlay of successive rememberings’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1750698013482648">Casey, 1987</xref>: 266). This type of ‘thick’ memory is clearly more-than-representational rather than merely non-representational – it does not negate cognitive processes involved in the transmission of memory but it suggests that some aspects of the transmission are pre-cognitive or inaccessible to cognition, and that forms and acts of mnemonic transmission could be declarative and affective simultaneously. Naming could be one example of this convergence. Historian <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1750698013482648">Rachel Buchanan (2011)</xref> points out that in her native New Zealand, for generations, the history of colonial violence has been remembered through – and encoded in – Maori children’s names. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1750698013482648">Jeanne Gheith (2007)</xref> tells a story of a Gulag survivor, who did not say a single word to a soul about a decade he spent in a Gulag, but who, upon his release, got himself a German shepherd and called him Stalin. ‘Sit, Stalin!’, he would shout, ‘Fetch, Stalin!’</p>
<p>Of course, transmission and reception do not operate in a linear fashion: a representational memory can be – and often is – received affectively. In that sense, the notion of ‘more-than-representational’ seems much more self-evident in relation to the reception, rather than the transmission of memory. Yet, the idea of ‘more-than-representational’ as applied to all facets and sides of mnemonic encounters and exchanges demands of us that we enlarge our understanding of both what can be remembered <italic>and</italic> what can be transmitted. It also demands of me that, as I re-remember my grandmother’s relationship with the crumbs, I recognise that her fixation on bread was a way of remembering (in the complicated way we have discussed) not only her survival and the death of so many others but also her childhood, the struggles of her parents and other histories that will remain forever unknown to me.</p>

<title>Mnemospheres</title>
<p>When Carol A. Kidron began talking to descendants of Holocaust survivors about their parents’ past, she initially hit a wall. They knew little, virtually nothing, they said. Their parents never properly told them about what had happened to them and their kin. Then, instead of asking at the start, ‘What do you know about your parents’ past?’, Kidron started asking, ‘Was the past present in your home?’ From that point on, she ‘received rich, emotively powerful accounts, lasting two to three hours, of the non-verbal forms of the Holocaust presence’ (Kidron, 2003: 200) By freeing herself from the idea of what she was looking for – of <italic>what</italic>, in fact, could be transmitted within families – Kidron (2003) managed to get to what she calls ‘other channels of “remembrance” ’: embodied practices and behaviours, parent–child silent facework, person–object interaction, gestures, fragments of stories and, of course, silences that functioned as ‘a container – milieu – gateway that facilitated the movement into the past, into the otherwise sublime deathworld and lost pre-war life-world’ (pp. 193, 202).</p>
<p>In her study of the descendants of Holocaust survivors, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1750698013482648">Ruth Wajnryb (2001)</xref> noted that the majority of people she had spoken to did not remember being told about their parents’ history. Being born into their particular family meant that they were born knowing. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1750698013482648">Wajnryb (2001)</xref> called this kind of memory ‘an oblique knowledge, more a sensing at a visceral or subconscious rather than a cognitive level’ (pp. 135–136). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1750698013482648">Eva Hoffman (2005)</xref>, whose parents also survived the Holocaust, notes the nature of the recurring but never elaborated memory ‘episodes’ in her household: ‘compressed, packed, sharp’. This form was central to the language of memory in her family and to the manner in which it was transmitted across generations:<disp-quote>
<p>For it was precisely the indigestibility of these utterances, their fearful weight of densely packed feeling, as much as any specific content, that I took in as a child. The fragmentary phrases lodged themselves in my mind like shards, like the deadly needles I remember from certain fairytales, which pricked your flesh and could never be extracted again.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>We are habituated to thinking about such accounts as central exemplars of cross-generational traumatisation in our culture. Yet, if we view what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1750698013482648">Marianne Hirsch (2008</xref>: 112) calls ‘nonverbal and non-cognitive acts of transfer’ within a familial space exclusively through the lens of the traumatic, then we run a risk of misrecognising something central about memory itself. My story about my grandmother strikes me as revealing something structurally inherent not to the transmission of trauma but to the transmission of memory itself, which is to say that often memory is transmitted <italic>and</italic> received discursively and affectively at the same time.</p>
<p>Certainly, in the case of my grandmother, to understand her behaviour – her silence coupled with her fixation on bread crumbs – as merely an example of traumatic, embodied recall in the face of the unspeakability of her trauma is to misunderstand the very core of her experience. In the Soviet Union, the public and private silences surrounding traumatic memories were not a manifestation of un-worked-through trauma and of one’s experience defying articulation. Silence was a necessary strategy for survival not just for individuals but for their families and social circles as well. As I write elsewhere,<disp-quote>
<p>Silence as a coping mechanism is very different, if not entirely extraneous, to silence as an outright psychic repression. Silence which is consciously chosen by parents to protect their children from the dire and tangible consequences of knowing something undesirable about family history, is not the same as silence which functions as, primarily, a reflection of deep fear or shame. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1750698013482648">Tumarkin, 2009</xref>: 7)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Silence around trauma, in other words, does not have to be the same as traumatic silence. And in the face of my grandmother’s silence, her relationship with crumbs can be seen, for instance, as a way of <italic>coping</italic>, rather than <italic>acting out</italic>. This is not to say that my grandmother was not traumatised, but that her actions and habits cannot be properly understood through the prism of trauma theory.</p>
<p>For <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1750698013482648">Kidron (2012)</xref>, the routinised interpretation as trauma of the absence of a coherent narrative to be passed on to children and grandchildren by their survivor parents stops us from paying attention to a different channel of transmission operating in survivor households. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1750698013482648">Kidron (2012)</xref> describes it as ‘the tacit, non-pathological, yet no less constitutive impact of the past in the survivor home’ (p. 193). What she is trying to get at, I think, is what philosopher <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1750698013482648">Edward Casey (1987)</xref> called ‘an active immanence of the past’ (p. 149). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1750698013482648">Casey (1987)</xref> was talking about a kind of bodily remembering ‘that informs present bodily actions in an efficacious, orienting and regular manner’ (p. 149), but it is, I believe, possible – and necessary – to imagine this <italic>active immanence of the past</italic> as inhabiting and structuring not just bodies, but places and spaces between them, as, in fact, characterising certain sites and forms of social life.</p>
<p>Let me explain. Contemporary Russian historian <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1750698013482648">Irina Sherbakova (2005)</xref> describes the disappearance of the memory of the Second World War in contemporary Russian society, where today’s adolescents are ‘the last generation that has the possibility of encountering the living carriers of communicable memory’. However, it is clear that it is not just the survivors who are disappearing. With the survivors, the whole world is disappearing as well – the world in which memory and knowledge of what happened in the Soviet Union in the 1920s, 1930s and 1940s were an unspoken, or barely spoken, part of every conversation. Soon today’s teenagers, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1750698013482648">Sherbakova (2005)</xref> writes, will have no access to<disp-quote>
<p>those things that in the past decades their parents would take out of the air, from the drunken narrative, from the eternal question – and which year are you from (this question meant almost the most important thing – were you part of it or not, did you fight in the war or not) – those things have practically disappeared by now.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Sherbakova is not being poetic when she writes about all manner of knowing and remembering being taken out of the ‘air’. In fact, she is simply describing a particular shared historical reality, and in doing so, she focuses our attention on the transmission of memory across generations (but not only) that happens in ways that are distinctly pre-cognitive. In other words, we are asked to consider memory matter that slips under the cognitive threshold and never quite reaches the level of a declaration or a representation, but is, in fact, a defining feature of a particular time or a place.</p>
<p>We talk about mnemonic processes, practices and products, but to what extent, I wonder, is it possible to conceive of culturally specific, historically grounded, constantly changing mnemospheres? If, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1750698013482648">Jeff Olick’s (2007)</xref> illuminating observation suggests, memory ‘is not a result of social forms; it is their very medium’ (p. 2), this very medium – its texture, carrying capacity and interaction with other media – is necessarily defined by its dual inhabitancy of both sides of the cognitive divide. Mnemospheres could exist at the level of a household or a generation (especially if this generation is marked by a historical cataclysm) or, perhaps, an entire culture in a specific historical moment.</p>

<title>Back to encoding (where I am from)</title>
<p>‘Different forms of remembering’, writes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1750698013482648">Jeff Olick (2007)</xref>, ‘not only characterise different epochs but also are fundamental features of existence in them’ (p. 1). I was born in a place, where archives, museums, textbooks, memorials, public speeches, legal systems, media, commemorations, songs, street names, historic sites and graves – all these things so routinely and unproblematically called upon in countless studies of memory as if they are somehow ‘natural’ or ‘innate’ forms of social life found wherever there is a society – were comprehensively hijacked by the state machinery and ideological imperatives. I escaped that place, or rather, I (and the whole world with me) watched that place implode some 20 odd years ago. By that time, my family was already in Australia, and my grandmother was about to die. That place where we were from was the only one she ever really knew.</p>
<p>What <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1750698013482648">Anne Fuchs (2002)</xref> calls ‘alternative forms of cultural transmission’ (p. 235) can be seen perhaps most clearly in totalitarian states, where the public articulation and circulation of memories of the past could – and did, countless times over – result in people ending up incarcerated or killed and where socially meaningful and shared memories often persisted and survived in encoded forms. The comprehensive assault on people’s shared memories of the past as well as on the individual’s ability to articulate and transmit their own memories was one of the <italic>fundamental features of existence</italic> in the Soviet Union, but so were all kinds of subterranean flows and technologies of memory – a kind of a memory ‘greynet’.</p>
<p>Alongside the idea of mnemospheres, practices of inter-generational encoding and decoding allow us to give some shape to our discussion of the more-than-representational forms of remembering and transmission. Indeed, for the 70 years of its existence, the Soviet Union produced multiple sites of mnemonic encoding of disavowed historical narratives. The most central of those sites were literary texts, films and songs. In these and other kinds of artistic work, distant history was used to speak about the recent, living, unfinished past. Shared and recognisable memories were planted and buried deep in texts, sealed inside metaphors, allusions, parables and irony. Stories were told about seemingly <italic>other</italic> places and <italic>other</italic> times. Texts encoded in these ways functioned, among other things, as deep mnemonic triggers, reminding people about what they actually remembered and giving a form of enduring legitimacy to memories that did not accord with the public narratives of the past.</p>
<p>This type of encoding was of course about keeping memories alive through condensed, displaced and symbolic modes of representation, but memories so encoded were marked by an affective force field. The process of decoding them, of wrestling a story out of a secret, necessarily generated an enduring affective response. Contemporary Russian cultural critic <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1750698013482648">Natalia Ivanova (1997)</xref> notes that as part of the development of Aesopian language in Soviet literature (the same could be said for other artistic genres), a contract was forged between the reader and the writer:<disp-quote>
<p>So as to have an adequate understanding of authorial intent, the reader was asked for the most attentive kind of listening to the author’s voice, the slow reading into the text, the thoughtful comparison of the text with the external reality and our history.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1750698013482648">Ivanova (1997)</xref> quotes an interview given in 1974 by Yuri Trifonov, one of the most respected Soviet writers of his time: ‘It seems to me that the contemporary reader is so magnetised with all kinds of associations, that it enough to say one word to him – and he will fill in the rest with his imagination’. <italic>Magnetised</italic> is an illuminating word here, as it suggests that readers were asked to work with cultural codes both discursively and affectively – to think and feel their way to the unmentionable truth.</p>
<p>In that same interview, Trifonov noted that the author’s position and their attitude to all manner of things could be clearly and convincingly expressed ‘in homeopathic doses – a smile, a half-smile, pauses and the unsaid’. In the Soviet public sphere, memory could be articulated and transmitted only in such <italic>homeopathic doses</italic>. It was not just <italic>what</italic> was said – it was <italic>how</italic> it was said. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1750698013482648">Svetlana Boym (2008)</xref> draws our attention to ‘the tactics of intonation and the uses of blemish, human error, mimicry, and minor gift exchanges that mark unofficial solidarities and elective affinities’ (p. 345). Most shared memories of the Soviet and pre-Soviet past were not lodged inside particular narratives about the distant or recent past. Instead, they resembled a colony of fleas, capable of attaching themselves to the skin of pre-packaged, approved narratives and thus of being carried to places they otherwise could not have entered. Memory could only be injected in the public sphere in homeopathic doses, concealed in the intonation and in the skin folds of stories that dutifully reiterated the official versions of the past.</p>
<p>I have used the Soviet experience here (however briefly) as a way of conjuring up more-than-representational memory out in the world, because certain kinds of processes are simply more visible in totalitarian or autocratic societies in the conspicuous absence of other, more normative, sites and practices of memory. While encoding and decoding were the primary forms for the preservation and transmission of cultural memory in the Soviet Union, my grandmother’s relationship with crumbs is, to me, an example of another kind – or, perhaps, another level – of encoding and decoding. <italic>Deep</italic> encoding is a process, by which people’s memories were preserved, communicated and transmitted inter-generationally through their attitudes to food, knowledge, neighbours, authority and other people. Of course, in other contexts, these kinds of embodied and inter-corporeal behaviours and attitudes that carry with them a heavy imprint of the individual and shared past have frequently been labelled as ‘acting out’. Yet, ‘acting out’, generally speaking, presupposes an inability to remember and, crucially, an inability to mourn. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1750698013482648">Gabrielle Schwab (2010)</xref>, for instance, draws on Derrida’s notion of cryptonymy to suggest that the ‘creation of cryptic enclaves in language marks the traces of refused mourning’ (p. 4).</p>
<p>Yet, these kinds of ideas can only be fully satisfying if we think of non-pathological remembering exclusively in the declarative/representational framework as necessarily producing particular kinds of contents and practices. In this framework to remember is to turn the past into a series of discreet and tellable – even if sometimes indefinitely withheld or untold – narratives. However, what happens to this widely accepted distinction between reclaiming the past by means of narrativizing our memory <italic>or</italic> acting out if we allow the possibility of more-than declarative remembering, if we do not buy into the opposition between trauma and cognition, representation and affect? I am, in other words, advocating here the kind of research that will work to foreground ‘processes that take cognition (and emotion) out of the head at the same time as they “mess up” structural accounts of collective memory with bodies, feelings, and experience’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1750698013482648">White, 2006</xref>: 326).</p>
<p>The truth, as I know it, is that much of the memory in the world is transmitted in thrillingly complex ways. We leave the past to our children and grandchildren not only as a series of stories, artefacts and silences but as lingering questions that may remain unanswered – and unasked – for lifetimes. To decode the memory of my grandmother’s crumb-hunting all those years later, far, far away from her kitchen, was to remember anew my grandmother’s fingers – this time, with a deep, piercing sadness, instead of a fickle irritation. It was, for the very first time, to remember my grandmother with love.</p>

<p>On some level, these processes can be seen as a version of what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1750698013482648">Stuart Hall (1980)</xref> described in his seminal 1973 essay ‘Encoding/Decoding’. In this instance, the memory is the media and the processes are played out at the level of a family.</p>

<p>We could think of procedural memory as simply ‘the body knows’ type of memory – when, say, our fingers can dial a phone number that we cannot consciously recall or our legs can take us to the place our brain cannot locate in space. In fact, in many of these situations, conscious attempt to recall something could be an inhibiting factor. Scientists and philosophers alike call this the memory of ‘knowing how’, as opposed to ‘knowing that’.</p>
