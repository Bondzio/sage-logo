<p>Reinforced tantalum carbide particles were synthesized between tantalum wires and graphite in gray cast iron by heat treatment; the effects of different heat treatment times on the phase evolution, microstructure, and micro-hardness of the composites were investigated. The particles obtained were small and square-shaped, 1–2 µm in size, and evenly distributed through the cast iron. The maximum micro-hardness of the composite region was 1832 HV<sub>0.1</sub>. After 20 min heat treatment, the micro-hardness decreased to approximately 1077 HV<sub>0.1</sub>, between about four and five times that of the matrix. The resulting composites also presented higher wear resistance compared with unreinforced gray cast iron.</p>

<p>Iron-based composites containing transition group carbide particles are the application materials of choice when good wear resistance and high-temperature properties are required.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0021998311412832">1</xref></sup> There are many ways of fabricating carbide ceramic particulate-reinforced Fe-based composites, including traditional powder metallurgy,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0021998311412832">2</xref></sup><sup>–</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0021998311412832">4</xref></sup> conventional casting,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0021998311412832">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0021998311412832">6</xref></sup> self-propagating high-temperature synthesis,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0021998311412832">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0021998311412832">8</xref></sup> in situ techniques,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0021998311412832">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0021998311412832">10</xref></sup> and so on. Among these, the in situ reaction technique has been considered to be one of the most promising methods for the production of metal matrix composites, because of the fine size and thermodynamic stability of the ceramic particulates in the matrix and a strong interfacial bonding between the reinforcement and the matrix, providing higher mechanical properties.</p>
<p>Tantalum carbide with high melt temperature 3880°C, high hardness, thermodynamic stability, corrosion resistance, and high anti-oxidation, have been widely used in cutting tools and abrasive substance.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0021998311412832">11</xref></sup> Berthod et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0021998311412832">12</xref></sup> studied the content and distribution of tantalum carbide in low alloy steel with 3%−6% Ta and 30% Cr, which received heat treatment in different temperatures. Xia and Jin<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0021998311412832">13</xref></sup> studied the diffusion behavior of the hybrid boundary of the explosive welding between tantalum plate and steel plate with 0.2 wt % C in different heat treatment temperatures. The reaction between tantalum and carbon depended on carbon diffusion. It can be seen that tantalum carbide is one of the suitable reinforcements in iron matrix composites due to its high hardness and high chemical stability. If tantalum carbide is added exteriorly as a kind of particulate reinforcement, the reinforcing effect is weak due to the poor compatibility and large different in thermal expansion coefficient between tantalum carbide particles and the matrix. The volume fraction is small, and particle sizes are large and not easily distributed in the matrix. Moreover, it is difficult to get a high volume fraction and well-distributed composite because of serious particle segregation.</p>
<p>The present study investigates the feasibility of in situ fabrication of fine tantalum carbide particulate-reinforced iron matrix composites by combining infiltration casting and heat treatment. The purpose of the present study is to explore the possibility of preparing tantalum carbide particle-reinforced iron matrix composites via a novel in situ reaction procedure; the preliminary results are discussed here in detail. The morphology, size, and distribution behavior of tantalum carbide particles, as well as the wear resistance of the composites, are analyzed.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec2-0021998311412832" sec-type="methods"><title>Experimental procedure</title>
<p>The starting materials were gray cast iron and tantalum wires (Ø 0.4 mm) with 99.99% purity. They were employed as carbon and tantalum sources for in situ synthesis of tantalum carbides within the iron matrix. The chemical composition (wt %) of gray cast iron is Fe – 4.22C – 0.58Si – 0.268Mn – 0.224P – 0.024S.</p>
<p>Gray cast iron was melted by Medium Frequency Induction Furnace at 1450°C, then cast into the graphite crucible, and tantalum carbide particulate-reinforced iron matrix composites was prepared by the infiltration casting process. Firstly, micro tantalum wires are set in a casting pattern using the infiltration casting process in the procedure. Then, tantalum wires are in situ reacted with carbon elements in the matrix by heat treatment to form tantalum carbide particle-reinforced composite gray cast iron. Specimens with size 10 mm × 10 mm × 25 mm were cut with a Numerical Control Wire-Cut EDM machine (Suzhou Nutac Electro Mechanic Co. Ltd., China) after natural cooling in the furnace. According to the differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) results, the sectioned samples were subjected to heat treatment at 1165°C for 10, 15, 20, and 25 min in a horizontal tube furnace with a modest flow of argon and cooled down to room temperature naturally.</p>
<p>After being polished with diamond paste and etched with a 4% Nital solution, the microstructure of the specimens was examined using a JSM-5800 scanning electron microscope (JEOL, Japan) equipped with energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS). The X-ray diffraction (XRD) data were recorded on a PW 1730 X-ray diffractometer (Philips, The Netherlands) with monochromated CuK<sub>α</sub> radiation at 40 kV and 40 mA in the 2θ range of 10–90°. Micro-hardness of the specimens was measured by a HDX-1000 digital micro-hardness tester, which consisted of a square-based pyramidal diamond indenter with a 136° angle between two opposite faces. The static load was 100 g and the dwell time of loading was 15 s. An average value of micro-hardness was taken from at least five different measurements. To determine the pouring temperature of the gray cast iron melt, DSC/thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) analysis was performed on a Q600 SDT (TA Instruments, USA) for the sample having a size 2.5 mm × 2.5 mm × 2.5 mm prepared using gray cast iron and tantalum wire. The specimen was heated at 10°C/min up to a maximum temperature of 1400°C with a 150 ml/min flow rate of argon gas and then cooled down to room temperature.</p>
<p>The specimen was cut to the size of Ø 6 × 25 mm for the abrasive wear test. The test was carried out on an ML-100 wear test machine (Zhangjiakou Xuan Ke Testing Machine Manufacturing Co. Ltd., China). Abrasion tests were carried out using a pin-on-disc apparatus. The flat cylinder was loaded through a vertical specimen holder against a horizontal rotating disc (25 rpm) covered with alumina abrasive paper. The specimen was moved over the abrasive paper in a spiral fashion so that it always encountered fresh abrasive. The particle size of the alumina abrasive paper was 600 mesh. Different loads (5, 10, 15, 20, and 25 N) were used. The weight loss of the pin was measured in an analytical balance with 0.0001 g precision.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec3-0021998311412832"><title>Result and discussion</title>
<p>The DSC curve of the specimen is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0021998311412832">Figure 1</xref>. As can be seen, there are two endothermic peaks centered at 831 and 1165°C, and an exothermic peak centered at 1238°C. The endothermic peaks at 831 and 1165°C are due to an allotropic change α − Fe → γ − Fe and the ternary eutectic transformation γ − Fe + graphite + TaC → L,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0021998311412832">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0021998311412832">15</xref></sup> respectively. The exothermic peak at 1238°C is attributed to the formation of tantalum carbides by the reaction γ − Fe + TaC → L. The reaction taking place near the ternary eutectic transformation is conducive to the precipitation of graphite, and it is beneficial to maintain the matrix consistency. From the DSC results, 1165°C was determined to be the optimum temperature for heat treatment.

<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0021998311412832">Figure 2</xref> shows the microstructure of the composite in the zone of in situ tantalum wire reaction after heat treatment for 0, 10, 15, 20, and 25 min. It can be found that within the reaction time, the diffuse region increases gradually. Between the tantalum wire and iron matrix, the composite region can be divided into two apparent regions after heat treatment. Hereinafter, the two regions are labeled as A and B, as is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0021998311412832">Figure 2</xref>(c), where the diffusion reaction has mainly taken place. The diffusion reaction in region A is obvious, while that in region B is small after heat treatment for only 10 min. Then, for 20 min, regions A and B enlarged constantly. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0021998311412832">Figure 2</xref>(e) shows that there is no tantalum phase after heat treatment for 25 min. The diameter of the reaction zone is extended to about 1.0 mm compared to 0.4 mm in the diameter of original tantalum wire. The area is increased by six times compared to the original tantalum wire area. It is also observed that the original boundary has disappeared, without any defects in it. A wave-spectrum line-scanning pattern, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0021998311412832">Figure 2</xref>(f), showed that these white chunks were rich in Ta and C.

<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0021998311412832">Figure 3</xref> shows an XRD graph of the in situ reaction zone. The presence of G (graphite), α-Fe, Ta, and TaC for the composition with 0 and 15 min heat treatment has been detected, and the presence of G (graphite), α-Fe, and TaC for the composition with 25 min heat treatment. A sudden disappearance of tantalum diffraction peaks after treatment at 1165°C for 25 min confirms that all tantalum atoms were consumed by reacting with graphite in the matrix. It is verified that there are only three phases, that is, TaC, ferrite and graphite, and tantalum carbide-dominated metal matrix composites can be obtained under the current conditions along with a small amount of non-reacted graphite.

<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0021998311412832">Figures 4</xref> (a)–(c) are enlarged pictures for region A, region B, and boundary zone C, respectively. There is only one kind of TaC morphology, which is shown as tiny squares in the reaction region. It can be found that the density of products gradually decreased from the central in situ reaction zone to the boundary. The tantalum carbide particles synthesized in situ are tiny squares of 1−2 µm in size and they are distributed evenly in the gray cast iron. The number of tiny square particles has, however, been highly decreased and sizes also increased a little. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0021998311412832">Figure 4</xref>(c) shows the boundary of reaction. Near these regions it can be observed that there still exists plate-like graphite. Careful examination of the matrix shows that it is in the ferrite phase. According to the EDS results obtained from the crystalline particles present in each region, the ratio of tantalum to carbon is near 1:1.

where the carbon atoms originate from the graphite of the gray cast iron and tantalum atoms originate from tantalum wires. The formation of TaC begins at the outer region of the wire, because this area is the first to come into contact with the carbon in the gray cast iron. Carbon atoms move to the surface of the tantalum wire under heat treatment by diffusion, and an Fe-Ta-C alloy melt forms on the surface. The reaction [Ta] + [C] = [TaC] occurs in the alloy melt because of the high affinity between carbon and tantalum atoms. When the concentration of [TaC] reaches saturation in the alloy melt, TaC nuclei precipitate and grow. The in situ reactions occur constantly because of the diffusion of carbon atoms throughout the matrix. TaC nuclei or small crystals diffuse from the surface of the tantalum wire to the matrix due to the concentration gradient. This may be why region A has finer and more TaC particles during heat treatment. However, the details of this procedure require further study.</p>
<p>Micro-hardness distribution along the dispersal direction of the metallic tantalum wire after heat treatment for 20 min was measured, and the results are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0021998311412832">Figure 5</xref>. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0021998311412832">Figure 5</xref>, the highest value was 1832 HV<sub>0.1</sub>, which appeared in diffusion reaction region A, due to intensive TaC. The micro-hardness value reaches the theoretical micro-hardness value for tantalum carbide. The average micro-hardness in the main regions can be placed in the following order: 433 HV<sub>0.1</sub> (tantalum wire), 1077 HV<sub>0.1</sub> (composite area), and 150 HV<sub>0.1</sub> (iron matrix). It is clear that the average value of the composite region is between four and five times higher than that of the iron matrix and two times higher than that of the tantalum wires.

The specimens acquired a wear resistance much higher than that of gray cast iron. That is, the specimens showed a relative wear resistance of 3.29, whereas gray cast iron showed a relative wear resistance of 1. Therefore, TaC particles formed in situ play an important role in composites; specifically, they reinforce the iron matrix and protect it from serious abrasions.

These results show the combined effects of micro-cutting and micro-ploughing. As can be seen, each sample has grooves; the grooves in the TaC-Fe composite specimens are much narrower compared with those in other samples. This is attributed to the presence of TaC reinforcements in the iron matrix, which blocked the abrasion paths during the wear test.

<p>Therefore, the depth decreases exponentially with increasing composite hardness. When the volume fraction of TaC in the composite is low, the depth value is large because the hardness of the material is low and the distance between two particles is large.

According to the DSC results, 1165°C was chosen as the heat treatment temperature. The effects of different heat treatment times (0, 10, 15, 20, and 25 min) on the phase evolution, microstructure, and micro-hardness of the in situ tantalum carbide particulate-reinforced iron-based composites were investigated. The XRD results showed that only graphite, α-Fe, and TaC dominate in the composite after being heat treated at 1165°C for 25 min. The scanning electron microscopy (SEM) observation revealed that the produced tantalum carbide particles are in tiny square shapes and with 1–2 µm sizes after being kept at 1165°C for 25 min. The highest micro-hardness value on composite region after keeping 20 min was 1832 HV<sub>0.1</sub>, and average micro-hardness values was 1077 HV<sub>0.1</sub> which was about 4–5 times than matrix, due to the formation of TaC crystallites as reinforcement phases within the matrix. Relative wear resistance was determined by a pin-on-disc wear test technique, and as a result, the composites containing hard tantalum carbide particulates presented higher wear resistance compared with the unreinforced gray cast iron.</p></sec>
