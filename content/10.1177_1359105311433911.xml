<abstract>
<p>This article examines the relationship between decisional balance and stages of change for consistent condom use with a current romantic heterosexual partner. The sample consisted of 619 undergraduate students (35.1% males; mean of age = 20.31). The results show that the pros and cons of using condoms were significantly related to the stages of change for condom use, but that the pros were more strongly related. Therefore, campaigns for preventing the transmission of the HIV virus and other sexually transmitted diseases should attempt to maximize the perceived advantages of condom use, rather than refuting the cons.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Between 120,000 and 150,000 people are infected with the HIV virus in Spain and an estimated 25% ignore it (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1359105311433911">Secretariat for the National AIDS Plan, 2008</xref>). Moreover, between 2500 and 3500 people are infected with the HIV virus each year. It should be pointed out that, according to the Spanish National Plan for AIDS prevention, young people and adolescents are still the focus of this epidemic regarding transmission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1359105311433911">Secretariat for the National AIDS Plan, 2008</xref>). People under the age of 30 accounted for 25.9% of the new infections from 2004–2009 and this figure increases to 64.5% if people up to the age of 39 years are included (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1359105311433911">National Centre for Epidemiology/Carlos III Institute of Public Health, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>Nowadays, the main cause of HIV transmission is through sexual relationships, both heterosexual and homosexual (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1359105311433911">Belza et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1359105311433911">National Centre for Epidemiology/Carlos III Institute of Public Health, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1359105311433911">Secretariat for the National AIDS Plan, 2008</xref>). Specifically, heterosexual unprotected sex accounted for 34.5% of newly diagnosed HIV infections in 2009, and infections resulting from this type of transmission have seemed to stabilize (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1359105311433911">National Centre for Epidemiology/Carlos III Institute of Public Health, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>The percentage of young people aged 19–24 who had always used condoms in the last six months, during vaginal sex, was 54.5% for males and 52.7% for females (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1359105311433911">Faílde et al., 2008</xref>). Regarding college students samples, 64% of women and 56.9% of men always or almost always use condoms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1359105311433911">Lameiras et al., 2008</xref>) whereas a slightly lower figure of 48% has been found when specifying vaginal sex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1359105311433911">Ballester et al., 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>The transtheoretical model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1359105311433911">Prochaska and DiClemente, 1982</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1359105311433911">1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1359105311433911">Prochaska et al., 1992</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1359105311433911">1994a</xref>) posits that the cessation of risky behaviours and acquisition of preventive behaviours is a gradual, dynamic process in which individuals move through five stages of change: precontemplation; contemplation; preparation; action; and maintenance. The classification into stages of change combines both intentional and behavioural criteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1359105311433911">Prochaska and Norcross, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1359105311433911">Prochaska et al., 1992</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1359105311433911">1994b</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1359105311433911">1994c</xref>). Precontemplation is the stage in which people are not considering the possibility of change in the foreseeable future, while individuals in the contemplation stage are seriously thinking about changing within the next six months. Preparation is the stage in which individuals are intending to take action in the next month, with the action stage containing individuals who have modified their behaviour for a period of less than six months. Finally, the maintenance stage starts after six months of successfully taking action. These stages of change represent a continuum of motivational readiness for behaviour change.</p>
<p>Decisional balance is another construct of the transtheoretical model, which is based on the conflict model of decision making (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1359105311433911">Janis and Mann, 1977</xref>). Decisional balance involves weighing up the advantages and disadvantages of the health-related behaviour (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1359105311433911">Velicer et al., 1985</xref>). The advantages (pros) can be defined as the expected benefits of using condoms (e.g. the protection from unwanted pregnancy and sexually transmitted infections). Conversely, the disadvantages (cons) are the expected costs of condom use and include such things as a reduction in pleasure or their partner’s disapproval. The model has been applied to a broad range of health behaviours, such as: smoking cessation; exercise engagement; cessation of cocaine use; and condom use (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1359105311433911">Prochaska et al., 1994c</xref>). Furthermore, this model has been suggested to be a useful model to understand and deal with HIV prevention behaviours (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1359105311433911">Prochaska et al., 1994b</xref>).</p>
<p>The relationship between the stages of change for condom use and its perceived pros and cons has been examined in several cross-sectional studies carried out with samples composed of college students from several countries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1359105311433911">Grimley et al., 1993</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1359105311433911">1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1359105311433911">Kwon et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1359105311433911">Parsons et al., 2000</xref>), as well as women at high risk of HIV infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1359105311433911">Galavotti et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1359105311433911">Lauby et al., 1998</xref>) and single urban women (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1359105311433911">Morrison-Beedy and Lewis, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1359105311433911">Morrison-Beedy et al., 2002</xref>). These studies have identified a consistent relationship between the pros of the protective behaviour and the stages of change, with the pros being higher among people who were in a more advanced stage of change (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1359105311433911">Galavotti et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1359105311433911">Grimley et al., 1993</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1359105311433911">1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1359105311433911">Kwon et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1359105311433911">Lauby et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1359105311433911">Morrison-Beedy and Lewis, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1359105311433911">Morrison-Beedy et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1359105311433911">Parsons et al., 2000</xref>). However, there are also a number of studies where the cons were not found to be related to the stages of change for condom use, although it was expected that individuals in the earlier stages of change reported more perceived cons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1359105311433911">Grimley et al., 1993</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1359105311433911">1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1359105311433911">Morrison-Beedy et al., 2002</xref>). Moreover, in longitudinal research, increasing the perceived pros predicted progression to later stages in the model, whereas increasing the cons and decreasing the pros predicted regression to an earlier stage of change among people who were using condoms consistently (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1359105311433911">Grossman et al., 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>Several studies have shown it is important to specify partner type when assessing the stage of change for condom use (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1359105311433911">Galavotti et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1359105311433911">Grimley et al., 1997</xref>). It seems clear that condom use is less likely with a primary, steady or long-term partner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1359105311433911">Belza et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1359105311433911">Galavotti et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1359105311433911">Grimley et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1359105311433911">Lauby et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1359105311433911">Morrison-Beedy and Lewis, 2001</xref>). Data from young Spaniards show that condom use is considerably lower with a romantic partner than with occasional partners (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1359105311433911">Faílde et al., 2008</xref>). Furthermore, the perceived importance of the individual pros or cons differs according to partner type, with those who had a steady partner perceiving less pros and more cons than those who had another type of partner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1359105311433911">Morrison-Beedy and Lewis, 2001</xref>). Thus, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1359105311433911">Grimley et al. (1993</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1359105311433911">1995</xref>) point out, it is necessary to distinguish partner type when researching condom use. Therefore, it is interesting to assess condom use as well as its perceived pros and cons regarding a romantic partner according to the stage of change.</p>
<p>This study assessed the applicability of the transtheoretical model of behaviour change for consistent condom use among young people in a romantic heterosexual relationship. The specific aims were:</p>
<list id="list1-1359105311433911" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>To assess the construct validity and reliability of the decisional balance measure for consistent condom use with a heterosexual partner.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>To evaluate the distribution of stages of change for condom use with a heterosexual partner and whether there are gender-related differences.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>To analyse the relationship between pros and cons of condom use and stages of change.</p></list-item>

<title>Methods</title>
<sec id="section3-1359105311433911">
<title>Participants</title>
<p>The initial sample consisted of 1502 college students from the University of Girona. The majority of the sample were female (53.4%), with a mean age of 21.2 (SD = 4.73). Random sampling within strata was used for participant selection. Strata criterion was the field of knowledge: (1) humanities and social sciences; (2) natural sciences and health; (3) technical studies. A third of the degrees in each stratified sample were randomly selected. More than 90% of the participants (91.4%) were younger than 26 years old; 2% and 1.6% identified themselves as being homosexual and bisexual, respectively; 86% had previously had sexual relationships with penetration; 50.9% had a heterosexual partner and only a male (.1%) was intending to make his partner pregnant.</p>
<p>Data were analysed from participants who (a) were 25 years or less, (b) identified themselves as being heterosexual or bisexual, (c) had previous sexual relationships with penetration, (d) were not attempting to get pregnant (or get their partner pregnant) and (e) had a heterosexual romantic partner. The retained sample was comprised of 619 students and included more females (64.9%) than males. The average age was 20.75 (SD = 2.01) for males and 20.08 (SD = 1.71) for females, with the vast majority (97.9%) identifying themselves as heterosexual.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1359105311433911">
<title>Measures</title>
<p>A self-administered questionnaire based on the CIVIUP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1359105311433911">Planes et al., 2012</xref>), a questionnaire for assessing the importance of the pros and cons of condom use, was used to assess decisional balance for condom use with their current partner. Some other items were also included in order to increase the scope of the advantages and disadvantages, as well as to improve the psychometric properties of the questionnaire.</p>
<p>Participants were given the following brief story of a heterosexual romantic partner:
<disp-quote>
<p>Charles and Eve have been dating for six months. They feel a lot of attraction for each other and are very satisfied with their relationship. They are even making future plans. Since they began to have sexual relations they have been using condoms almost always. They also frequently used them with their former partners.</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Then, they were asked to identify themselves with the character of their own gender and consequently, to rate how important each statement was for making their decision about using condoms or not. The pool of items was presented randomly ordered. In contrast to a prior study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1359105311433911">Planes et al., 2012</xref>), the range of response options was expanded in order to identify more clearly variability in the participants’ responses. Thus, a five-point Likert scale was used with response options ranging from 1 = Not at all important to 5 = Extremely important.</p>
<p>Participants reported age, gender, sexual orientation, whether they had had sexual relationships, whether they had a romantic partner, whether they were actively attempting to get pregnant and the length of their relationship. Stage of change was assessed using an algorithm previously used by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1359105311433911">Grimley et al. (1993)</xref>. Participants answered three questions to determine what stage they were in: (1) how often they used condoms; (2) how long they had been consistently using condoms; and (3) whether they intended to use a condom within the next month or six months. The three questions referred to their current partner.</p>
<p>Using the responses to the above questions resulted in each participant being placed into one of the following five stages: (1) Precontemplation: not currently always using condoms and does not have intentions to do so in the next six months; (2) Contemplation: not currently always using condoms, but has the intention to do so in the next six months; (3) Preparation: not currently always using condoms, but has the intention to do so in the next month; (4) Action: currently using condoms every time they have sex, but has done so for less than six months; (5) Maintenance: has been using condoms every time they have sex for the last six months or more.</p>

<sec id="section5-1359105311433911">
<title>Procedure</title>
<p>The first step was to obtain permission to carry out the study from the co-ordinators of the degrees and then from the professors in charge of the required courses in the first, second and third year of each degree course. The questionnaire was administered in classroom settings and took about 10–15 minutes. The participants were also informed of their right not to answer the whole questionnaire or to miss any questions they chose to. Moreover, the students were informed that any data they provided would be both anonymous and confidential. Data were collected from March to May in 2010.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1359105311433911">
<title>Data analysis</title>
<p>The data were analysed using SPSS version 15.0. Principal-components analysis with varimax rotation was performed on the decisional balance items to assess the construct validity and scale reliabilities were assessed using Cronbach’s alpha. Descriptive statistics were used to describe sample characteristics and the distribution of participants among the stages of change.</p>
<p>The pros and cons measures for all individuals were converted from raw scores to <italic>T</italic>-scores (<italic>M</italic> = 50; SD = 10) to provide a standard metric. Because of the small number of participants in the contemplation, preparation and action stages, and in order to increase the power of the statistical tests, participants in the contemplation and preparation stages were collapsed into one category, as were those in the action and maintenance stages. Thus, three groups were used for all following analyses. This trichotomization of the stages of change grouped participants who had intentions to use condoms (both in the short and long-term) into one group and those who had already been using condoms consistently into another group, as in previous research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1359105311433911">Font-Mayolas et al., 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>Chi-square was used to explore the relationship between gender and the stage of change for condom use. Two-way ANOVAs were performed to examine differences in the perceived pros and cons of condom use, by stage of change and gender. Scheffe tests for post hoc comparisons were used to examine the differences between stage of change and the decisional balance scales, with Eta square being used to evaluate the effect sizes. Kruskal-Wallis and Mann-Whitney NPAR tests were employed when homogeneity of variances was not assumed.</p>

<title>Construct validity and internal consistency of the pros and cons scales</title>
<p>In order to confirm the factor structure of the modified version of CIVIUP, a principal component analysis (PCA) specifying two factors was performed. The factorial solution explained 26.037% of the variance, although there were a number of departures from the expected factor structure. These items and those that had loadings of less than .30 were dropped and the analysis was rerun, as suggested by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1359105311433911">Floyd and Widaman (1995)</xref>. The Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin value was .719 and the Bartlett test of Sphericity was 1423.990 (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .001). This solution explained 28.528% of the variance and is shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1359105311433911">Table 1</xref>.</p>

The internal consistency of the pros and cons scales produced alpha coefficients of .577 and .719, respectively, with none of the items adversely affecting each scales internal consistency. Item-scale correlations ranged from .203 to .394 for the pros scale and from .305 to .528 for the cons scale.</p>

<p>A Kruskal-Wallis NPAR test showed significant differences in the pros across the stages of change (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .001). Mann-Whitney NPAR tests indicated that individuals in the action and maintenance stages had significantly higher pros scores than those in precontemplation (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .001). Overall, females perceived significantly more pros of condom use than males (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .001). To evaluate the interaction between gender and the stage of change a two-way ANOVA was used. In agreement with the non-parametric tests, differences were found according to gender (<italic>F</italic>(1, 537) = 14.171; <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01; eta<sup>2</sup> = .026) and stage of change (<italic>F</italic>(2, 537) = 18.102; <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001; eta<sup>2</sup> = .064). Post hoc comparisons also indicated differences between participants in the precontemplation stage (mean = 46.57) and those who were in the action and maintenance stage (mean = 51.94; <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001). There was also a significant interaction effect between gender and stage of change (<italic>F</italic>(2, 537) = 3.132; <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05; eta<sup>2</sup> = .012), indicating that the increase in the perceived pros across the stages of change was smaller in females (Means: precontemplation = 50.05; contemplation/preparation = 52.51; action/maintenance = 53.18) than in males (Means: precontemplation = 43.09; contemplation/preparation = 47.68; action/ maintenance = 50.70).</p>

<title>Construct validity and internal consistency of the pros and cons scales</title>
<p>The two-factor solution found in the previous work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1359105311433911">Planes et al., 2012</xref>) was confirmed, so that the majority of the items representing the pros of condom use were grouped together, as were those which referred to the cons of using condoms. Although some items were conceptually unrelated, when they were removed the original factorial structure was supported. The variance explained by these two factors was also similar to previous research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1359105311433911">Planes et al., 2012</xref>). Concerning internal consistency, the cons scale had an acceptable Cronbach’s alpha, but the pros scale had a marginal internal consistency, which could not be improved by removing any items. This low internal consistency could be accounted for by the large range of the topics included in the scale (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1359105311433911">Carretero-Dios and Pérez, 2005</xref>), given that various aspects from prevention programmes have been included in the scale.</p>

<title>Stages of change for condom use</title>
<p>The distribution of stage of change for condom use indicates that a substantial amount of college students are engaging in unprotected sex with their current romantic partner, and consequently, they might be putting themselves at risk of exposure to HIV and other STDs. Furthermore, among those who had not been using condoms consistently, the majority did not have intentions to do so in the immediate future.</p>
<p>Gender differences in the stages of change were found in the present study, in contrast to studies conducted in the United States (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1359105311433911">Grimley et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1359105311433911">Parsons et al., 2000</xref>). Surprisingly, more men than women were thinking of using condoms consistently with their current partner in the next six months (intention criteria). However, differences were not found in the stages defined by the behavioural criterion, which is consistent with the results from a Spanish college sample (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1359105311433911">Lameiras et al., 2008</xref>). However, condom use in this sample was lower than the figure for consistent condom use during vaginal sex with a romantic partner found among a sample of young Spaniards from the general population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1359105311433911">Faílde et al., 2008</xref>).</p>

<title>Gender differences in the pros and cons</title>
<p>Regarding the cons, there were no gender differences identified here, which is in contrast to previous research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1359105311433911">Grimley et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1359105311433911">Parsons et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1359105311433911">Planes et al., 2012</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1359105311433911">Grimley et al.

It might be that items such as ‘It gives you a contraceptive method without medical supervision’ or ‘It provides you with a contraceptive method without side-effects’ would have a more direct affect on women than on men.

<title>Pros and cons by stage of change</title>
<p>The current study adds further evidence for the relationship between the pros and stages of change for condom use. Consistent results have been found in college populations in several different countries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1359105311433911">Grimley et al., 1993</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1359105311433911">1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1359105311433911">Kwon et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1359105311433911">Parsons et al., 2000</xref>), samples comprised of women at high risk for HIV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1359105311433911">Galavotti et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1359105311433911">Lauby et al., 1998</xref>) and a sample of single urban women (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1359105311433911">Morrison-Beedy and Lewis, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1359105311433911">Morrison-Beedy et al., 2002</xref>). The participants in the action and maintenance stages were the group perceiving the highest level of pros, whereas those in the precontemplation stage were the group perceiving the lowest. Furthermore, this study found a significant relationship between the perceived cons of condom use and the stage of change, in that participants in the precontemplation stage rated the cons more highly than those in the action and maintenance stage. However, in previous research this relationship was not found in studies using college students, whether partner type was specified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1359105311433911">Grimley et al., 1995</xref>) or not (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1359105311433911">Grimley et al., 1993</xref>). Nonetheless, our results indicated that the pros were more strongly related to the stages of change than the cons, as shown by the difference in their partial eta square coefficients. Moreover, an interaction effect between gender and stages of change was also found, suggesting that a major increase in pros is needed to progress along the stages of change, but more in males than females. However, this fact could be due to a ceiling effect, as women in the precontemplation stage already had high pro scores. Taken altogether, the data provide evidence for the relationship between the pros and cons and the stages of change for consistent condom use with a romantic partner.</p>
<p>The pattern of relations among the pros and cons measures and stages of change for condom use are similar to previous research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1359105311433911">Galavotti et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1359105311433911">Grimley et al., 1993</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1359105311433911">1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1359105311433911">Lauby et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1359105311433911">Morrison-Beedy et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1359105311433911">Prochaska et al., 1994c</xref>) using several different types of samples, as well as in a broader range of health-related behaviours (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1359105311433911">Prochaska et al., 1994c</xref>). Nevertheless, the differences between precontemplation and the contemplation and preparation stages were not found for the cons or the pros, contrary to previous research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1359105311433911">Galavotti et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1359105311433911">Grimley et al., 1993</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1359105311433911">1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1359105311433911">Lauby et al., 1998</xref>). The crossover between the standardized pros and cons occurs before action takes place in women, similar to the results found in previous research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1359105311433911">Galavotti et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1359105311433911">Grimley et al., 1993</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1359105311433911">1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1359105311433911">Lauby et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1359105311433911">Morrison-Beedy and Lewis, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1359105311433911">Prochaska et al., 1994c</xref>) and for other health-related behaviours (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1359105311433911">Prochaska et al., 1994c</xref>). In contrast to previous findings, the pros outweighed the cons in the action and maintenance stages in males. So, males have the intention to use condoms consistently with their partner, even when the standardized cons are higher than the pros are.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section16-1359105311433911">
<title>Implications for prevention</title>
<p>This relationship pattern has implications concerning preventive programmes and campaigns. Although both the pros and cons of condom use were related to consistent condom use with a romantic heterosexual partner, the pros accounted for more variance than the cons. However, many prevention campaigns designed to prevent the sexual transmission of HIV and other STDs emphasize the dangerous consequences of unsafe sex, rather than the benefits of using a condom. In contrast, these results suggest that interventions should be designed to increase the perceived pros of condom use.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section17-1359105311433911">
<title>Limitations</title>
<p>Nevertheless, there are several limitations in the current study. First, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1359105311433911">Galavotti et al. (1995)</xref> pointed out, the stage of change construct does not take into account the fact that condom use involves the decision of two people. Hence, individuals may not have the decisional balance expected of somebody in their stage, since they may be in the stage because of their partner’s request, so that they may be using condoms in order to please their partner or because of their pressure. A second limitation is the low reliability of the pros scale, meaning the results should be viewed with caution. In spite of this, the pros were significantly related to the stage of change, as predicted. Because of the private and sensitive nature of sexual behaviour, social desirability bias may have affected participants’ responses. However, this was hopefully minimized by the anonymity and confidentiality of the data, along with the voluntary nature of the study. Another limitation is that the sample may not be representative of Spanish undergraduate students, or young Spanish people in general. Moreover, given the cross-sectional nature of the data, causal relationships between variables can not be assumed. Lastly, the fact that condom use was measured without specifying the type of practice (vaginal, anal or oral sex) is another of the study’s limitations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1359105311433911">Grimley et al., 1997</xref>).</p>

<sec id="section18-1359105311433911" sec-type="conclusions">
<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>The majority of the students in the sample were not consistently using condoms with their heterosexual romantic partner, which may put them at an increased risk of exposure to HIV and other STDs. Moreover, among those who were not consistently using condoms, the vast majority had no intentions to use them in the short or long term. Therefore, taking into account that all the participants were not attempting to get pregnant, the efforts to improve prevention should promote the dual protection (against unintended pregnancies and STDs) offered by condoms to this target population.</p>
<p>In spite of the limitations, this study provides further evidence of the relationship between the constructs of the pros, cons and stage of change for condom use with a romantic heterosexual partner. Both higher pros and lower cons were related to engaging in the preventive behaviour. However, the role of the pros was found to be more important than the cons. Therefore, these results should be used to direct preventive actions in order to maximize the perceived advantages of condom use with a heterosexual partner.</p>
