<title>Natalizumab and PML</title>
<p>Natalizumab — a monoclonal antibody against alpha-4-integrin — was approved for treatment of relapsing–remitting multiple sclerosis (MS) in 2004 based on its therapeutic efficacy shown in two large clinical trials, AFFIRM<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1352458512451946">1</xref></sup> and SENTINEL.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1352458512451946">2</xref></sup> Natalizumab substantially reduced MS relapses, progression of disability and new inflammatory lesions on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and demonstrated a favourable safety profile. However, in February 2005, soon after approval, natalizumab was voluntarily suspended after two cases of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) in the extension phase of the SENTINEL study in patients treated with the combination of interferon (IFN) β-1a intramuscularly and natalizumab.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1352458512451946">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1352458512451946">4</xref></sup></p>
<p>PML is caused by John Cunningham (JC) virus, a DNA virus belonging to the polyomavirus family. The virus is ubiquitous throughout the world, and approximately 50% of the population harbour JC virus, primarily in the kidney.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1352458512451946">5</xref></sup> The archetype JC virus does not cause PML, and to be pathogenic the virus has to undergo one of several possible mutations.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1352458512451946">6</xref></sup> The pathogenic virus may in genetically susceptible persons cause PML if the person is severely immunocompromised (HIV infection, malignant disease, organ transplantation) or is treated with a drug interfering with central nervous system (CNS) immune surveillance.</p>
<p>In February 2006, natalizumab was reintroduced in the USA and approved in the EU for the treatment of patients with relapsing–remitting MS failing IFNβ and in patients with very active MS.</p>
<p>Based on the experience in clinical trials, the risk of PML was estimated to be 1/1.000 treated patients.</p>
<p>After reintroduction of natalizumab, more than 95,000 patients have been treated with the drug, corresponding to more than 195,000 patient-years of experience, and the risk of PML in patients treated for more than 24 months has been shown to be considerably higher. In fact, the cumulative incidence of PML can be calculated to 6.1 in 1000 patients treated with natalizumab for five years equal to one case in 164 treated patients [<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://medinfo.biogenidec.com/medinfo">https://medinfo.biogenidec.com/medinfo</ext-link> (accessed April 30, 2012)] [<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.biogenidec.ch/Tysabri.aspx?ID=4763">http://www.biogenidec.ch/Tysabri.aspx?ID=4763</ext-link> (accessed April 30, 2012)].</p>
<p>It might be argued that this risk is unacceptable, because PML carries the risk of death and disability. However, today this argument is invalid, mainly because it is possible to make risk stratification for PML in the single patient. In addition, the often disabling cause of MS and the efficacy of natalizumab should not be disregarded.</p>

<title>Risk stratification for PML is possible</title>
<p>During the last few years it has been possible to identify certain risk factors for the development of PML.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1352458512451946">7</xref></sup> 1) Duration of natalizumab therapy: The risk is low during the first 12 months; it increases in the second year, and, in particular, beyond 24 months of therapy. 2) Prior treatment with immunosuppressants, which increases the risk of PML by a factor of four. 3) JC virus antibodies: The most important means to assess the risk of PML in the individual patient is, however, measurement of anti-JC virus antibodies in the blood.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1352458512451946">7</xref></sup> Individuals who have encountered JC virus infections develop antibodies against JC virus, and the presence of antibodies can be measured in the blood using a simple two-step enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1352458512451946">7</xref></sup> The test is robust as all patients who have developed PML and in whom blood samples had been collected six months or more before PML were shown to be JC virus antibody positive. The test is reliable with a false-negative rate estimated at 2.5%.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1352458512451946">7</xref></sup> Seroconversion occurs in 1%–2% of seronegative patients per year, calculated from the increasing frequency of JC virus antibodies with increasing age. Using the three known factors that determine the risk of PML with natalizumab therapy, the risk in the individual patient can be calculated. In JC virus antibody-negative patients the risk is virtually zero.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1352458512451946">8</xref></sup> In JC virus antibody-positive patients with no prior immunosuppressant use, the incidence of PML during natalizumab treatment up to 24 months can be calculated to 0.53/1000 patients (95% confidence interval (CI): 0.33–0.81) and with natalizumab treatment between 24 and 48 months 3.9/1000 patients (95% CI: 3.0–4.9). In JC virus antibody-positive patients previously treated with immunosuppressants, the incidence of PML in natalizumab treatment up to 24 months was 1.5/1000 patients (95% CI: 0.83–2.5) and patients treated beyond 24 months 10.6/1000 patients (95% CI: 7.7–14.2).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1352458512451946">8</xref></sup></p>

<title>Recommendation for treatment with natalizumab using risk stratification for PML</title>
<p>Using risk stratification for PML, it is possible to assess the risk of PML in the individual patient and to develop guidelines or treatment algorithms for the use of natalizumab:<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1352458512451946">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1352458512451946">9</xref></sup></p>
<list id="list1-1352458512451946" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>All JC virus antibody-negative patients can safety be treated with natalizumab, but should have their JC virus antibody status tested every year. In case of seroconversion, a switch to an alternative therapy or continuation of natalizumab should be decided based on the proven treatment efficacy of natalizumab and risk evaluation with continued therapy in comparison with efficacy and risk of an alternative therapy.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>In JC virus antibody-positive patients who have received prior treatment with immunosuppressants, it is recommended to use other disease-modifying therapy because treatment with natalizumab beyond 12 months cannot be recommended in these patients.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Other JC virus antibody-positive patients can be treated with natalizumab for 12 or 24 months in order to evaluate the therapeutic efficacy, and after 12 or 24 months it should be decided whether the patient should continue natalizumab or switch to an alternative therapy, which today would be fingolimod. However, many neurologists would recommend fingolimod as the initial second-line therapy. If treatment with natalizumab is continued beyond 24 months in JC virus antibody-positive patients, it is recommended to perform frequent (3-monthly) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in order to diagnose PML as early as possible because it has been reported that patients diagnosed very early can survive PML without or with minimal sequelae.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>A difference between natalizumab-induced PML and PML occurring in patients with immune incompetance or patients treated with other drugs, is that the mortality of PML with natalizumab is only 20%, because plasma exchange can remove natalizumab from the blood and normalise the immune status in the CNS. Reestablishment of the immune competence elicits immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS) that may severely worsen the clinical status in the patient and, hence, the majority of patients surviving PML will be left with moderate or severe disablement.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1352458512451946">10</xref></sup></p>
<p>In the future, with the introduction of new, effective and safe therapies for MS, natalizumab will probably be confined to JC virus antibody-negative patients. On the other hand, as natalizumab probably is the most efficacious MS therapy, it would be warranted to use natalizumab as first-line therapy in JC virus antibody-negative patients.</p>
<p>In conclusion, death and disability from natalizumab treatment can be minimised with use of risk stratification based on JC virus antibody testing combined with a high clinical vigilance and use of frequent MRI in those JC virus antibody-positive patients who, after risk assessment for PML, decide to continue treatment beyond 12 or 24 months.</p>
