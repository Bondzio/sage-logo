<abstract>
<p>The design of tax systems is an important topic as governments reshape taxes to reduce public sector deficits following the global financial crisis. This article discusses findings from a focus group study on public attitudes to taxation in England. It uses rational choice and moral arguments to explore three questions: What do the public think of different taxes? How do people react to different combinations of taxes? What are public attitudes towards public spending? This article demonstrates that people’s stage in life affects attitudes to taxation. The most unpopular tax among older people is inheritance tax, whereas it is fuel duties for younger respondents. Taxes associated with personal choice (such as value added tax) attract more support than income tax. People also want greater transparency about the benefits of tax systems. The results show that principles are important for shaping public attitudes to taxation and that policy-makers should consider how diverse forms of taxation combine over the life cycle when designing a tax system.</p>

<p>Taxation is a key part of the modern economy. It is at the heart of the relationship between citizens and the state and helps fund public services such as health and education (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0958928711425266">Commission on Taxation and Citizenship, 2000</xref>). However, tax systems can be designed in a wide variety of ways. There can be different types of taxation depending on the balance between income and consumption taxation; taxes on transfers or holdings of wealth and so on (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0958928711425266">Mirrlees et al., 2010a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0958928711425266">Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, 2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0958928711425266">2010</xref>). An Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) policy brief states: ‘All governments raise taxes for public spending. From schools to highways and social security. The question is what taxes to levy, how are they applied and how they affect people’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0958928711425266">Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, 2007</xref>: 1).</p>
<p>The design of tax systems is a live issue in many countries. Different countries are facing a common set of policy challenges. Perhaps most immediately there is debate across Europe and beyond on the mix of taxes needed to cut public sector deficits swollen by governments’ responses to the recent global financial crisis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0958928711425266">Inman, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0958928711425266">Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, 2010</xref>). An OECD report also highlights more long-term challenges to tax systems from increasing pressure on welfare spending caused by changes such as an ageing population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0958928711425266">Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, 2010</xref>). Added to this are developments in theory. Sir Jim Mirrlees chaired a recent review of taxation at the Institute for Fiscal Studies in the UK (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0958928711425266">Mirrlees et al., 2010a</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0958928711425266">b</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0958928711425266">Mirrlees et al. (2010a</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0958928711425266">b)</xref> argue that important changes in the economy mean that the principles that should guide tax systems today are not the same as those 30 years ago. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0958928711425266">Mirrlees et al. (2010b</xref>) suggest that tax systems need to cope with a growing inequality of income and wealth in many countries. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0958928711425266">Mirrlees et al. (2010a</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0958928711425266">b)</xref> say that the ideal tax system in the 21st century should be both progressive and neutral, where progressive means that richer people pay a greater proportion of their income and wealth in tax than poorer people and neutral implies that similar economic activities should be taxed similarly.</p>
<p>Studying public opinion is an important part of designing a tax system. Although the design of tax systems raises technical questions (such as what is the optimal tax rate to maximize revenues), these issues of ‘optimal taxation’ should be accompanied by studies of public opinion. Public attitudes act as a constraint upon politicians and policy-makers. Public unhappiness with taxes can provoke protests that threaten government. For example, in 2000 the Labour government in the UK faced a serious threat to its authority to govern from blockades of oil refineries by hauliers and farmers protesting over fuel duties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0958928711425266">Robinson, 2003</xref>). Another example is the serious riots that broke out in central London in 1990 over the poll tax (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0958928711425266">BBC, 2005</xref>). Even if public discontent does not spill over into physical protests it can put pressure on politicians through the ballot box to cut taxes. For instance, Goodin writes: ‘Inheritance taxes have long been the “third rail” of tax policy, touch them, and you are dead, politically’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0958928711425266">Goodin, 2003</xref>: 70). This points to the importance of studying public attitudes to taxation. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0958928711425266">Hammar et al. (2008)</xref> write that: ‘political difficulties in implementing the tax structure therefore call for optimal taxation theory to be complemented by analyses of tax attitudes’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0958928711425266">Hammar et al., 2008</xref>: 524).</p>
<p>This article presents evidence on public opinion towards taxation in England. This country is an interesting case study because the UK is home to important policy debates over taxation. The Westminster-based Conservative–Liberal Democrat coalition government has embarked on a far-reaching ‘fiscal consolidation’ that involves both tax changes and spending cuts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0958928711425266">HM Treasury, 2010</xref>). Similarly, although <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0958928711425266">Mirrlees et al. (2010a</xref>) outline general principles of taxation, their recommendations and examples concentrate mainly on the UK.</p>
<p>Existing evidence on UK attitudes to taxation is fairly limited. Gemmell et al. comment that there is: ‘surprisingly little evidence for the UK on attitudes to taxation in general and tax misperceptions in particular, at least for central government’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0958928711425266">Gemmell et al., 2004</xref>: F118). There are studies of UK public opinion towards individual taxes such as inheritance tax and council tax (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0958928711425266">BMG Research, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0958928711425266">Hedges and Bromley, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0958928711425266">Lewis and White, 2006</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0958928711425266">1</xref></sup> However, these studies tend to ask people their attitudes to specific taxes in isolation from other taxes. Although this provides useful information, it is also important to study how people compare taxes or react to different combinations of taxes when designing a tax system. Taxes form part of a wider tax system and a key issue is how different taxes fit together. This is because taxes can interact to cause high effective marginal rates or provoke unexpected avoidance behaviour.</p>
<p>Analysing public attitudes to the tax system points to several questions. First, what do people think of different taxes? This helps identify whether there are particular taxes that the public likes or dislikes and so helps policy-makers select what taxes the public think should make up the tax system. To answer this, it is important to ask people to compare taxes rather than consider taxes in isolation from each other. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0958928711425266">McCaffery and Baron (2003)</xref> did a study on the internet on attitudes to income tax and payroll taxes (which cover social insurance) in the USA. They asked people to think about a tax system based on both of these taxes. They found that if people were asked about one of the taxes in isolation from the other, then people did not make any adjustment to account for the presence of the other tax even though they were supposed to be thinking about the tax system.</p>
<p>Second, do the public prefer certain combinations of taxes over others? This question looks at how different taxes fit together and whether the public prefer an emphasis on certain mixes of taxes over others. In their study of Swedish public opinion to taxation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0958928711425266">Hammar et al. (2008</xref>: 541) conclude: ‘one must look more into combinations of taxes and not only at taxation broadly or at one tax at a time. This is an important task for future research.’</p>
<p>Third, what do public think about public spending? Taxes involve benefits as well as costs, and an important part of the benefits provided are through tax-funded public services. Popular support for taxes and the tax system is likely to fall when they question the value of public spending.</p>
<p>This article addresses each of these questions through exploratory focus group interviews in London on public attitudes to taxation. This article is organized as follows. The first section sets out the background to analysing public attitudes towards taxation. This highlights the role of rational choice and moral reasons in shaping attitudes to taxation. The second part describes the focus group interviews used in this particular study. The third section looks at the responses given when people are asked to compare a range of taxes. The article focuses mainly on the taxes that raise the most revenue for the UK exchequer, as they are the basis of the present UK tax system. The fourth section outlines responses when people are asked to comment on different combinations of taxes. This examines in particular attitudes to consumption taxes versus income taxes as well as a contrast between the taxation of earned and unearned income. The fifth section outlines what respondents think of public spending. A conclusion follows this discussion.</p>
<sec id="section1-0958928711425266">
<title>Background</title>
<p>Rational choice theory is a starting point for understanding public attitudes towards taxation. People are assumed to be rational self-interested utility maximizers. Rational choice means that people satisfy axioms of consistent choice, such as not being swayed by irrelevant alternatives in the choices they make. Self-interest means that people satisfy their own preferences, although these preferences can be either selfish or altruistic. People also choose those actions that maximize their utility. However, they need the appropriate information to pick the actions that maximize their utility. If this information is unavailable then people can make errors over the choices that maximize utility. Rational agents will make the maximizing choices once the proper information becomes available (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0958928711425266">Sen, 1990</xref>).</p>
<p>Rational choice theory makes various predictions about attitudes to taxation. Rational choice theory suggests that people might have concerns with specific taxes. For example, self-interest permits people to have preferences about the taxes paid by others, such as parents who are concerned about the taxes paid by their children. This may mean a preference against inheritance tax. Rational people may also think about spending and consumption patterns over their life cycle, preferring for instance taxes that allow for a smooth level of consumption over their lifetime. Getting people to compare taxes helps reveal the preferences people have about different taxes. Rational choice theory also suggests that people should be concerned with the overall tax bill that they face. This is because the tax bill contains the total cost imposed from all the taxes that people pay. This points to the significance of studying how different taxes combine. These issues help create the first two questions explored in this study, namely what do people think about different taxes and what are their reactions to different combinations of taxes?</p>
<p>Rational choice theory also suggests that people consider benefits as well as costs when thinking about taxation. For example, people get benefits through tax-funded public services such as health and education and this should shape attitudes to taxation. This helps generate the third question: ‘What are public attitudes towards public spending?’</p>
<sec id="section2-0958928711425266">
<title>Limitations of rational choice theory</title>
<p>Although rational choice theory is a flexible and robust theory, it nevertheless has important limitations for understanding public opinion. Rational choice theory assumes that people do not make systematic mistakes over costs and benefits if provided with the correct information. However, evidence suggests that people have a systematic tendency to overestimate how much tax they pay. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0958928711425266">Gemmell et al. (2004)</xref> look at public perceptions of taxation based on the 1995 British Social Attitudes survey. This wave asked questions about knowledge of income tax and value added tax (VAT). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0958928711425266">Gemmell et al. (2004)</xref> found that between 60 percent and 70 percent of respondents overestimated their liabilities under both income tax and VAT despite having access to the information that would have allowed them to make the correct assessment. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0958928711425266">Rowlingson and McKay (2005)</xref> also found a tendency to overestimate liabilities in their survey of attitudes to inheritance tax. For example, only 6 percent of respondents noted correctly that 6 percent of estates in the UK paid inheritance tax, with 48 percent thinking it was 25 percent of estates or above. One question these findings raise for the present study is how much people know about the tax system in the UK, and whether the provision of information will change opinion towards particular taxes or combinations of taxes.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0958928711425266">
<title>Moral motives</title>
<p>Moral arguments that go beyond self-interest also seem important for understanding attitudes to taxation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0958928711425266">Beckert, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0958928711425266">Graetz and Shapiro, 2005</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0958928711425266">Graetz and Shapiro (2005)</xref> highlight the importance of moral attitudes in their case study of the repeal of estate tax in the US. They argue that the provision of information and statistics on the estate tax in the US by supporters of this tax did little to change public opinion. They claim that public attitudes seemed to be swayed more by moral arguments rather than statistical facts such as the proportion of estates that are liable to the tax.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0958928711425266">Beckert (2008)</xref> also draws on moral arguments to explain why the estate tax might be so controversial. He suggests that the estate tax brings together a range of moral issues and conflicts and this explains why this tax excites particular attention. This involves principles such as equal opportunity, family, justice and the community. For example, a family principle might hold that inheritances are important for building family solidarity or identity. However, a family principle might also be used to develop arguments against inheritances, for example driven by a worry that the prospect of an inheritance may create a lever that allows a parent to exercise control over their child’s life and so undermine the child’s freedom. These points suggest that it is important to examine the impact of moral arguments when studying attitudes towards taxation. The focus group discussions explored this by examining arguments about the merits of taxing unearned rather than earned income.</p>

<title>Evidence on public attitudes to taxation in the UK</title>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0958928711425266">Hedges and Bromley (2001)</xref> provide perhaps the largest previous study of UK public opinion about taxation in a survey conducted about a decade ago for the Fabian Society in the UK. The think-tank initiated this survey for a <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0958928711425266">Commission on Taxation and Citizenship (2000)</xref>. The survey asked respondents a series of questions about different taxes, though they were not asked to compare taxes or comment on different combinations of taxes. The survey found that 51 percent of respondents thought that inheritance tax should be abolished, while about 20 percent thought that the threshold at which inheritance tax starts should be raised from its then level of £250,000 to at least £500,000. The remainder believed that the threshold should be kept or reduced, with 2 percent thinking that all inheritances should be taxed. They found that 58 percent of respondents thought that income tax was too high or much too high; 76 percent believed VAT was too high or much too high; and 75 percent of people felt that duties on tobacco, alcohol and petrol were too high or much too high (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0958928711425266">Hedges and Bromley, 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>A previous study on inheritance tax in England in 2006 reports a specific comparison between inheritance tax and income tax (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0958928711425266">Prabhakar, 2009</xref>). Respondents in the focus group interviews were asked how they would react if they had a choice between a package of a high income tax but low inheritance tax or a low income tax and a high inheritance tax. The study found that opposition to inheritance tax fell once participants were asked to make a choice between cuts in income tax or inheritance tax (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0958928711425266">Prabhakar, 2009</xref>). This earlier study focused on a specific comparison between income tax and inheritance tax and did not consider other taxes such as fuel duties, national insurance or corporation tax. The present article builds on this earlier work by looking at attitudes to a wider range of taxes as well as different combinations of taxes.</p>

<title>Description of focus group discussions</title>
<p>Qualitative methods were used in this study. Such methods are often useful for exploratory research as they can be highly sensitive to the views of users and allow researchers to probe initial answers in depth. A qualitative approach also allows respondents to identify notable areas for further study, which is important for research where there is fairly limited knowledge. Focus group interviews were the particular qualitative method used in this study. An advantage of focus group discussions is that they can allow deliberation among participants. This can be important for highlighting those themes that may be likely to attract common agreement. Qualitative methods do not provide a set of general results that are statistically robust. Rather, they allow the researcher to sift through different sorts of arguments that may not all be amenable to measurement and provide insights into different sorts of argument. Qualitative methods might be a prelude to a larger scale quantitative survey. The focus group discussions used here are in line with best practice used in other focus group interviews (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0958928711425266">Lewis and White, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0958928711425266">Rowlingson and McKay, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>Four focus groups were convened in different sites across London in July 2010 to provide an exploration of public attitudes. London has high house prices and so the focus groups allowed a study of attitudes in an area in which inheritance tax is a live issue alongside the other taxes under discussion. There were about eight people per group. Discussions lasted about an hour, and all respondents received an incentive payment. All groups were audiotaped and all identities are anonymous. There were roughly equal numbers of men and women in each group. Groups were divided according to age and income. Two of the groups were classed as having younger people (18–44 years old) and the remainder were older people (45+ years old). Older people tend to possess more assets than younger people; for example, they are more likely to be the outright owner of their home (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0958928711425266">Daffin, 2009</xref>). Those who possess greater levels of assets can be expected to be more resistant to taxes on assets, such as inheritance tax. The age bands chosen also correspond broadly to a previous focus group discussion of attitudes to inheritance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0958928711425266">Rowlingson and McKay, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>One might also expect attitudes to taxation to vary according to income. The impact of tax may be more keenly felt by those on lower incomes and this might introduce different attitudes to taxes such as VAT. Two groups were classed as ‘low/middle income’ (below an annual personal income of £35,000 a year) and two groups were classed as ‘high income’ (above an annual personal income of £35,000). The £35,000 threshold was set to help catch people below as well as above the bracket for paying a higher 40 percent income tax band in the UK, which applied for incomes between £43,875 and £150,000 for 2010/2011 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0958928711425266">HM Revenue and Customs, 2010a</xref>).</p>
<p>The groups started by asking respondents their initial reactions to different taxes. Time constraints meant that it was not possible to ask people about all the different taxes in the UK. Instead, the focus group interviews looked at some of the most important taxes in terms of the revenue they raise for the public purse. Data from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0958928711425266">HM Revenue and Customs (2010b)</xref> shows that for 2009–10, the top revenue-raising taxes were: income tax (£134 billion), national insurance contributions (£95 billion), VAT (£67 billion), corporation tax (£33 billion) and fuel duties (£26 billion). National insurance contains contributions from employers, employees and the self-employed. The balance of contributions made by the different taxes has followed a similar pattern for the past decade. The contribution made by the different taxes will alter in the next few years because of changes introduced by the Conservative–Liberal Democrat coalition government. For example, in 2011 VAT rose from 17.5 percent to 20 percent. However, the taxes above are likely to remain the most important contributors to tax revenues in the future. As well as asking people about the above taxes, participants were asked for their opinions towards inheritance tax. This is because previous research suggests that inheritance tax seems to stoke particular unpopularity among the public (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0958928711425266">Lewis and White, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0958928711425266">Hedges and Bromley, 2001</xref>). Inheritance tax raised about £2 billion in 2009–10. The focus group discussions also included tobacco duties (£8 billion) to include one of the lower revenue-raising taxes as a comparison to inheritance tax.</p>
<p>The groups then focused on different combinations of taxes. This looked at two main themes. First, the groups considered the balance between the taxation of earned and unearned income. The focus group discussions did this to explore whether moral arguments could be used to shape attitudes to combinations of taxes. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0958928711425266">Atkinson (1972)</xref> says that rewarding a work ethic means that people should be allowed to keep a greater proportion of earned over unearned income. This points to a system in which emphasis is placed on taxes such as inheritance tax rather than on income tax (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0958928711425266">Batchelder, 2010</xref>). The UK periodical <italic>New Statesman</italic> provides recent backing for this idea in a leader comment calling for a system that: ‘shifts the burden of taxation from earned to unearned income; from taxes on income and consumption to those on property, inheritance and land’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0958928711425266"><italic>New Statesman</italic>, 2011</xref>). The notion of unearned income in the groups was understood mainly to refer to a situation where a person did not work for the income themselves. The groups did not have time to explore other sources of unearned income or wealth, such as income from various investments. However, the role that house price rises play in public attitudes towards wealth taxation has been explored elsewhere. This study found that perceptions of a windfall gain in property prices could boost support for wealth taxation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0958928711425266">Prabhakar, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>The second theme looked at was the combination of consumption versus income taxes. This would mean a system that stresses taxes such as VAT, alcohol duties or tobacco duties rather than income taxes. The focus group interviews examined this because consumption taxes have been a topic of recent policy debate. For example, the OECD produced a policy brief in 2007 asking whether consumption taxes are the way of the future. This is because of the argument that consumption taxes are better for economic growth than income taxes as they involve lower taxation of savings and investments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0958928711425266">Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>The final part of the focus group interviews asked people for their attitudes to public spending, which was used here to capture attitudes towards the benefits of taxation.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0958928711425266">
<title>What do people think of different taxes?</title>
<p>People were asked initially to think about the following taxes: income tax, national insurance contributions, VAT, corporation tax, fuel duties, inheritance tax and tobacco duties. People were asked if there were any taxes from the list that they particularly disliked. The aim was to get people to compare taxes and not just think about taxes individually.</p>
<p>Two taxes were highlighted across the different groups. These were inheritance tax and fuel duties. These were singled out as the most unpopular in the groups. However, there were differences in the order of unpopularity of these taxes in the groups. The groups of older people tended to name inheritance tax as the most unpopular tax. Concerns about how inheritance tax would affect the wealth that older people wanted to pass to their children seemed to drive this unhappiness. This excited more attention perhaps among older than younger people because the former were at an age where decisions about passing wealth on are more pressing.</p>
<p>Rational choice theory might explain this unhappiness, with parents keen to reduce the tax bill of their children. Moral considerations also seemed to be an important influence on their attitudes. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0958928711425266">Beckert (2008)</xref> notes that inheritance tax involves a series of values organized around equal opportunity, justice, community and the family. What dominated the discussion among the groups was a belief in the right of parents to transfer wealth to family members. As will be seen later, seeing this tax as part of a system that taxes unearned income more heavily than earned income brought other ideas into play, for example the importance of a work ethic. This signalled how different moral arguments could be used to shape attitudes in different ways.</p>
<p>The specific objection during this part of the discussions was based mainly on a ‘double taxation’ argument. In particular, respondents argued that as they had already paid tax while building up the estate, it is wrong that this money should be taxed again through an inheritance tax.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>You work hard for your money. If you’ve actually got something at the end of your life then you’re taxed on it again. You were already taxed on it when you earned it. I don’t see why your children, or whoever you leave it to, should be taxed again. (Female, 45+, low/middle income)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Rational choice theory might be used to explain this double taxation objection. As noted above, self-interest allows people to have preferences for the welfare of others. Rational choice theory may mean that parents wish to minimize the taxes of their offspring. Although this theory might be used to explain double taxation, most participants tended to draw on moral arguments when discussing double taxation, saying, for example, that this is unfair. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0958928711425266">White (2008)</xref> questions whether this objection is coherent as the dead do not pay tax and so are not double taxed. Most participants did not see the issue in this way, and argued the key issue is the money itself that is being taxed.</p>
<p>However, this defence raises the question of whether people also recognize that other taxes involve double taxation. For example, if someone pays VAT on an item after they have paid income tax, then presumably VAT is a double tax. In fact, any system with many taxes can give rise to double taxation.</p>
<p>When this point was put to the groups, most people accepted that multiple taxes involve double taxation, but most said that difference between VAT and inheritance tax is that for the former people exercise a choice when making spending decisions. One might qualify this by saying that personal choice does not apply for any VAT imposed on spending on essentials such as food. This is arguably less of an issue in the UK, though, because the tax base for VAT excludes many essential items of spending, such as food (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0958928711425266">Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, 2011</xref>).</p>
<sec id="section7-0958928711425266">
<title>Fuel duties</title>
<p>The younger age groups tended to cite fuel duties as their most unpopular tax. This might have been because for them fuel duties are likely to be a more pressing issue than thinking about what assets to pass on to the next generation.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>I do a lot of driving and it costs me an absolute fortune and I know how much of it is tax. All this thing about green, okay, I’m as green as the next person. All this thing about green, I do not believe that the money they raise in the revenue on the petrol in any way, shape or form, goes towards helping the UK reduce its emissions. It doesn’t, it just supports the government and that’s all it does. (Female, 18–44, low/middle income)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The main reason people were unhappy with fuel duties was because they said the price of fuel is much cheaper in other countries (such as the US). Tax was used to explain these price differences. This shows that respondents do compare taxes in certain circumstances, although they are thinking here of a single tax and comparing it across countries rather than within a system.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>I’ve been out in the States, and fuel is the price of water, and here it is just extortionate. I just filled up my car and its cost me £75, you have to check your bank balance before you fill up your car these days, because fuel is so expensive, and a lot of that is tax. (Male, 18–44, high income)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Although inheritance tax and fuel duties were singled out most of all, this was part of a wider discontent with all taxes. This discontent was driven by issues such as how taxes are spent, which is discussed below.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-0958928711425266">
<title>Which taxes do people accept?</title>
<p>The above reports taxes that people disliked. The sessions then reversed this question by asking whether there were any taxes that they accepted. There was general support for taxes that involve an element of choice. This concerned particularly the imposition of tobacco or alcohol taxes. People thought it was fair that ‘sins’ such as smoking or drinking alcohol should be taxed. However, there was scepticism that sin taxes would do much to change behaviour. ‘I used to smoke 25 years ago. The tax wasn’t a problem. The same with drink. I like a pint, and unless it gets ridiculous, and it’s £100 a pint. When I go for a pint, I don’t think, “I’m paying so much tax”’ (male, 45+, low/middle income).</p>
<p>There was also general acceptance of the principle of income tax in the groups. People stated that income tax was needed to pay for things such as public services. Although most respondents accepted the principle of income tax, worries were raised about the ease with which richer people were able to avoid paying income tax as well a concern that the higher rates of income tax started at too low a level. ‘Income tax we all have to pay, yes, which is fine … but it just really annoys me that normal people that go to work and get taxed, pay their tax and there are so many people fiddling that system and not paying tax’ (female, 18–44, low/middle income).</p>
<p>Criticism of tax avoidance was in fact one of the themes of the groups, and helped shape responses to other questions. For example, one of the reasons why people voiced support for a consumption tax system considered below was that they thought this would reduce avoidance compared with an income-based system. Part of the worry about avoidance was rooted in moral concerns that fairness requires that people contribute to the public purse. However, there was a rational choice side to the argument because tax avoidance on one tax means higher taxes are needed elsewhere to meet a shortfall in revenue wrought by avoidance.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-0958928711425266">
<title>How much do people know about taxation?</title>
<p>Previous research cited above suggests that members of the public make systematic mistakes about taxation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0958928711425266">Gemmell et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0958928711425266">Rowlingson and McKay, 2005</xref>). To explore this further, the groups were asked questions about the different taxes. The aim was to see if people make errors when comparing taxes, and if so, whether the provision of information would change opinions. People were asked which taxes from the list given at the start of the discussions they thought raised the most money for the exchequer. The aim was to see if people knew the relative importance of different taxes for the public purse.</p>
<p>There was patchy knowledge about the relative contribution of the different taxes to the public purse among all of the groups. However, there were notable differences between the different income groups. The low/middle income groups were both more likely to cite tobacco duties as the top revenue-raising tax. Official statistics suggest there are higher rates of smoking among lower social-economic groups. Data for 2008/9 show that 30 percent of people in routine and manual occupations smoke compared with 15 percent in managerial and professional occupations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0958928711425266">Office for National Statistics, 2009</xref>). Low/middle income groups might cite tobacco duties more because they smoke more than other groups. That is, people pick those taxes that are more visible to them. Only the younger, high-income group correctly identified income tax as the top revenue tax, although they also made mistakes about the role of other taxes. All the groups overstated the contribution of corporation taxes to public finances, though there was also recognition that companies might compensate for this partially through their employer contributions to national insurance.</p>
<p>People were then asked if any of them had revised their attitude towards different taxes having heard the information about tax revenues. Within the groups, some people reported that their attitudes had changed. However, more seemed inclined to stick to their original positions, and instead adapt the new information to suit their original arguments.</p>
<p>To confirm whether or not the provision of information had changed how people compared different taxes, people were asked at the end of this section of the focus group discussions if they were able to abolish one tax, then which tax would they choose. People were told that the revenue from the abolished tax would then be raised from other taxes.</p>
<p>Some people reported that the issue of abolition did not matter as revenues would still be raised elsewhere. For these respondents, it was the overall tax bill that was important rather than which particular taxes were used to raise this. ‘I’d just rather pay less overall. It doesn’t matter how. It seems to me that it’s about as complicated as it could get right now’ (male, 18–44, low/middle income).</p>
<p>Others tended to repeat the answers given in the first part of the session, namely to abolish fuel duties or inheritance tax. For these people, it was important which particular taxes constitute their tax bill. Although there might be a rational concern with specific taxes (such as fuel duties), moral concerns also seemed to be important for understanding objections to particular taxes (such as inheritance tax).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-0958928711425266">
<title>A single tax system?</title>
<p>The double taxation objection to inheritance tax was used within the focus group interviews to open up a wider discussion of whether people would prefer a tax system in which there is a single tax over one in which there are multiple taxes. If people do not like double taxation then one solution is to have a system in which there is only one tax. Most respondents were lukewarm about this option. One reason given was that under a single tax people might have to contribute to tax revenues that they were not previously liable. There was also recognition that the tax system has different aims that are unlikely to be met through a single tax. ‘I don’t think you can ever have a system where there is one tax, because I’m not going to pay for a corporation element of tax, neither am I going to pay the bit that comes out of tobacco tax’ (female, 18–44, high income).</p>
<p>Some of those in the high-income groups reported, however, that one advantage of such a move would be that the tax system would be simpler to understand.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-0958928711425266">
<title>What do people think of different combinations of taxes?</title>
<p>The reaction to inheritance tax as well as disapproval of tax avoidance shows how moral arguments were important for participants when comparing taxes. The sessions then built on this by exploring a moral argument for combining taxes in a particular way. The groups were told that one view is that people should be allowed to keep a greater proportion of earned over unearned income because they had worked for it themselves.</p>
<p>Most people in the groups had not thought about the issue in this way. Most could see logic behind this argument. Some people reported surprise as it had led them to rethink their initial objection to inheritance tax.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>I actually like that idea …. It seems more equitable. If you going out and grafting to actually get more in, and pay less tax out, as opposed to winning the lottery and paying the same on income tax as you would on that, I think it seems more equitable. (Male, 45+, low/middle income)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>As noted above, the sessions did not have time to examine all the different sources of unearned income. People thought that it was fairer that people were allowed to keep more of the income that they worked for themselves than unearned income. However, reservations were also expressed about taxing inheritances more heavily than earned income. One view was that although the inheritor did not work for this money, the person who had given it had worked for this money. Some people were also worried that taxing inheritances more heavily could risk blaming people for receiving an inheritance.</p>
<sec id="section12-0958928711425266">
<title>Consumption tax system</title>
<p>To extend the discussion about different types of taxation, people were then asked about a system in which they are taxed mainly on their spending rather than income. This would mean more weight placed on VAT, fuel duties, tobacco duties and less on other taxes. There was support in the groups for a consumption tax system, notwithstanding the opposition to fuel duties. When they discussed this they saw it as being based mainly on VAT. Those who liked it argued this created a link between personal choice and tax as people would only pay tax once they had decided to spend money. People added that would be harder to avoid paying consumption taxes than income taxes, and that foreign tourists to the UK would be liable for consumption taxes but not income taxes. ‘Because then it’s my choice. If I choose to buy that, I am being taxed on it, if I don’t choose to buy it, I’m not. Whereas income tax I pay whether there is spending or not’ (female, 18–44, high income).</p>
<p>This support tended to be offset, however, by the view that a consumption tax system would hit the poorest in society the hardest (although this depends in fact on the scope of the tax, that is, on the various exemptions and zero ratings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0958928711425266">Crossley et al., 2009</xref>)). There were worries that people on lower incomes would be paying more tax as a proportion of their income than those on higher incomes. There were also practical worries about what the level of VAT would have to be if it replaced income tax.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section13-0958928711425266">
<title>Spending</title>
<p>The rational choice approach suggests that people consider the benefits as well as costs of taxation. The annual British Social Attitudes survey has a set of questions about general taxation and spending. Findings from the British Social Attitudes survey suggest a drop in support for increased public spending since the 1980s. In 1987, 62 percent of respondents backed tax rises to pay for health and education compared with 39 percent in 2010 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0958928711425266">Park et al., 2010</xref>). To explore the benefits of taxation, the groups were asked for their views of government spending. The idea that government wastes money was usually an initial response in the groups. Perhaps this was unsurprising given the media stories in the UK about the need to reduce public expenditure (for example, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0958928711425266">Phibbs, 2010</xref>). However, participants usually had more nuanced views when their attitudes were probed further.</p>
<p>Many respondents claimed they lacked the information to make a proper judgement of this issue. There was interest here in having a more transparent system. The idea that people lacked enough information was shared among the different age and income groups. The impact of the provision of such information on public attitudes can be exaggerated because, as seen above in the discussion of how much people know about taxation, people can adapt information to suit their existing views. ‘It’s very hard to gauge, I think, a lot of people don’t really know how taxes are spent, they just suspect they are not being spent properly’ (female, 18–44, high income).</p>
<p>People were also asked within the focus group discussions what they thought of the view that inefficiency and waste is likely to be a feature of any large organization, whether this is in the private or public sectors. Most respondents accepted this. Participants also accepted there were areas in which government spent money well. When people were asked to give an example of this, they usually cited the example of the National Health Service.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>I can say something because I’ve firsthand experience. I have a friend who is severely disabled. Now for her we live in the best country in the world. She has fantastic housing. Her daughter has had support. She’s very intelligent and is going to university. She has now got transport. She has no income, not low income. She has no income. When I look at somebody like her and the attention, she has to know how to work the system, or I have to know how to work the system, to get it for her. If she was sitting around this table she would have that counter argument because for her on a personal level, she’s in a different situation to us, I can’t knock it. (Female, 45+, high income)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Although there were reservations about government spending, with criticisms of the previous Labour government’s decision to go to war in Iraq in 2003, most people in the groups saw that taxes yielded benefits as well as costs. This tempered the criticisms of taxation.</p>

<sec id="section14-0958928711425266">
<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>This article has explored three questions about public attitudes to taxation. The first question explored attitudes to particular taxes. Life cycle factors seem important when people compare taxes. Older people react negatively to inheritance tax while younger people were concerned with fuel duties. This suggests public disquiet with a tax system that has a prominent role for either of these taxes in the UK.</p>
<p>The second question looked at how people react to different combinations of taxes. There was little appetite for a system built on a single tax. Although there were concerns about double taxation, people usually accepted a multiple tax system. Moral arguments were important for shaping attitudes to mixes of tax. People were moved by moral arguments about taxing unearned income more heavily than earned income. This caused some to revise their opposition to inheritance tax, although overall opposition to this tax remained strong. Nevertheless, this showed how attitudes to a particular tax could change if it was seen as a part of a combination of taxes. Those taxes associated with personal choice (such as VAT) tended to attract more support than other taxes. However, this acceptance needs to be qualified by unhappiness with fuel duties. Although this tax also involves choice, it was thought UK levels are too high compared with rates elsewhere.</p>
<p>The third question examined attitudes to spending. People made references to public spending throughout the groups. This showed how people thought about benefits as well as costs when thinking about taxation. Although a perception of government waste was an initial reaction of the respondents, when probed further, most accepted that public spending brought useful benefits. There was a desire for greater transparency of the connection between taxation and spending, although the impact of more information on changing opinion can be overstated.</p>
<p>Various implications can be drawn from the above findings. One implication is that empirical studies of public opinion should ask people to consider taxes as part of the wider tax system. The focus group results reported in this article shows how attitudes to particular taxes can change if people are asked explicitly to consider taxes as part of the wider tax system. This is because people then engage in trade-offs between different taxes. Such an approach is valuable for designing a tax system because a tax system usually involves multiple taxes.</p>
<p>The results also suggest that underlying ideas or principles can mould public attitudes to taxation. This can be seen in the way that the idea of a work ethic influenced attitudes to the taxation of unearned rather than earned income. Embedding debates within a wider moral framework is one way in which policy-makers might try to build public support for a tax system. The introduction of this article notes that <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0958928711425266">Mirrlees et al. (2010a</xref>) endorses a progressive, neutral tax system for the 21st century. The findings in the focus groups suggest that there would be public support for a principle of progressive taxation.</p>
<p>The findings also highlight that policy-makers should pay attention to life cycle issues if they wish to win public support for the tax system. This means that policy-makers might consider how taxes combine over a person’s lifetime as well as how different taxes combine at any point in time. For example, further survey work might examine public attitudes to the preferred mix of income tax and inheritance tax over a person’s lifetime. This underlines the point that public attitude work should move away from considering taxes in isolation from each other and look more at how taxes combine to form a tax system.</p>

<p>Inheritance tax in the UK is a misnomer as this is a tax imposed on the final estate rather than on the amount a person inherits. However, this article refers to inheritance tax throughout for convenience because this is the label used within public debates of this tax as well as the relevant legislation in the UK.</p>
