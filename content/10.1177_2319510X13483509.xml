<abstract>
<p>Sustainable development efforts presented on a piece of paper take the shape of a sustainability report, also labelled as sustainable development report. Sustainability report integrates economic, environmental and social performance of the company into one report. This study compares the sustainable development efforts by companies in developed (USA) and developing (India) nations. The recent sustainability reports from a three-year period that is 2008–2011 of AMEX major market index (USA) and SENSEX companies (India) are studied using content analysis. Independent sample <italic>t</italic> test and ANOVA have been used to compare the reports of the said countries. The results of the analysis show that companies are now more aware of sustainable development. Out of 20 AMEX major market index companies, 14 companies are providing sustainability information in a separate sustainability report while in case of SENSEX there are 16 companies out of 30 that are producing sustainability reports. In USA greater percentage of companies is disclosing sustainability information, while the quantity of information disclosed as per GRI’s G3 guidelines, in sustainability reports is more in the case of Indian companies.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Financial reporting is a tool through which companies communicate with various stakeholders but this established framework gives a curtailed picture of business activities as it precludes information about an entity’s social and environmental activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-2319510X13483509">Farneti &amp; Guthrie, 2009</xref>, p. 91). So, companies are communicating social and environmental dimension in conjunction with economic dimension through sustainability reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-2319510X13483509">Daub, 2007</xref>, p. 75). In recent years, prompted by the wave of mega-size corporate scandals in the developed and developing economies in general and promoted by worldwide concerns about social and environmental issues, research on sustainability has increased. This practice is escalating all over and benefits society and environment alike but it is voluntary and no obligatory regulation is governing it. However, Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) is the body which plays an essential role by devising guidelines for drafting sustainability reports.</p>
<p>Sustainability reporting is not country specific; it is followed in both developed and developing countries. Some studies were found on comparison but they exclusively related to comparison within developed nations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-2319510X13483509">Steurer &amp; Konrad, 2009</xref>) or developing nations like SIRAN (Social Investment Research Analysis Network), KLD &amp; Social Investment Forum (2008). The researcher has not come across any study that has compared sustainability reporting in developed and developing economies. So, the present study is an attempt to compare the sustainability reporting practices of India (developing country) and USA (developed country).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-2319510X13483509">
<title>Literature Review</title>
<p>Plenty of literature is available on corporate disclosure but on sustainability reporting the availability is meagre. Clelland, Dean, Douglas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-2319510X13483509">2000</xref>) in their study of 250 US firms found that the higher pollution efficient firms appeared to be most operationally efficient manufacturers and implemented waste minimisation practices earlier. Further, Belal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-2319510X13483509">2001</xref>) illustrated that 97 per cent companies of Bangladesh had made some voluntary disclosure which was mainly descriptive. However, the quantity of information disclosed was very less. Similarly, Roberts &amp; Koeplin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-2319510X13483509">2007</xref>) found that the Portuguese companies emphasised more on social reporting, while environmental reporting was less stressed. Further, Guthrie &amp; Farneti (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-2319510X13483509">2008</xref>), established that only 32 per cent of the GRI’s elements were used by the selected Australian organisations and the Labour Practices category showed the highest disclosure that is 54 per cent.</p>
<p>Some studies like SIRAN (Social Investment Research Analysis Network), KLD and Social Investment Forum (2008) examined the current level of sustainability reporting and found that South Africa was the leading country while energy was the best sector. Besides, Steurer and Konrad (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-2319510X13483509">2009</xref>) revealed that CR reporting is more popular in Western European (WE) than Central Eastern European (CEE). Moreover, environmental responsibility was more important in CEE companies and their stakeholders than WE. Huang and Wang (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-2319510X13483509">2010</xref>) investigated Chinese enterprises and found that the reporting system of some companies had arrived at high level, as compared to majority of companies that needed improvement in many aspects. Furthermore, Kolk (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-2319510X13483509">2010</xref>) showed sustainability reporting has been significantly increasing in all the countries from 39 per cent in 1999, to 52 per cent in 2002 and 69 per cent in 2005 and the increasing trend was followed by sectors too. Additionally, Elijido-Ten (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-2319510X13483509">2011</xref>) examined the extent of sustainability and balanced scorecard (BSC) public disclosure and found that all BSC disclosures provide sustainability disclosure but only half of the sustainability disclosures provide BSC disclosures. Also, Li et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-2319510X13483509">2011</xref>) found that the most emphasised area was environmental responsibility. Faisal et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-2319510X13483509">2012</xref>) empirically specified that the average level of sustainability disclosure is surprisingly high that is 61.9 per cent and indicated that high profile industries and additional assurance procedures persuade the disclosure of more sustainability information.</p>
<p>The review of literature reveals that not much work has been carried out to explore the comparison of sustainability reports of developed and developing economies. So, the present study attempts to fulfil this gap by comparing the sustainability reports of India (SENSEX) and USA (AMEX Major Market Index) companies.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-2319510X13483509">
<title>Objectives of the Study</title>
<p>The study proposes to examine and compare the level of sustainability reporting of SENSEX companies (30 companies) in India (developing country) and AMEX Major Market Index companies (20 companies) of USA (developed country) as per GRI framework. So, the hypothesis studied in present study is:</p>
<p>H<sub>0</sub>—There is no significant difference between disclosure score of SENSEX (India) and AMEX Major Market Index (USA) companies.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-2319510X13483509">
<title>Database and Research Methodology</title>
<p>GRI’s, G3 (third generation) guidelines are taken as a basis for analysis. BSE SENSEX (India) and AMEX Major Market Index (USA) companies accessed on 31 May 2012 (from <uri>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BSE_SENSEX</uri> and <uri>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amex_Major_MarketIndex</uri>) constitute the universe of this study. The companies whose sustainability reports were not prepared as per GRI framework were not considered. Since, sustainability reports are not published by the companies on annual basis, so the time frame of three years ending on 31 March 2011 that is, 2008–2009 to 2010–2011 was taken. And the companies which do not produce sustainability reports within a period of three years that is 2008–2009 to 2010–2011 were also eliminated. Thus as a result a sample of 16 Indian and 14 American companies was selected. The latest sustainability report published by the selected companies during this period was considered for the analysis.</p>
<p>For the purpose of analysis of the sustainable development reports content analysis was applied taking disclosure index (see <xref ref-type="app" rid="appendix2-2319510X13483509">Appendix 2</xref>) as per GRI’s G3 guidelines. It constitute 79 items with maximum score of 2 each (as 2 for full, 1 for partial and 0 for no disclosure) making the total possible score of 158 (79*2). Further, independent sample <italic>t</italic> test was applied to judge the significant difference between means of two groups, that is, India and USA and one way ANOVA has been used for inter industry comparison.</p>
<p>In this study disclosure in sustainability reports is studied in two parts:
<list id="list1-2319510X13483509" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>The extent of disclosure of companies has been measured from three angles; company wise disclosure, category wise disclosure and industry wise disclosure.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The comparison has been measured by group wise disclosure using <italic>t</italic> test.</p></list-item>
</list></p>

<title>Results and Discussions</title>
<p>The results and discussions have been divided into two parts. In the first part, the extent of disclosure of companies has been explored and the second part deals with comparison. Extent of sustainability disclosure of the companies in India and USA.</p>
<p>The extent of disclosure of companies has been examined with the help of disclosure score using content analysis from three angles—Company wise, Category wise and Industry wise.</p>

<title>Company-wise Disclosure</title>
<p>Company wise disclosure is accessible in <xref ref-type="app" rid="appendix1-2319510X13483509">Appendix 1</xref>. The disclosure score of items of information varies from 33 to 158 in case AMEX Major Market Index companies while the range of disclosure score is 69 to 154 in case of SENSEX companies. In USA first rank is obtained by Procter &amp; Gamble with percentage score of 100 per cent and it is shared with International business machine. The highest disclosure score of 100 per cent is followed by Dow chemical (89.24 per cent) and General electric (72.15 per cent). 3M company occupies the lowest position in sustainability information disclosure with the percentage score of 20.89 per cent. While in case of India, TATA Steel leads all these companies by attaining first rank with the total score of 152/152 followed by Tata Consultancy Services (97.47 per cent) and Reliance Industries (95.57 per cent). The least score percentage that is 43.67 per cent has been obtained by Hindalco Industries. (See <xref ref-type="app" rid="appendix1-2319510X13483509">Appendix 1</xref>)</p>

<sec id="section8-2319510X13483509">
<title>Category-wise Disclosure</title>
<p>In this section, aggregated disclosure scores for each of the three categories that is economic, environmental and social has been calculated. This is to determine the highest reported category out of three categories mentioned above for Indian and American companies. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-2319510X13483509">Table 1</xref> presents the category wise disclosure both in absolute figures as well as in percentages for sample companies from India and USA.</p>

<p>The maximum score is of economic category in both countries that is 86.8 per cent (India) and 66.4 per cent (USA). In India economic category is followed by social (82.2 per cent) and environmental (76.97 per cent) category while in USA environmental disclosure (64.97 per cent) is more than social disclosure (49.91 per cent). Social category is sub-divided into four categories—Labour practices &amp; decent work, Human rights, Society and Product responsibility. In India, society (84.65 per cent) is followed by human rights (80.14 per cent) and Labour practices &amp; decent work (79.51 per cent) while the disclosure of product responsibility is lowest that is 75.17 per cent. However, in case of USA also, the disclosure of society is highest that is 56.76 per cent but it is followed by Labour practices &amp; decent work (52.34 per cent), instead of human rights (45.93 per cent) while product responsibility (43.7 per cent) has lowest score as in case of India. It is noted that the disclosure of all categories in India is far better than USA. So, we find that sustainability reports are more informative in case of Indian companies.</p>

<sec id="section9-2319510X13483509">
<title>Industry-wise Disclosure</title>
<p>Companies have been divided in various industry groups as depicted in <xref ref-type="app" rid="appendix1-2319510X13483509">Appendix 1</xref>. It shows that the companies belonging to different industries have variations in their mean disclosure score for both countries of the study. When we look at means it is found that computer hardware and software industry is leading in case of Indian companies with mean of 87.76 while in case of USA it is following chemical industry (72.47) with a mean score of 71.52. Findings also reveals that certain industries like oil and energy and computer hardware and software are common in both countries. The mean disclosure score of Oil and energy industry in case of Indian companies (85.15 per cent) is far better than that of USA that is 50.42 per cent. Similarly in case of computer hardware and software it is 87.76 per cent for India better than 71.52 per cent (USA) (see <xref ref-type="app" rid="appendix1-2319510X13483509">Appendix 1</xref>). Mean disclosures of industries shows difference so one way ANOVA was also applied to do inter industry comparison for statistical conclusions. But no significant difference was found. The results of ANOVA have been presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-2319510X13483509">Tables 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-2319510X13483509">3</xref>.</p>

So, null hypothesis is rejected and alternate accepted. From the above analysis it is clear that mean of Indian companies that is 80.8662 is more than American companies that is 58.1221. It signifies that sustainability disclosure by Indian companies is more than that of USA.</p>

<title>Managerial Implications</title>
<p>Sustainability reporting is a communication tool between a company and its stakeholders, so stakeholders are really important. Investors, one of the major stakeholders, all over the world have also started attaching more importance to environmental and social performance and prefer making investments in companies going in for green initiatives. They are interested in risk inherent in and return provided by their investment as they are the ultimate financial risk takers. The present study reveals that a greater percentage of companies have indulged in disclosing sustainability information in USA as compared to India, while the quantity of information disclosed as per GRI’s G3 guidelines, is more in the case of Indian companies. So, the simple idea is that most of the big companies are providing sustainability information which provides the base for responsible investors to take wise decision, to invest in socially and environmentally concerned company.</p>

<sec id="section13-2319510X13483509" sec-type="conclusions">
<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>The concept of sustainability reporting is reaching the roots of the global business community. Companies are showing concern in sustainability disclosures but here arise a problem in determining the level of disclosure and in comparison, as negligence is a common feature because of absence of mandatory provisions. The initiatives of Global Reporting Initiative are expected to improve sustainability disclosure in near future. This study contributes to understanding of sustainability disclosure practices by comparing firms in India (a developing country) and USA (a developed country). The analysis reveals that the number of sustainability reports is more popular in USA but as far as content quality and quantity is concerned Indian reports are more informative as per GRI framework. It is crystal clear from the above discussion that the sustainability of the company’s operations continues to be one of the main targets.</p>

<title>Limitations and Scope for Further Research</title>
<p>The present research studied the disclosure practices without considering the differences in sizes of Indian firms and US firms. Various other corporate attributes like profit, leverage, etc., can also affect the sustainability disclosure by firms, so future research can be done on finding relationships between levels of sustainability disclosures and corporate attributes. Further research could also be done taking the sustainability reports of the companies from different countries. Moreover, this article examined the incidence of disclosure in terms of numbers only and further does not considers the significance or impact of the various initiatives taken by the firms, consequently future research can focus on them in more detail.</p>

<p>Above table shows that divergent companies call sustainability report by divergent names like corporate citizenship report, corporate responsibility report, GRI report, Corporate sustainability report, Sustainable development report etc. with different prefixes and suffixes. However, this divergence is less in case of Indian companies as compared to American companies. The length of report also varies as 52 pages (Tata Power) to 200 pages (Mahindra &amp; Mahindra) in case of India and 50 pages (Coca cola) to 244 pages (Hewlett Packard). Moreover, the reporting period of sustainability report is not same, this variation is also more in case of USA, some reports are for period 1 January 2010 to 31 December 2010 (International business machine), and some are of 1 July 2010 to 30 June 2011( Procter &amp; gamble) while some reporting periods ended on 31 October (Hewlett Packard). It was also found that in most of the cases whether in USA or India the reporting period is annual while in few cases like Tata Power (India) and Walt Disney (USA) it is biennial.</p>
