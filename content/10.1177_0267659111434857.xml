<p>Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) has emerged as an effective mechanical support following cardiac surgery with respiratory and cardiac failure. However, there are no clear indications for ECMO use after pediatric cardiac surgery. We retrospectively reviewed medical records of 76 pediatric patients [mean age, 10.8 months (0–86); mean weight, 5.16 kg (1.16–16.5)] with congenital heart disease who received ECMO following cardiac surgery between January 1997 and October 2010. Forty-five patients were treated with an aggressive ECMO approach (aggressive ECMO group, April 2005–October 2010) and 31 with a delayed ECMO approach (delayed ECMO group, January 1997–March 2005). Demographics, diagnosis, operative variables, ECMO indication, and duration of survivors and non-survivors were compared. Thirty-four patients (75.5%) were successfully weaned from ECMO in the aggressive ECMO group and 26 (57.7%) were discharged. Conversely, eight patients (25.8%) were successfully weaned from ECMO in the delayed ECMO group and two (6.5%) were discharged. Forty-five patients with shunted single ventricle physiology (aggressive: 29 patients, delayed: 16 patients) received ECMO, but only 15 (33.3%) survived and were discharged. The survival rate of the aggressive ECMO group was significantly better when compared with the delayed ECMO group (p&lt;0.01). Also, ECMO duration was significantly shorter among the aggressive ECMO group survivors (96.5 ± 62.9 h, p&lt;0.01). Thus, the aggressive ECMO approach is a superior strategy compared to the delayed ECMO approach in pediatric cardiac patients. The aggressive ECMO approach improved our outcomes of neonatal and pediatric ECMO.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) has emerged as an effective mechanical support following cardiac surgery with respiratory and cardiac failure. In 1976, Bartlett et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0267659111434857">1</xref></sup> reported the successful use of ECMO for a neonatal patient with respiratory failure and, since then, ECMO has been used effectively for a variety of indications, including preoperative hemodynamic support, low cardiac output after cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB), sudden cardiac arrest, and as a bridge to heart transplantation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0267659111434857">2</xref></sup>. The Extracorporeal Life Support Organization (ELSO) Registry reports that the rates of survival off ECMO and survival to discharge among neonatal cardiac patients are 59% and 39%, respectively; in pediatric patients, these values are 62% and 46%, respectively. The rates of survival off ECMO and to discharge among neonates subject to extracorporeal cardiopulmonary resuscitation are 63% and 37% and, in pediatric patients, these rates are 52% and 38%, respectively<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0267659111434857">3</xref></sup>. Outcomes of ECMO have been developing and still have been keeping the improvement scope for better outcomes, especially in patients with congenital heart disease.</p>
<p>In our institute, we did not have any criteria for ECMO introduction until March 2005, but we changed our strategy of ECMO therapy and introduced an aggressive approach toward indications for ECMO from April 2005 wherein we did not hesitate to introduce ECMO. Before we had changed our strategy of ECMO therapy in April 2005, we had felt the negative image of ECMO because of our poor results of survival off ECMO in patients with congenital heart disease.</p>
<p>The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of this aggressive approach of ECMO initiation since we changed our strategy compared with the previously followed delayed approach for introducing ECMO after pediatric cardiac surgery, by reviewing our single center experiences.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-0267659111434857" sec-type="materials|methods">
<title>Materials and methods</title>
<p>We retrospectively reviewed medical records of 76 pediatric patients with congenital heart disease who received ECMO following cardiac surgery between January 1997 and October 2010 at Okayama University Hospital, Japan.</p>
<p>Two groups were compared: those who were treated with the aggressive ECMO approach (45 patients from April 2005 to October 2010) and those who were treated with the delayed ECMO approach (31 patients from January 1997 to March 2005). The aggressive ECMO approach was defined as commencement of ECMO as early as possible before end-organ dysfunction or complete circulatory collapse, and without hesitation for the introduction of ECMO. The outcomes were categorized as follows: survived off ECMO (successful weaning from ECMO support), survival to hospital discharge, and survival during outpatient follow-up. Demographics, diagnosis, operative variables, and ECMO indication and duration of survivors and non-survivors were compared. We compared the lactate levels of both groups before and 2 hours after the introduction of ECMO.</p>
<p>We defined the indications for aggressive ECMO as follows: mean arterial blood pressure less than 35 mmHg, anuria, high lactate level (greater than 5.0 mmol/L) and acidosis with a pH less than 7.3, hypoxia with arterial oxygen saturation less than 60% with 100% FiO<sub>2</sub> (fraction of inspired oxygen) on mechanical ventilatory support. ECMO was established via a median sternotomy and cannulation of the ascending aorta or inominate artery for return, and drainage via a 3-mm polytetrafluoroethylene graft to the right atrium (in cases after a Norwood stage 1 procedure). For patients with a right ventricle (RV) to pulmonary artery (PA) shunt after a Norwood stage 1 procedure in hypoplastic left heart syndrome, we opened the RV-PA shunt and controlled the pulmonary blood flow by the degree of clipping the shunt.</p>
<p>We used a hollow-fiber membrane oxygenator (Biocube®; Nipro, Osaka, Japan) and a centrifugal pump (Gyro®; Kyocera, Kyoto, Japan) with a 6-mm heparin-coated tube (Biomate®; Toyobo, Osaka, Japan) for the ECMO device. The initial ECMO flow rate was set at 150–180 ml/kg/min. Anticoagulation was accomplished by drip infusion of sodium heparin to maintain an activated clotting time of 150–200 seconds. The hemoglobin concentration was maintained above 10 g/dL by transfusion of packed red blood cells during full support. We maintained the bladder temperature at 35°C and applied minimal ventilatory support during ECMO. The intrathoracic cavity was irrigated with sterile, warmed, normal saline every 3 days.</p>
<p>We tried to wean the patient off ECMO when the lactate level was less than 2.0 mmol/L, the urine output had increased to equal or greater than 1.0 ml/kg/h for as long as 24 h, and the arterial pulse pressure had increased to equal or greater than 10 mmHg. We started inotropic agents for 6 h and gradually reduced the ECMO flow rate under stable hemodynamic conditions. We weaned the patient off ECMO within 12 h.</p>
<p>Descriptive statistics are expressed as mean ± standard deviation (<italic>s</italic>). The χ<sup>2</sup> test for a (2 × N) table, Kruskal-Wallis test and Student’s t-test were used to evaluate differences between the groups for statistical significance. A p-value of &lt;0.05 was considered to have statistical significance.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>The mean age of all patients was 10.8 months (range, 0 days–86 months) and the mean weight was 5.16 kg (1.16–16.5 kg). The demographic data of both aggressive ECMO and delayed ECMO are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0267659111434857">Table 1</xref>. Cardiopulmonary bypass time (aggressive: 187.20 ± 117.48 min, delayed: 194.90 ± 115.33; p=0.400) and aortic cross-clamp time (aggressive: 79.93 ± 44.01 min, delayed: 64.62 ± 44.78 min; p=0.105) during surgery were not significantly different. Thirty-four patients (75.5%) from the aggressive ECMO group (n = 45) survived off ECMO and 26 patients (57.7%) survived to hospital discharge (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0267659111434857">Table 2</xref>). Eight patients (25.8%) from the delayed ECMO group (n = 31) survived off ECMO and 2 patients (6.5%) survived to hospital discharge (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0267659111434857">Table 2</xref>). Thirty-one patients (31/76, 40.8%) had biventricular physiology and 45 patients (45/76, 59.2%) single ventricle physiology. All the patients with single ventricle physiology treated with delayed ECMO died in the hospital (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0267659111434857">Table 3</xref>). The patients with biventricular physiology treated with the aggressive ECMO had significantly better results than the other groups. The patients who survived off ECMO and hospital discharge following the aggressive ECMO had significantly shorter ECMO duration than those following delayed ECMO (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0267659111434857">Table 4</xref>).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>ECMO support following pediatric cardiac surgery provides effective support for postoperative cardiac and pulmonary dysfunction refractory to conventional medical management<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0267659111434857">4</xref></sup>. ECMO is an advanced therapy for acute cardiac and/or respiratory failure associated with congenital heart disease and pulmonary disease<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0267659111434857">5</xref></sup>. Indications for ECMO are affected by many factors, including ventricular function, magnitude of conventional inotropic support, and pulmonary function. No standard indication criteria or management guidelines have been established for ECMO in congenital heart disease because of its complex nature and specificity of use<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0267659111434857">6</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>At our institution, in April 2005, the approach for ECMO was changed from a delayed ECMO approach, where patients were managed without ECMO for as long as possible, to an aggressive ECMO approach, where patients were indicated for ECMO as early as possible before a catastrophic event such as cardiac arrest occurred. In our results, the aggressive ECMO approach revealed a significantly better result in terms of ECMO survival and survival to hospital discharge than the delayed ECMO approach.</p>
<p>Ungeleider et al. have suggested that mechanical assistance should be routine after a Norwood stage 1 procedure and described an aggressive approach of mechanical assistance improving hospital survival rate<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0267659111434857">7</xref></sup>. Cooper et al. have suggested that the initiation of ECMO support should be based on “urgent” rather than “emergency” criteria, i.e., before the occurrence of end-organ dysfunction or circulatory collapse<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0267659111434857">8</xref></sup>. The risk factors for mortality due to ECMO are as follows: age below 1 month, male gender, long duration of mechanical ventilation support prior to introducing ECMO, and the development of renal or hepatic dysfunction during ECMO<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0267659111434857">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0267659111434857">9</xref></sup>. Following pediatric cardiac surgery, it is critical to maintain both systemic and pulmonary blood flow. The advantage of aggressive ECMO is the prevention of ventilator-induced lung injury caused by respiratory care injuries resulting from setting up mechanical ventilation.</p>
<p>Booth et al. demonstrated that the survival of cardiac patients supported by ECMO is associated with indication and cardiac diagnosis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0267659111434857">2</xref></sup>. The ELSO Registry reported that rates of survival to weaning from ECMO and survival to hospital discharge were 59% and 39% in neonatal patients, and 62% and 46% in pediatric patients, respectively<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0267659111434857">3</xref></sup>. In our study, rates of survival to weaning from ECMO and survival to hospital discharge were 75.5% and 57.7%, respectively. Our aggressive ECMO approach was shown to be superior to that of the ELSO Registry average. Hence, the aggressive ECMO approach may result in better ECMO outcomes for patients with congenital heart disease than the delayed ECMO approach.</p>
<p>Patients with single ventricle physiology, especially those with hypoplastic left heart syndrome, had a significantly higher mortality rate than those with biventricular physiology<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0267659111434857">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0267659111434857">10</xref></sup>. In our review, the aggressive ECMO approach brings better outcomes, at least in patients with single ventricle physiology, than the delayed ECMO approach.</p>
<p>It is well known that long ECMO duration increases the risk of complications, such as bleeding, hemolysis, and systemic inflammatory syndrome. Long ECMO duration also increases the mortality rate associated with ECMO and may affect the progression of multiple organ dysfunction and have a negative influence on immunological systems<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0267659111434857">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0267659111434857">11</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0267659111434857">13</xref></sup>. A previous study of ours, as well as one by Baslaim et al., clearly indicated that patients with long ECMO duration (more than 3 days) may benefit less from ECMO support and may have an increased risk of mortality.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0267659111434857">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0267659111434857">10</xref></sup></p>
<p>In general, the purpose of pediatric ECMO as a mechanical circulatory support following cardiac surgery is recovery of cardiac function by unloading the right and left ventricle preloads and increasing the ECMO flow rate, as well as resting the lungs from the high demand for oxygen-saturated blood by the body. On the other hand, increasing the ECMO flow rate increases the left ventricular afterload and wall stress. These ECMO mismatches have a negative impact and outcome during pediatric ECMO following cardiac surgery. Hence, not only early introduction of ECMO, but also weaning as early as possible from ECMO might help to get better outcomes.</p>
<p>Several groups have reported improved survival in patients placed on ECMO in the operating room compared with those cannulated in the ICU<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0267659111434857">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0267659111434857">13</xref></sup>. Chaturvedi reported the avoidance of severe end-organ damage before restoration of adequate perfusion to pursue an aggressive approach for early indication of ECMO with the aim of reducing the morbidity and mortality associated with prolonged periods of hypoperfusion and cardiac arrest<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0267659111434857">13</xref></sup>. Our review also showed that it might be better to choose an aggressive ECMO approach of an early introduction of ECMO before progress to multiple organ dysfunctions could possibly prevent cardiac arrest, which results in a poor outcome. The ELSO Registry Report in 2009 showed a poor outcome for extracorporeal cardiopulmonary resuscitation after cardiac arrest, with survival rates of 26% in neonates, 47% in infants, and 39% in pediatric patients<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0267659111434857">3</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>In conclusion, we recommend an aggressive ECMO approach following pediatric cardiac surgery, which requires early introduction and early discontinuation of ECMO support before end-organ dysfunction and circulatory collapse, rather than the conventional approach of delaying ECMO introduction. The aggressive ECMO approach improved outcomes of ECMO therapy in our institution.</p>
