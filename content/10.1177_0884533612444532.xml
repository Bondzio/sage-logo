<abstract>
<p>Protein-losing enteropathy (PLE) is a complex disorder characterized by enteric protein loss and often is associated with cardiovascular abnormalities, particularly those with elevated central venous pressure. The Fontan operation is a surgical procedure used to palliate patients with a functional single ventricle. Although the Fontan operation eliminates cyanosis and decreases the workload of the functionally single ventricle, it also elevates central venous pressure. This can result in hepatic and enteric congestion as well as PLE. Despite the universal elevation in central venous pressure, only a fraction of patients who have had a Fontan operation develop PLE. However, PLE is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Presenting signs and symptoms of PLE include abdominal bloating, diarrhea, edema, pleural effusions, ascites, and failure to thrive. In this review, the authors discuss the diagnosis and prevalence of PLE after the Fontan operation and review currently available therapeutic strategies.</p>

<title>Introduction and Background</title>
<p>Protein-losing enteropathy (PLE) is characterized by enteric protein loss, hypoalbuminemia, and hypoproteinemia. Patients with PLE often also have dilated intestinal lymphatics, lymphopenia, electrolyte disturbances, diarrhea, and edema. When PLE is secondary to heart disease, it occurs most commonly in those cases associated with elevated systemic/central venous pressure.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0884533612444532">1</xref></sup> This can occur with a variety of cardiac conditions, including constrictive pericarditis, restrictive cardiomyopathy, tricuspid valve stenosis, or vena caval stenosis (such as might occur after a Mustard operation for transposition of the great arteries). PLE also has been reported following the Fontan operation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0884533612444532">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0884533612444532"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0884533612444532"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0884533612444532">4</xref></sup> The Fontan operation has become the most common cardiac cause of PLE.</p>
<p>The Fontan procedure originally was described for patients with tricuspid atresia in 1971. Since then, the number of malformations for which the Fontan operation can be used has expanded considerably. In fact, it has become the most common, definitive operation performed for patients with any type of single ventricle.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0884533612444532">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0884533612444532">6</xref></sup> Because these patients have only one pumping chamber, that chamber must be used to pump blood into the high-resistance, systemic circulation. As a result, the systemic venous blood (blue blood) must flow through the lungs without the benefit of a systolic pump. This diversion effectively eliminates cyanosis and reduces the workload of the single ventricle to a near-normal level. However, because there is no ventricular pump to propel blood into the pulmonary arterial circulation, systemic venous pressures are elevated compared with those of a biventricular circulation.</p>
<p>Over time, the technical aspects of the Fontan procedure have evolved and changed. In the early experience, both vena cavae were left in continuity with at least part of the patient’s right atrium, and a direct atriopulmonary anastomosis was created to allow caval blood to flow through the remnant of right atrium into the pulmonary arterial confluence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0884533612444532">Figure 1</xref>). This connection was associated with progressive enlargement of the right atrial component and less efficient flow from the vena cavae to the lungs. These patients frequently developed atrial arrhythmias. For these and other reasons, contemporary patients usually will have a staged approach to the surgical reconstruction. The first venous to pulmonary artery connection is created between 4 and 9 months of age and directs only the superior vena caval (SVC) blood into the pulmonary arteries. This connection is referred to as a bidirectional caval pulmonary anastomosis or a “bidirectional Glenn procedure.” The Fontan operation is performed (or “completed”) later in life, often between 2 and 4 years of age. In most centers, an extracardiac conduit is used to connect the inferior vena cava (IVC) to the pulmonary arteries, bypassing the atrium entirely (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0884533612444532">Figure 2</xref>). Many Fontan procedures also include the creation of an atrial fenestration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0884533612444532">Figure 2</xref>, right panel). These fenestrations function as small residual “atrial septal defects” and allow a small right-to-left shunt to persist between the Fontan conduit and the left atrium. The fenestration eases the transition to the Fontan circulation for these patients by providing a consistent source of systemic ventricular preload (filling) and perhaps limiting the degree to which central venous pressures rise.</p>

<p>This illustration demonstrates a classic atriopulmonary Fontan connection in a patient with tricuspid valve atresia and normally related great arteries. The right atrial appendage (large black arrow) has been anastomosed to the pulmonary artery confluence, and the atrial septal defect has been closed. These maneuvers direct venous flow from both of the vena cavae through the right atrium (RA) and to the pulmonary vascular bed without the assistance of a ventricular pump. The connection of the main pulmonary artery (PA) to the ventricle has been interrupted to eliminate any residual left-to-right shunting.

<caption>
<p>The 2 diagrams in this figure illustrate modifications of the original Fontan concept. They both use a direct, bidirectional anastomosis of the superior vena cava (SVC) to the right pulmonary artery and a conduit to connect the inferior vena cava (IVC) to the pulmonary arterial confluence (PA). The left panel shows an example of an intra-atrial conduit (indicated by the * in the left panel) connecting the IVC to the PA. This modification is used when pulmonary venous or other anomalies complicate the placement/use of an extracardiac conduit. The right-sided diagram illustrates the anatomy of a patient with hypoplastic left heart syndrome, after a fenestrated, extracardiac Fontan operation. A nonvalved conduit completes the connection of the IVC to the PA (indicated by the * in the right panel). This conduit is placed within the pericardial space but outside the heart itself. This type of connection is preferred because it places all of the patient’s native atrial volume under the lowest possible distending pressure. Note the fenestration (At F) of the extracardiac conduit, which allows a small, persistent right-to-left atrial shunt.

<p>Even patients with the most complex forms of a single ventricle are surviving much longer with the modern Fontan operation compared with previous generations. Despite the increased survival for many of these patients, it is critical to understand that the physiology of the systemic venous return after Fontan operation is distinctly abnormal. This physiology allows for systemic arterial blood flow to be powered by systolic contraction of the single ventricle, whereas pulmonary blood flow is driven by central venous pressure and is augmented by changes in intrathoracic pressure, as well as active relaxation of the systemic ventricle (drawing blood forward).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0884533612444532">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0884533612444532">8</xref></sup> For this circulation to be effective, the patient must have normal (low) pulmonary arteriolar resistance, relatively normal systolic and diastolic function of the single ventricle, and sufficiently large pulmonary arteries (to avoid any component of mechanical resistance).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0884533612444532">7</xref></sup> From the “perspective” of the gastrointestinal organs, the most important characteristic of Fontan physiology is the increase in central venous pressure, which can lead to venous congestion of the liver and the gut. Unfortunately, as survival has increased, so have the complications associated with this unique operation. These late postoperative problems include, but are not limited to, atrial arrhythmias, thrombosis, hepatic fibrosis, plastic bronchitis, and, the focus of this discussion, PLE.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0884533612444532">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0884533612444532">9</xref></sup></p>

<title>Pathophysiology of PLE</title>
<p>Excessive loss of plasma proteins into the gut lumen can result from a variety of insults, including mucosal injury, inflammation, congenital (primary) intestinal lymphangiectasia, and elevated systemic venous (and lymphatic) pressures (secondary lymphangiectasia). In cardiac-related PLE, the intestinal lymphatics become engorged and have a histologic appearance that is very similar to that of patients with congenital intestinal lymphangiectasia. Despite the central role of elevated venous pressure in the genesis of PLE secondary to cardiac diseases, some patients with severely elevated systemic venous pressure never develop protein loss, leading most to presume that other (as yet unidentified) triggers also play a role in determining a patient’s susceptibility to the disorder. When plasma or lymphatic proteins are “lost” into the intestinal lumen, they are degraded rapidly to amino acids and reabsorbed into the portal circulation. PLE will become manifest when the intestinal leak exceeds the patient’s ability to resynthesize the lost proteins. Proteins with slower rates of turnover (such as serum albumin and some immunoglobulins) will have more dramatic reductions in their plasma levels than proteins with more rapid turnover (such as insulin). In addition, the elevated lymphatic pressure after the Fontan operation reduces the ability of the lymphatic system to assist in absorption of nutrients from the small intestine. This impaired absorption, combined with the constant demand for resynthesis of lost proteins, presents a significant nutrition challenge to those dealing with or attempting to manage patients with PLE.</p>
<p>Rychik<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0884533612444532">9</xref></sup> has described a multifactorial hypothesis for the development of PLE after the Fontan operation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0884533612444532">Figure 3</xref>). In this model, the primary insult is the chronic low cardiac output that occurs in many patients after the Fontan operation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0884533612444532">10</xref></sup> This compromised cardiac output results in poor perfusion of the gastrointestinal mucosa. As a result, mesenteric vascular impedance is markedly increased in patients with PLE as compared with those without PLE.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0884533612444532">11</xref></sup> This, in combination with vascular congestion due to elevated venous pressures, results in abnormal enterocyte function.</p>

<graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0884533612444532-fig3.tif"/></fig>
<p>In addition, there is an element of chronic inflammation in PLE, also likely secondary to low cardiac output.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0884533612444532">9</xref></sup> Both interferon-γ and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)–α can be increased after the Fontan procedure.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0884533612444532">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0884533612444532">13</xref></sup> Increased TNF-α results in increased serum albumin flux across an in vitro model of intestinal mucosa. This serum albumin flux was increased further in these in vitro studies when an elevated pressure gradient was applied, simulating the increased systemic venous pressure seen after Fontan operation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0884533612444532">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0884533612444532">15</xref></sup> It has been postulated that elevated brain natriuretic peptide levels after the Fontan operation contribute to the development of PLE by inhibiting lymph transport through effects on lymphatic smooth muscle.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0884533612444532">16</xref></sup></p>
<p>Patients with PLE can have abnormal enterocyte basal membrane structure with resultant chronic leak of serum albumin into the gut lumen.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0884533612444532">9</xref></sup> This was brought to light by the discovery of intravenous (IV) heparin as an effective treatment for PLE. Heparin may act as an anti-inflammatory agent, by inhibiting mast cell degeneration in the intestine. It also plays a role as a glycosaminoglycan in maintaining the integrity of the basal membrane by acting as a barrier to large molecules such as serum albumin.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0884533612444532">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0884533612444532">17</xref></sup> Thus, deficiency of heparin sulfate may result in increased permeability of the basal membrane to serum albumin, as well as a proinflammatory state.</p>
<p>Finally, it is difficult to explain why patients with similar hemodynamics (cardiac outputs and venous pressures) can have such markedly different clinical outcomes—namely, that some develop PLE, whereas others do not. It is also intriguing that some patients with similar hemodynamics also develop chylous effusions after the Fontan operation, whereas others do not. One hypothesis is that patients who develop chylous effusions or PLE after the Fontan operation have an unrecognized congenitally abnormal lymphatic system. This hypothesis is difficult to study due to the relative difficulty in imaging the lymphatic system.</p>

<title>Diagnosis and Clinical Presentation of PLE After the Fontan Operation</title>
<p>PLE affects from 3%–18% of patients following the Fontan operation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0884533612444532">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0884533612444532">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0884533612444532">18</xref></sup> In the largest reported multicenter series studying &gt;3000 Fontan patients and risk factors for developing PLE, an incidence of 3.7% was reported.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0884533612444532">10</xref></sup> The number of affected patients does seem to increase with the length of follow-up after the Fontan operation. Therefore, the incidence of PLE may become even higher as these patients continue to age and more patients with less severe or even transient forms of PLE are recognized.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0884533612444532">19</xref></sup> PLE can develop anywhere from weeks to many years following the Fontan operation, but the average time from Fontan operation to diagnosis of PLE is 3.5 years.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0884533612444532">10</xref></sup> The severity of the disease varies widely and in some cases even can be transient, especially when due to a correctable hemodynamic abnormality or when associated with an infection. The broad range of presenting symptoms emphasizes the need for regular screening of patients after the Fontan operation for stool protein loss or hypoproteinemia, even in the presence of subtle symptoms.</p>
<p>Common presenting symptoms of PLE include peripheral edema, diarrhea, abdominal bloating and pain, intermittent diarrhea or steatorrhea, and effusions within the pleural and pericardial spaces. Most symptoms experienced by patients with PLE are secondary to the consequences of intestinal protein loss and nutrient malabsorption (especially long-chain triglycerides and fats), leading to hypoproteinemia and a malnourished state. Therefore, all patients with PLE are at risk for failure to thrive and other adverse effects of malnutrition. Patients with severe disease may manifest hypocalcemia (both relative and absolute) and an increased susceptibility to infections due to lymphopenia (intestinal loss of circulating lymphocytes) and/or hypogammaglobulinemia (intestinal loss of circulating immunoglobulins). Rarely, a diffuse coagulopathy can occur due to liver congestion and to loss of coagulation factors.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0884533612444532">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0884533612444532">20</xref></sup></p>
<p>The gold standard for diagnosis of PLE is a 24-hour stool α-1-antitrypsin (AAT) clearance study.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0884533612444532">21</xref></sup> AAT is an excellent marker for protein leak in the intestinal mucosa, as it is usually excreted in only small quantities in the stool and is not metabolized by other organs. However, in the setting of the nonselective protein leak associated with PLE, the amount of AAT in the stool increases dramatically, allowing confident laboratory confirmation of the clinical syndrome. Random, single-sample, “spot” analysis of stool for AAT level is not as accurate as the formal 24-hour clearance study. However, a low “single-sample” AAT stool concentration, coupled with normal plasmal protein levels, may serve as a convenient surveillance method for patients who are doing well and in whom clinical suspicion for PLE is low.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0884533612444532">22</xref></sup> If performed, biopsy of the small intestine can reveal dilated lacteals and other pathologic changes that are also hallmarks of PLE. However, this usually is not required because the constellation of clinical symptoms and an elevated level AAT stool excretion is diagnostic.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0884533612444532">
<title>Risk Factors for Developing PLE and Clinical Outcomes in Fontan Patients With PLE</title>
<p>Clinical features associated with the development of PLE include increased bypass time, length of hospital stay after the Fontan operation, and preoperative ventricular end-diastolic pressure, as well as right ventricular morphology of the functional single ventricle, and postoperative renal failure.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0884533612444532">18</xref></sup> Postoperative renal failure after creation of the Fontan circulation seems to be associated with a particularly high risk for later development of PLE. Most studies have focused on “risk factors” that could be identified prior to or immediately after the Fontan operation. Silvilairat and colleagues<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0884533612444532">23</xref></sup> found that late reduction in overall ventricular systolic function also was associated with an increased risk of PLE relative to a “control” group of Fontan patients (matched for age, length of time after the Fontan operation, and ventricular morphology).</p>
<p>Many potential complications of PLE may lead to death. These include severe edema, low cardiac output syndromes, hypocalcemia, thromboembolism, arrhythmia, and infections.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0884533612444532">10</xref></sup> Sepsis, in particular, can be very difficult to treat because of associated chronic hypogammaglobulinemia. PLE after the Fontan operation is associated with a discouragingly high mortality rate. In the largest available studies, only 46%–59% of PLE patients survived for 5 years or more following diagnosis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0884533612444532">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0884533612444532">18</xref></sup> Risk factors for early mortality after diagnosis of PLE include many features that also predict a poor initial hemodynamic result after the Fontan. Silvilairat and colleagues<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0884533612444532">23</xref></sup> also found that a lower initial serum albumin concentration (&lt;2.5 g/dL), those with New York Heart Association (NYHA) classifications &gt;II (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0884533612444532">Table 1</xref> for definitions of NYHA classes), and those with reduced mid-diastolic ventricular compliance (Doppler deceleration time &lt;120 ms) at the time of PLE diagnosis had more rapid progression and earlier death relative to PLE patients without these presenting characteristics. In fact, when all 3 risk factors (low serum albumin level, reduced functional status, and short deceleration time) were present in the same patient, patient outcome was particularly dismal (approximately 30% four-year survival postdiagnosis). These highest risk patients may best be treated by aggressive regimens (see Treatment Options section) and early referral for cardiac transplantation. Rychik et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0884533612444532">9</xref></sup> have proposed a “grading system” for the severity of PLE based on the serum albumin level at presentation. In this system, a serum albumin between 2.5 and 3.5 mg/dL is considered mild (grade 1), between 2.0 and 2.5 mg/dL is considered moderate (grade II), and &lt;2.0 mg/dL is considered severe (grade III). The authors suggest that those with lower serum albumin levels at presentation warrant aggressive treatment strategies. Unfortunately, most of these outcome studies are focused on patients who had surgical treatment before the “modern” era. Updated outcomes may be somewhat better, as some new therapeutic methodologies have become available, and there has been earlier recognition of PLE.</p>

<title>Treatment Options</title>
<p>No single treatment reliably “cures” or even improves PLE in all patients. In fact, most therapies result in a decrease in protein loss and varying degrees of symptom reduction. It is also important to recognize that most treatments for PLE (other than diuresis and serum albumin infusions) typically take several months to show a measurable response. Thus, adding multiple therapies in rapid succession may make it difficult to know which therapy provided the most benefit. This delay in clinical response may be due to the rate of enterocyte turnover in the small intestine.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0884533612444532">9</xref></sup></p>
<p>The first and most important step in treating PLE is to identify reversible hemodynamic abnormalities. This evaluation should include detailed echocardiography and a cardiac catheterization. Other imaging studies that may provide additional information in many patients include transesophageal echocardiography and cardiac magnetic resonance scanning. The cardiac rhythm should be normalized when possible, preferably achieving atrioventricular synchrony whenever possible. Eliminating major hemodynamic abnormalities such as severe atrioventricular valve regurgitation or severe coarctation of the aorta should be strongly considered. However, the risk of any invasive therapy must be balanced against the increased surgical mortality risk for patients with significant debilitation due to PLE. Conventional surgeries are associated with up to 60% mortality in patients with PLE.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0884533612444532">10</xref></sup> In addition, PLE resolved in only 47% of the surgical survivors. Therefore, surgical intervention should not be undertaken for problems that are only mildly or moderately significant. Most catheter-based interventions can be performed without prohibitive risk. Obstructions to systemic venous flow (from the vena cavae through the pulmonary arteries) are particularly problematic (because they elevate venous pressure) and must be eliminated, preferably by balloon angioplasty and intravascular stents. Relief of significant venous obstructions can improve PLE symptoms in up to 60% of patients.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0884533612444532">24</xref></sup> Specific treatment strategies for the Fontan patient with PLE are summarized below and in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0884533612444532">Table 2</xref>.</p>

<title>Diet Modification</title>
<p>Malnutrition is a universal component of PLE. In our experience and that of other centers, growth failure is a common finding in patients with severe PLE.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0884533612444532">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0884533612444532">25</xref></sup> Patients not only lose calories due to the protein loss and fatty diarrhea associated with the disorder but also have difficulty absorbing long-chain triglycerides via the intestinal lymphatic system. Therefore, the dietary and nutrition interventions proposed for patients with PLE emphasize a high-protein (≥2 g/kg/d), low-fat diet (&lt;25% of calories from fat), with a greater than normal level of medium-chain triglycerides. The use of medium-chain triglycerides is thought to be of benefit because these molecules bypass the intestinal lymphatic system and are absorbed directly into the bloodstream. This absorptive pathway avoids the impaired, dilated intestinal lacteals and can improve overall nutrition status in these patients. However, no controlled studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of this diet. Although diet modification alone has rarely produced significant clinical improvement, we believe that augmenting a PLE patient’s “effective” nutrition and caloric intake is important to the success of other therapies (especially giving the chronic catabolic state created by PLE).</p>

<title>Pharmacologic Interventions to Increase Cardiac Output</title>
<sec id="section8-0884533612444532">
<title>Anticongestive Medications (Heart Failure Medications)</title>
<p>Diuretics are very helpful for decreasing symptoms associated with fluid overload and edema. They may provide important support for the failing heart and should be used in virtually all patients with PLE. Furosemide commonly is used. Typical doses are 1 mg/kg in young patients twice daily, with increasing frequency or dosing as needed. Spironolactone may also be used as a supplemental diuretic and also to reduce proteinuria.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0884533612444532">26</xref></sup> Spironolactone also is known to have other cardiac benefits, which are difficult to quantitate. The role of afterload reduction using angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and/or angiotensin receptor blockers remains controversial after the Fontan operation. However, for patients with PLE, reduction in systemic vascular resistance should improve cardiac output, at least somewhat, and thus improve symptoms resulting from PLE.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0884533612444532">27</xref></sup></p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-0884533612444532">
<title>Pulmonary Vasodilators</title>
<p>Inhaled nitric oxide has been shown to improve PLE in patients with elevated pulmonary arteriolar resistance.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0884533612444532">28</xref></sup> Unfortunately, nitric oxide cannot be used chronically on an outpatient basis. Therefore, selective pulmonary vasodilators (such as sildenafil) have been used in patients with PLE to decrease resistance in the pulmonary vascular bed. These agents act by increasing nitric oxide availability, reducing pulmonary arteriolar resistance, and, in Fontan patients, reducing the central venous pressure. These drugs also cause vasodilation in the systemic arterial circulation, reducing systemic ventricular afterload. Sildenafil also has been shown to improve mesenteric arterial blood flow. Finally, sildenafil has been reported to improve some measures of exercise performance in Fontan patients.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0884533612444532">29</xref></sup> Newer pulmonary vasodilators, including bosentan, are currently being investigated in the Fontan population.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0884533612444532">30</xref></sup></p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-0884533612444532">
<title>Corticosteroids</title>
<p>As inflammation appears to be a factor in the development of PLE, it stands to reason that corticosteroid therapy could provide a benefit to these patients. Indeed, the administration of doses of 1–2 mg/kg/d of prednisone has been reported by several authors to improve PLE symptoms.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0884533612444532">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0884533612444532">32</xref></sup> However, long-term, systemic corticosteroid administration is associated with its own significant complications, including weight gain, hypertension, hyperglycemia, osteopenia, and infection. The effect on immune function is particularly concerning for patients with PLE and with hypogammaglobulinemia due to enteric protein loss.</p>
<p>Budesonide is an enteric-specific steroid, often with limited systemic side effects. Oral administration delivers the steroid selectively to the enteric mucosa where it is most needed. An initial report by Thacker et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0884533612444532">33</xref></sup> suggested a favorable effect on serum albumin levels in 8 of 9 patients. In all patients, although improvement in symptoms was achieved, the hypoproteinemia returned after weaning of the medication. John et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0884533612444532">34</xref></sup> recently reported 7 slightly older patients with PLE who were given budesonide. Six of the 7 patients had increases in serum albumin levels, whereas only 4 had symptomatic improvement. Many patients in this cohort had systemic side effects, particularly the 2 oldest patients who had significant hepatotoxicity. In both studies, patients who responded to budesonide had symptoms return when the medication was weaned, and long-term, low-dose administration has been suggested for maintenance of effect.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0884533612444532">8</xref></sup></p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-0884533612444532">
<title>Low Molecular Weight Heparin</title>
<p>Heparin was first reported by Donnelly et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0884533612444532">35</xref></sup> to be effective for the treatment of PLE in some patients. This may be due to several mechanisms. First, heparin may decrease inflammation by inhibiting mast cell degeneration in the intestine. It likely also plays a role in the integrity of the basal membrane by acting as a barrier to large molecules such as serum albumin, with heparin deficiency resulting in increased permeability of the basal membrane to serum albumin.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0884533612444532">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0884533612444532">17</xref></sup> Finally, thromboembolic events have been reported in approximately 20% of patients following the Fontan operation, and this may include both pulmonary and mesenteric microthrombi.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0884533612444532">36</xref></sup> It is possible that heparin reduces the incidence of microthrombi and thus reduces the resultant enterocyte damage. Patient response to subcutaneous low molecular weight heparin therapy is not predictable. Although some patients derive significant benefit from heparin therapy, others show little symptomatic improvement. However, a trial of this type of therapy has little negative impact and is reasonable to consider in patients who have not responded other measures.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-0884533612444532">
<title>Octreotide</title>
<p>Octreotide is a medication that mimics natural somatostatin. It has been shown to decrease thoracic duct lymphatic flow in animal studies and commonly is used in patients with chylous effusions and lymphangiectasia. It has been successful in some patients with PLE after the Fontan operation, albeit in limited case series.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0884533612444532">37</xref></sup> Unfortunately, it can cause gallstones. Similar to heparin therapy, octreotide may be used to augment other medical regimens but should not be considered a primary therapeutic agent.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section13-0884533612444532">
<title>Serum Albumin (Intermittent IV Infusions)</title>
<p>In severely affected patients, periodic serum albumin infusions can be used to increase the serum albumin level and provide symptomatic relief. Theoretically, this increased intravascular serum albumin will increase oncotic pressure and aid in dispersing edema.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0884533612444532">9</xref></sup> Of course, in the setting of ongoing protein loss, the benefits derived are temporary. In some patients, serum albumin infusions only may be required, while other therapeutic interventions are taking effect. However, in severely affected patients, these infusions typically are used in a regular, recurring schedule. The frequency of the infusions is determined by symptom severity and duration of benefit.</p>

<title>Surgical and Other Interventional Treatment Strategies</title>
<sec id="section15-0884533612444532">
<title>Atrial Baffle Fenestration</title>
<p>The catheter intervention that most effectively improves symptoms in patients with PLE is atrial baffle fenestration. Therefore, if any surgical or catheter-based intervention is undertaken, strong consideration must be given to creation of a fenestration in the atrial baffle. From a hemodynamic perspective, creating a fenestration in the Fontan circuit (as seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0884533612444532">Figure 2</xref>) has many potential benefits. The fenestration will allow some of the desaturated blood to shunt to the pulmonary venous atrium and thereby provide additional preload to the systemic ventricle and an increase in cardiac output. It may provide a pressure “pop-off” for increased pressure in the Fontan circuit. Atrial baffle fenestration has been reported to improve the clinical status of some patients with PLE.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0884533612444532">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0884533612444532">39</xref></sup> However, there is a high rate of spontaneous closure of the created fenestrations and subsequent return of PLE symptoms.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0884533612444532">38</xref></sup> Thus, creation of a durable fenestration is required to achieve sustained benefit but does not provide a “cure” for the disorder.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section16-0884533612444532">
<title>Balloon Angioplasty and Intravascular Stents</title>
<p>Patients who have had a Fontan operation do not tolerate even mild obstructions within the systemic venous to pulmonary arterial pathway. Interventional catheter procedures have advanced to the point that many of these obstructions can be relieved without resorting to conventional surgery. Obstructions in either the surgically created Fontan connection or the branch pulmonary arteries should be approached with these catheter techniques. Over 60% of PLE patients treated with balloon angioplasty techniques have had at least some symptomatic improvement, and adverse event rates have been quite low.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0884533612444532">10</xref></sup></p>
</sec>
<sec id="section17-0884533612444532">
<title>Pacing</title>
<p>For patients who have rhythm disturbances, including sinus bradycardia or atrioventricular dissociation, atrioventricular (AV) sequential pacing may be helpful in improving cardiac output.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0884533612444532">40</xref></sup> However, it is important to balance this treatment option with potential complications, including lead and generator malfunction, as well as the potential thrombogenic risk of intracardiac leads.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section18-0884533612444532">
<title>Surgical Strategies</title>
<p>As mentioned previously, the surgical mortality rates reported for patients with PLE are very high. Therefore, conventional surgical intervention should be undertaken only when the patient’s clinical status has been optimized by all other means available and when the potential hemodynamic benefit of the intervention will be dramatic. If the intervention will not produce a significant increase in effective cardiac output, as well as a reduction in central venous pressure, it should probably not be considered. In these cases, cardiac transplantation may be the only beneficial “surgical” strategy. When conventional surgical procedures are recommended for a patient with PLE, these operations should be preceded by intensive medical and metabolic therapy focused on optimizing the patient’s cardiac function/output and nutrition status.</p>
<sec id="section19-0884533612444532">
<title>Fontan “Revision”</title>
<p>Many patients with PLE had their Fontan operations prior to the introduction of the extracardiac Fontan approach (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0884533612444532">Figure 2</xref>) that currently is favored. These Fontan connections usually were of the atriopulmonary type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0884533612444532">Figure 1</xref>). These connections often develop significant enlargement of the portion of the pathway derived from the native right atrium. Patients with dilated right atria are more prone to form intra-atrial thrombi and to develop atrial tachyarrhythmias. In addition, the flow dynamics through such a dilated chamber are less efficient than the flow through the more streamlined, tube-like connections used in an extracardiac Fontan.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0884533612444532">41</xref></sup> In contemporary practice, these connections often are “revised” to an extracardiac circuit with simultaneous surgical antiarrhythmia procedures. This approach is quite successful in patients without PLE.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0884533612444532">42</xref></sup> However, despite the theoretical improvement in hemodynamic efficiency, patients with PLE seem to derive limited benefit from this type of surgery, and the reported operative mortality rate approaches 50%.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0884533612444532">10</xref></sup> Therefore, it is our opinion that an isolated Fontan conversion should be undertaken only rarely in the patient with PLE. When conversion is performed in a patient with PLE, simultaneous creation of an atrial baffle fenestration during the procedure should be strongly considered.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section20-0884533612444532">
<title>Cardiac Transplantation</title>
<p>Cardiac transplantation is the only “surgery” that offers a potential to cure PLE. Actually achieving such a favorable result depends on many things. Not only must an appropriate donor become available, but the patient must also be healthy enough to survive transplantation. Despite these obstacles, it seems that PLE does resolve in the vast majority of transplant survivors.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0884533612444532">43</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0884533612444532"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0884533612444532">45</xref></sup> The resolution of PLE symptoms often takes several months after transplantation. Unfortunately, patients with PLE are high-risk transplant recipients, often having elevated antibody titers, multiple prior operations, increased risk for infection because of hypogammaglobulinemia, and anatomic challenges (particularly patients with heterotaxy). These complicating features combine to create significant risk for death both while awaiting a donor organ (approximately 25%) and earlier after transplantation (also about 25%). However, multiple reports have suggested that successful transplantation does reliably eliminate PLE.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0884533612444532">43</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0884533612444532"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0884533612444532">45</xref></sup> It seems that better patient selection and perhaps earlier referral for consideration of transplantation may be the keys to further improvements in outcome.</p>

<sec id="section21-0884533612444532">
<title>Summary and Therapeutic Guideline</title>
<p>Directing the care of a patient who develops PLE after the Fontan operation is a complex process and requires the clinician to choose from multiple treatment regimens, none of which produce consistently positive results. The following paragraphs outline an approach to treatment that assumes that the patient has no venous pathway stenoses, no outflow obstructions, and no major valvular regurgitation. Although treatment must be individualized, several common strategies are employed. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0884533612444532">Table 1</xref> provides a summary of “average” doses for the medications discussed. In our practice, treatments and interventions are added to the patient’s regimen in a progressive and additive fashion. Potassium, calcium, and magnesium supplements are used and adjusted in all patients based on periodic laboratory values.</p>
<p>Once the diagnosis is established and initial inpatient treatment (if any) is completed, outpatient therapies are focused on optimizing cardiac output with oral “heart failure” medications. All patients are treated with at least a moderately aggressive anticongestive medication regimen. If they already are receiving this type of treatment, then medication doses are increased (if possible) or additional agents are prescribed. Afterload reduction is achieved with either an ACE inhibitor or an angiotensin receptor blocker. The dosages of these medications are titrated upward until a maximum dose for age and size is reached or the patient develops unacceptable side effects. Spironolactone is given to all patients. A loop diuretic (such as furosemide) is given and its dosage and frequency adjusted to reduce edema/ascites but avoid intravascular volume depletion. Digoxin is used at the discretion of the treating cardiologist, usually when ventricular systolic performance is impaired. The patients and their immediate family members are educated regarding implementation of a low-fat, reduced-sodium, high-protein diet and are asked to have all members of the patient’s household follow those guidelines if possible.</p>
<p>If the patient has not improved adequately after 1–2 months of such therapy, then the enterally selective corticosteroid, budesonide, is often the first agent added. Young patients (&lt;8 years) are given 6 mg daily, whereas older patients begin with a single daily dose of 9 mg. If the patient responds favorably, the dose may be weaned to either 3 or 6 mg daily to maintain the effect. In steroid-responsive patients, it is rare to be able to discontinue steroid treatment and avoid a recurrence of PLE.</p>
<p>If the patient’s response is still not satisfactory after 1–2 months of budesonide therapy, then additional agent(s) should be considered. The choice of agent needs to be tailored to the patient’s clinical situation. If there is evidence of increased resistance to flow in the small lung vessels, then sildenafil may be a logical addition. This drug will provide pulmonary arterial vasodilation and potentially improve transpulmonary flow but will also dilate the systemic arterial vessels. As a result, the dose of any other afterload-reducing agent being used may need to be decreased when sildenafil is added to the patient’s regimen. If sildenafil is ineffective or thought to not be a good choice for the patient, the next agents are either oral prednisone or subcutaneous low molecular weight heparin.</p>
<p>When none of these strategies have been effective, the patient is then considered for atrial baffle fenestration. We prefer to create these fenestrations in the cardiac catheterization laboratory whenever possible, to avoid an additional surgery and its associated risks. Catheter-created fenestrations usually will require placement of stent(s) between the atrial chambers to remain patent chronically. Because a fenestration in these patients is uniformly associated with a right-to-left shunt, anticoagulation with heparin should be continued or warfarin should be added (if the patient is not receiving heparin) to decrease the risk of paradoxical embolic events.</p>
<p>Patients with PLE after the Fontan operation who have either failed these treatment strategies or are at particularly high risk for mortality<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0884533612444532">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0884533612444532">23</xref></sup> should be evaluated for cardiac transplantation. Markers that identify those at such high risk include very low serum albumin values at the time of diagnosis (&lt;2.5 g/dL), those with severely impaired ventricular systolic or diastolic function, and those with severely limited physical capacity (NYHA classes III and IV). Evaluation for transplant can be carried out simultaneously with any of the treatment strategies outlined above. In fact, it is our belief that referral for transplantation is often best considered earlier in the course of patients with truly chronic PLE. This opinion stems from the observation that patients with end-stage disease and the severe debilitation/malnutrition that accompany it face the greatest risk for mortality, both with surgery and while awaiting donor availability.</p>
