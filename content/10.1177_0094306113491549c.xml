<p>The Holocaust, Ronald J. Berger argues, has received short shrift in (American) sociology. Craig Calhoun’s anthology, <italic>Sociology in America: A History</italic>, for instance, mentions it only once in 900-plus pages, and National Socialism only seven times in passing. One can count the papers about the Holocaust or National Socialism over the last half century in the <italic>American Sociological Review</italic> and the <italic>American Journal of Sociology</italic> on little more than one hand each. Years ago, when I was a graduate student wondering about this, a very distinguished leader of the profession asserted that this is because sociology is interested in conditions rather than in events. In a section entitled “Understanding Sociology’s Neglect,” however, Berger explores a number of more disturbing explanations, including anti-Semitism among some of American sociology’s founders, and the putative disengagement of those who, in contrast to a first generation of Christian reformist sociologists, followed a more scientific ethos. Whatever the explanation though, Berger agrees with those like Irving Louis Horowitz and Zygmunt Bauman who assert a “normative order of neglect” (p. 8) even in the engaged sociology of the 1960s. Indeed, Berger’s larger point stems from Horowitz’s assertion, in Berger’s words, that sociology has been “squeamish about fundamental issues of life and death” (p. 8). In contrast, Berger asserts that “Arguably the greatest concern of social science is to contribute, in whatever way it can, to the prevention of genocide” (p. 234). Because as a sociologist he believes that “sociology, as a disciplinary endeavor, cannot afford to be left behind” (p. 235), Berger offers this synthetic review of major debates in social scientific scholarship on the Holocaust, highlighting the contributions of sociology in those debates, and the relevance of those debates to sociology more generally.</p>
<p>In his introduction, Berger outlines the debate over whether Germany followed a special developmental path (<italic>Sonderweg</italic>) that led to National Socialism. On the one side are those who emphasize Germany’s late development, regional fracturing, and small middle class in contrast to Great Britain, France, and the United States. On the other side are those who find no true “standard” model against which such specialness could be measured, and who argue that what happened in Germany requires a more micro explanation specific to the uniqueness of the violence that emerged. Following this discussion, Berger outlines how the views of Marx, Weber, and Durkheim might be relevant to explaining the Holocaust: from Marx, attention to capitalism and the Nazi state; from Weber, an emphasis on bureaucracy; and from Durkheim, attention to social solidarity, particularly with regard to the development of anti-Semitism. Within the discussion of Durkheim on social solidarity, Berger also reviews the debate in the 1990s about the American political scientist Daniel Goldhagen, who asserted that all Germans were bound together by a strong commitment to an “eliminationist” form of anti-Semitism.</p>
<p>Chapter Two asks “Why the Jews?” and focuses on the role of the image of the Jews in Christianity through the ages. Chapters Three and Four explore basic questions of the sociology of National Socialism and the Holocaust. In particular, Chapter Three looks in short order at Hitler’s rise to power, the mobilization and legitimation of the Nazi Movement, anti-Jewish legislation, emigration and deportation, the Aryanization of the economy, and the emergence of the Final Solution. Chapter Four provides Berger’s most direct look at the machinery of genocide, including its culture and economy. In a detailed section on the bureaucracy, Berger highlights the role of the German citizenry, the management of the ghettos, and the railways. Finally, in a section on “The Killing Apparatus,” Berger reviews the role of the medical profession and “the concentration camp system” itself.</p>
<p>Berger’s view of the Holocaust, however, does not stop with the perpetrator perspective but explores the perspective of victims and bystanders. Chapter Five thus looks at Jewish responses, including issues of survival, the question notoriously raised by Hannah Arendt during the Eichmann trial of the so-called Jewish Councils, which were involved in the management of the ghettos, and the issue of Jewish resistance. Chapter Six covers German resistance, the role of the Christian Churches, as well as social scientific debates about the question of altruism, in addition to reviewing controversies about the (lack of response) from the United States, the Allies, and neutral countries. In the latter discussion, issues include U.S. immigration policy, the internationalization of the refugee problem, and the question of why the United States did not bomb the railway lines to Auschwitz.</p>
<p>Two further chapters extend the discussion of the sociology of the Holocaust to question its legacies in collective memory. In Germany, important issues included the Nuremberg tribunals, denazification, the legacies of resistance, and the so-called Bitburg affair of 1985. For Poland, the main debates were over the construction of crosses at Auschwitz and the controversy over historian Jan Gross’ 2000 book on Jedwabne, a small town in which the gentile population, of its own volition, murdered the half of the town’s population who were Jewish. Gross’ book unleashed a virulent controversy about the role of Poles in the Holocaust, and about Poland’s self-image as a victim of National Socialism.</p>
<p><italic>The Holocaust, Religion, and the Politics of Collective Memory</italic> is obviously a thorough and detailed book. It provides a broad introduction to major (though by no means all) questions in the study of the Holocaust. Missing, for instance, are discussions of literary and cultural debates, generational issues, as well as social theoretic implications. While many of the literary and cultural debates may not be social scientific, they have indeed been studied social scientifically. There is also an extensive discussion, partly in memory studies, about “postmemory” and generational legacies which Berger does not review here. Finally, despite his references to Baumann, he does not address the connection between the study of the Holocaust and its reverberations for postmodern perspectives, both within and outside of social science. No book, of course, can be comprehensive, and the author meets his stated aims well (though it was not clear to me, based on its place in the text, that religion earned pride of place in the title).</p>
<p>Berger’s book is also accessibly written, which goes to its apparent purpose. He says his aim “is not to add to specialist knowledge of the field but to provide a disciplinary-informed selection and interpretation of the extant literature” (p. 3). The question, then, is of audience. For me, the book read like a terrific upper-level undergraduate course on the sociology of the Holocaust. One wonders then, about the structural constraints—perhaps including lack of market—that prevented the author from framing it as an actual textbook. For the expert, it offers very little: as a scholarly book, it is far too secondary and synthetic. Perhaps its offer is to sociologists who know little to nothing about Holocaust scholarship. But for the student, just a bit more detail and breathing room—and perhaps some excerpts from key documents and texts— would make it an extraordinarily useful basic classroom text.</p>
