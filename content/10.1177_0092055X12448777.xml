<abstract>
<p>Sociologists and scholars of composition have long argued that in order to get students to improve the quality of what they write, they need to change <italic>how</italic> they write. Here, the authors assess whether students’ participation in writing-intensive first-year seminars leads to changes in their writing process. Data collected via pretest and posttest interviews of 34 students show that writing-intensive seminars help first-year students become better planners and revisers yet have little effect on the ways that they prewrite and draft. Additionally, students in their first semester of college demonstrate higher order writing processes at the beginning of their seminar than their second-semester counterparts and show more improvement over the course of the semester as well. We analyze the conditions that foster these patterns and suggest that increasing quantitative course requirements (i.e., page counts) may hamper students’ ability to adopt qualitatively better writing strategies.</p>

<p>For the past 30 years, campuses nationwide have shifted the responsibility of compositional instruction away from English departments by initiating “writing across the curriculum” and “writing in the disciplines” programs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0092055X12448777">Edwards 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0092055X12448777">Malcom 2006</xref>). Proponents of these programs argue that students learn best when taught to write about subject matter they find relevant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0092055X12448777">Farris and Smith 1992</xref>) and that the act of writing offers students an effective pathway to “knowing” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0092055X12448777">Lindeman 2001</xref>:5) course material. Many sociologists embrace these curricular reforms. Some do so for practical reasons: “If students are to learn to write sociological prose, sociologists must be involved in the teaching of writing” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0092055X12448777">Anderson and Holt 1990</xref>:183). Others cite studies showing how writing assignments can enhance students’ critical thinking skills (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0092055X12448777">Grauerholz 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0092055X12448777">Malcom 2006</xref>), help them to reflect on the origin of their beliefs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0092055X12448777">Hudd and Bronson 2007</xref>), and foster their “sociological imagination” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0092055X12448777">Edwards 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0092055X12448777">Roberts 1993</xref>). Yet, despite their potential benefits, requiring sociologists to teach students how to write comes at a cost.</p>
<p>Writing-intensive courses can tax departmental resources. Typically, these courses are capped at between 12 and 25 students and taught by faculty rather than teaching assistants. Writing-related activities—like peer-to-peer “draft workshops”—take up valuable time that otherwise would be spent teaching traditional “content” (concepts, theories, and methods) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0092055X12448777">Farris and Smith 1992</xref>). These activities also can increase instructors’ workload by mandating individual conferences with students and extra grading (evaluating up to 5,000 words per student) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0092055X12448777">Grauerholz 1999</xref>). Given the amount of time and energy required, it is important to assess whether writing-intensive courses are making students better writers.</p>
<p>There are two strains of research on assessing students’ writing—research that examines the final product (an assignment, a portfolio), and research that analyzes the process by which it was created (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0092055X12448777">Humes 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0092055X12448777">MacArthur, Graham, and Fitzgerald 2006</xref>). Our study focuses on the latter, relying on the assumption that a better process yields a better product, an assertion that enjoys wide support in the compositional and pedagogical literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0092055X12448777">Bean 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0092055X12448777">Elbow 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0092055X12448777">Flower and Hayes 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0092055X12448777">Humes 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0092055X12448777">Lindemann 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0092055X12448777">Perl 1979</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0092055X12448777">1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0092055X12448777">Petrosky and Brozick 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0092055X12448777">Rohman 1965</xref>).</p>
<p>A process-oriented investigation is especially well suited to writing-intensive courses given that they are generally designed to change the ways students approach their writing assignments. One way they do this, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0092055X12448777">Grauerholz (1999</xref>:316) describes, is by structuring assignments in order to break up the writing process into a number of assigned “components (e.g., statement of topic, outline, list of five references consulted, one- to two-page statement of problem, etc.) and pace these evenly throughout the term.” Similarly, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0092055X12448777">Kamali (1991)</xref> suggests, writing-intensive courses should sequence major research papers into discrete tasks that culminate into a broader final product. These changes are based on the rationale that students should approach their writing tasks as professionals do: “Why do we ask students to produce single-shot essays, when most of us who publish know that our own writing goes through many drafts before reaching a journal?” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0092055X12448777">Thompson 1994</xref>:65). Whereas Thompson’s question is hypothetical, ours is empirical: How do students write? When left to their own devices, what do they do? And in regard to their process, do writing-intensive courses have a positive effect?</p>
<p>We assess the writing process from a symbolic interactionist perspective (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0092055X12448777">Blumer 1969</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0092055X12448777">Mead 1934</xref>). As a result, we assume that students choose among possible writing strategies based on the meanings they assign to them—which may or may not align with how their instructors perceive them. This approach enables us to focus our attention on the generic processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0092055X12448777">Hughes 1958</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0092055X12448777">Schwalbe et al. 2000</xref>) individuals use when charting out lines of action. Specifically, we measure how college students write in conditions they understand as real and consequential.</p>
<p>Past studies have attempted to measure changes in students’ writing processes; however, the preponderance of existing research relies on data gathered from young children to high school students—not college students (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0092055X12448777">Calkins 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0092055X12448777">Graves 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0092055X12448777">MacArthur et al. 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0092055X12448777">Myhill and Jones 2007</xref>). Although some of these studies exhibit methodological strengths, they do so through experimental design (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0092055X12448777">Humes 1983</xref>). Most of these experimental studies either create assignments for students and observe students while they carry out the assignments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0092055X12448777">Sommers 1980</xref>) or ask students to narrate their thought processes out loud while writing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0092055X12448777">Perl 1979</xref>). Although these studies are reliable, we question their external validity for one obvious reason—college students rarely complete everyday assignments under these circumstances.</p>
<p>If we want to know how students write in real-life situations, we need to capture how they write on their own in settings of their choosing. Some studies have attempted to do this through observing students directly in the classroom (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0092055X12448777">Myhill and Jones 2007</xref>), asking them to produce minimally invasive “logs” while composing text (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0092055X12448777">Segev-Miller 2004</xref>:11), interviewing them about their general experiences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0092055X12448777">Brent 2005</xref>), or collecting “retrospective accounts” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0092055X12448777">Roozen 2010</xref>:320) of how they wrote. Although more externally valid, these methods of data collection can suffer if students fail to recall minor details. Additionally, students may be unaware or unable to articulate some of the taken-for-granted writing process strategies they use. We believed that by interviewing students about their specific experiences and prompting them to elicit more detailed memories, we would address some of the shortcomings of previous studies (for critiques of past studies on the writing process, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0092055X12448777">Kress [1994]</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0092055X12448777">Smagorinsky [1987]</xref>).</p>

<title>Methods</title>
<p>Over the course of two years (spring 2009 to fall 2010), we interviewed eight or nine students a semester for four semesters (<italic>N</italic> = 34) as part of an institutional assessment of the writing-intensive first-year seminar program at a small liberal arts college. The program was implemented in 2008 and designed to replace traditional introductory composition courses. Although the theme of each course varied across the disciplines, the program dictated a shared general structure. Enrollment for each course was capped at 12, and students were required to produce between 16 and 20 pages of finished writing. Rather than submit all of their work at the completion of the course, students were required to carry out a series of writing assignments in succession. Class time was set aside for draft workshops, individual conferences with their instructors, and an information fluency session delivered by a research librarian. (For a more detailed overview of a similar course design, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0092055X12448777">Brent [2005]</xref>.)</p>
<p>Students participating in the study were interviewed twice—at the beginning and end of the semester (pretest and posttest). After receiving approval from our local institutional review board, we derived a list of potential participants from a random sample of all students enrolled in these courses. We offered an honorarium ($10 per interview) and filled slots on a first-come, first-serve basis, potentially biasing the sample toward more eager, higher achieving students. Because some students were underrepresented on campus, we oversampled Latinos, African Americans, and men to ensure their participation. In addition, the sample is equally split between students who took their course in either the fall or the spring semester.</p>
<p>Over the course of the project, the first author collected nearly 50 hours of interview data. As one part of a larger assessment project, interview questions spanned a variety of topics beyond the writing process, including participants’ disposition toward learning, scholarly ethics, and information fluency. In regard to the writing process, students were asked to identify their most recent (completed) writing assignment that required outside sources. Students were asked to describe the assignment prompt and outline what they wrote. They were then asked a series of questions: “I’d like to know about all the steps you took, from start to finish, to write the paper. Where did you start? What did you do? Where did that happen? Who did you talk to? What did they say? Okay, the next step, what did you do?” This line of questioning was adjusted and repeated depending on the students’ responses. The goal was to tease out as many details as possible regarding any writing-related task that took place between learning about the assignment and handing in the final document. First-semester students were asked in their pretest interview to refer to their last substantial paper completed in high school.</p>
<p>The purpose of our approach to interviewing was to get students to give detailed answers instead of “generalized accounts” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0092055X12448777">Weiss 1994</xref>:72). Although hypothetical scenarios or generalized explanations may elicit students’ intentions when writing, these accounts may not reflect students’ actual practices. Although some students had difficulty at first remembering the specifics of their writing process, with enough prompting and follow-up questions they were soon able to provide a detailed inventory of what they did. Using a semistructured interview guide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0092055X12448777">Lofland et al. 2006</xref>), we pressed students to clarify their statements until interviewer and interviewee arrived at a joint understanding of the underlying meaning behind each question and response.</p>
<p>Interviews were digitally recorded and transcribed. We used a qualitative analysis software program—Atlas.ti—to code the data along a composite framework of four domains of the writing process (outlined in detail the following). The pretest and posttest responses were scored on a scale of 0 to 6, and average changes were then calculated. Additionally, within each domain, we collapsed students’ scores into dichotomous “low” (0–3) and “high” (4–6) categories in order to analyze the different configurations of how students began and ended their seminars.</p>

<title>The Writing Process</title>
<p>One of the goals of writing-intensive courses is to disabuse students of the notion that simply spending more time at their keyboards will make them better writers. Instead, students are taught to change their writing strategies and practices. Sociologists have made similar theoretical claims but in different contexts. One classic example is <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0092055X12448777">Chambliss’s (1989)</xref> study of Olympic swimmers. He found that contrary to conventional wisdom, “excellent” swimmers are not always those who practice the longest. Rather, “excellence in competitive swimming is achieved through qualitative differentiation from other swimmers, not through quantitative increases in activity” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0092055X12448777">Chambliss 1989</xref>:72). He showed how Olympic swimmers did not become the fastest by swimming more laps—a quantitative change; instead, they made “qualitative improvements . . . doing <italic>different kinds of things</italic>” [emphasis in original] (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0092055X12448777">Chambliss 1989</xref>:72–73). For example, elite swimmers did “flip turns” every practice lap and forced themselves to compete in their weakest events. Instead of only increasing the frequency of their arm strokes, they also improved their efficiency. In short, the best swimmers consistently did all of the “little things” that lesser swimmers could do but neglected. In the end, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0092055X12448777">Chambliss’s (1989</xref>:85) focus on process shows us how “excellence is mundane . . . accomplished through the doing of actions, ordinary in themselves, performed consistently and carefully.” Taking this sociological lesson out of the pool and into writing-intensive classrooms, we contend that in order to improve the result (product), we should pay more attention to the mundane steps (process) needed to achieve it.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0092055X12448777">
<title>A Framework for Assessing the Writing Process</title>
<p>One obstacle to measuring the writing process is the lack of consensus regarding which approach meets all students’ needs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0092055X12448777">Wardle 2009</xref>). As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0092055X12448777">Lindemann (2001</xref>:31) argues, “Composing is not one process, but many.” As a result, the compositional literature is filled with different models of writing. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0092055X12448777">Rohman (1965</xref>:106) labels these writing stages as <italic>prewriting, writing</italic>, and <italic>rewriting</italic> or <italic>revising</italic>, whereas <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0092055X12448777">Humes (1983</xref>:201) uses the terms <italic>planning, translating, reviewing</italic>, and <italic>revising</italic>. To make things even more complicated, most compositional scholars suggest that “writers move back and forth among these subprocesses” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0092055X12448777">Humes 1983</xref>:205) in a “recursive” process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0092055X12448777">Perl 1980</xref>:364). (For more writing process models, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0092055X12448777">Althauser and Darnall 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0092055X12448777">Bean 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0092055X12448777">Cadwallader and Scarboro 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0092055X12448777">Crowley 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0092055X12448777">Edwards 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0092055X12448777">Elbow 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0092055X12448777">Flower and Hayes 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0092055X12448777">Grauerholz 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0092055X12448777">Hudd and Bronson 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0092055X12448777">Murray 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0092055X12448777">Schiff 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0092055X12448777">Stallard 1974</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0092055X12448777">Thomas 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0092055X12448777">Weaver 1996</xref>.)</p>
<p>To create our composite framework summarized in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0092055X12448777">Table 1</xref>, we synthesized the various models cited above by adhering to three principles they hold in common. First, writing involves a series of steps, phases, or stages—even if there is some overlap between them. Second, although there is an implied order or progression (writing precedes editing, for example), writing is also recursive. Third, the best strategies indicate an author’s willingness to revise and generate new ideas at any writing stage.</p>

<p>When creating our scoring system, we tried to find a balance between the practices outlined in the literature as well as those that students actually engage in while completing assignments. As we will show, students sometimes follow the “best practices” advocated by scholars of writing, but not always. As a result, we have woven some of students’ innovative approaches (even if potentially ill-advised) into our scheme. We broke the writing process down into four basic domains that we label <italic>planning, prewriting, drafting</italic>, and <italic>revising</italic> and created a 7-point scoring index (0–6) to rank the different tactics in each.</p>
<sec id="section4-0092055X12448777">
<title>Planning</title>
<p>In this domain, students collect their thoughts, gather information (from text and people), and set goals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0092055X12448777">Flower and Hayes 1981</xref>). Only one participant scored a zero (PL 0) by skipping any type of preparation, saying she just “threw it all together.” All the rest engaged in some type of planning, earning them at least a score of one (PL 1). To score higher, we looked for evidence that students compiled any sort of “inventory of facts, observations, details, images, quotations, statistics” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0092055X12448777">Murray 1985</xref>:12). If the source of information came from an assigned book, they scored a two (PL 2). If they solicited materials within easy reach—a book on reserve at the library or a simple Internet query—they scored a three (PL 3). To score higher (PL 4), students had to exhibit some advanced information fluency, such as consulting a scholarly academic database (Sociological Abstracts, EBSCO, Google Scholar, etc.). One student described this approach as “I walked to the library, and I said okay, ‘racism.’ And I went up to the little search engine station, okay . . . let’s see . . . ‘racism and sociology,’ ‘social construction and racism,’ and wow, I have a huge number of books.” In short, the more vetted the source (i.e., JSTOR rather than Wikipedia), the higher the score.</p>
<p>Some assignments, like expository essays, limit the number and type of sources students can use. To account for this, students can score higher if they bring others into the planning process. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0092055X12448777">Schiff (1982</xref>:158) argues that at some point, students need “expert intervention.” Students scored a five (PL 5) if they met with a reference librarian, writing center consultant, or their professors <italic>before</italic> constructing a draft or outline. To score a six (PL 6), students had to use those interactions as heuristic opportunities to generate new ideas. For example, one student used experts at an agency where he once interned as a sounding board for his emerging ideas on environmental policy. Rather than seek affirmation for his previous plan, he began the conversation with an open mind and ended up with a new argument for his paper.</p>

<sec id="section5-0092055X12448777">
<title>Prewriting</title>
<p>The concept of “prewriting” is new to many college students and counterintuitive to some—they wonder how writing before their “real” writing will help them. Yet, scholars of composition are in agreement that this activity help students generate, organize, and explore new ideas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0092055X12448777">Lindeman 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>We distinguish between prewriting and drafting based upon the intended audience of the text. Prewriting occurs when students are writing for themselves (note taking, “brainstorming,” outlining, “freewriting,” diagramming); drafting occurs when they expect others will eventually read their text. Thus, prewriting helps students clarify their ideas <italic>before</italic> they draft (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0092055X12448777">Perl 1980</xref>). Any evidence of prewriting (such as note taking) earned at least a score of one (PW 1). Organizing these ideas into a skeletal outline earned them one score higher (PW 2), and revising a series of outlines garnered a three (PW 3). To go higher, students had to try out a variety of different kinds of prewriting activities listed above (PW 4), and they scored a five (PW 5) when they approached their prewriting as means to spur innovative thoughts—that is, “an act of discovery” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0092055X12448777">Murray 1985</xref>:18). Students who scored this high indicated their willingness to discard text if needed, undaunted by the specter of “wasted” effort.</p>
<p>The most advanced prewriting strategy (PW 6) involved heuristic exercises. For example, one student who scored a six (PW 6) engaged in a creative strategy that Bean often refers to as “mind maps” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0092055X12448777">2001</xref>:230). As she put it, “I’m not an outliner . . . I draw the diagrams [and] webs . . . making connections that way.” Consequently, the best prewriters were willing to create and try multiple lines of inquiry.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0092055X12448777">
<title>Drafting</title>
<p>All participants reported completing some type of draft before they began the revising process—earning at least a score of one (DR 1). Although scholars of composition do not necessarily advise that writers adhere rigidly to their notes or outlines, many students did this. Thus, students earned a two (DR 2) if they did not deviate from their initial plan: “After I finish my outline, I kind of feel like I have the paper, you know? . . . I basically just follow it in the order that I’ve written it.” To score higher, students had to be more flexible—spreading out their writing over more than one sitting, allowing them time to reflect on their text mid-draft (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0092055X12448777">Stallard 1974</xref>). They scored a three (DR 3) if they spaced apart their writing sessions out of necessity: “I like to really get in there and write, write, write until I cannot write anymore, and that’s when I step away.” To earn a four (DR 4), they had to schedule writing breaks intentionally; one student explained that these pauses “let the ideas kind of stew in the back of my head.”</p>
<p>The most advanced drafting strategies were recursive. This meant engaging in other domains of the writing process (planning, prewriting, and revising) during the composition of a draft. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0092055X12448777">Weaver (1996</xref>:83) characterizes this writing strategy as nonlinear: “A writer often rereads and revises, does more research, edits, jots down ideas for later paragraphs or sections, and so forth.” However, many students were resistant to “go back” once they gathered information from books or articles. If students returned to the other domains of the writing process grudgingly and out of necessity (i.e., to shore up a glaring weak spot in their argument), they scored a five (DR 5). To score a six (DR 6), they had to approach their draft with a loose attachment, looking for opportunities to rewrite or rethink substantial portions. One student worried her argument was too diluted after multiple drafts, so she decided to gather more information on just one theme: “I decided I needed to go back and get more information so I could just focus on one aspect instead of [two].”</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-0092055X12448777">
<title>Revising</title>
<p>All students in our sample engaged in some type of revision, although their methods varied. One student who earned a score of one (RE 1) only checked mistakes at the “local” level, such as spelling or “a missed word or punctuation.” Other students took the additional step to revise the style, clarity, or “flow” of their text (RE 2)—making sure their reader would understand their writing as they intended it. To score higher, students had to solicit help from outside readers. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0092055X12448777">Thomas (2005</xref>:35) argues that the writing process should include “interaction among several readers, both teachers and peers.” Any evidence that a student showed someone a draft earned the student a three (RE 3). To score a four (RE 4), students had to solicit feedback on issues of style or clarity so that an audience would be able to “extract” the meaning of the text accurately from the page (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0092055X12448777">Perl 1980</xref>:332).</p>
<p>Clarity and “flow,” however, do not ensure one’s text will be persuasive. To score a five (RE 5), students had to ask others to read their papers with an eye toward argumentation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0092055X12448777">Humes 1983</xref>). This type of “global” revision strategy entailed feedback on the “big picture” of their paper. One such student asked another whether he needed “to expand this idea a little bit more [or] support this argument more.” The most advanced score for revising— (RE 6)—was reserved for those who sought “global” feedback from more than one person. These students treated revising time like a workshop: “students and teachers writing, reading, and discussing, and improving one another’s work” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0092055X12448777">Lindeman 2001</xref>:208). As one student described, “I read their papers and they read mine . . . we focus more on organization and ideas rather than getting into the nitpicky grammar and things like that.”</p>

<title>Findings</title>
<p>As shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0092055X12448777">Table 2</xref>, students began their writing-intensive seminars, on average, as better planners (3.5) and revisers (3.5) than as prewriters (1.8) and drafters (2.9). At the end of the semester, their planning (4.2) and revising (4.1) scores improved, but their prewriting (2.1) and drafting (3.0) scores showed little gain. As a result, participation in writing-intensive seminars does appear to have a positive effect but only at the “bookends” of the writing process outlined in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0092055X12448777">Table 1</xref> (i.e., at the very beginning and end).</p>

<p>This impact becomes especially clear when we collapse the 7-point index of each domain into “low” (0-3) and “high” (4-7) categories. This dichotomous coding allows us to see whether writing-intensive seminars are helping students move across the threshold into advanced writing strategies. As illustrated in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0092055X12448777">Table 3</xref>, 47 and 59 percent begin their courses with “high” planning and revising scores, respectively; these figures increase to roughly 80 percent by the end of the semester. Conversely, very few students began their seminars as “high” prewriters (6 percent) or drafters (15 percent), and by the time they finished the course, fewer than 20 percent scored “high” in these “middle” domains.</p>

<p>To investigate the patterns of how students improve or decline, based on where they began, we created four configurations of possible change within each domain: those that start “high” and stay “high” (PRE–POST), start “high” and finish “low” (PRE–post), start “low” and finish “high” (pre–POST), and start “low” and stay “low” (pre–post). For example, as shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0092055X12448777">Table 3</xref>, 77 percent of students finished their seminar scoring “high” in revising, but this percentage does not tell the entire story. From <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0092055X12448777">Table 4</xref>, we learn that 24 percent of students began as “low” revisers and finished “high” (pre–POST), whereas 53 percent of students began “high” and finished “high” (PRE–POST). Thus, even though a high percentage of students finished as advanced revisers, this was mostly due to a maintenance effect—more than half of all students began the course already scoring “high.” A slightly more impressive pattern can be found in the planning domain: a high percentage of students finished as “high” planners (82 percent), and this was accomplished by moving a significant portion from “low” to “high” (41 percent pre–POST). Conversely, for prewriting and drafting, few students move from “low” to “high” (15 and 18 percent, respectively), and the vast majority start “low” and stay “low” (79 and 68 percent, respectively).</p>

<p>Our research plan collected data over 2 years in order to get an equal balance of students in their first and second semester of college. Students had no control over which semester they were enrolled in a writing-intensive course, and we assumed that students in their second semester would score higher (as a result of taking college level courses for the past 3 months). However, this was not the case.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-0092055X12448777">Table 5</xref> illustrates that all students follow the bookend pattern, but those in their first semester are much more likely to begin their classes planning and revising at “high” levels. For example, 65 percent of first-semester students start and end the seminar as “high” planners (i.e., “PRE–POST”), whereas only 18 percent of second-semester students do the same. Second semester students do improve more as planners; 59 percent of them start “low” but end “high”—meaning that nearly 90 percent of both groups finish the semester as “high” planners. In the revising domain, though, second-semester students do not improve nearly as dramatically, leaving a substantial gap between the two groups’ posttest scores. Ninety-four percent of first-semester students end as “high” revisers, compared with only 59 percent of their second-semester counterparts. Thus, even though second-semester students finish as “high” planners at similar rates as their first semester peers, they do not catch up in regard to their revising.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Our findings have important implications for sociology departments. Any course that involves a substantial paper or is otherwise designated as writing-intensive can benefit from an assessment of how students write. With our framework, instructors can identify their students’ practices early in the semester and tailor instruction accordingly (i.e., Are my students “high” planners? Are they “low” prewriters?). For example, if students are already practicing advanced revision strategies at the outset, then class time could be spent teaching other activities instead. In addition, our scoring framework is flexible. Instructors could rank the strategies differently or substitute new writing tactics in place of existing ones. To save time, instructors could also convert our framework into a survey instrument and administer it during a conference</p>
<p>The data show that although most students improve their planning and revising strategies, few made noticeable gains in their prewriting and drafting activities. This bookend pattern was reflective of their qualitative accounts. During their interviews, students described investing heavily in the very beginning and very end of the writing process.</p>
<p>The lessons learned from the different scores of first- and second-semester students are a bit more difficult to interpret. We hesitate to speculate as to why second-semester students’ pretest scores are lower or why they made up the gap in regard to planning but not revising. We suspect that external factors are the culprit. First, their experiences in other courses likely played a role. Although this was the only writing-intensive course for participants in our study (they took no other required composition class), all reported writing in at least one of their other classes. We do not know what lessons they learned about writing in those classes; our assessment protocol only collected data regarding their first-year seminar. However, future research could look more closely at how other courses support or detract from the mission of writing-intensive ones. Second, anecdotal evidence from interviews suggests that some students put more effort into their first-semester courses until they realized they could earn relatively similar grades with less effort. Given the freedom to pare down their writing activities to a bare minimum, students may try riskier strategies the second semester. (For more on how students adapt to college writing requirements, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0092055X12448777">Hjortshoj 2009</xref>.) We intend to conduct follow-up interviews with the participants before they graduate to get a better sense of potential confounding effects as well as the long-term impact of writing-intensive seminars.</p>
<p>To analyze these findings from a symbolic interactionist perspective, we look to the meanings that students assigned to different writing strategies and the conditions that led students to perceive some writing strategies as crucial but not others. Students described their writing strategies in largely pragmatic terms. Facing multiple deadlines from various courses, they sought out the quickest route to finish their assignments. They attended conferences with their instructors (planning) as well as peer-review workshops (revising) but reported that they did so mostly because they were required. Prewriting and drafting, in contrast, were not always mandatory. Subsequently, students rushed through these middle processes when pressed for time. Most did not regret this choice, reporting that they bookended their writing process strategically. One who skipped prewriting activities reported, “I’ve already read all the books, and I know what they’re talking about, so I reference them when I’m doing a direct quote . . . otherwise it’s all in my head already, and so I just write it.” Others rushed through their drafts in order to get straight to revising: “For me it’s easier if I just go ahead and get a bunch of words on a paper and I can go back and delete and change and rework.” Thus, because the meanings that students associate with drafting and prewriting were so consistent, the design of these courses may have to be changed in order to break the bookend pattern.</p>
<p>Many institutions already mandate process-related goals in writing-intensive courses; these typically take the form of required planning (student–faculty conferences) and revising (draft workshops) activities. However, if prewriting and drafting are also important, then faculty should be required to incorporate them into their assignments. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0092055X12448777">Grauerholz (1999)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0092055X12448777">Kamali (1991)</xref> offer some useful guidance on how to do this, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0092055X12448777">Massengill’s (2011)</xref> approach to “scaffolding” assignments can also help in this regard. Another idea is to require students to append their final drafts with a portfolio of evidence documenting the steps they took to complete their papers. Students could be given a checklist of items they could include in their portfolio like “brainstorming lists, outlines, and other handwritten notes” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0092055X12448777">Trepagnier 2004</xref>:199). Two downsides to this approach—more work for faculty and forcing all students to adopt the same process—could be easily addressed. First, faculty would not be obligated to evaluate or offer feedback on every item contained within students’ portfolios. After all, the value of activities like “informal writing” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0092055X12448777">Hudd, Smart, and Delohery 2011</xref>) and “writer-based prose” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0092055X12448777">Flower 1979</xref>:19) is that they offer students a chance to explore new ideas without the worry of grades. Second, writing-intensive courses in the same institution could adopt the same comprehensive menu of writing process strategies from which students could choose. This would offer students the flexibility to tailor their practices to suit their needs while still providing some uniformity of compositional instruction across the curriculum.</p>
<p>However, forcing students to engage in these activities may only produce short-term changes. To produce lasting results, instructors might rely on an old lesson from symbolic interactionism: The <italic>meanings</italic> associated with prewriting and drafting are shaped by interactions in the classroom. As a result, to get students to see particular writing strategies as valuable, instructors need to act toward them as such. For example, instructors could devote class time to heuristic activates like peer-to-peer brainstorming (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0092055X12448777">Bean 2001</xref>); this would indicate to students that these methods have worth. Instructors could also help students see the effectiveness of spacing apart drafting sessions by scheduling their conferences at a time when students have some—but not all—of their draft completed. This would allow students to see writing as a nonlinear event, something that should be interrupted by reflection and discussion.</p>
<p>Changing students’ perceptions of new writing tactics will not be easy. Most students were leery of the advanced strategies outlined in our framework—especially the heuristic exercises—because they perceived them as merely “extra work.” As a result, in some cases, utilitarian appeals may be the only solution. For example, students might be persuaded to explore recursive strategies if they believed these could save them time in the long run. After all, the most rigid approaches to writing (i.e., adhering to an initial outline “no matter what”) are hit-or-miss endeavors. Sometimes they work, but if flaws emerge, revisions might entail starting over from scratch.</p>
<p>For sociologists, our findings are relevant because they highlight how prevailing conditions shape the pathways that individuals follow to achieve their goals. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0092055X12448777">Chambliss’s (1989)</xref> study showed, the route to excellence requires qualitative changes in preparation: Swimmers do not become the best by swimming more than the rest; they excel because of the care and attention they pay to each lap. Administrators of writing-intensive programs can learn from this lesson. The defining feature of most writing-intensive courses is the large number of pages that students are required to produce. Ironically, this quantitative feature may be impeding students’ ability to adopt qualitatively different writing strategies. Requiring more pages may mean that students spend less time trying out heuristic exercises, conducting extra searches for information, or taking intentional breaks while drafting. Thus, if students are adopting less effective strategies because they feel pressed for time, one solution might be to free up more time. In other words, teach them to write better by requiring them to write less.</p>
