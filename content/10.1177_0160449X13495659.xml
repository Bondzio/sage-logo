<p>For as long as anyone can remember, my home state of Virginia has remained in the outer reaches of organized labor. In the years immediately following World War II, Michigan, a union stronghold, enjoyed union membership rates of over 40 percent. Virginia, meanwhile, passed Right to Work legislation, and our union membership peaked at roughly 17 percent of Virginia’s workers.</p>
<p>Today about 17 percent of Michigan workers belong to unions, and that state has passed a Right to Work law.</p>
<p>Does this help explain the explosion of interest in Southern labor history? <italic>Contra</italic> Marx, do the states that were <italic>less</italic> developed industrially show the <italic>more</italic> developed image of their own future?</p>
<p>Robert Zieger introduces <italic>Life and Labor in the New New South</italic> by noting that in many respects there is less daylight between today’s South and the rest of the nation than there was before World War II. Yesterday, the South was poor, rural, and agricultural; today, its per capita income, urbanization, and industrial development are much closer to national norms. And the peculiar political institutions of the “New South” that emerged after reconstruction—Jim Crow segregation and one-party rule by conservative Democrats—have passed away. It might seem that the South was, at last, becoming part of the United States. Yet in labor relations, one could argue that the process has worked in reverse, with the Midwest, West, and Northeast increasingly adopting the hardnosed labor relations practices of the South. Zieger, one our nation’s leading labor historians, reminds us that where unions are concerned, the Southern “exception” has become the national norm.</p>
<p>The chapters within this volume cover a sweeping territory in both time and space, from the Deep South to the border states, and from the 1940s to the millennium. Familiar writers like Michael Honey and Timothy Minchin appear alongside younger scholars and new voices. One of the few unifying themes in the diverse collection is a strong interest in race and ethnicity. Essays examine how the South was transformed in this period by the civil rights movement and by a burgeoning Latino population. The latter is largely a story of immigration but not entirely; Texas saw much immigration from Mexico in these decades, but for the large Tejano population, the United States migrated to <italic>them</italic> rather than the reverse.</p>
<p>The contributions here will be especially prized by those who teach labor history in Southern locales. Students are fascinated by history near at hand, and there’s an account tailored to virtually every state in the region. Missouri readers of Robert Bussel’s contribution will be fascinated to learn of the novel community organizing activities of the St. Louis area Teamsters in the 1950s. Mississippi readers who may understandably believe that their state lacks a labor history to speak of will be intrigued by the three-cornered contest between area labor unions, local business boosters, and corporations looking to relocate production to a “union-free” South. Marylanders will be able to learn new things about the civil rights battles of African-American women employed in the public sector.</p>
<p>Minchin’s essay on deindustrialization and the Southern textile industry will be of special interest to those of us in Virginia and the Carolinas but is equally a challenge thrown down to all historians of business and the economy. The shutting of the textile mills, Minchin cogently argues, was an economic catastrophe on the same scale of those in rubber, steel, and auto but is often left out of discussions about workers and communities left behind by globalization. Partly because this disaster fell on small rural plants rather than urban industrial zones, partly because we are distracted by economic growth in other “Sun Belt” sectors, and partly because, for the most part, these workers had no union to sound the tocsin on their behalf, we seldom think of Danville in the same breath as Detroit. Perhaps we should.</p>
<p>A note of caution: a few of the writers seemed prone to an excessive credulity toward their union sources. More than once when struck by a remarkable claim in the text about working conditions in a particular firm, or about the sinister motives of a firm’s corporate officers, I consulted the endnotes—and found it attributed the testimony of a single charismatic union informant (one whose self-image was deeply invested in the description of his or her adversary, at that). If union activists never created embellished or self-serving accounts of their struggles, this would probably be evidence enough. Alas, when it confirms their preconceptions, union leaders and workers are no more immune from circulating speculation and hearsay as established “fact” than are, well, academics. It’s an occupational hazard of being an engaged scholar, but one we must strain to avoid.</p>
