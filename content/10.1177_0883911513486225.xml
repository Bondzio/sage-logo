<abstract>
<p>The high affinity and specificity between avidin and biotin were employed to bind a recombinant single-chain antibody fragment to synthetic hydrophilic polymer drug carriers. Two semitelechelic polymers, based on poly(ethylene glycol) and poly[<italic>N</italic>-(2-hydroxypropyl)methacrylamide], each containing a single thiol end group, were conjugated to dithiopyridyl-modified avidin. The biotinylated recombinant single-chain antibody fragment of the M75 antibody was then noncovalently bound to the polymer-avidin conjugates. The recombinant protein was chosen as a targeting ligand against carbonic anhydrase IX, a marker overexpressed by tumor cells of various human carcinomas. The antigen-binding affinity of the polymer–single-chain antibody fragment complex was confirmed by enzyme-linked immuno sorbent assay (ELISA). This approach provides an original, nondestructive way of preparing supramolecular systems intended for targeted delivery of therapeutics utilizing modern chemical procedures, including reversible addition–fragmentation chain-transfer polymerization and recombinant DNA techniques.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The hybrid conjugates formed by the combination of synthetic polymers and natural macromolecules represent a significant group of nanosized pharmaceuticals developed for improved drug, protein, or gene delivery.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0883911513486225">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0883911513486225"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0883911513486225"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0883911513486225">4</xref></sup> Recent progress in the clarification of biological functions of numerous biomolecules together with the versatility of synthetic chemistry has contributed to the development of highly efficient tailor-made polymer therapeutics with biomimetic features suitable for both clinical development and routine clinical use. It became evident that the choice of a polymer carrier, an appropriate biologically active compound, and the nature of their mutual interaction are important for their biological activity.</p>
<p>Because of their unique properties, the conjugates of biologically active molecules (e.g. antibodies, enzymes, and synthetic proteins) and water-soluble polymers have become generally accepted delivery vehicles in many biomedical applications.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0883911513486225">1</xref></sup> Antibodies and their fragments have been shown to be among the most efficient ligands in terms of active targeting of both solid tumors and leukemia cells.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0883911513486225">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0883911513486225">6</xref></sup> However, covalent coupling of the antibody to a multivalent polymer carrier often leads to a branched product with a broad molecular weight distribution and modification of the antibody charge and binding site structure, both resulting in decreased antibody binding to its antigen. Therefore, an improved conjugation strategy enabling site-specific modification of the antibody without changing its binding region is highly desirable to maximize the retention of its original bioactivity. In addition, having well-defined chemical entities with narrow molecular weight distributions significantly helps in regulatory approval for clinical applications. Specific supramolecular self-assembly of two macromolecules has proven to be a solution to this problem.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0883911513486225">7</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0883911513486225"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0883911513486225"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0883911513486225">10</xref></sup></p>
<p>Considering their unusual strong affinity, high specificity, and commercial availability, we decided to explore the well-documented intermolecular noncovalent interaction of two biomolecules—avidin and biotin—as a linkage between chemically modified antibody fragments and a polymer carrier.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0883911513486225">11</xref></sup> In this study, we used a recombinant monobiotinylated single-chain fragment (scFv) of the M75 antibody containing an avi-tag, which can be specifically biotinylated with biotin ligase BirA.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0883911513486225">12</xref></sup> This antibody is known to have a specific affinity to carbonic anhydrase IX (CA IX), a transmembrane protein overexpressed in a wide variety of tumor types.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0883911513486225">13</xref></sup> Avidin was conjugated to semitelechelic hydrophilic polymers based on poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) and poly[<italic>N</italic>-(2-hydroxypropyl)methacrylamide] (PHPMA) via a single-point attachment using thiol-disulfide “exchange chemistry.” Reversible addition–fragmentation chain-transfer (RAFT) polymerization<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0883911513486225">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0883911513486225">15</xref></sup> was used for the synthesis of PHPMA with a narrow molecular weight distribution and a high degree of end group functionality, reducing the risk of branching and cross-linking reactions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0883911513486225">Figure 1</xref>). Size-exclusion chromatography (SEC) analysis confirmed the formation of stable supramolecular assemblies upon mixing the recombinant protein with the polymers under physiological conditions. The antigen-specific cell binding of the polymer–protein conjugates was analyzed by enzyme-linked immune sorbent assay (ELISA).</p>

<p>The combination of modern polymerization techniques with recombinant methods described in this article offers a new approach for the preparation of polymer–protein conjugates. The specific noncovalent and nondestructive attachment of a recombinant protein to a synthetic hydrophilic polymer via the biotin–avidin interaction is the major advantage of the presented method. These polymer–protein conjugates can be used, as targeted polymer antitumor therapeutics or for diagnostics.</p>

<title>Synthesis of polymer</title>
<p>Semitelechelic HPMA-based polymer containing a thiol end group (PHPMA-SH) was prepared by solution RAFT polymerization of HPMA initiated by ACVA in the presence of a CTP chain-transfer agent followed by the reduction of the dithiobenzoate (DTB) end group of the polymer with NaBH<sub>4</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0883911513486225">Scheme 1</xref>). Briefly, a mixture of 4.9 mg (0.0175 mmol) of ACVA and 9.8 mg (0.035 mmol) of CTP in 1.15 mL of dioxane was added to a solution of 1.0 g (6.98 mmol) of HPMA in 2.3 mL of deionized water. The reaction mixture was poured into a heavy-wall glass tube, thoroughly bubbled with argon and polymerized for 7 h at 70 °C. After cooling to room temperature, the reaction mixture was precipitated into 100 mL of acetone. The precipitate was filtered off and purified by reprecipitation from methanol into diethyl ether.

<title>Construction of expression vector</title>
<p>The expression vector was cloned in several steps. First, an avi-tag was assembled from four oligonucleotides, av1 (5′ gtactggtggcggtctgaacgacatcttc), av2 (5′-P gaagctcagaaaatcgaatggcacgaag), av3 (5′-P ctgagcttcgaagatgtcgttcagaccgccacca), and av4 (5′gtaccttcgtgccattcgatttt), in the following manner. Duplexes av1/av3 and av2/av4 were annealed and ligated into one 57nt long duplex coding for the avi-tag sequence GGGLNDIFEAQ<bold>K</bold>IEWHE (lysine residue in bold can be specifically biotinylated by biotin ligase BirA).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0883911513486225">17</xref></sup> The duplex was then cloned into a unique Acc65I site of an intermediary scFv construct between a myc-tag and a his-tag in the orientation in which the 3′ site was restored and the 5′ site abolished. The full length scFv M75 (described previously<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0883911513486225">18</xref></sup>) was cloned into the resulting plasmid as an NcoI-XhoI fragment. The final construct thus coded for scFv M75 in the format V<sub>H</sub>-(gly<sub>4</sub>ser)<sub>4</sub>-V<sub>L</sub>-myc-avi-tag-His<sub>5</sub>. Similarly, avi-tag–containing scFv MEM97 directed against the CD20 antigen, which is overexpressed on several B-cell–derived leukemias, was also constructed.</p>

<title>Expression and purification of scFv-biotin</title>
<p>For expression in <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> BL21 (DE3) cells, a modified pET-22(b) vector was used in which the scFv coding sequence was preceded by the PelB signal sequence, allowing for the translocation of the product into the periplasmic space. The His<sub>5</sub> tag at the C-terminus of the polypeptide was used for product isolation and purification by immobilized-metal affinity chromatography on Ni-CAM (Sigma). Final purification was achieved by ion exchange chromatography on a MonoS column.</p>
<p>To biotinylate the specific Lys residue in the avi-tag in vitro, the protein (scFv) was mixed with D-biotin, BirA ligase, and other components according to the instructions provided with the biotinylation kit (Avidity, LLC, USA). The biotinylated protein was purified using a Streptavidin Mutein matrix (Roche Applied Science), as described in the manufacturer’s instructions.</p>

Microtiter plates were coated overnight with CA IX antigen (100 ng per well in 100 µL of bicarbonate buffer, pH 9.6), blocked with 1% bovine serum albumin in phosphate-buffered saline, and treated with Av-PHPMA/scFv M75 or Av-PEG/scFv M75 complexes at three different protein concentrations: 10, 2, and 0.4 mg/L. Biotin-scFv M75 alone was used as a positive control, and Av-PHPMA and Av-PEG without scFv were used as the negative controls. The binding of avidin conjugates (Av-PHPMA, Av-PEG, Av-PHPMA/scFv M75, and Av-PEG/scFv M75) to the CA IX antigen was detected by the fluorescent dye Alexa Fluor 488 attached to avidin. For the positive control, biotin-scFv M75, the anti-c-myc monoclonal antibody conjugated with the fluorescent dye Alexa Fluor 488, was used. The binding activity of complexes was determined from the fluorescence using excitation and emission wavelengths of 495 and 519 nm, respectively.</p>

<title>Modification of avidin with semitelechelic polymers</title>
<p>Avidin contains four identical subunits consisting of 128 amino acids. Each subunit, with an approximate molecular weight of 16,200 Da, contains 9 ϵ-amino groups on lysine residues plus one terminal NH<sub>2</sub> (i.e. the total number of primary amino groups in the tetramer is 40).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0883911513486225">20</xref></sup> Initially, a part of the amino groups in avidin (two on average) was modified by reaction with fluorescent dye Alexa Fluor 488-NHS. The condensation was nearly quantitative as only traces of the unbound dye were separated by SEC. The remaining amino groups were transformed to pyridyldisulfide (PDS) groups by in situ reaction with an excess of heterobifunctional reagent PDS-PEG<sub>4</sub>-NHS. The modified protein (Av-PDS) was characterized by SEC; the increase in <italic>M</italic><sub>w</sub> from 66,200 to 80,600 indicated almost complete modification of the 36 primary amino groups of avidin. It is important to note that the modification did not lead to any measurable increase in polydispersity. The SEC data analysis of both bioconjugates demonstrated that the high degree of protein modification still preserved their natural affinity for biotin. Moreover, chemical modification of avidin with “monodisperse” polymers via a single-point attachment led to the preparation of conjugates with precisely defined structures; almost no protein branching was observed.</p>
<p>Reaction of Av-PDS with semitelechelic MeO-PEG-SH led to a significant increase of the <italic>M</italic><sub>w</sub> from 80,600 to 270,000, corresponding to an average of 19 PEG chains per macromolecule (Av-PEG). Similarly, modification of Av-PDS with PHPMA-SH yielded a product with <italic>M</italic><sub>w</sub>=550,000 (Av-PHPMA), corresponding to an average of 12 PHPMA chains per polymer conjugate. The fairly lower degree of modification in the latter case was attributed to more pronounced steric hindrance between PHPMA and avidin. To verify that the polymer-modified avidin did not lose its affinity to monobiotinylated macromolecules (such as biotin-scFv), the Av-PEG conjugate was mixed with a model biotin-containing macromolecule (biotin-PEG, 10,000 Da) at a 1:4 molar ratio (four equivalents of biotin). SEC of the resulting complex revealed that only ~30% of the biotin-PEG remained unbound (i.e. the complex contained approximately 2.8 biotin-PEG molecules per one avidin-polymer conjugate). A very similar result (2.5 biotin-PEG molecules per avidin-polymer conjugate) was obtained with the Av-PHPMA/biotin-PEG complex. The observed decrease in the original association number of four biotins per avidin was most likely caused by the steric hindrance of the polymer “shell” shielding the biotin-binding site of the avidin “core.”</p>

<title>Noncovalent binding of scFv-biotin antibody fragments to avidin-polymer conjugates</title>
<p>A critical question in terms of further practical applications of polymer carrier-avidin conjugates concerns whether the polymer-modified avidin would still be able to bind a biologically active biotinylated scFv ligand, and what would be the optimal amount of ligand attached to one avidin-polymer molecule. In our previous article <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0883911513486225">8</xref></sup> (describing the use of coiled coil peptides for noncovalent attachment of scFv of the M75 antibody to PHPMA copolymers), we reported that attachment of more than one scFv ligand to the polymer carrier had not led to increased binding of the polymer–ligand complex to CA IX antigen in ELISA. Based on those results, we decided to mix the avidin-polymer conjugate with the biotinylated scFv at a 1:1 molar ratio. The addition of monobiotinylated-scFv fragments of monoclonal antibodies MEM97 and M75 (not shown) to Av-PHPMA and Av-PEG led to significant growth of <italic>M</italic><sub>w</sub> of the resulting complexes, Av-PHPMA/scFv and Av-PEG/scFv, from 550 to 620 kDa and from 270 to 355 kDa, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0883911513486225">Figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0883911513486225">3</xref>). The increase in <italic>M</italic><sub>w</sub> and the absence of the peak corresponding to free scFv clearly indicated the formation of the polymer-avidin/scFv complexes. The fact that the differences in <italic>M</italic><sub>w</sub> of the avidin-polymer conjugates and the biotin-scFv complexes were slightly higher than 30 kDa (one scFv molecule) could be explained by the inaccuracy of the <italic>d</italic>n/<italic>d</italic>c value of the resulting complexes. This value could not be exactly determined because of the limited amount of recombinant protein and the presence of a small amount of light scattering aggregates. Nevertheless, the increase in <italic>M</italic><sub>w</sub>, the absence of the free scFv in the reaction mixture, and the ELISA results (see next section) all clearly demonstrated the formation of stable polymer-avidin/scFv complexes.</p>

<title>Receptor binding of the polymer–protein complex</title>
<p>While the SEC characterization of complex formation between avidin-polymer and biotinylated scFv was performed with scFv MEM97, the receptor-binding activity of the supramolecular assembly was studied with scFv M75, which is more suitable for ELISA because of its epitope character. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0883911513486225">Figure 4</xref>, avidin-polymer/biotin-scFv M75 complexes bound efficiently to the cognate antigen CA IX. The binding to the antigen was due to the specific interaction between the biotin-scFv M75 ligand and the CA IX because avidin-polymers alone and the biotinylated noncognate scFv fragment, MEM97, did not bind. Anti-c-myc monoclonal antibody conjugated with the fluorescent dye Alexa Fluor 488 also showed no binding. In the subsequent ELISA experiment, the targeted PEG polymer demonstrated better binding at the two higher concentrations than the PHPMA polymer; within the PHPMA set, no concentration dependence was observed These differences were attributed to steric hindrance.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>We have synthesized and characterized fluorescently labeled polymer-avidin conjugates, with very narrow molecular weight distributions based on two biocompatible hydrophilic semitelechelic polymers—PEG and PHPMA—as models for polymer drug carriers. The polymer-avidin conjugates were successfully targeted against CA IX, an antigen expressed in many types of human carcinomas, by noncovalent attachment of a monobiotinylated recombinant scFv fragment of the M75 antibody. The polymer-avidin/biotin-scFv complexes described in this work represent a new generation of actively targeted polymer drug delivery systems. The major advantages of this system are the well-defined molecular structure of the polymer–protein conjugate and the fact that the universal avidin–biotin interaction enables the attachment of any biotinylated recombinant protein to the polymer drug carrier according to the particular medicinal application.</p>
