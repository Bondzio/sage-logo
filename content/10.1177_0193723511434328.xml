<abstract>
<p>The year 2010 is considered South Korean women’s football’s greatest year, with outstanding results in two International Federation of Football Associations (FIFA) tournaments. North Korea has also displayed excellence in women’s football during the past 20 years. This study, therefore, investigates and compares the factors involved in the success of Korean women’s football. It finds that the South Korean government’s interest in women’s football has been erratic, but North Korea prioritized women’s football and provided it full support; that members of successful South Korean teams receive small financial rewards, while North Korean players receive decorations and significant material rewards, and that although South Korea established a systematic talent identification and training system in 2002, North Korea initiated this process more than a decade earlier.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>At the 2002 FIFA World Cup in Korea and Japan, South Korea<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0193723511434328">1</xref></sup> shocked world football fans by reaching the semifinals and impressed them with the masses of red t-shirts in both the stadium and the streets. Yet world football fans have tended to be more familiar with North Korea’s exploits, particularly its extraordinary victory over Italy at the 1966 World Cup finals. Such successes were partially revived by the North’s recent qualification for 2010 FIFA World Cup.</p>
<p>Arguably, however, the performances of both Korean national men’s teams have been seriously overshadowed by the success of women’s football in North and South Korea. The South Korean women’s U-20 team won the third place in FIFA U-20 Women’s World Cup (WWC), and the U-17 women’s side became the champion of FIFA U-17 WWC in Trinidad and Tobago in 2010. Meanwhile, the North Korean women’s team has performed impressively by seizing the title of the 2006 FIFA U-20 Women’s Championship in Russia and the inaugural FIFA U-17 WWC in 2008. Their senior women’s team has appeared in the four consecutive FIFA WWC finals since 1999.</p>
<p>Although literature on women’s football has continued to increase, as we will see, little of this has been concerned with North Korea. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0193723511434328">Lee and Bairner (2009)</xref> noted this in the context of the large amount of literature studying sport in such other communist contexts as the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe during the Cold War (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0193723511434328">Hoberman, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0193723511434328">Kostka, 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0193723511434328">Riordan, 1977</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0193723511434328">1991</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0193723511434328">1998</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0193723511434328">1999</xref>). The Asian Football Confederation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0193723511434328">AFC, 2008</xref>) reported,</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>How the North Korean women’s team has achieved their success is a mystery because few outsiders have had a chance to go into the insular Communist country to observe the grooming and training programs of the DPR Korea Football Federation.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Under these circumstances, South Korea’s recent success invites a comparative examination of women’s football in the two Koreas. This study, therefore, investigates two research questions in regard to the driving forces behind the success of women’s football on the Korea Peninsula. These are (a) what has prompted women’s football to grow so rapidly compared with men’s football, and (b) what are the main factors behind the success of women’s football in the two Koreas? A comparative sociological approach will take into account state investment, cultural values, economic reward, and development system.</p>
<p>Prior to discussing the study on detail, it would be worth justifying the importance and contribution of this piece of research for social scientists. First, this is an interesting substantive comparative research into two highly successful sport and football systems, which have been underexplored so far. Although much has been written about women’s football, this is less true of East Asia. Second, this article allows us to consider two radically different ways in which deep cultural values and modern state/market strategies interplay and collide in relation to sport. These two nations have very different political and economic systems, but they do appear to share some strong underlying cultural values and traditions, to the extent that they still share very strong ethnonational feelings. And they are also locked together in a state of war, for almost the past 60 years.</p>
<p>The answers to research questions will be achieved through an analysis of the media, including newspapers, the websites of international and national sport governing bodies, and magazines not only from South and North Korea but also from other parts of the world. Being based in the United Kingdom has made it more feasible for the researcher to access media sources in North Korea.</p>
<p>The author also conducted interviews with North Koreans between 2006 and 2010 to obtain insights from inside the country and to add to the analysis of media sources. Because of the political circumstances, two people were interviewed at a time and the purpose of the interview was clearly outlined in advance. Several details, including the interviewees’ name, occupation, the exact number of interviewees, and the environment of the interview, are undisclosed for political reasons. Answers to questions were recorded by hand.</p>

<title>Women’s Football in a Global Context</title>
<p>Since FIFA inaugurated the first WWC in 1991, nearly 60 years after the first men’s World Cup, and the International Olympic Committee introduced women’s football into the Olympics in 1996, research addressing women’s football has become an emerging academic field. As many as 150 women’s football clubs existed in England in 1921 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0193723511434328">Pfister, 2004</xref>), but then England’s Football Association (FA) banned women from playing football with the claim that “the game of football is quite unsuitable for females and ought not to be encouraged” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0193723511434328">FA, 2010</xref>). It only lifted the ban in 1971. The <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0193723511434328">FA (2011)</xref> reported that 1.38 million women and girls played the game regularly across country in 2010, that the number of female youth teams increased from 6,027 in the 2008-2009 season to 6,461 in 2009-2010, and that the number of adult women’s teams increased from 1,253 in 2008-2009 to 1,408 in 2009-2010. It predicted that the number of teams is likely to keep growing.</p>
<p>In Norway, one of women’s football’s leading nations, football is the largest organized female sport, with 107,859 registered players, or 28.8% of all Norwegian football players, in 2006 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0193723511434328">Skogvang, 2009</xref>). Women’s football developed in Norway in three historic stages. These were (a) show matches and curiosity from the 1920s to the 1960s, (b) the struggle for acceptance and inclusion by the Norwegian Football Association from the 1970s until their 1988 WWC victory, and (c) increasing popularity and further international success since 1988 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0193723511434328">Goksøyr &amp; Olstad, 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>Manzenriter and Horne found that the success of the Chinese women’s national team, which has won seven Asian championships and three titles at the Asian Games, has been the result of state support. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0193723511434328">Jinxia and Mangan (2001)</xref> found that the media plays an important role in promoting the popularity of football among women. Women’s football in Japan started with 20 teams in 1997, when the country had approximately 7,000 male clubs. The league then joined with company and university teams and had two regional divisions by the mid-1970s. The financial support from a few big firms contributed to the establishment of the Japanese Women’s Soccer League in 1989, which was renamed the L-League, with more company-based teams joining it in 1994 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0193723511434328">Manzenriter &amp; Horne, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>These different settings suggest that there are various triggers that led to the development of women’s football in other nations, and these factors may include government’s support, particular strategies introduced by the football governing bodies, and the specific contributions of the media and businesses. This also implies that the gap between the confederations in women’s football is not as significant compared to those of men’s football, which European and South American teams have dominated for several decades. This explanation is supported by Luis Bueno, who states,</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>It’s just a natural progression of the development of women’s soccer. The top teams in the world were bound to get some true competition at some point, and teams that now have some talent and organization feel more confident and are taking the game to the top teams. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0193723511434328">Canales &amp; Bueno, 2010</xref>)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>This gives us the opportunity to compare and contrast the development of women’s football in the two Koreas.</p>

<sec id="section3-0193723511434328">
<title>Confucianism, Sport, and Women in Asia</title>
<p>Confucianism cannot be neglected in any discussion of women’s football in the Far East due to its influence on culture, especially sport. Confucianism espouses a rigid social hierarchy that has historically prevented talented men from lower castes from rising above their births. Korea’s culture is extremely Confucian and adamantly maintained this doctrine well into the 20th century. It was only after Korea’s liberation from 35 years of Japanese colonial rule in 1945 that its traditional caste system was fully abolished and it became a country where birth does not set an official ceiling to individual achievement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0193723511434328">Chang, 2010</xref>). Although the communist revolution weakened and almost destroyed Confucianism in China, where it originated, it has still been able to exert its influence over contemporary Korean society (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0193723511434328">Koh, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>The cultural value of male dominance over women differs among cultures, but separate domains and standards for the genders are usually present. Cultural orientations, habitual practices, and laws have supported the maintenance of gendered orders in which women are consigned to positions inferior to those of men and are regarded as passive and subordinate. Confucian values support such gender inequality and tend to affect relationships between the sexes in contemporary East Asia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0193723511434328">Manzenreiter, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>Such Korean studies as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0193723511434328">Lee and Yeo (2001)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0193723511434328">Koh (2009)</xref> have argued that deeply embedded Confucianism has kept Korean women from participating in sport clubs, as the Confucianism of early 20th-century Korean society strongly disapproved of women revealing their bodies in public, including when participating in sports. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0193723511434328">Hong (2002)</xref> argued that negative attitudes toward Chinese women’s involvement in men’s games mirror an especially Confucian type of sexism. The Chinese have tended to regard football as a men’s sport, as it requires competitiveness, aggression, and violence, and considered women who played football to be vulgar, crude, and unfeminine. Football, therefore, still tends to remain a men’s game there (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0193723511434328">Jinxia &amp; Mangan, 2002</xref>). Despite the success of Chinese women’s football in the past, national participation for women does not appear to be favorable. In China, women’s football is losing its popularity and parents are discouraging their daughters from playing football. The reality is that there are less than 300 female footballers even in the elite level and the national team’s allowance is the only means by which the players may feed themselves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0193723511434328">Nǚzú zhíyè, 2010</xref>).</p>

<title>South Korea</title>
<p>Kim Hwajip, South Korea’s first international football referee, created the country’s first women’s team in Joongang Girls’ Junior School in 1946. South Korea’s first women’s football competition took place in Seoul Stadium, formerly Dongdaemun Stadium, in 1949 as part of the Second National Women’s Sport Festival. The Moohak, Joongang, and Myungsung girls’ schools’ teams participated. Kim recalled, “When I announced that I would organize a women’s football team a parent asked me if the girls would kick his father-in-law’s meal table! And another parent even asked the principal of our school to sack me” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0193723511434328">Park, 2010, November</xref>). This illustrates how the public then perceived football as a men’s sport.</p>
<p>In June 1990, the Korea Football Association (KFA) created the first women’s national team to participate in the Asian Games in Beijing. It recruited 25 players from such other sports as volleyball, athletics, and hockey. It achieved fifth place in a field of six teams on this first international appearance, with one win and four losses. That year the Ewha and Sookmyung Women’s University established a women’s football team, which was a hopeful sign for the development of Korean women’s football (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0193723511434328">KFA, 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>The Korean Women’s Football Federation (KWFF) was established in 2001 under the leadership of Park Jong Hwan, who was the head coach of the Korean men’s semifinalists team in the 1983 FIFA Youth World Championships. The Korean national women’s team won the Toto Cup in August 2001 by beating China, which had been considered unbeatable for a decade. The Toto Cup is a women’s international friendly competition that Sport Toto Ltd, a subsidiary company of Tiger Pools Korea, created and sponsors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0193723511434328">Koh, 2003</xref>). They then achieved third place in the 21st Summer Universiade later that year and later qualified for FIFA WWC for the first time in 2003 but lost all three group-stage matches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0193723511434328">KFA, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>A new generation of women’s football developed as a result of the 2002 Korea-Japan FIFA World Cup. The primary school girls who watched the Korean national men’s team’s semifinal performance in their home stadium became attracted to football. They started to prove their excellence in 2004 by winning the U-19 AFC Championships and reaching the quarterfinals of the FIFA WWC in 2008.</p>
<p>The semiprofessional women’s WK League was established in 2009 but received little exposure or attention. Watching the men’s national team, who passed the group stage in South Africa in 2010, and envying their support, the U-19 girls’ team went relatively quietly to Germany for the U-20 WWC. Hundreds of journalists and supporters welcomed the players home, however, after they achieved third place for the first time in Korean football history. Two months later, the U-17 team won the U-17 WWC in Trinidad and Tobago and returned home to great public acclaim (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0193723511434328">Bae, 2010a</xref>).</p>

<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0193723511434328">Table 2</xref> shows the North Korean women’s football team’s outstanding results over more than two decades. The North Korean public, however, was slow to accept women’s football. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0193723511434328">Kang (2001)</xref>, when the first women’s football team was launched in 1980 the public response was so indifferent that it failed to develop into an official team due to most North Korean people’s perception that women’s football was both a disgrace to what they called the elegance of Korean women, which could be linked to Confucianism, and a decadent leisure sport played in capitalist countries.</p>

<p>Its national women’s football team emerged on the international stage at the 1989 Asian Women’s Championship (AWC), the most prestigious tournament in Asia, where they secured third place. After producing strong performances in Asian competitions, North Korea won the AWC for the first time in 2001 and continued its success in the Asian Games the following year.</p>
<p>North Korean women’s football’s greatest achievements were probably winning the FIFA U-20 Women’s Championship in Russia in 2006, when they shocked the world by displaying excellence throughout the tournament. It was the first time a North Korean team had participated in the FIFA U-20 Championship. They conceded only one goal while scoring 18 in 6 matches. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0193723511434328">FIFA (2006b</xref>, p. 22) praised them in a technical report, saying that they displayed the most consistent and best performances of all the teams in the tournament, specifically that “Korea DPR’s coronation provided the biggest surprise of a spectacular three-week competition that illustrates both the continued evolution of the women’s game and the emergence of some prodigiously talented individuals” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0193723511434328">FIFA, 2006a</xref>). The South Korean media also praised them, pointing out that no Korean men’s or women’s side had ever achieved a world championship before (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0193723511434328">Kim, 2006, September</xref>).</p>
<p>North Korea then won the inaugural U-17 WWC in New Zealand in 2008, thereby establishing its status as a superpower of women’s football, which had previously been that of only the United States, Germany, and to a lesser extent, Brazil (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0193723511434328">FIFA, 2008</xref>). North Korea lost to the host Germany in the quarterfinals of the 2010 U-20 WWC and to Japan in the semifinals of that year’s U-17 WWC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0193723511434328">FIFA, 2010a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0193723511434328">2010b</xref>).</p>

<title>South Korea</title>
<p>The South Korean government’s support for women’s football has been sporadic. As noted earlier, in its urgency to create a women’s football team for the 1990 Beijing Asian Games the South Korean authorities decided to form one using players from such other sports as athletics, taekwondo, and hockey. The KFA and Korea Sports Council expressed strong opposition to the idea of sending such a team to the Asian Games because they were concerned that its probable poor performance would embarrass the Korean people. The Ministry of Sport was nevertheless determined to send the team due to then President Rho Tae Woo’s interest in women’s football (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0193723511434328">Yeoja Chukku, 1990</xref>). One of the team’s coaches later recalled,</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>When I told the players to tackle one of them told me aggressively that tackling is a foul! I couldn’t sleep at all due to worrying about how to teach these girls, who didn’t have even the most basic knowledge about football, and then take them to an international competition! (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0193723511434328">Choi, 2010</xref>)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Another opportunity to promote South Korean women’s football was the 1999 FIFA WWC in the United States. The Korean media covered the competition closely, and its transmissions of the final between the United States and China in a stadium full of 90,000 enthusiastic fans attracted a large audience in South Korea (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0193723511434328">Kim, 2010, July</xref>). This event prompted the Ministry of Culture and Tourism to propose a 3-year to develop and promote women’s football by increasing the number of school, university, and corporate teams from 32 to 70 by 2000 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0193723511434328">Lee, 2010, July</xref>). Park Ji Won, then the minister of culture and tourism, announced that “Korea will put a total of ₩ 3,000 million into women’s football in the next three years. We will provide ₩ 30 to ₩ 50 million to universities and company teams” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0193723511434328">Kwon, 1999</xref>)</p>
<p>This boom in women’s football included the establishing of the Sungmin Wonders, women’s football team, which its coach, Park Jong Hwan, predicted would be the foundation of a successful national team, saying, “The women’s national team will be the world champions in less time than it took the men’s team to progress to the second round in the World Cup in Korea” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0193723511434328">Jung, 2001</xref>). He based this confidence and optimism on the Korean women’s teams’ strong performances in such ball sports as basketball and handball in the previous Olympics and world championships. The Sungmin team was, however, liquidated only 3 years later due to problems with its corporate sponsor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0193723511434328">Shim, 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>Football’s popularity with the Korean people continued after the national team’s second-round performance at the 2010 FIFA World Cup in South Africa, as its women’s teams came third in the U-20 WWC and won the U-17 WWC. The phrase “promote women’s football” appeared in the media almost every day along with various stories about the history of women’s football, the factors involved in Korea’s successes, and its future prospects. Korean women’s football was, however, facing a serious crisis as the number of teams in the country had started to decrease due to a shortage of players and a lack of support. Minister of Culture, Sport, and Tourism Yoo In Chon greeted the U-17 Women’s football team at the Incheon airport and promised, “I will try to solve the problem we are facing in women’s football. We will endeavor to create more teams in universities and companies so that our players can train better” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0193723511434328">Bae, 2010b</xref>).</p>
<p>This comment was a direct result of President Lee Myung Bak’s instructions to him to “prepare a plan to support women’s football, not just one-off but continually” at a luncheon reception for the women’s U-20 team (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0193723511434328">Yoon, 2010, November</xref>). Then he announced a project for promoting women’s football. It included the forming of 45 school teams by 2013 and the creation of two more teams for the WK League. Park Sun Kyu, a deputy minister of culture, sport, and tourism, explained,</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Women’s football produced an excellent result in the U-17 and U-20 World Cups despite little interest from the public and elsewhere. As Brazil, Argentina, and a few European countries can boast of their supremacy in men’s football, we acknowledge that Korean women’s football needs a foundation to be the best in the world. That’s the reason for this project. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0193723511434328">Yoon, 2010, November</xref>)</p>

<title>North Korea</title>
<p>One of the features of North Korean sport in the late 1960s was that the authoritarian communist state began to use it as a means for gaining international recognition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0193723511434328">Lee &amp; Bairner, 2009</xref>). Considering the country’s political circumstances, it is not surprising that little evidence became publicly apparent in regard to the extent of government resources supporting women’s football. According to a media source, the country’s leader, Kim Jung Il proclaimed, “I compliment those who have promoted the DPR Korea to the world. We will support the women’s football team in order to achieve great outcomes in international tournaments with our thinking, fitness, and technical ability” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0193723511434328">Han, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>North Korea’s central media agency, Joongang Tongshinsa, issued a release saying, “The thanks for the absolute 5 to 0 victory over China in the finals of the FIFA U-20 Women’s Championships belong to our Great Leader, Kim Jung Il” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0193723511434328">Han, 2006</xref>). Jang Su Myong, who represented the DPR Korea Football Federation at the 2009 AFC Women’s Awards night, glorified the country’s leader:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>We have to thank our Great Leader Kim Jong-il, who gave us on-the-spot guidance that helped us do well in the tournaments this year. Imagine a leader who takes the time to advise a football team.

<p>Kim Kwang Min, who later took the AFC Women’s Coach of the Year Award in 2009 after winning the Asian title in Vietnam, was equally fervent in his tribute to his country’s leader:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>The reason we did well was the inspiration of our Great Leader Kim Jong-il. And there is a lot of expectation for us to do well, so the players want to play their best and also inspire the next generation of players. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0193723511434328">AFC, 2008</xref>)</p>

<p>The KFA revealed that it paid the ₩ 4.2005 billion (approximately US$4.2 million) that it won in South Africa to the players and coaching staff who progressed through the group stage for the first time on foreign soil (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0193723511434328">Park, 2010, July</xref>), and the ₩ 400.9 million (approximately US$400,000) to the players and coaching staff of the victorious U-17 WWC team, although since these players were students they received their prize money in the form of scholarships. The third-place U-20 players’ prize money was about half that of the champions, U-17s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0193723511434328">U-17 yeoja, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>Apart from tournament prize money, elite players have the possibility of moving to better-paying leagues outside of Asia and earning large sums of endorsement and sponsorship money, as have Park Ji Sung of Manchester United and Lee Young Pyo, formerly of Tottenham Hotspurs and then of PSV Eindhoven. Some have predicted similar professional success for Ji So Yeon, who won the silver boots and silver ball at the U-20 WWC, with reports of her receiving offers from clubs in the United States and Germany, which have not resulted in a contract. Having withdrawn from the WK League’s draft she is ineligible to play in it and has signed to play with the Kobe club in Japan in 2011. Korea’s lack of agents with expertise in women’s football could be the reason for her club problems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0193723511434328">Yoon, 2010, October</xref>).</p>
<p>Moon So Ri, the U-20 team’s goalkeeper, who the media call <italic>Ulzang</italic> (pretty face), signed a sponsorship deal with Le Coq Sportif, a French sportswear and sporting goods company, one of the first such deals for a Korean woman footballer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0193723511434328">On, 2010</xref>). Then Yeo Min Ji, who won the golden ball and golden boots at the U-17 WWC, signed a 3-year deal with the Daehong Communications management firm, which secured a sponsorship contract for her with a dairy-products company called Purmill, which has agreed to provide 50 million annually for Yeo’s training for 3 years and to supply her football team with a dairy drink for a year.

<p>The rewards for North Korean women’s football players are completely different from those of South Korean players. Their principal rewards are apparently such scarce luxuries as houses and cars and titles called <italic>decorations</italic>. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0193723511434328">Han (2006)</xref> reported that the players who won the U-20 FIFA Women’s World Championship in 2006 each received a car and a house. The nature of the country’s political structure and economic situation makes owning a car and a house a significant reward. One of this study’s interviewees supported this by reporting that the members of the North Korean team who won the Asian Women’s Championship in 2001 for the first time each received a house in the capital city Pyongyang, saying,</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Behind the success of women’s football is a strong mentality among the players. What can I say? If we win this we could bring our parents to Pyongyang, or something like that. We can say that a bright future is guaranteed.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Receiving a decoration can change a North Korean’s life. Those interviewed for this study explained that they can be awarded differently for individual and team sports, and several kinds of decorations exist. The most prestigious one is the Kim Il-sung Youth Honorary Prize (<italic>Chung-nyun</italic>), which is for those who achieve the highest result more than 3 times in their sport. The Boys and Girls Honorary Prize (<italic>So-nyun)</italic> for people aged 14 years and younger enables those who receive it to attend the university of their choice. Champions of all-Asian competitions can be knighted and the <italic>In-min Cheyukin</italic> can be awarded to athletes who have either won three championships consecutively, a world championship, or an Olympic gold medal. For example, Jung Sung Ok, who won the 1999 International Association of Athletics Federations World Marathon Championships, became a Hero of the Republic, the first sportsperson in North Korea to do so (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0193723511434328">Kim, 2006, December</xref>).</p>

<title>South Korea</title>
<p>The turning point in South Korean women’s football was probably when the national team won the Toto Cup International Tournament in 2001-2002. This provided the momentum for a few more elementary schools to form girls’ football teams prior to Korea’s cohosting of the 2002 FIFA World Cup. After its success the KFA recognized women’s football’s potential and began to invest a portion of its World Cup earnings into it. It created youth reserve teams like those in men’s football and implemented a policy of more systematic training (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0193723511434328">Suh, 2010</xref>)</p>
<p>As most of South Korea’s elite athletes are based in school teams, women’s football has been doing likewise. The Hyundai group’s efforts for women’s football have been particularly noteworthy. When Chung Mong Joon, the president of Hyundai Heavy Industry, took charge of the KFA in 1993 Hyundai began creating women’s football teams in schools in Ulsan, the city where Hyundai’s headquarters are located, and also a company team in that city (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0193723511434328">Oh, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>Kwon O Gap, then the general secretary of Hyundai Schools, led the project of establishing a women’s football system that includes elementary school, middle school, high school, university, and company teams. The resulting Chungwoon Middle School, Hyundai Information Science High School, Ulsan Science University, and Hyundai Steelers (later changed to the Incheon Steelers) teams have played an important role in South Korean women’s football during the past 18 years. Kwon explained,</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>One early morning in March 1993, President Chung asked me how to create women’s football teams, emphasizing that women’s football had a great potential to succeed. In Ulsan we not only established girls’ school teams but also opened football clinics for mothers and supported kindergartens’ efforts to give football lessons. Several women’s teams in other regions came to Ulsan for a training camp. All the effort we put in is bearing fruit. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0193723511434328">Oh, 2010</xref>)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Six of the champion U-17 squad’s 21 players and 4 players on the national U-20 team had played or were then playing in Ulsan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0193723511434328">Oh, 2010</xref>) Lee Sang Yup, a former head coach of the women’s national team, explained, “Compared to the players in the previous generation, these young players have a higher level of football sense and technical ability” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0193723511434328">Jin, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>Even though women footballers began to produce outstanding results after the 2002 World Cup, the pool of football talent at the grassroots level has remained relatively small, especially compared to other countries’ number of teams and players, which makes the Korean women’s successes in 2010 particularly remarkable. The KFA has registered only 16 high school teams with 339 players and 6 university teams with 158 players. Compared to the more than 800 university teams in existence in the United States, Japan’s approximately 50 university teams, and North Korea’s 20 university and adult teams and 50 school teams, South Korean women’s football’s situation appears perilous even in terms of sheer numbers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0193723511434328">Yeoja Chukku, 2010</xref>)</p>

<p><italic>Chosun Shinbo</italic>, a newspaper published by the pro–Pyongyang Federation of Korean Residents in Japan, reported that the factors involved in producing talented female footballers are the early identification and systematic training of talented girls between the ages of 6 and 15 in schools throughout the country. The government pays these players a salary, and parents therefore enthusiastically encourage their daughters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0193723511434328">Lee, 2009, August</xref>).</p>
<p>One of this study’s interviewees said that some argue that other Asian countries having little interest in promoting women’s football also gives North Korea an advantage. Another interviewee reported,</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Although the developmental efforts led by both governments to promote women’s football could be identified as a commonality, there are specific differences in how such efforts are managed; a top-down policy was implemented in one situation and a bottom-up approach in the other, with some obvious, sharply contrasting features in terms of recognizing the potential of women’s football and support rendered toward the developing the game.</p>
<p>In South Korea, women’s football has received considerable attention from the government and media only a couple of times over the past two decades. Although big tournaments such as the FIFA World Cup and the Asian Games have played a critical role in inducing the government to acknowledge the possibility of women’s football achieving success, they have failed to sustain the initial support provided by the government.</p>
<p>The North Korean government, however, has displayed a different attitude during the same period and has made women’s football a priority sport, apparently to promote the image of its regime internationally. The country’s leader has apparently been particularly committed to making its team the best in the world.</p>
<p>Noting that the Chinese Communist Party has codified a formal system of physical exercise for women (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0193723511434328">Hong, 1997</xref>), it is reasonable to conclude that the leaders of communist states frequently proclaim the importance of developing international-level female athletes in order to propagate the image of their women as socially active (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0193723511434328">Lee &amp; Kim, 2004</xref>). In relation to Confucianism, contrasting points can also be found. Whereas South Korea appears to be reluctant to remove Confucianism from society, leading to the restriction of women’s football for a long time, North Korea presents female football players as role models for North Korean women, with its media playing a crucial role in disseminating and circulating such imagery within the country (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0193723511434328">Lee, 2009</xref>). It can be argued that this propaganda supports the Communist regime in North Korea and, thus, its national ambitions can be viewed as given precedence, doing away with, in effect, the philosophy of Confucianism in North Korea.</p>
<p>Due to their political and economic differences the two nations are also sharply dissimilar in regard to the rewards that their elite female footballers receive, especially compared to their male counterparts. Although South Korea’s male football players receive much more money and other benefits because of the popularity of their sport and the size of its market, North Korea’s female football players benefit from greater rewards than their male counterparts, who have had much less international success.</p>
<p>South Korean women’s football players received some prize money, and a few received sponsorship deals due to their successful U-17 and U-20 WWC performances, which also prompted scouts and coaches from the United States and Germany to show an interest in Korean players; however, such interests did not result in contracts. Such interest by Western clubs could eventually influence the future of some young players, which would be a valuable reward for Korean women’s football as a whole.</p>
<p>North Korea’s success in the 2006 U-20 FIFA Women’s Championships and 2008 U-17 FIFA WWC resulted in those teams’ players being awarded decorations. The players who won the Asian Women’s Championship in 2001 each received a house in the capital city Pyongyang and a car. Even though they apparently received no lucrative monetary reward, the opportunity to move their families to Pyongyang, own their own residences, and, for young players, the right to select their universities were enormous benefits in the context of North Korea. This study’s interviewees also agreed that receiving decorations themselves could change people’s and their families lives for the better.</p>
<p>South Korea established its systematic talent identification and training structure during 2001 and 2002. It founded its youth reserve team after the 2002 World Cup, and it has provided its female footballers with much organized and systematic training. Hyundai’s activities in Ulsan have also benefited South Korean women’s football, as its players’ international performances have demonstrated.</p>
<p>North Korea started establishing a foundation for identifying talented athletes and training them at every level much earlier than the South did. Its larger grassroots-level player population and the number of competitions held to promote women’s football have been a big help in sustaining the growth of women’s football, which is the reason that North Korea has continued to produce high-quality football players for more than 20 years. Its government’s full commitment and support for these activities has, of course, played a central role.</p>
<p>Finally, the role of the military can be mentioned in a different capacity. The creation of The Armed Forces Athletic Corps (Sangmu) in March 2007 contributed to the expansion of the WK League, women’s semiprofessional league in South Korea, whose size increased to holding 5 teams, and later 8 teams, as of March 2011 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0193723511434328">Kim, 2007, January</xref>). Sangmu appears to attract players by emphasizing that they can continue to serve in the army as a “noncommissioned officer” even after retiring from an active playing career. Nevertheless, the impact and significance of this military team on the development of South Korean women’s football remains to be seen. On the other hand, the influence of North Korean military on the development of women’s football is known to be significantly stronger than the South. For example, most of the women’s national players are from a team known as 4.25, named after the founding date of the North Korean military foundation, April 25, 1932, and the team has close ties with the North Korean Peoples’ Army (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0193723511434328">“Success or Else?,” 2011</xref>).</p>

Although the two Koreas share many Confucian/national values, they are internationally recognized as separate states and so implement different sport policies.</p>
<p>Whereas South Korea has been reluctant to remove Confucianism from society, resulting in the restriction of women’s football, North Korea’s Communist propaganda and national ambitions have superseded the philosophy of Confucianism by utilizing female football players as role models. Also, the very different political and economic systems show somewhat contrasting phenomenon between the two Koreas. South Korean players may be given opportunities to pursue individual commercial contracts or a career abroad; however, North Korean players are not able to expect the same kind of benefits, but they can receive life-changing rewards from the state, such as a car and a house, and some may also receive decorations. It would be difficult to measure or evaluate which is the more efficient way of motivating athletes; nevertheless, it is important to consider developing innovative and realistic types of rewards that take into account the different political and economic scenarios prevalent in both counties.</p>
<p>Despite these differences, it is important to point out that the North and the South might have similar policies and approaches to sport. The development of women’s football in both states is driven and funded by the government with a focus on the market (and does not rely on the market), which can be a subtle and counterintuitive feature of the two Koreas.</p>
<p>It is difficult to deny that North Korea has been one of the most successful nations in women’s football in Asia during the past two decades. Although it had no difficulty in qualifying for the tournament, unlike South Korea, its chances of advancing into the final rounds seem to be remote which was confirmed when the North Korean senior side failed to progress to the knock out stage (Quarter-finals) with one draw against Columbia and two defeats by the U.S.A. and Sweden at the FIFA WWC in June 2011.</p>
<p>South Korea needs to sustain a long-term plan and maintain a high level of interest in women’s football with the help of the government and the media. The government’s support, however, has been sporadic, and it has failed to help with promoting women’s football over the long term. The KFA needs to develop and implement additional strategies to the project that the Minister of Culture, Sport, and Tourism has announced and initiate efforts to expand the grassroots player population at the club level.</p>
<p>How these two Koreas continue to develop their women’s football will be monitored and observed in Asia as well as in the rest of the world. There may be a number of aspects that South and North Korea can learn and benchmark from each other should the door of North Korea open more widely. There is a strong desire in the South for reunification with the North, and if this were to occur one cultural byproduct should be an even stronger set of national team in sports, including women’s football.</p>
