<abstract>
<p>Supporters of racial colorblindness are united by their opposition to racial categorization. However, we suggest that the nature of the relationship between racial colorblindness and racial policy attitudes among Whites varies based on individual differences in racial prejudice. Across two independent samples (Studies 1a and 1b), we demonstrated that colorblindness predicts opposition to affirmative action for low prejudice Whites. For high prejudice Whites, who presumably oppose affirmative action regardless of colorblind concerns, no significant relationship between colorblindness and affirmative action support was found. In Study 2, we examined the relationship between various rationales for supporting colorblindness and affirmative action attitudes, and again detected moderation by prejudice. Low prejudice Whites’ evaluations of affirmative action appeared to be based upon perceptions of declining discrimination as well as a concern for balancing the interests of both Whites and minorities. The affirmative action attitudes of high prejudice Whites, in contrast, appeared to be based primarily upon defending the interests of their racial ingroup. The implications of these findings for theoreticians and social justice advocates are discussed.</p>

<p><disp-quote><p>If the Ku Klux Klan thinks that equality is right, God bless them. Thank them for finally reaching the point where logic and reason are being applied, instead of hate. (Ward Connerly, 2006)<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1368430211424763">1</xref></sup></p></disp-quote></p>
<p>In 2006, the voters of Michigan passed the “Michigan Civil Rights Initiative,” which effectively outlawed race-based affirmative action in their state. Ward Connerly, Black chairman of the American Civil Rights Institute, garnered popular support for the initiative by touting the need for a colorblind society. Prior to the eventual passing of the proposal, however, Connerly found himself at the center of a media firestorm when he begrudgingly accepted the Ku Klux Klan’s endorsement of his proposal (see quotation above). As did Connerly, the KKK based their support for the anti-affirmative action initiative on the ideal of racial colorblindness. Assuming that the KKK still harbors fervently racist viewpoints, this example demonstrates that there is more to the colorblind ideology than meets the eye.</p>
<p>In recent years, social scientists have become increasingly interested in the concept of racial colorblindness (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1368430211424763">Apfelbaum, Sommers, &amp; Norton, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1368430211424763">Awad, Cokley, &amp; Ravitch, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1368430211424763">Bonilla-Silva, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1368430211424763">Correll, Park, &amp; Smith, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1368430211424763">Donnelly, Cook, van Ausdale, &amp; Foley, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1368430211424763">Ebert, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1368430211424763">Knowles, Lowery, Hogan, &amp; Chow, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1368430211424763">Lewis, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1368430211424763">Neville, Lilly, Duran, Lee, &amp; Browne, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1368430211424763">Norton, Sommeres, Apfelbaum, Pura, &amp; Ariely, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1368430211424763">Norton, Vandello, Biga, &amp; Darley, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1368430211424763">Plaut, Thomas, &amp; Goren, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1368430211424763">Richeson &amp; Nussbaum, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1368430211424763">Ryan, Hunt, Weible, Peterson, &amp; Casas, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1368430211424763">Tarca, 2005</xref>; Verkuyten, 2005; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1368430211424763">Wolsko, Park, Judd, &amp; Wittenbrink, 2000</xref>). Several basic definitions of racial colorblindness have been offered. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1368430211424763">Jones (1997)</xref>, racial colorblindness is simply “ignoring race, or skin color.” <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1368430211424763">Richeson and Nussbaum (2004)</xref> defined colorblindness as the belief that “racial categories do not matter and should not be considered when making decisions such as hiring and school admissions” (p. 417). Similarly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1368430211424763">Wolsko et al. (2000)</xref> defined color-blindness as “the ideal of learning to judge others as individuals and not on the basis of their social group membership” (p. 637).</p>
<p>In the present work, we define racial colorblindness as simply an opposition to racial categorization. The purpose of this minimalist working definition was to allow for the possibility that those who oppose racial categorization may do so for very different reasons. Specifically, we were interested in the relationship between support for racial colorblindness and individual differences in racial prejudice.</p>
<p>Past researchers have reported associations between racial colorblindness and several forms of prejudice. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1368430211424763">Richeson and Nussbaum (2004)</xref> reported that those who read an essay touting colorblindness showed increases in both explicit and implicit racial prejudice. Similarly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1368430211424763">Ryan et al. (2007)</xref> demonstrated positive associations between measured support for colorblindness and stereotyping and ethnocentrism among Whites. Finally, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1368430211424763">Apfelbaum et al. (2008)</xref> demonstrated that the tendency of White participants to use a colorblind communication strategy during an interaction was associated with an external, but not internal, motivation to respond without prejudice.</p>
<p>In the present research we were interested less in the direct relationship between prejudice and colorblindness, and more in how colorblindness, particularly as it relates to affirmative action attitudes, might be differentially manifested based on individual differences in racial prejudice. Furthermore, unlike <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1368430211424763">Apfelbaum et al. (2008)</xref> we were not interested in colorblindness as an interactional strategy, but instead as an ideology or attitude-guiding belief system. Generally, we propose that individual differences in prejudice among Whites play a key and previously unexplored moderational role in both <italic>how</italic> (Studies 1a and 1b) and <italic>why</italic> (Study 2) colorblindness relates to affirmative action beliefs.</p>
<sec id="section1-1368430211424763">
<title>Basis of support for racial colorblindness</title>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1368430211424763">Knowles et al. (2009)</xref> found that support for racial colorblindness among Whites can be based on either a relatively egalitarian emphasis on distributive justice concerns (a desire that resources and opportunities are balanced proportionately among the races), or a presumably less egalitarian concern with procedural justice (making sure that race does not affect resource or opportunity allocation processes). The former concern is aimed at redressing past harms to minorities. The latter concern is more likely aimed at protecting White dominance by justifying opposition to programs such as affirmative action. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1368430211424763">Knowles et al. (2009)</xref> demonstrated that, especially under conditions of perceived intergroup threat, Whites higher in social dominance orientation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1368430211424763">Pratto, Sidanius, Stallworth, &amp; Malle, 1994</xref>) were more likely to construe racial colorblindness in terms of procedural as opposed to distributive justice.</p>
<p>Although social dominance orientation and racial prejudice tend to be positively correlated among Whites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1368430211424763">Duckitt &amp; Sibley, 2007</xref>), the two concepts are not identical. Social dominance orientation entails general support for social hierarchies, whereas racial prejudice involves an affectively-based preference for one race over another. Therefore, we sought to apply and extend the work of Knowles et al. to individual differences in racial prejudice.</p>
<p>We theorize that Whites higher in prejudice are likely to base their support for a colorblind ideology primarily on racial ingroup interests. Prior research has demonstrated a positive link among Whites between racial prejudice and opposition to affirmative action (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1368430211424763">Sears &amp; Jessor, 1996</xref>). To the extent that the colorblind ideology is perceived as widely and increasingly acceptable (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1368430211424763">Bonilla-Silva, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1368430211424763">Carr, 1997</xref>), it can be used as a publicly defensible justification for pre-existing opposition to policies involving racial categorization that are believed to threaten ingroup interests. To put it another way, those higher in prejudice would oppose a program like affirmative action whether they were racially colorblind or not. The colorblind ideology merely provides a justification for this pre-existing opposition.</p>
<p>For Whites lower in prejudice, we propose that the colorblind ideology fulfills a desire to hold racial beliefs and opinions that (a) are consistent with present racial realities and that (b) balance the interests of both the racial ingroup as well as racial outgroups. Hence, for those low in prejudice, racial colorblindness should have a more determinative effect on affirmative action attitudes. Low prejudice individuals should generally favor affirmative action unless a colorblind ideology prevents them from doing so.</p>
<p>Based on this line of reasoning, we predicted that the relationship between racial colorblindness and affirmative action attitudes would be moderated by individual differences in racial prejudice. Specifically, for Whites higher in prejudice, no association was predicted between racial colorblindness and affirmative action attitudes. For Whites lower in prejudice, support for racial colorblindness was predicted to correlate significantly and positively with opposition to affirmative action. These propositions were tested in Studies 1a and 1b.</p>

<sec id="section2-1368430211424763">
<title>Study 1a</title>
<p>In Study 1a, we sought to test the hypothesis that colorblindness would relate significantly and negatively to affirmative action support only for Whites lower in racial prejudice. In contrast, for higher prejudice Whites, we expected a weak or null relationship between colorblindness and affirmative action attitudes.</p>

<title>Participants</title>
<p>Participants were 176 male (<italic>n</italic> = 78) and female (<italic>n</italic> = 98) White undergraduate college students who attended the Ohio State University at Mansfield. Mean participant age was 20.64 years (<italic>SD</italic> = 5.78) and individual ages ranged from 18–66 years old. The majority of participants completed the study online (<italic>n</italic> = 113) from a computer of their choosing, but a portion (<italic>n</italic> = 63) completed the study in a lab setting.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1368430211424763">
<title>Procedures</title>
<p>Extant measures of racial colorblindness represent various combinations of the functions and rationales discussed in the proceeding section (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1368430211424763">Knowles et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1368430211424763">Neville et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1368430211424763">Ryan et al., 2007</xref>). For example, scales devised by Knowles et al. and Ryan et al. contain items such as, “People who become preoccupied with race are forgetting that we are all just human” and “Recognizing that all people are created equally regardless of their ethnicity” respectively—egalitarian sentiments that appear sensitive to both the ingroup and the outgroup. In contrast, the Neville et al. scale contains items such as “English should be the only official language in the U.S., ” which focuses on dominant group interests. Such scales, then, may be differentially supported by those high and low in prejudice, making it impossible to examine our core hypotheses.</p>
<p>In the present work, a series of items was designed to measure basic support or opposition to racial colorblindness without elaborating upon any specific motivation or rationale. Each of the items entailed deemphasizing race and racial categories in society: “Nothing good will come out of continuing to focus on race,” “America would be better off if we stopped placing so much importance on race,” “The topic of race is something that should generally be avoided,” and “Society would be better off if we all stopped talking about race.” In each case, the reasoning behind the stance was intentionally obscured. For example, with respect to the final item, participants may interpret the word “society” as referring to Whites, minorities, or both. The inter-item reliability of the scale was acceptable (α = .83).</p>
<p>Participants also completed <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1368430211424763">Kravitz and Platania’s (1993)</xref> Affirmative Action Scale. This 6-item scale contains items such as “The goals of race-based affirmation action are good” (α = .72). To measure racial prejudice, participants completed a Thermometer Rating Task (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1368430211424763">Campbell, 1971</xref>) in which they were asked to rate their warmth toward “Blacks” on a scale of 0–100, with higher numbers indicating increasing warmth/reduced prejudice. In addition, participants completed <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1368430211424763">Brigham’s (1993)</xref> Attitudes Toward Blacks Scale. This 20-item scale contains items such as “Generally, Blacks are not as smart as Whites” (α = .90). Again, higher values indicated more positivity, or less prejudice, towards Blacks.</p>

<title>Zero-order correlational analyses</title>
<p>A negative correlation between support for racial colorblindness and affirmative action attitudes was obtained, <italic>r</italic>(176) = −.29, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001. Support for colorblindness was not, however, significantly correlated with either the Black Warmth Scale, <italic>r</italic>(176) = .04, <italic>p</italic> = .563, nor the attitudes towards Blacks scale, <italic>r</italic>(176) = −.01, <italic>p</italic> = .932. In addition, neither the Black Warmth Scale, <italic>r</italic>(176) = .10, <italic>p</italic> = .175, nor the Attitudes Toward Blacks Scale, <italic>r</italic>(176) = .07, <italic>p</italic> = .357, significantly correlated with affirmative action attitudes.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-1368430211424763">
<title>Advanced correlational analyses</title>
<p>Next, the regression procedures described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1368430211424763">Aiken and West (1991</xref>, p. 52) were used to examine whether the relationship between racial colorblindness and affirmative action attitudes was moderated by individual differences in racial prejudice.</p>
<p>First, support for colorblindness, Black Warmth, and a multiplicative interaction term were entered simultaneously into a regression equation predicting affirmative action attitudes. The interaction term in the equation was a significant predictor of affirmative action attitudes, β = −.17, <italic>t</italic>(172) = −2.31, <italic>p</italic> = .022 (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1368430211424763">Figure 1</xref>). The pattern of the interaction was such that there was a significant effect of colorblindness on support for affirmative action for those high in Black Warmth (lower in prejudice) with those higher in colorblindness more likely to oppose affirmative action, β = −.30, <italic>t</italic>(172) = −4.71, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001. As predicted, for those lower in Black Warmth, colorblindness was not significantly associated with affirmative action support, β = −.08, <italic>t</italic>(172) = −1.12, <italic>p</italic> = .265. Hence, racial colorblindness appears to have a greater correspondence with the affirmative action attitudes of low, as opposed to high, prejudice individuals.</p>
<p>An analogous analysis was conducted using the Attitudes Toward Blacks Scale. As above, the interaction term was significant, β = −.15, <italic>t</italic>(172) = −2.04, <italic>p</italic> = .043, and there was a significant effect of colorblindness for those lower in prejudice, β = −.29, <italic>t</italic>(172) = −4.44, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001, but not for those higher in prejudice, β = −.09, <italic>t</italic>(172) = −1.21, <italic>p</italic> = .227. The pattern was very similar to that portrayed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1368430211424763">Figure 1</xref> such that colorblindness only predicted opposition to affirmative action for those with more positive attitudes towards Blacks.</p>
<p>In summary and as expected, support for colorblindness predicted opposition towards affirmative action, but only for Whites lower in racial prejudice. For Whites higher in prejudice, the relationship between colorblindness and support for affirmative action was nonsignificant.</p>

<title>Demographic analyses</title>
<p>Though not focal to the aims of this study, the use of a nationally representative sample allowed the examination of the direct relationship between support for racial colorblindness and the recorded demographic characteristics. There was no significant correlation between support for colorblindness and age, <italic>r</italic>(134) = .12, <italic>p</italic> = .169, or household income, <italic>r</italic>(134) = −.13, <italic>p</italic> = .141.

<p>The results of Study 1b replicated those of Study 1a using a nationally representative sample.

The key aims of Study 2 were to understand differences in the ways in which high and low prejudice individuals rationalize their support for colorblindness, and also how such justifications relate to support for affirmative action.</p>
<p>When asked to explain support for colorblindness, a given individual may cite a variety of justifications and rationales. We chose to focus on three specific rationales for racial colorblindness: (1) the idea that colorblindness protects the interests of racial minorities by reducing stereotyping and stigma (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1368430211424763">Knowles et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1368430211424763">Ryan et al., 2007</xref>), (2) the notion that colorblindness protects ingroup interests by defending against racial policies and practices perceived as harmful to Whites (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1368430211424763">Bonilla-Silva, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1368430211424763">Neville et al., 2000</xref>), and (3) the idea that racial categorization is no longer necessary due to prevailing racial equality (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1368430211424763">Bonilla-Silva, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1368430211424763">Mazzocco et al., 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>We predicted that each of these three rationales would correlate positively with support for colorblindness regardless of prejudice. In other words, we expected that both high and low prejudice individuals would justify their support for racial colorblindness in the same fashion. It is important to note, however, that such rationales can be held either privately or merely publicly. One way to differentiate between the two, and the strategy used in Study 2, was to examine which sets of rationales actually correlate with support for affirmative action, as opposed to merely predicting support for colorblindness. For example, it is possible to publicly cite a particular rationale in justification of colorblindness, while privately basing support for actual racial policy programs on very different criteria. Once again, we believe racial prejudice may in some cases moderate the relationship between a particular rationale for supporting racial colorblindness and support for affirmative action.</p>
<p>To begin, colorblindness might be justified as an expression of concern for racial minorities. This rationale would be consistent with the perception that minimizing racial categorization would deter stereotyping and minority stigmatization, and ultimately would reduce anti-minority discrimination. Both those high and low in prejudice are likely to justify their support for racial colorblindness on this ostensibly virtuous rationale; however, only those low in racial prejudice would be expected to base their opinions of affirmative action on this justification. High prejudice Whites, in contrast, should by definition be less concerned with the plight of minorities as it relates to actual policy.</p>
<p>Colorblindness might also be rationalized by Whites as an expression of ingroup interests. For example, racial colorblindness may be seen by Whites as a remedy against “reverse racism” (e.g., affirmative action) and the playing of the “race card” (i.e., invoking the issue of race or racism to sway public opinion). We strongly predicted that high prejudice Whites would base support for affirmative action on such grounds. Our predictions for low prejudice Whites, however, were less certain. Although egalitarian concerns may entail a belief that the racial ingroup (Whites) should be willing to make sacrifices to redress current and past racial injustices, it may also be the case that low prejudice Whites are not willing to support any action perceived as harmful to the ingroup. In the former case only would an interaction be expected between support for racial prejudice and level of concern for ingroup interests.</p>
<p>Finally, colorblindness may be considered justifiable based on perceptions of trivial or nonexistent ongoing racial disparities and discrimination. In other words, to the extent that race no longer matters, racial colorblindness becomes a more acceptable and valid racial ideology. Correspondingly, progressive racial policies are less likely to be deemed necessary to the extent that racial disparities are perceived to be minimal (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1368430211424763">Kluegel, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1368430211424763">Kluegel &amp; Smith, 1983</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1368430211424763">1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1368430211424763">Mazzocco et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1368430211424763">Tuch &amp; Hughes, 1996</xref>). Whites lower in prejudice, given their predicted penchant for accuracy, were confidently predicted to base their affirmative action attitudes on this rationale. For Whites higher in prejudice, it was deemed more of an open question as to whether they would factor estimates of racial disparities into their evaluations of affirmative action as opposed to focusing solely on the potential harms to Whites.</p>

<title>Method</title>
<sec id="section19-1368430211424763">
<title>Participants</title>
<p>Participants were 110 White male (<italic>n</italic> = 43) and female (<italic>n</italic> = 67) college students who attended the Ohio State University at Mansfield. Mean participant age was 20.23 years (<italic>SD</italic> = 4.98), and individual ages ranged from 18–44 years old. All participants completed the study using an online data collection website.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section20-1368430211424763">
<title>Procedures</title>
<p>Three items were chosen to represent each of the three rationales for supporting racial colorblindness discussed above (all responded to on 7-point “strongly disagree–strongly agree” scales). The three outgroup defense items were as follows: “Society’s focus on race can hurt minorities by increasing Whites’ resentment of them,” “The continued emphasis on race in America is bad for minorities,” “Being hired based on affirmative action can make minorities doubt their true abilities.” The three ingroup defense items were: “The continued emphasis on race in America is bad for White people,” “Programs like affirmative action end up discriminating against qualified Whites,” “Programs like affirmative action give minorities an unfair advantage.” Finally, the three items relating to denial of disparities were: “Racism is a thing of the past,” “Race basically doesn’t matter in society anymore,” “Racial discrimination does not play an important role within society.”</p>
<p>In each case, the items relating to each of the respective composites were positively and significantly correlated with one another. To facilitate analysis and presentation, averaged composites were created of the outgroup defense (α = .54), ingroup defense (α = .62), and denial of disparities (α = .76) items. After responding to these items participants completed the four colorblind items used in the previous studies (α = .82), the Affirmative Action Scale used in Study 1a (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1368430211424763">Kravitz &amp; Platania, 1993</xref>; α = .76), the Attitudes Toward Blacks scale (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1368430211424763">Brigham, 1993</xref>; α = .90), and the Black Thermometer Measure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1368430211424763">Campbell, 1971</xref>). To facilitate and simplify analysis and presentation, the two measures of racial affect (<italic>r</italic> = .54) were standardized and averaged into a composite measure of Black positivity.</p>

<p>A significant though weak association was found between support for racial colorblindness and the composite measure of prejudice indicating that those higher in prejudice (less Black positivity) were somewhat more likely to support colorblindness, <italic>r</italic>(110) = −.20, <italic>p</italic> = .043.</p>

<sec id="section23-1368430211424763">
<title>Support for colorblindness</title>
<p>We next conducted three separate regression analyses using the prejudice composite and each of the colorblind rationales to predict support for colorblindness. In each case, there was no interaction between prejudice and either of the three colorblind rationales (all <italic>p</italic>s &gt; .10). Therefore, we examined the simple correlations between each of the three separate rationales and colorblindness. Support for colorblindness was significantly correlated with the outgroup defense composite, <italic>r</italic>(110) = .36, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001, the ingroup defense composite, <italic>r</italic>(110) = .46, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001, and the denial of disparities composite, <italic>r</italic>(110) = .25, <italic>p =</italic> .008. Hence, as predicted, those who support colorblindness appear to rely on each of the three rationales as justifications, regardless of whether they are higher or lower in prejudice.</p>
<p>It is possible that each of the three rationales only correlated with support for colorblindness because they correlate highly with one another. In fact, associations between the three composites were not exceedingly high. The ingroup defense composite did correlate significantly with both the outgroup defense composite, <italic>r</italic>(110) = .28, <italic>p</italic> = .004, and the denial of disparities composite, <italic>r</italic>(110) = .35, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001, but only weakly so in both cases. The outgroup defense composite and the denial of disparities composite did not correlate significantly, <italic>r</italic>(110) = −.06, <italic>p</italic> = .509.</p>

<title>Affirmative action attitudes</title>
<p>We next conducted a parallel set of analyses using the prejudice composite and the three colorblind rationale composites to predict affirmative action attitudes.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-1368430211424763">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>As predicted, there was a significant interaction between support for the outgroup defense items and level of prejudice, β = −.18, <italic>t</italic>(106) = −2.06, <italic>p</italic> = .042. For those high in prejudice, there was no association between the outgroup defense composite and affirmative action attitudes, β = .01, <italic>t</italic>(106) = 0.06, <italic>p</italic> = .952. In contrast, for those low in prejudice, higher scores on the outgroup defense composite predicted significantly less support for affirmative action, β = −.36, <italic>t</italic>(106) = −2.72, <italic>p</italic> = .008.</p>
<p>In contrast, regarding the ingroup defense composite, the interaction with prejudice was not significant, β = .01, <italic>t</italic>(106) = 0.13, <italic>p</italic> = .897. There was only a main effect of prejudice such that higher prejudice corresponded with less support for affirmative action, β = .34, <italic>t</italic>(106) = 3.28, <italic>p</italic> = .001, and a main effect of the ingroup defense composite such that more support for these items predicted less support for affirmative action, β = −.40, <italic>t</italic>(106) = −4.42, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001.</p>
<p>With respect to the denial of disparities composite, a significant interaction with prejudice was obtained, β = −.25, <italic>t</italic>(106) = −3.04, <italic>p</italic> = .003. As with the outgroup defense composite, for those high in prejudice the denial of disparities composite did not predict affirmative action attitudes, β = .02, <italic>t</italic>(106) = 0.22, <italic>p</italic> = .829, whereas for those low in prejudice, a greater belief that race was irrelevant corresponded with less support for affirmative action, β = −.47, <italic>t</italic>(106) = −3.95, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001.</p>
<p>The results of Study 2 can be summarized as follows: Those high and low in prejudice appear to justify their support for colorblindness based on the same three rationales relating to defending the ingroup, defending the outgroup, and denial of ongoing racism. For those lower in prejudice, their affirmative action attitudes as well appear to be related to these same three sets of beliefs and opinions. In contrast, for those higher in prejudice, their affirmative action attitudes appear to be based primarily on a concern for protecting their ingroup interests.</p>

<title>General discussion</title>
<p>The present studies demonstrate that racial colorblindness can be motivated and rationalized in different ways among Whites depending on level of racial prejudice. Regarding motivations, we proposed that high prejudice Whites are primarily concerned with defending their own ingroup against perceived threats from racial outgroups. As such, racial colorblindness provides a publicly defensible justification for preexisting opposition to programs such as affirmative action. Low prejudice Whites, in contrast, were posited to be focused both on holding a valid set of racial attitudes, as well as balancing the interests of both the racial ingroup and racial outgroups. Hence, colorblindness was predicted to have a determinative influence on the affirmative action attitudes of those low in prejudice. Consistent with these underlying motivations, we demonstrated in Studies 1a and 1b that the affirmative action attitudes of low prejudice Whites were significantly associated with support for colorblindness, whereas affirmative action attitudes were independent of support for colorblindness for high prejudice Whites.</p>
<p>In Study 2, we examined various ways in which racial colorblindness can be rationalized. Specifically, we proposed that racial colorblindness could be rationalized by Whites as (a) a defense of the racial ingroup, (b) a defense of the racial outgroup, and/or (c) a natural response to a decline in the importance of racial disparities and discrimination. We demonstrated that both high and low prejudice Whites based support for colorblindness on each of these three rationales, but that the relationships between support for affirmative action and these three rationales depended upon prejudice. Study 2 demonstrated that low prejudice Whites appeared to base their support for affirmative action on all three of the colorblind rationales, but that high prejudice Whites’ support for affirmative action was based primarily on defending the ingroup.</p>
<p>Building on the work of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1368430211424763">Knowles et al. (2009)</xref> on the relationship between social dominance orientation and colorblindness, these results demonstrate that racial colorblindness is not a unitary construct, but instead can be differentially manifested depending on underlying motivations and rationales. It is important to note, however, that the colorblind ideology presents pitfalls for minorities regardless of the underlying motivations (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1368430211424763">Carr, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1368430211424763">Jones, 1997</xref>). As was demonstrated in the present studies, colorblindness is associated with opposition to affirmative action, a program that continues to play an important role in reducing racial inequalities. When carried to the extreme, a colorblind ideology would prohibit the collection of race-based data on census forms, making it difficult to document and track racial inequalities. Studies have also demonstrated that racial colorblindness can have negative implications for minorities in interpersonal and organizational settings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1368430211424763">Donnelly et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1368430211424763">Plaut et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1368430211424763">Schofield, 1986</xref>).</p>
<p>To the extent that racial colorblindness is harmful towards minorities, future research should examine ways of changing such beliefs. For example, participants might be educated regarding the aforementioned harmful nature of racial colorblindness. The present findings suggest that such information would increase support for affirmative action among low prejudiced, colorblind Whites, but not those higher in prejudice, whose opposition to affirmative action is primarily motivated by anti-egalitarian sentiments.</p>
<p>Although the present work was not focused on the direct relationship between colorblindness and prejudice, it is noteworthy that support for racial colorblindness did not correlate strongly with racial prejudice in any study, including Study 1b, which was based on a nationally representative sample. In other words, determining an individual’s level of opposition to racial categorization without regard to justification does not appear to provide very reliable clues regarding likely level of racial prejudice, or <italic>vice versa</italic>. This finding differs somewhat from previous reports showing consistent positive relationships between support for colorblindness and prejudice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1368430211424763">Richeson &amp; Nussbaum, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1368430211424763">Ryan et al., 2007</xref>); but, as previously discussed, these demonstrations either made use of inductive essays, or scales that highlighted various rationales for colorblind support. In contrast, in the present study, we attempted to measure mere colorblind support or opposition without focusing our scale on any particular motive or rationale.</p>
<p>The present findings of generally null or weak associations between colorblindness and prejudice helps to differentiate the concept of racial colorblindness, as currently construed, from constructs such as modern (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1368430211424763">McConahay, 1986</xref>) and symbolic racism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1368430211424763">Kinder &amp; Sears, 1981</xref>), which are posited to be underpinned by negative racial affect. In fact, the present findings suggest that racial colorblindness, at least among low prejudiced individuals, may operate in a fashion similar to benevolent sexism, which entails discrimination against women that is ostensibly well-intentioned (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1368430211424763">Glick &amp; Fiske, 1996</xref>). In the present case, well-meaning (low prejudiced) Whites may ironically be supporting an ideology which is likely to harm racial minorities in the long run. It should also be pointed out that if the link between colorblindness and harm to minorities were to become common knowledge (as, for example, is more and more the case with modern and symbolic racism), a stronger and positive relationship between support for racial colorblindness and prejudice would likely emerge.</p>
<p>In conclusion, the present work demonstrates that racial colorblindness reduces support for affirmative action primarily among Whites lower in prejudice. Furthermore, these data suggest that racial colorblindness can be differentially manifested depending on underlying motivations and rationales. The ability of racial colorblindness to appeal equally to those both high and low in racial prejudice (albeit for different reasons) makes colorblindness a pernicious ideology by uniting opponents and proponents of continuing racial antipathy under a common rallying call. The present investigation is intended to provide guidance to social justice advocates in terms of understanding the varied nature of racial colorblindness in the hopes that effective countermeasures can be devised.</p>

<p>One potential concern with the main analyses in Studies 1a and 1b is that there may have been smaller associations between colorblindness and affirmative action attitudes among those high in prejudice due merely to constrained variance in support for affirmative action among that group (relative to those lower in prejudice). Indeed, in Study 1a, high prejudice participants (determined by median split with scores on the median thrown out) did exhibit significantly lower variance in affirmative action attitudes according to Levene’s Test of the Equality of Error Variances. This was the case for both the Attitudes Towards Blacks Scale (<italic>SD</italic><sub>high prejudice</sub> = .86, <italic>SD</italic><sub>low prejudice</sub> = 1.21), <italic>F</italic>(1, 170) = 10.90, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001, and the Black Thermometer Ratings (<italic>SD</italic><sub>high prejudice</sub> = .89, <italic>SD</italic><sub>low prejudice</sub> = 1.17), <italic>F</italic>(1, 174) = 6.60, <italic>p</italic> = .011. However, in Study 1b, which was based upon a more robust sample, variance in affirmative action attitudes was not significantly different for high (<italic>SD</italic> = 1.69) and low (<italic>SD</italic> = 1.75) prejudice participants, <italic>F</italic>(1, 124) = .07, <italic>p</italic> = .797.</p></fn>

<label>3</label>
<p>Two of the rationale composites contained items involving affirmative action (one item in the ingroup defense composite, and two in the outgroup defense composite). Therefore, it was possible that any correlations with affirmative action involving these items would be artifactually high. To examine this possibility, the three items mentioning affirmative action were formed into a separate composite and compared with a composite based on the three items not mentioning affirmative action. A Fisher’s r-z transformation test indicated that these two composites were not differentially associated with affirmative action attitudes (<italic>r</italic><sub>AA Items Composite</sub> = −.39, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001; <italic>r</italic><sub>Non-AA Items Composite</sub> = −.35, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001), <italic>z</italic>(110) = .34, <italic>p</italic> = .734. Hence, the danger that the affirmative action items would overinflate the relationship between the rationale composites in question and support for affirmative action appeared to be minimal.</p></fn>
