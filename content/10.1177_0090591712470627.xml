<abstract>
<p>This essay argues that black Americans writing from outside or at the margins of the democratic polity shed important light on the nature of human dignity and on the political emotion that offers—to oneself and to others—the surest proof of the existence of such dignity: indignation. I focus in particular on four insights of this body of black American political thought: that the presumption of dignity is the basis on which citizenship is conferred, while its denial is the justification by which citizenship is withheld; that dignity’s existence within a person is vouchsafed most effectively by indignation, a flash of emotion that arises in response to the insult of its denial; that even though dignity feels woven into one’s innermost being, it is always vulnerable to social denial and therefore stands in need of social confirmation; that indignation can and should be transformed into a self-opposing disposition that resists complacency and seeks continual reconfiguration, or enlargement, of the <italic>demos</italic> and of its democratic theory.</p>

<p>Olivia Cherry, a black woman living in Virginia in the early twentieth century, often found temporary work as a field hand at harvest time. One afternoon (as she recalled later in an interview with an oral historian), she lost her temper because her white employer kept forgetting her name and calling her “Susie.”</p>
<p>“Olivia,” she exclaimed. “My name is Olivia. Can you say that?”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0090591712470627">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>This essay is an effort to show how much political theory is packed into Olivia Cherry’s outburst of indignation. The words and actions of ordinary men and women like Cherry often express a political analysis they have undertaken, one that implies what we would call a political theory. As Alasdair MacIntyre reminds us: “political theories are, by and large, articulate, systematic, and explicit versions of the unarticulated, more or less systematic and implicit interpretations, through which plain men and women understand [their] experience of the actions of others in a way that enables them to respond to it with their own actions. . . . [T]he ordinary agent is able to act in relation to others only because he has theoretical and philosophical commitments of the same kind as those expressed in classical political theory.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0090591712470627">4</xref></sup> I would amend MacIntyre’s insight only to make clear that Cherry’s commitments are not necessarily “of the same kind as those expressed in classical political theory,” if by those words MacIntyre means that they replicate or instantiate the substance of such theory. As we shall see, the thinking of plain black men and women can sometimes surpass, or radically supplement, conventional political theory—for they have brought to bear on their experience a perspective that is largely unavailable to those who produce the theory we know of as “classical.” More specifically, as Charles Mills and George Yancy have argued, black thought on the North American continent has known itself to be deeply situated in its specific historical context and has both refrained from, and even distrusted, the conventional philosophic tropes of distance and spectatorship that underwrite so much classical theory. Leonard Harris has made this point by calling black thought a “philosophy born of struggle.” Charles Mills has done so by contrasting the Cartesian arrival at “I am” (<italic>sum</italic>) with black American philosophy and experience: “the whole point of subordinate black experience, or the general experience of oppressed groups, is that the subordinated are in no position to doubt the existence of the world and other people, especially that of their oppressors. It could be said that only those most solidly attached to the world have the luxury of doubting its reality, whereas those whose attachment is more precarious, whose existence is dependent on the goodwill or ill temper of others, are those compelled to recognize that it exists.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0090591712470627">5</xref></sup> This radically different standpoint, which we might call the standpoint of raced and embodied unfreedom, is one reason why, as Michael Hanchard writes, “black political thought contains within its traditions the possibility of enriching and complicating discussions in political theory about the relationship between theory and history, theory and politics, and the conceptualization of the political.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0090591712470627">6</xref></sup></p>
<p>My focus here will be on the ways a number of black American voices, often speaking from outside or from the very margins of the <italic>demos</italic>, suggest that indignation is a political emotion with potentially powerful consequences for democracy and democratic citizenship. These voices repeatedly indicate that the involuntary nature of the indignation we feel whenever our dignity has been slighted or denied immediately confirms to ourselves and others that we do in fact possess dignity. Their second observation is that in their experience at least, indignation often sets “the mind on fire,” provoking an analysis of the causes and conditions that have sparked it. Finally, these black Americans testify that when one’s indignation takes this inward turn, it has the potential to become a dialectical mode of thought that monitors and assesses one’s response to insult. For them, it often <italic>had</italic> to take this inward turn into reflection, since prompt and direct expression of anger would have been dangerous, even fatal, while total repression of it would have been self-denying and self-destructive. Their challenge, then, was to try to guide their anger toward productive political and social ends, transforming it into an alert and often courageous willingness to think back against the grain of one’s thoughts so as to perceive the contingency and the limits of the positions one has taken. As such, it becomes a self-opposing modality of thought that resists complacency and promotes what I will be calling democracy’s “reconfiguration” or “enlargement” or “reconstruction.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0090591712470627">7</xref></sup> As Axel Honneth has argued “Any negative emotional reactions elicited by the experience of disrespect paid to claims of recognition potentially enable the subject in question to acquire a cognitive grasp of the injustice he has suffered. To this extent, the feelings of moral indignation with which human beings react to insult and disrespect contain the potential for an idealizing anticipation of successful, undistorted recognition.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-0090591712470627">8</xref></sup></p>
<p>As we shall see, this body of political reflection on indignation also sheds light on the nature of dignity itself. It discovers that the presumption of having dignity is the basis on which citizenship is conferred and confirmed, while dignity’s denial (or claimed absence) is the justification by which citizenship is withheld. These black Americans, some of them activists or intellectuals and some of them “plain men and women,” also suggest that individual and personal dignity can and indeed must be confirmed and nurtured through human relationships. Even though it feels like an “intrinsic” quality that is woven into one’s innermost being and expresses one’s value as a distinctive and irreplaceable person, dignity is in fact always in need of social confirmation and vulnerable therefore to social denial. The experience of these black men and women indicates that (white) citizens who can take their citizenship for granted pretend to themselves that such nurturing and confirmation are unnecessary because they wish to believe that their dignity is an unquestionable natural fact not a vulnerable social achievement. By contrast, for black Americans who have been kept outside or at the margins of the polity, the luxury of such pretense has not been an option: many are keenly aware of dignity’s essentially social nature because they have had to work hard and collaboratively to sustain their dignity in the face of whites’ denial or slighting of it.</p>

<title>“That’s When I Started Thinking About”: Indignation and Political Reflection</title>
<p>We might begin with a story James Weldon Johnson tells in his autobiography, <italic>Along This Way</italic>. As a young man living in Jacksonville, Florida, early in the twentieth century, Johnson used to drop by a bicycle shop in town because “in those days, the bicycle shop rivaled the barber shop as a place for the exchange of masculine talk and information. I used to talk freely about race and racial injustices with white men in town that I knew; perhaps more freely than cautious judgment would have warranted.” One afternoon, he found about a half-dozen white men he wasn’t familiar with standing around. As he expressed himself with his usual frankness, he was interrupted suddenly by a white man he had not seen before, “who remarked with a superb sneer, ‘What wouldn’t you give to be a white man?’”</p>
<p>Johnson was stunned by the insult. “The remark hit me between the eyes. The sheer insolence of it rocked me.” After pausing an instant to collect himself, he retorted, “I don’t know just how much I would give. I would have to think it over. But, at any rate, I am sure that I wouldn’t give anything to be the kind of white man you are. No, I am sure I wouldn’t; I’d lose too much by the change.” The man “went livid, then purple. The titter died.” For a moment, violence threatened to explode. But the young white man “seemed to realize that to beat me up would not improve his position in the eyes of the witnesses to the incident. He was spiritually licked.”</p>
<p>Johnson mounted his bicycle and rode away feeling justifiably satisfied with his reply, but after a while he realized that he was still disturbed by the man’s insolent words. They challenged his dignity in a way he had to face, and his thoughts took what I have called an “inward turn”: “I thought: I must go over this question frankly with myself; I must go down to its roots; drag it up out of my subconsciousness, if possible, and give myself the absolutely true answer.” Did he somewhere in his being, Johnson asked himself, actually wish he were a white man? The answer he eventually arrived at after deep reflection was negative: “To conceive of myself as someone else is impossible, and the effort is repugnant.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-0090591712470627">9</xref></sup> Thus, Johnson’s thinking—sparked by indignation in response to insult—went down to the “roots” of the matter and understood his dignity to be an unwillingness to “conceive” of himself “as someone else.”</p>
<p>Here is civil rights activist James Bevel describing what he felt after the September 15, 1963, bombing of the Sixteenth Street Baptist Church in Birmingham:
<disp-quote>
<p>My first reaction . . . was anger, rage. The bombing felt almost like a personal insult; the reactionary forces of the Klan, or whoever, were trying to teach us a lesson. Then I got information to the effect that some of the guys involved in it were from the sheriff’s department, and then I was thinking about killing people. I had to do a lot of thinking about that. That’s when I started thinking about what would be the appropriate response to that kind of situation.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Once again, “thinking” has been sparked by the experience “personal insult” and indignation. To be sure, Bevel’s thinking, like Johnson’s, was conditioned by his life and circumstances. As a Christian and a young civil rights activist who believed strongly in nonviolence, Bevel was predisposed to transform his “thinking about killing people” into thinking of another kind. Nonetheless, this transformed thought is indisputably a form of political theorizing. Bevel goes on to say: “I think it’s natural for humans to get angry when there’s an intense violation, and I think if a person doesn’t have the capacity to get angry, they don’t have the capacity to think through fully the implications of that which causes them to be angry.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-0090591712470627">10</xref></sup> What Bevel is narrating here is his experience that when indignation does not express itself immediately as violence, it becomes an investigation of (and what he believes is a more appropriate response to) whatever has caused it.</p>
<p>As a third example, here is Pauli Murray, the first black female Episcopal minister and a cofounder of the National Organization of Women, describing how she responded to the murder of her father by a white man.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>It took many years for me to get over the shock of my father’s murder. . . . And while I could not always suppress the violent thoughts that raged inside me, I would nevertheless dedicate my life to seeking alternatives to physical violence and would wrestle continually with the problem of transforming psychic violence into creative energy.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-0090591712470627">11</xref></sup></p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>What Bevel calls “the capacity to think through,” Murray describes as “the problem of transforming psychic violence into creative energy.” Murray’s words also underscore the existential pain caused by indignation. The fire that illuminates also burns; as “psychic violence,” indignation always threatens to turn against the person who feels it and to consume them in their own anger.</p>
<p>A number of writers of slave narratives attest to the way their indignation prompted such a burning awakening and with it a train of political reflection upon their situation. Perhaps the most eloquent account is James McCune Smith’s description of Frederick Douglass, in his Introduction to <italic>My Bondage and My Freedom</italic>: “blows and insults he bore, at the moment, without resentment; deep but suppressed emotion rendered him insensible to their sting; but it was afterward, when the memory of them went seething through his brain, breeding a fiery indignation at his injured self-hood, that the resolve came to resist, and the time fixed when to resist, and the plot laid how to resist. ”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-0090591712470627">12</xref></sup> J. W. C. Pennington writes of his family that after his father was whipped for no good reason by their master, “each member felt the deep insult that had been inflicted upon our head; the spirit of the whole family was roused; we <italic>talked of it in our nightly gatherings</italic>, and showed it in our daily melancholy aspect. . . . Although it was some time after this event before I took the decisive step, yet <italic>in my mind and spirit</italic>, I never was a <italic>Slave</italic> after it.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-0090591712470627">13</xref></sup> Henry Bibb recalls the deep indignity of being “compelled to stand and see my wife shamefully scourged and abused by her master, ” and he writes, “The circumstances in which I was then placed, gave me a longing desire to be free. It kindled <italic>a fire of liberty</italic> within my breast which has never yet been quenched.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn14-0090591712470627">14</xref></sup> William Craft describes the day when he and his beloved sister were auctioned off to different owners; he implored the auctioneer to allow him to say goodbye to her, but he was callously rebuffed. Craft writes: “the thought of the harsh auctioneer not allowing me to bid my dear sister farewell, sent <italic>red-hot indignation</italic> darting like lightning through every vein. It quenched my tears, and appeared to <italic>set my brain on fire</italic>, and made me crave for power to avenge our wrongs!”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn15-0090591712470627">15</xref></sup></p>
<p>James Baldwin’s phrase for this “fiery indignation” that goes “seething through [the] brain” is “the rage of the disesteemed.” It is, he writes, “personally fruitless, but it is also absolutely inevitable; this rage, so generally discounted, so little understood even among the people whose daily bread it is, is one of the things that makes history. Rage can only with difficulty, and never entirely, be brought under the domination of the intelligence and is therefore not susceptible to any arguments whatever. This is a fact which ordinary representatives of the <italic>Herrenvolk</italic>, having never quite felt this rage and being unable to imagine it, quite fail to understand.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn16-0090591712470627">16</xref></sup></p>
<p>More explicitly than the others whom we have been reading, Baldwin articulates the agonizing tension between venting one’s anger and transforming it, describing this inner struggle with extraordinary precision. By noting that indignation “can only with difficulty, and never entirely, be brought under the domination of the intelligence,” he points to the unending, almost Sisyphean nature of the struggle: the intelligence must seek to dominate indignation in order to transform it into creative thought and action, yet that domination can never become absolute because intelligence alone can neither cause indignation nor reason it away. Indignation, like the dignity it bears testimony to, “is not susceptible to any arguments whatever.” Baldwin also calls attention to two other features of indignation. One is that those who have never experienced it cannot imagine it or understand it.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn17-0090591712470627">17</xref></sup> A second is that even those who have experienced it “daily” often fail to honor and understand it; too often, he implies, they feel slights to their dignity as so wounding and so threatening that they choose to repress rather than to reflect upon and rebut them.</p>
<p>If Baldwin is correct, then the black American experience of indignation he describes somewhat qualifies Martha Nussbaum’s belief that because “Indignation involves the idea of a wrong or harm,” it is conducive to “reasoning that can be publicly articulated and publicly shaped” and therefore qualifies as a political emotion.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn18-0090591712470627">18</xref></sup> The voices we have heard do not cast doubt on Nussbaum’s identification of the political with what can be reasonably articulated and debated; indeed, they seem to share that view. The important shade of difference between them and Nussbaum lies in their calling our attention to the involuntary and unreasoning nature of indignation itself and in their suggesting that we should value these qualities precisely because they testify so powerfully to our possession of dignity. (Curiously, Nussbaum overlooks the psychological and etymological connections between indignation and dignity; both derive from the Latin <italic>dignus</italic>, meaning “worthy,” and from the Indo-European root <italic>dek</italic>, “to take, accept.”) We cannot claim to possess it by way of argument or reason any more than we can persuasively claim to have charisma or sex appeal. Our dignity lies dormant, so to speak, until it is denied or recognized by another. What makes our indignation such a persuasive witness to our dignity’s presence is that it gives its testimony independently of our own will; we do not control it, and so our dignity seems to speak for itself. To be sure, as the figures we have been reading indicate, indignation can be <italic>transformed</italic> into “reasoning that can be publicly articulated and publicly shaped,” but this transformation is always painful and necessarily incomplete. It cannot fully account for or “dominate” all of the emotion, so it necessarily leaves behind a residue. This remainder is what causes the struggle to be both unending and self-critical—open to assessment and revision, yet also dangerously prone to embitterment, contempt, and <italic>ressentiment</italic>.</p>
<p>As a “creative energy” responding to the denial of dignity, then, democratic indignation has helped produce political reflection that is both practical and theoretical, both opposing and self-opposing. Melding critique of the <italic>demos</italic> with self-criticism, it has contested oppression, deplored quiescence, and debated the forms resistance to oppression should take. It is imbued with an intensely dialectical spirit and a deep appreciation for conflict. Anna Julia Cooper both typifies and describes this spirit when she writes, in <italic>A Voice from the South</italic>, that “progressive peace in a nation is the result of conflict; and conflict, such as is healthy, stimulating, and progressive, is produced through the co-existence of radically opposing or racially different elements.” She calls this coexistence “the stable equilibrium of opposition.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn19-0090591712470627">19</xref></sup> Ralph Ellison expressed such an appreciation of conflict when he wrote that “American democracy is a most dramatic form of social organization, and in that drama each of us enacts his role by asserting his own and his group’s values and traditions against those of his fellow citizens. Indeed, a battle-royal conflict of interests appears to be basic to our conception of freedom.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn20-0090591712470627">20</xref></sup> His description of jazz as “antagonistic cooperation”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn21-0090591712470627">21</xref></sup> would be an apt description of this process of transforming “psychic violence” into “creative energy,” one that fuses opposition <italic>and</italic> self-opposition.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn22-0090591712470627">22</xref></sup></p>

<title>What Is “The Essential Dignity of Humanity?”</title>
<p>If indignation bears powerful witness to one’s dignity and can prompt reflection that analyzes the reasons why one’s dignity has been denied or challenged, what exactly <italic>is</italic> the dignity that it both reveals and protects? Within the slave-narrative tradition, the best-known answer to this question is Frederick Douglass’s, which he gives as he concludes his account of his wrestling match with the slave-breaker Edward Covey:
<disp-quote>
<p>This battle with Covey was . . . the turning point in my “life as a slave.” It rekindled in my breast the smouldering embers of liberty. It brought up my Baltimore dreams and revived a sense of my own manhood. I was a changed being after that. I was nothing before: I was a man now. It recalled to life my crushed self-respect, and inspired me with renewed determination to be a free man. A man without force is without the essential dignity of humanity. Human nature is so constituted, that it cannot honor a helpless man, though it can pity him, and even this it cannot do long if signs of power do not arise.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn23-0090591712470627">23</xref></sup></p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p><italic>A man without force is without the essential dignity of humanity</italic>: following on the heels of his description of his physical struggle against Covey, Douglass’s words have the ring of an immediate, intuitive truth.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn24-0090591712470627">24</xref></sup> But is Douglass correct? <italic>Is</italic> “the essential dignity of humanity” a form of force or power? The testimony of slave narratives is mixed on this question; indeed, Douglass‘s <italic>Narrative</italic> is anomalous because it is one of the few to recount an act of successful <italic>physical</italic> resistance to a slave master. Most other narratives throw into relief both how courageous Douglass’s decision was and how contingent it was on his highly unusual circumstances—including his personal size and strength, the happenstance of his being put out to hire with Covey (who had a reputation to protect), and the unwillingness of his fellow slaves to intercede and help Covey.</p>
<p>Dignity and indignation are represented differently—and more typically—in Harriet Jacobs’s <italic>Incidents in the Life of a Slave Girl</italic>. Unlike Douglass, who tends to present himself as a heroically self-made individual, Jacobs locates herself within a network of relationships and makes clear that she has learned about her dignity by observing others and modeling her behavior on theirs.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn25-0090591712470627">25</xref></sup> She tells us that as a girl she was influenced by the stubborn dignity modeled by her father and by her brother William. She carefully points out that her father’s dignity seemed to have two sources—one inherent and natural, the other produced socially through his work: he “by his nature, as well as by the habit of transacting business as a skillful mechanic, had more of the feelings of a freeman than is common among slaves.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn26-0090591712470627">26</xref></sup> She also tells us that her brother William likewise derived his sense of self-worth both from his own nature (“my brother was a spirited boy”) and from his relationship with their father (“being brought up under such influences, he early detested the name of master and mistress”) (9). One day her brother was called simultaneously by both his father and his mistress. He hesitated, uncertain as to who “had the strongest claim upon his obedience,” and then went to his mistress. His father was greatly displeased, and instructed him: “You are my child, . . . and when I call you, you should come immediately, if you have to pass through fire and water” (9). The lesson was clear: by honoring his father’s dignity he would also fortify his own.</p>
<p>Jacobs calls more attention not just to the relational nature of dignity, but to the independence of dignity from what Douglass calls “force.” Continually harassed and bullied by Dr. Flint, she feels his lascivious advances as threats to her “self-respect” and “pride,” words that at first express her fidelity to what she calls the “pure principles” of Christian womanhood instilled by her first mistress and her grandmother. But as a woman subject to the constant threat of rape, she does not believe that successful physical resistance is really an option. This is why, when she realizes that Flint will never cease trying to seduce and threatening to rape her, she enters into a liaison with another white man whom she calls “Mr. Sands.” This relationship, she believes, will offer her protection. Narrating this part of her life story, however, she is deeply conscious that she risks alienating or offending her nineteenth-century readers, most of whom were white, middle-class abolitionist women in the North. In what may be the most-discussed chapter of her book, Jacobs addresses their misgivings directly: “And now, reader, I come to a period in my unhappy life, which I would gladly forget if I could. The remembrance fills me with sorrow and shame. It pains me to tell you of it; but I have promised to tell you the truth, and I will do it honestly, let it cost me what it may.”</p>
<p>Jacobs confesses that her “calculation” to have an affair with Sands was “deliberate.” Her motives were complex, but the one she emphasizes has to do with asserting her “pride,” which I take to mean not vanity but her personal sense of dignity and self-worth: “to be an object of interest to a man who is not married, and who is not her master, is agreeable to the pride and feelings of a slave, if her miserable situation has left her any pride or sentiment. It seems less degrading to give one’s self, than to submit to compulsion. There is something akin to freedom in having a lover who has no control over you, except that which he gains by kindness and attachment” (54-55). Later, to be sure, Jacobs gives a more conventional reason for her affair: knowing that she will perforce bear the children of whichever man she has sexual relations with, she prefers to bear the children of Sands. For Flint was known to sell slaves with whom he had affairs, “especially if they had children.” But Jacobs then reverts to the first version of her motives, explaining that she wanted to anger Flint: “I knew nothing would enrage Dr. Flint so much as to know that I favored another; and it was something to triumph over my tyrant even in that small way.” Clearly she wants to get revenge on Flint; she feels she can shore up her own dignity through a sally at his, since by preferring another man, she can cast doubt on Flint’s manhood.</p>
<p>I think we may infer two things about dignity from Jacobs’s <italic>Narrative</italic>. The first is that it is not reducible to or dependent on “force.” The second is that, although it thrives in conditions of personal and political freedom, it is not to be identified with these. As Jacobs puts it, her dignity is something “akin to freedom.” Nor is it to be confused with agency.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn27-0090591712470627">27</xref></sup> As we have seen, slave narratives suggest that the feeling of possessing dignity is rarely something one can will or exercise agency about, nor does a sense of one’s dignity necessarily lead to or take the form of resistance. Dignity occupies a middle space between these terms. It refers to the always-present possibility that a person might recover, remember, or reclaim her sense of intrinsic self-worth through intersubjective exchanges in which that very thing is being slighted or denied. Involuntary indignation is often the sensation that catalyzes this possibility, and indignation is always a social emotion, totally embedded in a matrix of intersubjective relations between persons. (We can be angry with things and animals, but not indignant with them. Nor can we willfully display our dignity without looking pompous.) Thus, our dignity is something we cannot ever be the sole creators or possessors of; we need relations with others in which they recognize it; by its nature, dignity is something socially produced and affirmed (or denied).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn28-0090591712470627">28</xref></sup> For these reasons, any analysis that simply opposes dominance to resistance and power to agency cannot adequately describe the nature of dignity nor give a complete account of indignation’s effects on what Orlando Patterson has called “the battlefront of the political psychology of [the slave’s] relation with the slaveholder.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn29-0090591712470627">29</xref></sup></p>
<p>For a mind that reasons from the presumption of its own freedom, this entwining of the intrinsic and the social is hard to grasp. A mind that thinks of itself as ontologically free tends not to see that it is in fact always conditioned by an ineluctable situatedness. It carves existence into two distinct realms, the free and the unfree, and then it understands its own “agency” as being possible only insofar as it is in the realm of the free or returning to it. By contrast, living as they do within conditions of radical unfreedom, Jacobs and Douglass produce “philosophical reflective thought” that knowingly situates itself, as George Yancy writes, “within the concrete muck and mire of <italic>raced</italic> embodied existence, thus deconstructing the myth of philosophy and the philosopher as Olympian.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn30-0090591712470627">30</xref></sup> Therefore, they have to employ a conceptual vocabulary, including this freedom/unfreedom binary, that doesn’t quite map onto their life as they experience it nor onto the world as they know it. Yet for this very reason, their words point to a truth about freedom and dignity that this vocabulary derived from classic political theory tends to occlude: the two are both dependent on <italic>and</italic> independent of each other. (I believe that Douglass was driving at just this point when he titled his second autobiography <italic>My Bondage and My Freedom</italic>.) We repossess our freedom in part through a recognition of our ontological situatedness; we repossess our dignity in part through a recognition of our individual unimportance; we repossess our power in part through our acceptance of our vulnerability. A person who reasons from within conditions that make the <italic>presupposition</italic> of freedom unreasonable does not say only, “I am indignant because you have deprived me of an ontological state of freedom,” but also states, “I am indignant because you have denied my dignity—that sense of an inner ‘domain as broad as’ my own ‘heart.’” Such a person understands that dignity has to do with recognition and regard, not just liberty; she sees that while dignity does indeed refer to “intrinsic human worth,” this very sense of the intrinsic arises within—and is dependent upon—a social matrix of interpersonal relations.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn31-0090591712470627">31</xref></sup></p>

<title>“When My Eyes Caught His”: The Social Production of Personal Dignity</title>
<p>Orlando Patterson has described with brutal eloquence how “slavery, for the slave, was truly a ‘trial by death,’ as Hegel called it. Out of this trial the slave emerged, if he survived at all, as a person afire with the <italic>knowledge of</italic> and the need for dignity and honor. . . . Confronted with the master’s outrageous effort to deny him all dignity, the slave even more than the master came to <italic>know</italic> and to desire passionately this very attribute. For dignity, like love, is one of those human qualities that are most intensely felt and <italic>understood</italic> when they are absent—or unrequited.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn32-0090591712470627">32</xref></sup></p>
<p>I have emphasized Patterson’s words <italic>knowledge of, know</italic>, and <italic>understood</italic> because we are engaged here in a recovery (sometimes speculative, to be sure) of what enslaved persons knew and even theorized about dignity, not just what they might have experienced without reflection. They knew, first, that their dignity was exceedingly vulnerable to denial by others and thus that it was in a deep sense dependent upon recognition by others. They understood also the crucial role their own community and family played not just in affirming their dignity through a casual look or word but in nurturing and sustaining it when it came under assault from others. These insights led them to understand in turn that relationships are sites of intense political struggles as we assert dominance over, or resist submitting to, the power of others. As Patterson makes clear, the slavery system waged unremitting war upon the dignity of the enslaved: their dignity was not just incidentally or collaterally damaged as the master sought to exploit their labor; rather, their dignity was itself the citadel to be captured and razed, day after day, year after year. There could hardly have been an enslaved person who did not know, by the time he had reached a certain age, that dignity was the precious essence over which slave and master fought and that relationships were the ground on which the struggle was waged. As historian Steven Hahn has recently argued, this perspective on relationships should encourage us to reimagine what we think “the political” means: “Slavery . . . was a system of extreme personal domination in which a slave had no relationship that achieved legal sanction or recognition other than with the master, or with someone specifically designated by the master. . . . Consequently, the slaves’ struggles to form relations among themselves and to give those relations customary standing in the eyes of masters and slaves alike was the most basic and the most profound of political acts in which they engaged.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn33-0090591712470627">33</xref></sup></p>
<p>Indeed, relationships became contested political grounds not just as enslaved blacks and then the freed men struggled to preserve and promote relationships among themselves, but as whites and blacks struggled to control the nature and the meaning of their relationships with each other. In <italic>Incidents</italic>, as we have seen, Jacob describes in detail her long, pitched battle with her master, Dr. Flint, who sought by all means short of brute force to make her his concubine—that is, to structure the master–slave relationship as a master–concubine relationship. Flint clearly wished to have at least the <italic>semblance</italic> of an authentic, reciprocal relationship with Harriet herself. Jacobs never tells us so, but we can infer from Flint’s words and actions that he did not wish her to be merely an inhuman object of his physical desire; he did not want to put himself in a position where sexual relations with Harriet would have consisted of repeated rapes. In short, it wasn’t just her body that he desired but her person, her personhood. However, as Jacobs makes clear, the very fact that he, who held her enslaved, could imagine having an authentic relationship with her, only intensified her repulsion and disdain—and her determination to resist. For what his fantasy expressed and exposed was the ugly hypocrisy lurking at all times in the attitude slave masters took toward the persons they had enslaved. If they had consistently treated them simply as “living tools” or “brutes,” they would have been evil enough. But even worse was that they tried to form and benefit from relationships with their slaves—relationships predicated implicitly in word and glance and touch on their recognition of their slaves humanity—while at the same time formally denying their slaves’ personhood in order to continue benefitting from their unpaid labor.</p>
<p>Against this manifest hypocrisy, the political objective of many slaves was both “to form relationships with other slaves” (as Hahn argues) <italic>and</italic> to deny or transform their relationships with their masters. Since the master was trying to benefit from relationship even while formally and legally denying it, an enslaved person’s political resistance could take the form of spurning such relationship (as Jacobs did) or of insisting that this relationship be acknowledged and honored. William Wells Brown relates that after being hired out to various persons by his master, he returned “home” to discover that all the rest of his family had been sold away. His master approached him “very politely,” which immediately suggested to Brown “that something was the matter.” Sure enough, his master informed Brown that since he had sold all the rest of Brown’s family, he thought it best to sell him now as well. In response, Brown tells us, “I raised up my head, and looked him full in the face. When my eyes caught his he immediately looked to the ground” (27). Clearly, Brown’s master was deeply ashamed. He knew that he had a relationship with Brown and his family, and he knew that he had denied that relationship by selling them and by now intending to sell Brown. When Brown looked him “full in the face,” he had to look away both to conceal his shame and to deny the relationship both knew was there. But in doing so, he implicitly acknowledged the very facts he was seeking to deny.</p>
<p>Of course, few enslaved persons would have dared to challenge their master with such a look. They knew from firsthand experience that any sign of black indignation might be read by whites as “insolence” or worse, and could provoke a counterreaction of utterly disproportionate fury. The barest assertion of black dignity seemed to challenge not just the authority of whites but, their very personhood. In <italic>The Fugitive Blacksmith</italic>, J. W. C. Pennington offers an especially vivid description of such an outburst of counterindignation:
<disp-quote>
<p>I was one day shoeing a horse in the shop yard. I had been stooping for some time under the weight of the horse, which was large, and was very tired; meanwhile, my master had taken his place on a little hill just in front of me, and stood leaning on his cane, with his hat drawn over his eyes. I put down the horse’s foot, and straightened myself to rest a moment, and without knowing that he was there, my eye caught his. This threw him into a panic of rage; he would have it that I was watching him. “What are you rolling your white eyes at me for, you lazy rascal?” He came down upon me with his cane, and laid over my shoulders, arms, and legs, about a dozen severe blows, so that my limbs and flesh were sore for several weeks; and then after several other offensive epithets, left me.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn34-0090591712470627">34</xref></sup></p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Why did his master fly into a “panic of rage” when Pennington’s eyes accidentally met his own? “He would have it that I was watching him,” writes Pennington: the master interpreted this casual glance as an act of surveillance. But why would he leap to such a paranoid inference? And why would it provoke him to such violent, <italic>panicked</italic> anger? The answer, as I have argued elsewhere, is that by being so absorbed in the craft of his own work, Pennington had existentially stepped out of slavery into a condition of relative freedom; when he happened to look up, his eyes were those of a free man looking freely upon the world, the eyes of a man who had dignity and was expressing it in his very mien. Not knowing that his master was nearby, he hadn’t veiled his eyes or assumed a submissive posture to protect himself and his master from the explosive collision of their two personhoods. His master <italic>panicked</italic> because the truth had suddenly burst into plain view: the truth, so threatening to a slavery system based upon the presumption of innate black inferiority, was that an enslaved black man was a <italic>person</italic> with as much dignity as a free white man. The master’s rage was <italic>panicked</italic> because for an instant he could not deny the evidence of his own senses, that his slave had dignity. And this—for reasons that will become clear as we proceed—was profoundly threatening to his own sense of self-worth, which somehow depended upon the denial of dignity to blacks like Pennington. As Orlando Patterson has noted, “What was universal in the master-slave relationship was the strong sense of honor the experience of mastership generated, and conversely, the dishonoring of the slave condition” (11).</p>
<p>This dynamic in which whites’ sense of their dignity depended on their denying the dignity of blacks remained fundamentally unchanged during the era of Jim Crow. The only change that Emancipation brought was to transform the struggle over dignity within a slavery system to a struggle over dignity within democracy. In both political regimes, relationships were both a site and a means of this contest. As black sociologist Charles S. Johnson, the editor of <italic>Opportunity</italic>, wrote in 1936: “Race relations, in an ultimate sense, are personal relations, and changes in relations may be expected to follow changes in personal experiences.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn35-0090591712470627">35</xref></sup> This battle over personal relationships—over whether they would or would not be ones in which dignity was mutually recognized and confirmed—led a number of post-Emancipation black American writers and thinkers to conclude that democracy cannot be true to its own principles if it fails to protect citizens against such denial. Indeed, their words sometimes go further and suggest that alongside freedom and equality, dignity should be accorded an equal place in a trio of crucial democratic values. Finally, their writings indicate that while we each have a right to have our dignity recognized by others, we also and perhaps more deeply have an <italic>obligation</italic> to recognize the dignity of others. They suggest, in a word, that democracy comes into being and is sustained precisely in those moments when citizens look at one another and see one another and with that look confirm each other’s all-too-vulnerable sense of self-worth.</p>
<p>Here is Pauli Murray’s incisive account of what it felt like <italic>not</italic> to be thus seen: “Each morning I passed white children as poor as I was going in the opposite direction on their way to school. We never had fights; I don’t recall their ever having called me a single insulting name. It was worse than that. They passed me as if I weren’t there! They looked through me and beyond me with unseeing eyes.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn36-0090591712470627">36</xref></sup> Black existentialist philosopher Lewis Gordon has argued that this refusal to see is a deliberate act that constructs and imposes a particular relationship even as it seeks to deny all relationship:
<disp-quote>
<p>It makes the Other a form of presence that is an absence, an absence of human presence. That being so, the Other falls below the category of otherness, for an Other is a human being. Forced into the realm of property, even linguistic appeals—cries for recognition—are muffled, unheard; waving hands, gestures for acknowledgment are invisible. It is not that they do not trigger impulses between the eye and the brain. It is that there has been a carefully crafted discipline of unseeing.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn37-0090591712470627">37</xref></sup></p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Gordon is calling attention here to the degree to which withholding relationship is actually itself a form of relationship, and an aggressive one at that. When an “Other” comes into our range of vision, we cannot help but “see” them in a strictly objective fashion. But with practice we can learn to feign very successfully that we have not seen them, and that they occupy no space whatsoever in our visual field. We pretend that they are invisible, and that we see through them. Eventually, with repetition, this pretense becomes a habit so deep that it feels natural—as natural as our not seeing the light switch our fingers can find without help from our eyes, as routine as our not noticing something as important as the color of our beloved’s eyes. But there is an awful difference between these kinds of unseeing. One occurs simply because we have come to take something for granted; the other is learned and requires training and discipline. When we have learned to fail to see an Other, we must at first have <italic>refused</italic> to see them many times. And this refusal means not merely keeping them in the category of the unknown other, like a stranger we have not yet met, but actually keeping them from even stepping into that category. We pen them into a realm in which they are stripped even of their Otherness as a stranger to us. This is what Gordon means by saying that we turn them into “a form of presence that is an absence, an absence of human presence.” This absence is not merely an absence; it remains a “form of <italic>presence</italic>” because we produce it in an intersubjective moment of exchange with the Other. What we exchange, on our part, is not mere indifference or blindness but refusal. Yet we cannot refuse to recognize except insofar as we have first felt, however subtly and fleetingly, an impulse to recognize. We cannot refuse to recognize someone whom we literally do not see, only someone whom we know perfectly well is actually there before us. Our unseeing is therefore palpable, like a withheld handshake. We cannot perform or transact it alone; we need the presence of the Other before we can turn it into an absence.</p>
<p>This dynamic is a two-way street. When Pennington recalls that his “eye caught” his master’s and “threw him into a panic of rage,” he uncovers the cause of the defensive anger many white persons felt when they were seen by a black person whose dignity they had denied or slighted. What Pennington’s casual glance inadvertently exposed was his master’s pathetic investment in a claimed racial superiority that could substitute for a more precarious and vulnerable dignity. That is, when whiteness can serve as an indisputable sign of personal dignity, then one’s dignity no longer depends upon its recognition and affirmation by others. We can perceive this displacement of dignity into whiteness when (to choose one of many examples) South Carolina Representative Milton J. Durham opposed the 1874 Civil Rights Act, stating that, “The poorest and humblest white person in my district feels and knows that he or she belongs to a superior race morally and intellectually, and nothing is so revolting to them as social equality with this inferior race.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn38-0090591712470627">38</xref></sup> W. E. B. Du Bois was just one of many black Americans to write about seeing through this specious claim and knowing that, in doing so, he provoked white rage: “I know their thoughts and they know that I know. This knowledge makes them now embarrassed, now furious. . . . We whose shame, humiliation, and deep insult [a white person’s] aggrandizement so often involved were never deceived. We looked at him clearly, with world-old eyes, and saw simply a human thing, weak and pitiable and cruel, even as we are and were.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn39-0090591712470627">39</xref></sup></p>
<p>Many black American writers have approached and dramatized, in very different ways, these interpersonal dynamics of seeing or refusing to see. They have observed that in that moment of eye contact, a decision inevitably took place: either one recognized the other person’s dignity, or one did not. And they realized as well that that decision, precisely because it had to be <italic>made</italic>, implicitly proved the presence of the “other” and raised the question of his or her dignity. (After all, one doesn’t feel obliged to deny something that isn’t there; one doesn’t need a <italic>discipline</italic> of unseeing if no one is there to be seen.) These writers suggest that it is there—in these moments of eye contact or its refusal—that democracy either lives or dies. They suggest that while citizens may be autonomous beings who possess inalienable rights, one of these is the right <italic>to be seen</italic> in a certain way by one’s fellow citizens: as a person with innate democratic dignity who is worthy of respect. Consequently no democratic citizen has the right to express a prejudice or aversion so strong that it withholds this look of recognition from any fellow citizen, even by so mild a means as deliberately forgetting her name.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn40-0090591712470627">40</xref></sup></p>

<title>“Indignez-vous”: From Ressentiment to Indignation</title>
<p>The black Americans whose words we have been reading here bring a distinctive insight to the vexing dilemma of who constitutes “the people.” As several theorists have observed, the people cannot decide this question, because they have to presuppose their own constituted identity before making any decisions; for them to decide who “the people” or “we” are would be to undo the presupposition on which their own legitimacy and the democratic polity are founded. The writers I have been discussing give this dilemma valuable specificity and texture. Their testimony suggests that precisely because the people cannot determine who “the people” are without calling into question their own prior constitution <italic>as</italic> “the people,” some alternative and less visible method of deciding must be found. The indeterminate signifier “the people” requires, then, (to use Jacques Ranciere’s terms) an indeterminate signifier of “the part” that distinguishes it from the “non-part.” Such a signifier must have exclusionary force, for that is its function; yet it also must remain blank and invisible, since anything particular and specified would immediately announce its own contingency, thereby calling into question “the people” as always already given. But this signifier is perfectly visible to those who are the “not part” of the established field of political representation. Its content, these black American voices attest, is dignity. What “good manners” and “breeding” are to an aristocratic culture, or what “style” and “taste” are to the conferral of distinction by aesthetics, “dignity” is to the field of democratic political representation: if you have to ask what it is or insist that you have it, you clearly don’t belong.</p>
<p>Now we are in a position to understand more fully Michael Hanchard’s claim that race is “a fundamentally relational concept” (510). Now we can also specify that racism’s political function is to quietly identify dignity with whiteness by loudly denying the dignity of blackness. At bottom, the function of such denial is to shore up, silently and indirectly, the dignity of the white citizens within the <italic>demos</italic>; it affirms and renews their sense of dignity without them ever having to admit that their dignity stands in need of such affirmation. “White Americans,” writes James Baldwin, “find it as difficult as white people elsewhere do to divest themselves of the notion that they are in possession of some intrinsic value that black people need, or want.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn41-0090591712470627">41</xref></sup> This “intrinsic” value, I suggest, a racial whiteness that whites imagine confers intrinsic dignity and thereby enable them to avoid acknowledging the real nature of their dignity, which is dependent upon others and therefore vulnerable.</p>
<p>On this basis, these writers and thinkers pose a salutary challenge to the <italic>demos</italic>: can it admit to itself the contingent and therefore vulnerable basis of its own founding—that is, the contingent, mutually conferred dignity of all its members? For only if all citizens can summon the courage to acknowledge that their dignity is vulnerable because it depends upon recognition by other citizens will they set about affirming their dignity in a more truthful and effective way than by denying dignity to persons whom, on that very basis, they deprive of full citizenship. For that is what racism and other forms of categorical exclusion do: they give some members of the <italic>demos</italic> an easy way out, one that blinds them to one of their most important responsibilities: explicit and collaborative renewal of the dignity of all its members, a renewal that in turn would render unnecessary racism and other modes of denying dignity to “others” who stand beyond the borders of the <italic>demos</italic>. James Baldwin called this refusal to accept one’s own contingency and vulnerability “innocence,” and he regarded it as the core failing of white citizens and the chief weakness of U.S. democracy. This innocence is a willed refusal to acknowledge “the role these people [black Americans] played—and play—in American life” because such knowledge “would reveal more about America to Americans than Americans wish to know.” What they want <italic>least</italic> to know is that they have made their own sense of self-worth contingent upon their denial of the self-worth of blacks.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn41-0090591712470627">41</xref></sup></p>
<p>These insights have suggestive implications for Sheldon Wolin’s thesis that democracy is “fugitive” because citizens experience the full measure of democracy’s possibilities and demands only when they are agitated enough to want to exercise power; once they have succeeded in creating or renewing democracy, their political energy subsides and they cede the actual work of governing to powers that gradually suck the lifeblood from it.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn42-0090591712470627">42</xref></sup> Wolin is certainly correct that democracy in the U.S. tends to be episodic, and that the <italic>demos</italic> has a self-defeating tendency to give away its powers to organized elites; he is also correct that when the <italic>demos</italic> is roused to claim or reclaim that power, its actions may do as much to destroy as to renew its democracy. But instead of shrugging off the burden of wondering how democracy “as a form of government” might be more consistently sustained, why not consider if and how the people’s anger might be kept at a low boil? One step in that direction might be to create an honored place for a specific kind of anger—democratic indignation—in political theories of democracy. Another would be to encourage what Wolin calls “the memory of the political” by bringing to mind the long history of the ways black writers have sought to understand what indignation is, to reflect upon its meaning, and to channel it constructively toward the reconstruction of U.S. democracy. On the canvas of revolutionary hopes and ambitions, these are modest aspirations, and they will not bring change overnight. But on the canvas of what we are doing here, reading and thinking about democracy, they are no small thing; here, indeed, they may be as much as we can ever hope to accomplish.</p>
<p>The words of black Americans who have experienced and reflected on indignation and dignity shed revealing light not just on some perennial debates in political theory but on the urgencies of the present moment. Today, in the United States, many citizens who are perfectly at liberty to go where they choose and say what they think find that their freedom in itself is not enough. They need a token or talisman, a visible sign of their dignity. For those citizens who have taken their whiteness to be such a talisman, the very idea of a black president is profoundly threatening, since it renders absurd their investment in whiteness as the sign and substance of their dignity. Feeling this injury to their self-hood, they respond with indignation; but it is not the self-checking indignation that transforms itself into a reflective and creative energy, it is a righteous and sometimes nihilistic fury. This is the rage Pennington’s master and James Weldon Johnson’s young white interlocutor experienced when faced with a black man who plainly had dignity. It is the rage of those who feel disesteemed because the specious value of their whiteness is no longer readily available to them as a substitute for dignity.</p>
<p>These insights into the nature of indignation and dignity illuminate not just the function of racism in a democracy but the anxiety that helps produce racism in the first place. This is the worry that <italic>every</italic> citizen feels at times—the fear that he or she lacks dignity, that he or she will not be “seen.” This fear circulates independently of racism, and haunts citizens of all races, ethnicities, and classes. It is endemic to U.S. democracy itself, which leveled all inherited and natural distinctions as it asserted the natural equality of all persons. But this sweeping away of distinctions was also a destruction of the feeling of dignity they had automatically conferred. The perspective of the black figures I have been discussing indicates that while most citizens pay lip service to the idea of “intrinsic human dignity,” very few wish to explore its meaning because doing so might bring them face-to-face with the truth: that their dignity, which might <italic>feel</italic> intrinsic, is actually dependent on certain kinds of social interaction.</p>
<p>Today, thanks to the unceasing efforts of elites and other concentrations of power in the United States, these fears are being exacerbated. Increasing millions of citizens are living in or near poverty and are less and less able to secure the basic conditions that would enable them to live confidently and with self-respect. As Nussbaum has argued, because they lack the “social bases of self-respect and non-humiliation,” they feel they are not being “treated as a dignified human being whose worth is equal to that of others.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn43-0090591712470627">43</xref></sup> Even those citizens who do not suffer these material deprivations are bombarded by political discourse that consists largely of untruths, equivocations, and euphemisms; these are a running insult to the intelligence, and to the dignity, of the <italic>demos</italic> collectively and of each citizen individually. To be sure, these insults are usually less obvious and less immediately harmful than the words “We don’t serve Negroes here,” but cumulatively they take a heavy toll, enlisting citizens to join in mockery of their own stupidity and powerlessness.</p>
<p>Wendy Brown has gone so far as to argue that such failures of U.S. democracy are inevitable. Because liberal democracy paradoxically espouses both liberty and equality, it ignores that these two ideals inevitably conflict with one another; if it delivers on its promise of liberty, it reneges on its promise of equality, and vice versa. And because U.S. democracy also holds out to citizens the impossible promise of a self-mastering autonomy few can actually achieve, millions of Americans are set up to “fail.” Baffled and resentful, they look for someone or something to blame. Since blaming themselves would only intensify their pain, they blame and cause pain to others.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn44-0090591712470627">44</xref></sup></p>
<p>This hard logic is Brown’s version of Nietzsche’s <italic>ressentiment</italic>, and clearly it has something in common with indignation: both terms describe an emotional response to the experience of being hurt or wronged by a political and social order, and both point toward the political consequences of this emotion. Nietzsche’s and Brown’s account is largely theoretical, a chain of inferences from their psychological understanding of how an individual tends to react to (what feels like) personal failure that has been caused by a political and/or social domination and its ideology. My account is largely historical, derived from the first-person testimony of some persons who have experienced such emotion and who have then sought, successfully, to direct or control its political consequences. This testimony bears witness, first and foremost, that individuals do not always or necessarily respond to hurt with the <italic>ressentiment</italic> that worries Brown; on the contrary, they can—with the self-consciousness Johnson, Murray, Bevel, and Baldwin have exhibited—transform their initial pain into a productive political emotion rather than a corrosive one. The question arises then: could citizens of a democratic polity ever understand that the hurts Brown discusses are an affront to their dignity? Knowing that their dignity is at stake, might they respond to these hurts with indignation rather than <italic>ressentiment</italic>? That is, absent the coercive forces that have <italic>forced</italic> many black Americans to transform indignation into democratic indignation, could citizens today turn their indignation into political reflection and, potentially, political action?</p>
<p>Surely both the Tea Party and the Occupy Wall Street movements are expressions of some kind of anger, but it remains to be seen whether either will transform that emotion into what Pauli Murray called “creative energy.” The black writers I have discussed here would suggest that the moment for such transformation is always now. The question they would pose to those who have mistakenly imagined that they can take their dignity for granted is whether they can recognize their anger for what it is: a response to the denial of their dignity, that precious yet vulnerable sense of self-worth they neither hold by nature nor produce independently of one other. These black writers and thinkers would also ask whether Americans of all races and ethnicities can commit to protecting each others’ dignity not by excluding “others” to whom they have denied it, but by recognizing and nurturing the real thing among themselves. These questions, which are surely political theory questions, are packed into Olivia Cherry’s plain and indignant words to her employer: “Olivia. My name is Olivia. Can you say that?”</p>

<p>This self-oppositional quality is not quite captured by Du Bois’s term “double-consciousness,” for it is not so much a struggle between African and American identities that are “fused in one black body” as it is a tension inherent in the struggle against white racism.</p>

<p>But we should note that they are also saturated with ideology. They share the founders’ republican conception of manhood, one epitomized by Patrick Henry’s “Give me liberty or give me death.” They also lay claim to the “freedom-loving” character many whites in the 1850s wished to restrict to the Anglo-Saxon “race,” or the “Germanic” tribes described by Tacitus in his <italic>Germania</italic>. Finally, Douglass’s words refute the slaveholders’ claim to hold a monopoly of honor and asserts that the enslaved, too, have honor they can defend. Therefore, although Douglass seems to be asserting a natural fact when he lays claim to such dignity for enslaved blacks, he knows very well that he is weaving a sophisticated rhetorical argument. These words are no more an objective description of the outcome of his wrestling match than, say, his Christological rhetoric in the very next paragraph, where he writes that, “It was a resurrection from the dark and pestiferous tomb of slavery, to the heaven of comparative freedom.”</p>

<p>In an illuminating reading of Jacobs’s <italic>Incidents</italic>, literary scholar Saidya Hartman concludes that “ultimately, what is revealed in the course of Linda’s ‘deliberate calculation’ is that the very effort to ‘liberate’ the slave positions the self in a network of exchange underwritten by the extrications of constraint, property, and freedom.” My suggestion is that more attention to Jacobs’s indignation and dignity encourages a complementary, but less pessimistic, reading of this passage in her <italic>Narrative</italic>.

<p>Synthesizing Hegel (of the Jena period) and George Herbert Mead’s theory of the “social self,” Axel Honneth offers a compelling theory of the social production of dignity that is congruent with the theory I am extrapolating from these texts and words of black Americans.

<p>As Axel Honneth argues: “the moral force within lived social reality that is responsible for development and progress is a struggle for recognition [of dignity]. This is a strong claim, one that sometimes seems to suggest a philosophy of history, and in order to give it a theoretically defensible form, evidence would have to be presented to the effect that the experience of disrespect represents the affective source of knowledge for social resistance and collective uprisings. But that . . . is not something I can directly prove here.” (“Integrity and Disrespect,” 143) The texts we have been reading here provide precisely the empirical validation Honneth’s theory requires.</p>

<p>By focusing on the importance of relationships to human dignity, I do not mean to suggest that these were the only means through which black Americans within the slavery system or Jim Crow could protect and nurture their dignity. Many relied as well on other methods. They could attribute their suffering to God’s will and believe that their dignity had everything to do with Him and very little to do with this world and the persons in it. They could imagine themselves as an entirely separate community that bestowed dignity upon its own members regardless of how white Americans thought and behaved toward them. They could assert their dignity by responding with violent force to whites’ denial of it. However, while all of these methods can be justified both in principle and by their efficacy, none is especially pertinent to the practice of democratic citizenship. To locate the meaning of life in a transcendent sphere is to abandon hope for its achievement in the here-and-now of democratic politics. To identify oneself as entirely separate from the <italic>demos</italic> of the United States is, perhaps, to take a step toward the creation of another <italic>demos</italic>, but the territorial location of that new <italic>demos</italic> must necessarily be elsewhere. And as Hannah Arendt points out, violent resistance may be a necessary revolutionary act, but violence itself marks the failure of politics.</p>
