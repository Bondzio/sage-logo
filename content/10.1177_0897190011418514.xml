<italic>Purpose:</italic> This study compared the effectiveness of a change from enoxaparin to dalteparin for the prophylaxis of patients at risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE). <italic>Methods:</italic> A retrospective cohort study identified hospitalized patients with VTE risk admitted at Wellmont Health System between August 1, 2008 and July 31, 2009. On February 1, 2009, a therapeutic interchange from enoxaparin to dalteparin occurred. All patient records were reviewed from billing data collected 6 months prior and following conversion. Statistical tests of heterogeneity compared distributions of demography between study cohorts and Cochran tests were used to compare pre- versus postchange in the outcomes. <italic>Results:</italic> A total of 3557 and 3465 patient discharges were analyzed in the 6 months prior and following the interchange, respectively. Of these discharges, 1870 were administered enoxaparin and 1639 dalteparin. VTE rates were similar between the 2 groups. Data showed no significant difference in-hospital length of stay (LOS), readmittance, and bleeding rates in the populations. The system achieved a $40 788 savings over 6 months following the conversion using approved prophylactic dosing per patient indication. <italic>Conclusions:</italic> Dalteparin is similarly effective as enoxaparin and an alternative for the prophylaxis of VTE in a hospital setting while providing cost savings.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Venous thromboembolism (VTE), including pulmonary embolism (PE) resulting from deep vein thrombosis (DVT), remains an important health problem in the United States.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0897190011418514">1</xref>
</sup> Researchers have recently estimated that more than 600 000 symptomatic VTE events and 300 000 deaths related to VTE occur each year in the United States; of which, the majority of these episodes present in hospitalized patients.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0897190011418514">2</xref>
</sup> The American College of Chest Physicians (ACCP) recommends the use of appropriate VTE prophylaxis in patients who are at risk of hospital-acquired VTE.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0897190011418514">1</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>Hospitalized patients undergoing surgeries, such as orthopedic and abdominal, are at a high risk of VTE.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0897190011418514">1</xref>
</sup> Other risk factors include increasing age, obesity, previous VTE, congestive heart failure, severe respiratory disease, prolonged immobility, spinal cord injuries, trauma, cancer, and ventilator support.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0897190011418514">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0897190011418514">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0897190011418514"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0897190011418514">5</xref>
</sup> The clinical diagnosis of VTE is often missed because signs and symptoms are not easily recognized.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0897190011418514">6</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>The economic costs of VTE in hospitalized patients have remained significant.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0897190011418514">1</xref>
</sup> Ollendorf et al<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0897190011418514">7</xref>
</sup> found that orthopedic surgery patients with VTE had a 2-fold increase in the length of stay (LOS) and inpatient care costs compared with patients without VTE, and the mean number of days in the intensive care unit was 10-fold. Another study found that the initial DVT or PE event was associated with higher annual direct medical costs than no DVT or PE event.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0897190011418514">8</xref>
</sup> However, health care systems continue to implement strategies that reduce the cost of VTE care,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0897190011418514">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0897190011418514">10</xref>
</sup> while utilizing the most cost-effective, safe, and efficacious medications.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0897190011418514">11</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>The appropriate management of VTE is essential to improve patient outcomes and reduce overall health care costs in hospitalized patients. One class of prophylactic therapy, the low-molecular-weight heparins (LMWHs), has proven to have comparable efficacy and safety profiles. When LMWHs have been administered to hospitalized patients and continued to be used in an outpatient setting, these agents have shown to decrease VTE events with no increase in risk of recurrent thromboembolism or bleeding complications.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0897190011418514">12</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0897190011418514"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0897190011418514"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0897190011418514">15</xref>
</sup> This study assessed the clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of switching from one specific LMWH, enoxaparin, to another, dalteparin, in a hospital setting.</p>

<title>Methods</title>
<sec id="section3-0897190011418514">
<title>Data Source</title>
<p>In this retrospective, longitudinal, observational study, patient record and billing data were collected from the Wellmont Health System according to standard data collection procedures at Aspen Healthcare Metrics, a subsidiary of MedAssets, Inc., using Service Line Analytics®. The data source was derived from patient accounting and financial systems from Wellmont Health System. Service Line Analytics is a proprietary benchmarking and reporting program used by Aspen Healthcare Metrics and its health care customers. Service Line Analytics obtains data from disparate sources within a hospital and then normalizes and aggregates the data into actionable reports. These data were queried on ad hoc basis to specifically analyze the study end points related to prophylactic use of LMWH.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0897190011418514">16</xref>
</sup> The study end points and events (VTE, DVT, and PE events, hospital LOS, readmission rates due to VTE, and bleeding events measured by transfusions) were queried and compiled by the senior data analyst from the electronic data files by specific diagnosis-related categories for patients whom their physician deemed necessary to medicate prophylactically with enoxaparin or dalteparin. All patient records from the 2 largest facilities in the Wellmont Health System, Bristol Regional Medical Center (Bristol, TN) and Holston Valley Medical Center (Kingsport, TN) were reviewed from billing data collected 6 months prior and 6 months following therapeutic conversion, with the conversion date from enoxaparin to dalteparin being February 1, 2009. The 6-month period analyzed prior to the conversion was August 1, 2008 to January 31, 2009, and the 6-month period following the conversion was considered to be February 1, 2009 to July 31, 2009. The hospitals made a therapeutic conversion from enoxaparin to dalteparin. Patients were delineated by type of disease state as well as in aggregate form. Data were de-identified in accordance with the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPPA). This retrospective analysis did not involve patient intervention and used data with masked data identifiers.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0897190011418514">
<title>Study Population</title>
<p>The study cohorts consisted of all hospitalized patients aged 18 years and older at an increased risk of VTE who received enoxaparin or dalteparin as prophylactic care before and after therapeutic interchange between August 1, 2008 and July 31, 2009. Patient cohorts were categorized as enoxaparin patients 6 months prior to the conversion (August 1, 2008 to January 31, 2009) and dalteparin patients 6 months following therapeutic interchange (February 1, 2009 to July 31, 2009). Hospitalized patients with gastrointestinal/digestive, cardiology, abdominal, pulmonary, or hip/joint replacement surgeries, trauma, and ventilator support, who were deemed at an increased risk of VTE administered enoxaparin or dalteparin were included and stratified by patient diagnostic categories. Aspen Healthcare Metrics–derived patient diagnostic categories from Medicare Severity-Diagnosis–Related Group codes linked and grouped to primary diagnosis descriptions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0897190011418514">Figure 1</xref>
 and <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-0897190011418514">Appendix A</xref>). The use of enoxaparin or dalteparin was identified according to the description in the charge codes for these drugs as used by the facilities that were studied. The prophylactic dosing was determined using individual product labeling and identified as enoxaparin 30 or 40 mg every 12 hours and dalteparin 5000 international unit (IU) once daily, based on clinical practice guidelines, Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved indications, and medical evidence-supported utilization practices. Patients were excluded from the study if they were previously hospitalized for VTE as the principal diagnosis within 30 days prior to study commencement, if they were younger than 18 years, if the patients had received both enoxaparin and dalteparin, and if they had received 1 of the 2 LMWHs in the opposite 6-month period (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0897190011418514">Figure 1</xref>).</p>

<title>Criteria for Evaluation</title>
<p>Criteria for evaluation for the primary end points included the comparative effectiveness of the therapeutic interchange from enoxaparin to dalteparin in patients at risk of VTE at 6 months and measured the rate of VTE (DVT and PE, separately), hospital LOS, and the number of hospital readmissions within a 30-day period postdischarge for the primary diagnosis of VTE. The proportion of major bleeding documented through transfusions was also evaluated, wherein bleeding rates were defined as the number of patients per measured group whose hospital charges included a bill for red blood cell products. The comparative costs of drug acquisition for the 2 time periods were also analyzed. The study end points were defined as (1) LOS (the number of calendar days between admission and discharge of included patients); (2) VTE events (the number of patients with a diagnosis of inpatient DVT or PE as determined by the presence of <italic>International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision</italic> (<italic>ICD-9</italic>) codes of 451.1× for DVT and 415.1× for PE in the secondary diagnosis position of the universal billing form (2004 revision UB-04) associated with an inpatient hospitalization); (3) readmission for DVT or PE (determined as those patients who were admitted for the primary diagnosis of DVT or PE as determined by the codes listed above within 30 days of discharge from a hospitalization during which the patient received prophylaxis for VTE); (4) major bleeding (determined as those patients who received a blood transfusion as determined by billing codes that included red blood cell units, which were charged to the patient during a hospitalization in which the patient also received prophylaxis for VTE). In addition, patient identifiers were masked to protect the identity of individual health information.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0897190011418514">
<title>Statistical Analysis</title>
<p>The primary and secondary end points were efficacy and safety, respectively, where efficacy consisted of VTE (ie, DVT and PE) and safety consisted of bleeding. This study was designed to show noninferiority between the efficacies of dalteparin and enoxaparin. Event rates were assessed by type and as a composite for all high-risk patients (ie, hip and knee replacement patients, chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder, and pneumonia). For events rates (ie, DVT, PE, composite VTE, bleeding, and readmissions within 30 days for VTE) in the 2 populations, tests for differences between proportions were applied.</p>
<p>Descriptive statistics were calculated for continuous and categorical variables at baseline for both the study cohorts. For the distribution across risk categories, a Cochran test for an n × K contingency table for dichotomous variables was used. Statistical tests of heterogeneity with a χ<sup>2</sup> statistic compared distributions of demography between study cohorts. Hospital LOS and costs were compared between the 2 cohorts (prior and post) using independent sample <italic>t</italic> tests. For continuous variables, means (standard deviation) were generated and percentages were reported for categorical variables. An a priori level of significance of .05 was set for all the analyses and considered statistically significant. Bootstrap sampling was used to evaluate the degree of “uncertainty” in the cost-minimization results—a final end point evaluated. Critical to the magnitude of the VTE, event rate was the specific medical/procedure group at higher risk and deemed in need of prophylactic care. Using the bootstrap data, cost acceptability curves were mapped for various conditions/procedures.</p>

<title>Cost Analysis</title>
<p>A cost analysis was performed based on the acquisition costs, including any distributor markdowns for the prophylactic doses of enoxaparin compared with the acquisition cost of dalteparin. For the purposes of this analysis, enoxaparin 40 or 30 mg every 12 hours were considered equivalent to dalteparin 5000 IU once daily. No consideration for renal dosing adjustment was performed. Savings were then calculated using the current period spent for dalteparin and converting back to the cost of enoxaparin, should equivalent prophylactic doses been purchased. Based on <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0897190011418514">Table 1</xref>, 23.55% of those purchases were for joint replacement for the combined hospitals reported analysis. Those purchases were converted to equal portions as prophylaxis for hip replacement (enoxaparin 40 mg every 12 hours) and for knee replacement (enoxaparin 30 mg every 12 hours). The estimated savings during the 6-month period after conversion to dalteparin was $40 788 for the combined hospitals (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table6-0897190011418514">Table 6</xref>
). Because this is a study primarily for prophylaxis, the savings only considered those doses approved for prophylaxis. This study did not consider other cost considerations related to the conversion of treatment doses of enoxaparin to dalteparin.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Several subgroups of hospitalized patients are at elevated risk of VTE, including those undergoing orthopedic or other major surgery.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0897190011418514">1</xref>
</sup> As of October 1, 2008, the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) made changes in reimbursement policy—VTE occurrence is not compensated by CMS because it is considered a preventable health care–acquired condition. Using its national patient safety goal program, <italic>The National Patient Safety Goal, 3E</italic>, The Joint Commission (TJC) announced that as of January 1, 2009, hospitals are required to actively reduce the likelihood of patient harm associated with anticoagulation therapy or risk losing accreditation by TJC.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0897190011418514">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0897190011418514">18</xref>
</sup> As a result, pressure to reduce the cost of VTE care with the most cost-effective, efficacious, and safe medications has become a mandatory goal for hospitals nationwide.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0897190011418514">19</xref>
</sup> With the adoption of <italic>The</italic>
<italic>National Patient Safety Goal, 3E</italic>, the Wellmont facilities were concerned about the cost of 2 circumstances. The first was a broader use of pharmacologic agents for the prevention of VTE. The second was an increase in the use of LMWHs as the pharmacologic agent of choice. Wellmont Health System chose to defray these costs through the substitution of a lower acquisition cost agent, dalteparin.</p>
<p>Comparative effectiveness research (CER) studies serve as an important source of guidance for health care decision makers as they provide support for particular therapeutic choices that may decrease annual health care spending. Observational comparative effectiveness studies are designed to generate such evidence and are thus more relevant to actual practice.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0897190011418514">20</xref>
</sup> Our study reports the comparative effectiveness and costs after switching from enoxaparin to dalteparin as VTE prophylaxis at 2 facilities (Bristol Regional Medical Center and Holston Valley Medical Center) within the Wellmont Health System. As such, our observational CER suggests that making the conversion from enoxaparin to dalteparin does not adversely affect patient outcomes.</p>
<p>Our retrospective cohort study showed no significant differences in VTE rates after the conversion from enoxaparin to dalteparin as prophylaxis for VTE in 2 facilities (Bristol Regional Medical Center and Holston Valley Medical Center) within the Wellmont Health System between the 2 time periods analyzed (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0897190011418514">Tables 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-0897190011418514">5</xref>). The efficacy results were consistent between the subpopulations at the 2 facilities that were studied. Clinical trials comparing VTE rates and bleeding rates after the administration of dalteparin and enoxaparin have shown comparable outcomes in patients with spinal cord injuries and major orthopedic trauma, respectively.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0897190011418514">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0897190011418514">22</xref>
</sup> A study by Chiou-Tan and associates revealed that patients with spinal cord injuries receiving dalteparin and enoxaparin had comparable DVT and bleeding rates.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0897190011418514">22</xref>
</sup> The dalteparin versus enoxaparin for VTE prophylaxis in acute spinal cord injury and major orthopedic trauma patients (DETECT) trial also showed no significant difference between the 2 drugs in terms of DVT, PE, major bleeding, and minor bleeding.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0897190011418514">21</xref>
</sup> Although these studies were small and not rigorously designed, they support the results seen in the present study. However, there was a difference in the bleeding events during the 6-month period after switching from enoxaparin to dalteparin (<italic>P</italic> = .0380) in the present study (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-0897190011418514">Table 5</xref>). More significantly, patients who received enoxaparin showed fewer bleeding episodes requiring transfusion than those who received dalteparin (<italic>P</italic> = .0744). At first appearance, these numbers are in contradiction to previous studies that quantified bleeding rates. To understand the difference in bleeding rates, the authors point to the methodology of identifying patients with bleeding who received a blood transfusion, which may have overestimated bleeding rates and underestimated life-threatening bleeding in both groups. For caregivers, the decision to administer a transfusion is complex. Other factors are considered outside of the presence of an active hemorrhage as would be considered with the use of an LMWH. Such factors as blood loss prior to admission, blood loss as a result of surgery, or the cardiovascular condition of a patient influence the decision to administer blood products. The presence of an anticoagulant in these situations only further compels the decision to transfuse and is equally compelling by its presence and not by its brand name, composition, or route of administration. Transfusion, as a surrogate measure of significant bleeding, is a sensitive indicator of clinically important bleeding and is not a specific indicator of the cause of bleeding. Keeping in mind that the goal of this study was to prove noninferiority, the inclusion of bleeding data was intended to support this goal. While these numbers appear to be controversial, the authors felt appropriate to include them in the efforts of full disclosure and scholarly debate.</p>
<p>In addition, significant differences in the mean LOS and the readmittance rates were reported in the 2 time periods between patients receiving enoxaparin and dalteparin as prophylaxis (<italic>P</italic> = .0021; <italic>P</italic> = .0355, respectively; <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0897190011418514">Tables 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0897190011418514">4</xref>). However, for all patients administered an LMWH, there was no difference in LOS (<italic>P</italic> = .1160) or readmission rates (<italic>P</italic> = .1559). For LOS, subgroup analysis favored the dalteparin group, with significant differences seen in patients with pulmonary disorders and joint replacement and on ventilator support with the exception of patients with trauma, which was in favor of enoxaparin. The statistically significant difference in outcomes varies between the patient populations and the therapeutic agents. In some cases, 1 agent shows statistically significant difference versus the other agent. It is unclear whether these differences are due to the patient diagnostic categories and the variances of severity within these categories and their relationship to the patient’s LOS. Because of the low volume of events, it is also not apparent whether these differences in results are clinically significant.</p>
<p>The switch from enoxaparin to dalteparin yielded substantial cost savings of approximately $40 788 for combined centers during the 6-month period (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table6-0897190011418514">Table 6</xref>), which equates to $81 576 annually. This value only includes those doses used for prophylaxis of the patients in this study. These savings do not include costs for doses used to treat DVT/PE or in cardiology, nor do they include patients who received these agents but were not a part of this study. This study used wholesaler acquisition costs. Savings were calculated based on acquisition cost of prophylactic doses of dalteparin compared with an estimated cost of enoxaparin—should enoxaparin have remained the agent for VTE prophylaxis in these facilities. The presence of savings is in alignment with the results of prior studies. The DETECT trial also showed that switching from enoxaparin to dalteparin was associated with $12 590.76 (US) or $12 485 (CAD) per year in LMWH acquisition cost savings.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0897190011418514">21</xref>
</sup> Another study by Chiou-Tan and associates revealed that dalteparin had lower monthly cost of medication than enoxaparin ($750 [1 injection per day] vs $1101 [2 injections per day]).<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0897190011418514">22</xref>
</sup> A study comparing dalteparin and enoxaparin with unfractionated heparin (UFH) for treatment revealed that the total medical cost per patient associated with dalteparin was the lowest in comparison with enoxaparin and UFH ($3199; $3347; $5104, respectively).<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0897190011418514">23</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>This study was designed to show noninferiority between the efficacies of dalteparin and enoxaparin. The authors note that while both the agents have been shown effective for the prevention of VTE events in this study, and while this study demonstrates that dalteparin is noninferior to enoxaparin in the prevention of VTE events when used as indicated, neither of these agents are perfect in the prevention of VTE events for those patients who were deemed at risk of DVT.</p>
<p>As a retrospective observational study, several limitations exist, and our results are dependent on the accuracy of our billing codes. Because the study is based on diagnostic and procedural codes, our data are limited to the specificity of physician documentation and the transfer of that documentation to accurate codes. Patients with an alternative condition may have been misdiagnosed with VTE and included in this analysis. Another limitation to this study is that while readmissions to the same hospital system can be detected, readmissions to other hospitals outside the system cannot be detected. Moreover, outpatient encounters postdischarges are also beyond the scope of the data.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the authors believe that a potential for bias exists. During the time surrounding the conversion to dalteparin, all the policies and procedures for anticoagulant therapy were reviewed and order sets were updated. Extensive nursing and physician education were performed on the appropriate management of anticoagulant therapy. It is possible that by reviewing and analyzing the anticoagulant process, inestimable changes occurred, which would have affected the treatments administered and the outcomes of the study in the postconversion period. We also believe that such reviews of current practices can be considered an advantage in the overall provision of care for such patient subpopulations.</p>
<p>Even with the limitations, administrative data have been used to reveal startling small area variations in health care and clinical practice patterns, since the 1970s.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0897190011418514">24</xref>
</sup> Research in the 1990s has led to the usage of administrative data to screen for potential gaps in quality outcomes. The Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) now has a set of patient safety indicators that can be quantified using administrative data.<sup>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>A change from enoxaparin to dalteparin was performed with no changes in the clinical outcomes that were measured and with significant cost savings. Such savings may be used to defray the cost of extending VTE prophylaxis to more patients and further decreasing the occurrence of VTEs and their complications.</p>
