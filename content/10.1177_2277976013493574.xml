<abstract>
<p>Is South Africa a ‘sub/imperialist’ state, a leader of the Global South, or a victim of imperial power from the North? This essay unpacks the debate surrounding South Africa’s role in the ‘new scramble for Africa’ by critically contrasting competing theoretical conceptions against historical and empirical evidence. The conclusion projects a radical—and unexpected—rupture in South Africa’s power and position in the world-economy as North–South networks are broken and East–South relations replace North–South relations.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>As apartheid’s last days ran out expectations ran high of a peaceful and prosperous future for the peoples of south, southern and continental Africa. It was widely accepted that democratic rule would surely bring plentiful dividends from the end of the South African state’s costly domestic repression and foreign military operations, to a legitimate, developmental state at home and a peaceful developmental partner across the region.</p>
<p>Two decades on, frustration and perplexity abound. South African economic growth has been much slower than expected, inequality has been increasing and well-being has been stagnating. South Africa’s regional and transcontinental relationships have been equally disappointing and puzzling, particularly after the early Mandela glow faded away. For many radical analysts, the lack of regional amity and progress may be traced to an increasingly corrupt African National Congress (ANC) and the South African state’s willing role as a direct agent of Europe and the United States. As the most prolific chronicler of the ANC’s move to the right puts it, for those interested in equality and social justice ‘Pretoria appears to be merely sub-imperialist’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-2277976013493574">Bond 2004</xref>: 599).</p>
<p>Yet others lend more agency to the South African state and especially its powerful corporations that now operate across the continent, casting both as imperialist powers in their own right. As Ishmael Lesufi puts it, ‘the global and South African multinational corporations are the social actors orchestrating the opening up of the continent’ (2004: 810, 2006). For yet others, charges of South African imperialism and hegemony vastly overstate the case: ‘South Africa’s ability to... exercise “imperialism” is less significant than many think or fear’ given its demonstrated inability to lead a regional, much less continental project (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-2277976013493574">Taylor 2011</xref>: 1233; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-2277976013493574">Alden and Le Pere 2009</xref>). South Africa also undeniably shares with other African states, to push this argument further, the harsh, underdeveloping winds blowing from the North and a voracious demand for raw materials and markets for cheap industrial goods from the East.</p>
<p>These conflicting assessments represent not simply different viewpoints, but derive from fundamental anomalies in our understanding of how South Africa relates to its neighbours and the North. On the one hand, despite claims of a sub/imperialist role, Pretoria is, for example, increasingly viewed as an unreliable ally by the West, being unwilling to oust Mugabe, lead on AFRICOM, or project capable military power on behalf of the United States and Europe against their terrorist targets. On the other hand, distrust and resentment of South African expansionism by other African elites, firms and states are widely evident. While there is thus no denying South Africa’s overwhelming economic power, how this relates both economically and politically to the region, the continent and even northern powers is very unclear and very much the subject of debate.</p>
<p>In the following pages, I unpack this conundrum in three steps. First, I specify the key and different theoretical conceptions behind the varying answers to the question of whether South Africa is imperialist in its own right, sub-imperialist on behalf of the North (the United States, Europe and International Financial Institutions (IFIs)), or, like neighbouring African states, is an object of new imperialist pressures emanating from the North. Second, South Africa’s historical and current power across the region and continent is assessed empirically and historically against the dominant models of imperialism and primitive accumulation. Finally, I suggest how contemporary trends prefigure a rupture in regional and transcontinental imperial relationships—and call for new conceptual and theoretical explorations of imperial projects.</p>
<p>The conclusion here stands in sharp contrast to dominant analyses. Sub-imperial relationships created by white-settler rule have been rent asunder by two forces: one, the slow demise of US hegemony and its neo-liberal counter-revolution; and two and most disruptively for current theoretical schemas, the displacement of North–South relationships with East–South engagements.</p>

<title>Theorizing Imperialism and South Africa’s Place in the World-Economy</title>
<p>There can be no denying the compelling force behind the phenomena that have led so many to revisit theories of imperialism. As in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, we are living in a conjuncture marked by economic crisis, the expanding power of capital, increasing rivalry among great and emerging powers, the forcible opening up of closed markets and a new scramble for raw materials, foodstuffs and land. Ballooning discussions of land grabs, commodity and financial booms and busts and, more generally, a ‘new scramble for Africa’, certainly pose close parallels to the classic imperialist epoch of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.</p>
<p>Lenin’s <italic>Imperialism</italic> remains, of course, a touchstone guide. In its most common reading, imperialism took on a specific form, whereby monopolies replaced free competition in the late-nineteenth century, only to be superseded by the domination of finance over productive capital in the early twentieth century. This, moreover, was a global process, producing ever increasing global inequality and aggressive competition among states—including, which few remember, powerful new contenders from outside Europe and North America. In Lenin’s words in 1917 (1970: 744): ‘[c]apitalism is growing with the greatest rapidity in the colonies and in the overseas countries. Among the latter, new imperialist powers are emerging (e.g., Japan)’. The relevance to South Africa and other powerful members of the Global South, that is, the ‘emerging powers’ and especially the so-called BRICS group, is immediate. One may easily draw the conclusion, as does Lesufi for example, that ‘South African capital has all the essential features of imperialism as conceptualized by Lenin’ (2006: 33).</p>
<p>Such conclusions are, however, difficult to sustain and fail as a guide to the present. As Arrighi pointed out in his definitive conclusion to the 1970s debates over imperialism, if nothing else, Lenin was consistently, insistently, historically determinate in his analysis of imperialism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-2277976013493574">Arrighi 1983</xref>: 12). And historical facts, as Lenin paraphrasing British empiricists emphasized at the time, are stubborn things. Contemporary capitalist development and underdevelopment is not, quite simply, being driven by financial cartels that have absorbed productive capital. Indeed, the very power of Lenin’s argument rested upon careful historical analysis of the transition from competitive to monopoly forms and their linkage to inter-state rivalries. It was powerfully predictive: there would indeed be thirty years of war among the great powers as Lenin projected.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-2277976013493574">1</xref></sup></p>
<p>We are now quite distant from the historical context behind this formulation. For even while US militarism is accelerating today—as befits a declining world power that relies on its last uncontested pillar of power—there is little evidence of comparable forms of finance capital or interstate rivalry, much less the world wars that Lenin, Hobson and Bukharin sketched with such insight in the early twentieth century. To push the analogy further and see the South African state as executing the imperialist will of South African monopoly capital is, quite simply, a distortion of the considerable conflict between the ANC, its alliance partners and state, private and foreign firms.</p>
<p>There are alternatives. The path which the long global crisis has taken since the 1970s has led many to return to a different, early twentieth-century construction. Here the attempt to resolve crises of accumulation in core states through the movement from productive to financial investments on the one hand and through the exploitation via primitive accumulation of newly opened markets and lands on the other, constitute for many the essence of our new imperialist epoch. As Bond puts it (2006: 113), ‘modern imperialism necessarily combines neoliberalism and accumulation by dispossession in peripheral sites like Africa along with increasing subservience to the USA’s indirect, neocolonial rule’. In its most direct expression, neoliberal policies promoted by Europe and the United States, the IMF and the World Bank find their partners in sub-imperial states like South Africa. As Bond has so steadily charted (2000), direct ties between the South Africa state, the ANC and overseas neoliberal institutions were formed in the transition from apartheid to majority rule in the early 1990s and have continued ever since. Contrary to those who see the BRICS, or nationalist and developmental states, as obstacles to Northern imperialism, Bond straightforwardly asserts that the BRICS represent the leading neoliberal allies of the North in the new scramble for Africa. As Bond says ‘This is 1885 all over again’ (cited in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-2277976013493574">Fabricious 2013</xref>).</p>
<p>In a recent review of the debate over South Africa as sub-imperial power, Melanie Samson argues that Bond and other proponents of the sub-imperialism thesis fail in the end to provide ‘an adequate theorization of subimperialism’, leaving us with an ‘ahistorical, unchanging conceptualization of sub-imperialism’ (2009: 96). This overstates the case surely,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-2277976013493574">2</xref></sup> but it does point to a major difficulty that may be traced to their model of imperialism: the concept inevitably traces downward from crises of accumulation in advanced capitalist states (via overproduction, underconsumption, falling rate of profit, etc.), to their resolution by a new burst of forcing open and exploiting poorer, so-called ‘pre-’or ‘non-’ capitalist areas, states and peoples (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-2277976013493574">Harvey 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>As I have argued at greater length elsewhere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-2277976013493574">Martin 2012</xref>; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-2277976013493574">Moyo et al. 2012</xref>), contemporary discussions of ‘accumulation by dispossession’ by following this path often construct a relatively homogeneous, residual and objectified Global South that is operated upon from above. In a common scenario: an accumulation crisis in the North is resolved by Northern states and capital opening up ‘non-capitalist’ areas in the South. In these formulations, the South and its peoples play little role, if any, in the crisis and its resolution through a geographical ‘spatial fix’ that provides new markets and new sources of cheap labour and raw materials. In this sense, ‘primitive’ or ‘ongoing’ accumulation can easily become to ‘capitalist’ accumulation what ‘traditional’ is to ‘modern’: a residual construct that relegates the majority of the world’s population to lives outside capitalist modernity proper.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-2277976013493574">3</xref></sup> This is particularly problematic for eminently capitalist areas as illustrated by Lenin’s short, ambiguous references to ‘semi-colonies’ and ‘semi-independent countries’, or today’s uncertain formulations surrounding the so-called BRICS, Newly Industrializing Countries (NICs), Turkey, Venezuela and similarly strong ex-colonial and ex-imperial states.</p>
<p>The emergence and developmental success of these states—many of which, unlike South Africa, are not beholden to the IMF, World Bank and northern banks—forces back onto the agenda the ‘sub-imperial’ question of the autonomy of and the relation between, these states, their elites and core states and capital. Seeking to address these actors, Samson and others have returned to the original Latin American conceptions of the 1960s and 1970s, most notably the work of Ruy Mauro Marini, which focused on how relations between Brazil and the United States changed Brazil’s class relations, changing in turn the autonomy of the Brazilian state and its relations with the US state and multinationals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-2277976013493574">Marini 1965</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-2277976013493574">1972</xref>).</p>
<p>Studies of Brazil which seek to compare Marini’s theses to more recent globalization and transnational class constructs are particularly apt in this regard (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-2277976013493574">Flynn 2007</xref>). Like South Africa, Brazil in the early 1990s committed itself to liberalization. Even under the Lula (2003–10), who was elected with strong support from trade unions (as was, of course, the ANC), the Brazilian government remained committed to the basic tenets of neoliberalism, including debt payments, large primary surpluses, high interest rates and free investment flows. Flynn draws the conclusion that ‘theories of global capitalism are not incompatible with Marini’s theory of subimperialism. The case of Brazil, a key nation in the semiperiphery, suggests that the two views are complementary’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-2277976013493574">Flynn 2007</xref>: 24). This conclusion rests in large part on the growing transnational activities of Brazilian firms, transnational class alliances and the regional projects of a relatively autonomous Brazilian state.</p>
<p>There are sharp comparisons to be made with South Africa. Like South Africa, Brazil is far more indebted now than in 1990, has privatized many state-owned enterprises and has witnessed a decimation of a manufacturing sector built up under preceding authoritarian governments. It has also, like South Africa, sought to create regional alliances and a regional market, with mixed success, again like South Africa. Unlike South Africa, however, foreign direct investment (FDI) into Brazil accelerated in the last generation, even as Brazilian firms, particularly since 2000, have undertaken their own explosive growth abroad. Despite liberalization, continuing state support in forms of financing, R&amp;D support and protection against foreign takeovers has been critical to the success of Brazilian firms, like the oil giant Petrobras, the commercial jet exporter Embraer and the mining giant Vale.</p>
<p>As these conclusions and comparisons indicate, while reframing the debate over sub/imperialism in comparative and class terms does not resolve it, it does move us away from purely core-centric theories of accumulation, state power and the purported demise of agrarian issues and toward a narrower and more focused investigation. South African and Brazilian patterns press us to assess, over global booms and busts, whether and to what degree state action has engaged and been shaped by relations with local and foreign capital as well as neighbouring states. If sub-imperialism is a project, it should be evident in measures of regional domination and subordination to international partners—including not only economic relations but political ones as well.</p>

<title>Positioning South Africa in the World-Economy</title>
<p>For many analysts, South African sub-imperialism is easily and explicitly evident in every major store in the region and increasingly the continent: to shop for cell phones, foodstuffs, or banking services is often to confront a wall of South African products and firms. On the regional terrain, South Africa clearly stands out as an economic elephant, whether measured in terms of the types of good and services produced, the level and depth of labour and consumer markets, the size and weight of local firms, or the strength of physical, technological and financial infrastructures.</p>
<p>Just how great the gap is and its direction can be traced in long-term trends in national income per capita. For while this reveals little regarding levels of inequality and well-being, it does indicate the relative world weight and power of states and dominant classes. And here the evidence is quite clear (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-2277976013493574">Figure 1</xref>): South Africa has, for over forty years, stood well above the major states of the region and the continent—and has done surprisingly better in the last twenty neoliberal years than all but a few states that possess new and disproportionately large mineral and oil discoveries.</p>

<p>At the same time, it must be pointed out that South Africa has not fared well by comparison to Brazil and other ‘emerging’ or ‘newly industrializing states’ (NICs), as <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-2277976013493574">Figure 2</xref> indicates.</p>

<p>The hesitancy with which South Africa is included or excluded from the category of ‘emerging’ states and the BRICS group thus has real foundations: South Africa’s economy has been stagnant for at least twenty years, a pitiful record by comparison to the NICs and its partners in the BRICS group (see, for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-2277976013493574">Andreasson 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-2277976013493574">Shaw et al. 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>How far back this comparative decline may be traced is suggested by relating South Africa’s performance to Europe and the United States. As <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-2277976013493574">Figure 3</xref> suggests, South Africa closed the gap with core states in the interwar, imperialist epoch, only to stagnate in the apartheid decades.</p>

</fig>
<p>In short: if South Africa was a newly industrializing country in the 1920s—possessing only one of two integrated steel plants in the southern hemisphere, for example—in the short period of American hegemony it became increasingly a newly underdeveloping country. This finding reverses the common depiction of the post-1948 apartheid period as the era when South Africa first industrialized, entered into a long boom and came to dominate surrounding states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-2277976013493574">Martin 2013</xref>).</p>
<p>While these data mark out the rank and direction of South Africa’s position in the world-economy, they tell us only of outcomes and not the processes and relationships by which South Africa’s position was attained or sustained. What did the relation of the South African state and firms with foreign states and firms, near and far, have to do with this track record? Did imperialism or sub-imperialism, as sketched and predicted in such various ways by such different theories, have much to do with it? And what might the future bring?</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-2277976013493574">
<title>South Africa’s Record</title>
<p>If South Africa today dominates the region and large parts of the continent, it was not always so. As suggested by Mahmood Mamdani’s (1996) trenchant argument that apartheid was the generic form of colonialism, South Africa through most of its history stood in a colonial relation to Europe like its neighbours: racially colonized, exporting primary products and importing European manufactures. As the data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-2277976013493574">Figure 3</xref> suggest, it was in the interwar period that this pattern was broken. Under a new anti-British, Afrikaner government, South Africa after 1925 industrialized and become not just richer than its neighbours, but a producer of much more advanced goods. Protecting the home market through high tariffs and related measures not only fostered the expansion of local firms but also permitted the creation of state industries in leading sectors, where no local or foreign firms would invest (like the steel giant ISCOR). At the same time, US multinationals began to build branch plants (from auto producers Ford and GM, to consumer-goods manufacturers like Kellogg’s). By the end of World War II, as <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-2277976013493574">Figure 1</xref> suggests, South Africa was not only richer than other African territories, Korea, Brazil and most of southern Europe, but was one of the very few industrial powers outside Europe and North America.</p>
<p>Was this result of a new ‘sub-imperial’ strategy? It clearly was not a path or role directed by core powers: South Africa’s advance was made possible by an aggressive rupture with the British state and British firms. Nor were capital flows along the lines suggested by Lenin (or later theories of monopoly capital) fundamental to this process. US firms, it is true, began to locate in South Africa in this period, but this was largely driven by new tariff controls and not excessive US exports of capital—indeed, the major new advancements in higher-wage, industrial production were propelled by the South African state.</p>
<p>Nor did the South African state or firms expand into the region. Far from it: barriers were constructed to the imports, both material and human, from neighbouring states. South Africa in the interwar period might, for example, still import some Rhodesian tobacco, but it returned to Rhodesia in the form of South African cigarettes. South African mines might similarly expand production, particularly after the gold price leapt upward in the early 1930s, but the state assured that far fewer Mozambicans were employed and far greater numbers of South Africans were hired and spent their earnings inside South Africa.</p>
<p>In relation to theories of sub-imperialism, it is notable that this strategic move took place not by replicating models of imperial powers or foreign capital—as suggested by some sub-imperial analogies—but rather by a nationalist and relatively autonomous state seizing opportunities created by a colonial world in chaotic disarray. This required reconfiguring relations with both core states overseas and surrounding colonial territories (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-2277976013493574">Martin 2013</xref>). In short, this was very much the creation of an aggressive semi-peripheral state, engaging both core and peripheral elites and firms. The South African state emerged as the modern Janus: facing and fighting both the rich North and surrounding colonial and white-settler states.</p>
<p>During the postwar period, these conditions accelerated the increasing reliance of neighbours upon South Africa. Based on interwar advances, South Africa came to export industrial manufactures to the region and import cheap African labour for its mines and farms. Apartheid’s secret was not just racial segregation and repression at home, but the differentiation of cheap, territorially-differentiated labour forces and markets across the region. This was uneven development personified, forging for the first time a ‘region’ defined by interdependence and divergent patterns of social reproduction by race and gender—all to the design and advantage of white South Africa and domestic and foreign firms alike. At the same time, warm relations with the new hegemon, the United States, resulted in adherence to the new rules and institutions behind the US world order. This meant above all commitments to new international agencies, from the United Nations to the IFIs and, especially, an open to door US multinationals. This marked a significant change from the British world order and a reliance upon equity versus fixed capital and commercially-oriented, competitive capital. Significant FDI did occur, while South African conglomerates grew as well, particularly in mining, engineering and finance.</p>
<p>As <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-2277976013493574">Figure 3</xref> suggests, the stability and prosperity made possible by this set of relations with the North and the region failed to survive the middle of 1970s, marking a substantive break in South Africa’s developmental fortunes. In part this may be traced to the outbreak of the global economic crisis and rebellious new trade union, student and black power movements. Yet, as suggested again by <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-2277976013493574">Figure 2</xref>, South Africa suffered far more decline than competing semi-peripheral states, such as the NICs and later among the BRICS group—many of which faced similar protest waves in the wake of 1968 (e.g., Brazil, Korea, Mexico, Portugal). What the South African state proved unable to do throughout this whole period, in striking contrast to many other semi-peripheral states, was develop new state and state-supported enterprises and attract significant manufacturing investment as unruly manufacturing capital fled the North for cheaper, less regulated semi-peripheral locations. There would be no South African equivalent to Brazil’s jet exporter Embraer, Korea’s auto producer Hyundai, or Taiwan’s computer hardware giant Acer.</p>
<p>As sanctions advanced internationally and national liberation movements came to power in 1975 and 1980, the regional spaces open to South African and foreign firms contracted. By any measure—trade, investment, or migration—relationships between South Africa and all her neighbours plummeted. By the middle of 1980s, Pretoria was forced to concede all but military domination of the region. This was, as we know, a failing strategy at home and abroad. Regional relationships, so central to accumulation under apartheid and white-settler colonialism in the region, were withering away.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-2277976013493574">
<title>Post-Apartheid South Africa: Scrambler or Scrambled?</title>
<p>The negotiated settlement that led to majority rule is widely held to have been a moment of ‘elite transition’, entrenching neoliberalism and a new black elite. Facing Europe and the United States, the new ANC government institutionalized neoliberal trade, investment and finance policies. At the same time, sanctions fell and states across the continent rapidly opened their doors to trade, investment and finance. Opening economic doors were followed by political ones. After hesitation under President Mandela, the South African government aggressively moved to lead new continental programmes and institutions (e.g., the formation of the African Union, NEPAD, the African Parliament, etc.). Given the neoliberal foundations of South Africa’s domestic, regional and continental policies, it is easy to depict the current South African government as little more than a willing transmission belt for neoliberal programmes promoted by the United States, the United Kingdom and Europe in general.</p>
<p>This interpretation produces however a severely limited understanding of South Africa’s transnational relations and certainly fails to account for many anomalies of what might be called the ‘subimperialism subservience’ model. This is due not only to the lack of research on South African firms, foreign multinationals and transnational alliances—although this is very much the case to our collective detriment (for exceptions, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-2277976013493574">Miller 2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-2277976013493574">2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-2277976013493574">Verhoef 2011</xref>). More central to the problem is the lack of theoretical precision surrounding the deployment of the terms ‘imperialism’, ‘subimperialism’ and ‘primitive accumulation’. That these conceptions are so loosely formulated points towards a fundamental problem: their inappropriate application to contemporary global capitalist developments.</p>
<p>To explore empirically South Africa’s post-apartheid continental and overseas relationships illustrates this. It also points toward a very different conclusion with significant theoretical implications: we are witnessing the end days of North–South relations as they were constructed in the twentieth century and face a long struggle over the emergence of a new global order in which South Africa has little chance of playing a ‘sub-imperial’ role. To focus new research and policies on past patterns is thus to make a serious error of judgment.</p>
<p>Just how far we are from past formulations is easily indicated. The late nineteenth century ‘scramble’ was carried out by states and increasingly large capitalist firms seeking enclosed markets spaces demarcated by formal colonial territories. Post-World War II expansionism took place, by contrast, under the new forms promulgated under US hegemony. Multinational corporations led the way, facilitated by free investment policies. Alliances between Third World states, local capital and foreign multinationals formed a ‘triple alliance’ in many of the more powerful Third World states, Brazil and South Africa included (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-2277976013493574">Evans 1979</xref>). It is possible to show that the South African government promoted at home and abroad the free flow of capital and embraced the central pillars and policies of US hegemony.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-2277976013493574">4</xref></sup> But do today’s phenomena replicate postwar accumulation and spatial patterns in service of US imperialism?</p>
<p>To track investment flows and vehicles from South Africa to the region and the rich North indicates something quite different is afoot in the ‘new scramble for Africa’. Postwar monopoly capital in its classic form (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-2277976013493574">Baran and Sweezy 1966</xref>) and multinationals more broadly, were large, self-managing and self-financing firms that set prices and managed demand versus earlier forms of competitive capitalism. They expanded world-wide by investing in branch plants that allowed them to leapfrog the tariff walls raised during the interwar great depression. But are South Africa’s current relationships with the North and region understandable in terms of these historic processes?</p>
<p>The short answer is no.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-2277976013493574">5</xref></sup> As all observers and data agree, the coming of majority rule did not lead to the expected revival of direct investment by foreign multinationals. To be sure, the struggle against apartheid can account for the flight of capital during the 1970s and 1980s, when other semi-peripheral states drew in manufacturing from the de-industrializing North. Since 1994, however, FDI has been especially meagre, particularly by comparison to similarly situated states. As the <italic>Financial Times</italic> summarized for its international business readers on 17 June 2008, ‘between 1994 and 2002, average net annual inflows of FDI were 1.5 per cent of gross domestic product compared with 3 per cent for South Africa’s international rivals’. While the subsequent commodity boom led to higher levels of FDI, these peaked in 2008 and fell by 80 per cent in the next two years, to a point where South Africa’s FDI inflows as a proportion of GDP ranked 128<sup>th</sup> in the world, right behind Burkina Faso (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-2277976013493574">UNCTAD 2011</xref>: Web Table 28). If South Africa is being scrambled, in the sense of being the target of significant new direct investments, there is little evidence of it. The one case where significant direct investment and exports took place, automotive production and parts, is telling: it is the one sector where the state imposed trade and investment regulations and incentives. This leads to a parallel observation: if foreign multinationals in the neoliberal, post-apartheid era are using South Africa as a sub-imperial springboard to the region and continent, there is not much classic evidence of it.</p>
<p>Might one make a better case for South Africa’s own firms? Within the borders of the apartheid state, large conglomerates grew apace, paralleling trends in core states. In the more advanced manufacturing sectors, they also became heavily dependent on the region for exports. After World War II, South Africa’s relations with its neighbours increasingly took the form of the historic relations holding between core states and their colonies, with South Africa exporting manufactured goods and services and receiving in return primary products and cheap labour. And while South Africa was the major trading partner of most regional states, no regional state provided a significant proportion of South Africa’s imports. This was, as Hirschman (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-2277976013493574">1980</xref>) emphasized long ago, a classic case of unequal power.</p>
<p>As the doors closed on the apartheid era, it was expected that the re-opening of the region and the continent would enhance the presence and power of South Africa’s own multinational conglomerates across the region and farther north. In relation to the North, what took place was something quite different: as soon as capital controls were relaxed, the richest and biggest South African firms, internationalized themselves—by fleeing the country. This was capital flight with a vengeance, as some of the country’s largest firms in the mining, financial and energy sectors (e.g., Anglo American, De Beers, Old Mutual, South African Breweries, Liberty, Sasol and Billiton) moved their primary exchange listings and headquarters to London. Decisions, henceforth, were made in London, while dividends and other payments could now be legally moved out of South Africa as well.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-2277976013493574">6</xref></sup></p>
<p>Illegal capital flight accelerated as well after 1994. Estimated at 5.4 per cent of GDP a year in the late apartheid years (1980–93), it rose to an estimated 9.2 per cent between 1994 and 2001 and accelerated to 27 per cent in 2007 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-2277976013493574">Ashman et al. 2011</xref>: 9). Despite all the language of non-racialism and the rainbow nation, capital movements are highly racialized: historically white firms have fled North with the wealth built up under apartheid, while locally a small black capitalist stratum was pump-primed into existence by the state and local firms seeking post-apartheid legitimacy.</p>
<p>South African firms have, however, also expanded rapidly northward into the rest of Africa. The path here was paved earlier by the North’s imposition of structural adjustment, which served to shrink African state power and open doors to unfettered trade and investment. Mandela and Mbeki’s acceptance and application of neoliberal policies facilitated this process mightily: in the first five years after majority rule exports from the South African Custom Union (overwhelmingly South African) to regional Southern African Development Community (SADC) partners tripled (from Rand 5 billion in 1993 to Rand 16 billion in 1998). Imports doubled (from Rand 1.3 billion to Rand 2.6 billion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-2277976013493574">Davies 2001</xref>: 51)). South African imports from Africa also grew over this period, largely due to oil imports from Nigeria and Angola, while exports also moved steadily upward. By 2005, South Africa was exporting goods worth Rand 47 billion to the rest of Africa, around 15 per cent of its total exports, while importing only Rand 16 billion of goods (or less than four per cent of South Africa’s imports).</p>
<p>The inequity in the trade is revealed in two ways. First, by the early years of this century, South Africa was importing raw materials and simple manufactures from other African states, while finding in Africa its best market for advanced manufacturing exports and with Africa accounting for 20 to 50 per cent of these exports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-2277976013493574">Cassim et al. 2002</xref>; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-2277976013493574">Buthelezi 2003</xref>). Second, while South Africa itself imports little from SADC or Africa as a percentage of its total imports, for many countries South Africa became the key, overwhelming import partner, accounting in 2004 for 45 per cent of Mozambique’s imports, 44 per cent of Zambia’s, 33 per cent of Malawi’s, 32 per cent of Zimbabwe’s and 10 to 15 per cent of the total imports of Angola, Mauritius, the DR Congo and Tanzania (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-2277976013493574">South Africa, Department of Trade and Industry, 2010</xref>). Even in distant Kenya these patterns held, where exports to South Africa in the five years up to 2007 moved up to only Shilling 1.3 billion, while imports from South Africa ballooned from Sh12 billion to Sh35 billion in 2007 (<italic>Business Daily</italic> (Nairobi), 10 July 2008).</p>
<p>These inequalities are replicated in both equity and direct investment flows. By some estimates, South Africa was Southern Africa’s largest foreign direct investor 10 years after the end of apartheid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-2277976013493574">Wolfgang 2006</xref>: ix). By 2003, South Africa was, for example, the largest foreign investor in Botswana, the DR Congo, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique, Swaziland and Zambia. By the end of 2004, South Africa’s FDI in Africa amounted to Rand 24 billion (US$ 3.7 billion) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-2277976013493574">South African Reserve Bank 2006</xref>: S101–S103).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-2277976013493574">7</xref></sup> By 2008, direct investment in Africa was over US$100 billion, almost 25 per cent of total FDI and three times the amount in North America (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-2277976013493574">South African Reserve Bank 2010</xref>: S92–S95). As with trade, expansion has been particularly strong across the continent and not just the surrounding member-states of the Southern African Development Community (SADC): after 2000, the annual growth of South African FDI in Africa was 29 per cent, compared to an annual rate of investment in SADC of only six per cent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-2277976013493574">Gelb 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>These investments have been spread right across the financial, retail, mining, telecom and energy sectors. South African banks have moved beyond the region to open branches across the continent, absorbing in the process local banking and insurance companies, from Nigeria to Kenya. Retail forms a special case of success, with Shoprite as the leader. In 1990, Shoprite opened its first foreign stores in Namibia, in 1995 the first central African store opened its doors in Zambia and by 2012 there were 187 corporate and 43 franchise stores in 15 African countries outside South Africa (Angola, Botswana, Ghana, Lesotho, Madagascar, Malawi, Mauritius, Mozambique, Namibia, Nigeria, Swaziland, Tanzania, Uganda, Zambia and Zimbabwe) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-2277976013493574">Shoprite 2012</xref>). Cellphone operator MTN, incorporated only in 1994, has had equally remarkable success, spreading through Africa to the Middle East. By 2010, it had 145 million subscribers in 21 countries and was the largest listing on the Johannesburg Stock Echange (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-2277976013493574">MTN 2012</xref>).</p>
<p>More broadly considered, South African firms operate breweries, run airports, build roads and bridges and manage hotel chains all across the continent. Given South Africa’s longstanding mineral and energy complex, large investments have also been made in zinc, coal, gas, gold, platinum and diamond mining. The South African state has itself financed projects in over 20 countries through its Industrial Development Corporation, which has for example a 24 per cent share in the US$ 2 billion Mozal aluminium smelter project in Mozambique. South Africa’s lack of oil or natural gas reserves has propelled similar investments in the region, particularly in Namibian and Mozambican gas; Eskom, the state-owned utility, is engaged in building a regional power grid and has projects in seventeen African countries.</p>
<p>These initiatives must be set against, as noted above, the actual flight from South Africa of some of its largest private mining and energy firms, which now operate their global operations from London and not Johannesburg. South Africa is also not a major consumer of key industrial minerals—the new consumers and price-setters of copper, zinc, aluminium and iron ore are to be found in the East. South African firms do not integrate the exploitation of new resources into an expanding South African manufacturing sector; indeed, they export raw materials elsewhere. And South African mining and energy companies are increasingly being out-flanked by Asian states and firms that can draw on new models of financing, pricing and higher levels of state support.</p>
<p>These evolving patterns are hard to derive from classic models of imperialism, the late nineteenth century ‘scramble for Africa’, or more recent models of ‘accumulation by dispossession’ that underpin most models of a new scramble. This observation is lent further emphasis in relation to ‘land grabs’, where there has been much discussion but little depth of observation. As Ruth Hall’s recent survey of land dispossession in Southern Africa concludes, the media-driven depictions of a massive new wave of land grabbing in Southern Africa needs to be moderated, given the failure of proposed deals and investment, particularly in relation to western corporations, China and Korea (2011: 205). In part, this reflects successful resistance on the ground, the complex and incomplete state of land reforms and land titling, and the uncertain blurring of foreign and domestic investors and lessees.</p>
<p>South Africa is, in any case, hardly a target for large ‘land grabs’ given the level of dispossession achieved under apartheid. Older forms of dispossession do continue into the region, however, driven by the changing economic and political situation for commercial farmers in South Africa; after majority rule, their numbers fell from over 60,000 in 1996, to 45,000 in 2002, to below 40,000 in 2007 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-2277976013493574">South Africa 2012</xref>: 6). This has generated a new trek by white farmers into Zambia and Mozambique, among other locations. Whether the relatively small numbers of white farmers involved turns into a flood remains, however, very much to be seen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-2277976013493574">Hall 2012</xref>).</p>
<p>What is new and on a larger scale is the movement northward by South African agribusiness, most notably in the sugar sector, where the two major firms, Illovo and Tongaat Hulett, have rapidly expanded their estates, outgrower operations and processing plants across Mozambique, Tanzania, Zambia and Zimbabwe (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-2277976013493574">Richardson 2010</xref>). This reflects, as in the case of white commercial farmers, as much an exodus from South Africa as expansion from a strong South African base. Illovo, now Africa’s largest sugar producer, expanded outside South Africa in the 1990s by taking over privatized operations in Malawi, Swaziland and Zambia. This lead, in 2005, to British Sugar buying a controlling share in Illovo. By 2012, only 7 per cent of Illovo’s operating profit came for its South African operations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-2277976013493574">Illovo Sugar Ltd. 2012</xref>: 11). Tongaat Hulett’s post-apartheid expansion is similar: it began with the acquisitions in Mozambique in 1998 and in Zimbabwe in 2006. Yet, in 2012, its South Africa operations contributed but a scant 8 per cent of the profits derived from its sugar operations in Mozambique, South Africa and Zimbabwe (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-2277976013493574">Tongaat Hulett Sugar 2012</xref>: 65).</p>

<title>Looking Forward</title>
<p>It is common for local empirical and historical evidence to be marshalled against theoretical constructs and historical narratives. This is decidedly not the intent here. The specificities of the relations of the South African state, firms and elites with the North and the rest of Africa validate, instead, the utility of moving back and forth between theoretical constructs and historical investigations. While it is possible generally to cast South Africa as the dominant and even sub-imperial power over the course of the last century, nestling historical evidence against dominant theoretical constructs suggests a far more plausible and rich account locally and theoretically—with important lessons for the future.</p>
<p>As argued above, South Africa’s great leap forward took place during the late, classic imperialist epoch. Yet, South Africa was neither an imperial power scrambling for new markets, nor colonized in this period. What inter-imperialist rivalry and continuing crisis (as delineated by theories of imperialism at the time) made possible and explicable, however, were the conditions for innovative action by the South African state. Imposing apartheid at home and expanding South Africa’s power across the region after World War II were, similarly, deeply rooted in the alliance with US hegemony, most specifically an acceptance of the new free enterprise system and the panoply of new international political, trade and financial institutions.</p>
<p>Set against this backdrop, it is tempting to read the current realities and future prospects of South African sub-imperialism off theoretical accounts of the current global crisis and the uncertainties of continuing US power. But, as in earlier epochs, the constructs suitable to explicate the behaviour of core states and firms lack mechanical application to the South African case. There are, in this respect, three important theoretical lessons.</p>
<p>The first is straightforward: tracing how relationships were constructed both North and South indicates that South Africa has long exercised what might best be called a ‘semi-peripheral’ position in the capitalist world. In its simplest form, South Africa has faced underdeveloping relationships with the North on the one hand, and sought to exercise unequal relationships to its advantage with regional and continental states, on the other. This explains, in large part, the contradictory positions and the anomalies that they generate, to bipolar models of unequal exchange, colonizer/colonized, First/Third World, North/South.</p>
<p>This contradictory, Janus-like positioning also explains why legitimacy, much less hegemony, for the South African state has been so puzzling to so many and so difficult to achieve since 1994. On the one hand, the continuation of the developmental alliance with the North led the ANC to embrace the late apartheid’s regime adoption of neoliberal and non-racial principles. On the other hand, these ideological and policy commitments undercut the state’s attempt to lead continental states. Neo-Gramscian and left analyses that stress the failure of South Africa’s bid for continental hegemony are quite correct on this score. Mbeki’s deployment of the notion of Ubuntu was not simply ‘hypocrisy’ or the sign of a ‘revolution betrayed’: it expressed a real attempt to maintain an alliance with the North and yet find a way to forge legitimacy with other African states. It should not surprise us, then, that mutually-exclusive policies to the North and the region emerge; they reflect and reproduce unequal exchange and the highly racialized nature of transnational relationships in the post-apartheid epoch. Looking North, the proclamation of non-racialism and the celebration of formal racial equality serves to protect long-standing, highly-racialized forms of wealth and accumulation. Looking South, the promotion of a black elite, Ubuntu and remembrances of the colonial and apartheid eras conversely aims to forge allegiances in a common African condition. In summary: semi-peripheral positions are inherently unstable ones, involving contradictory stances toward richer, core states and institutions and underdeveloping relations with fellow Africans and states.</p>
<p>The second theoretical lesson to draw is the impossibility of directly applying to South Africa models developed from and about capital accumulation and its crises in Europe and America. This is especially the case today, including here the most persuasive models of capitalist crisis and accumulation by dispossession. Indeed, far from being engaged in ‘primitive accumulation’, South Africa suffers from excessive dispossession of land and labour under apartheid, as the cheap labour thesis postulated long ago. This has not only stifled the possibility of innovation and growth at home, but put South Africa very much at a disadvantage in relation to Asian states that have long been investing in, rather than dispossessing, social and human capital (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-2277976013493574">Arrighi et al. 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>The third lesson points us toward a future that is likely to depend far more upon accumulation and state formation processes spreading outward from Asia than models that derive from endemic crisis of accumulation or financialization in Europe or the United States. ‘Sub-imperial’ analyses invariably focus on the power and influence of Northern states and their neoliberal counterrevolution. Looking back at the last 50 years, there is much value in this. Looking forward, however, this orientation misleads us as the centre of the world-economy and the on-going struggle to create a new world order, moves outside the ambit of North–South relationships and toward East–South ones. Whether one looks at the future of reserve currencies, international financial institutions, migrant labour and capital flows, entrepreneurial and firm forms, post-structural adjustment policies, or the new international divisions of labour emanating from ‘emerging’ states, it is in Asia that innovation is taking place and not Europe or the United States.</p>
<p>The empirical evidence on the importance of these developments for Africa is quite clear and unsettling for the North: for most African states, Asia is now by far the more important partner and one that is disrupting past North–South colonial relationships. In 2000, China for example received 14 per cent of Africa’s exports; by 2007, a World Bank study noted the figure has risen to 27 per cent, on par with exports to the United States and the European Union (EU), with the EU share being halved over 2000–05 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-2277976013493574">Broadman 2007</xref>: 2). By 2008, China alone was the continent’s largest source of Africa’s imports and second only to the United States in its share of exports.</p>
<p>The impact has been even more direct and disruptive for rich South Africa. By 2009, China was South Africa’s largest trading import and export partner, with a trade deficit of Rand 3 billion in China’s favour. Figures for investment are less reliable, but are rising rapidly as well. While concentrated originally in mining, investment has extended to construction, energy and some electronic goods assembly. The largest gold producer in China, the Zijin Mining Group Company, is engaged in a mining project worth Rand 1 billion, while Sinosteel is involved in two chromium mines and state-owned firms have majority states in platinum projects. In 2010, Jidong, the largest cement producer in northern China, announced an investment of Rand 800 million in a 1.65 billion Rand (US$221 million) cement manufacturing project, building on past activity by the Chinese construction firms Citic and Covec. In October 2007, the world’s largest bank, the Industrial Commercial Bank of China, purchased 20 per cent of Africa’s and South Africa’s largest bank, Standard Bank, for US$5.5 billion. The attraction for China of the Standard Bank deal, like others before and after it, was to gain access not only to South Africa’s market but also to the African market through Standard Bank’s extensive banking and commercial network in 18 countries across the continent. By 2012, China’s Public Investment Corporation has started to loan funds directly to South Africa’s state investment agency, the Industrial Development Corporation.</p>
<p>Such interventions mark a sharply disruptive intervention in South Africa’s relations with the North and continental Africa. The centuries-old orientation to Europe and the United States is slowly being eclipsed, rendering the models of Northern accumulation and imperialism less and less reliable. Despite the highly racialized rhetoric from the West surrounding the ‘new imperialists’ (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-2277976013493574">Economist 2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-2277976013493574">2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-2277976013493574">Walt 2006</xref>), Chinese, Indian and, to a lesser extent, Brazilian and Korean, engagements simply do not follow the twentieth-century patterns associated with Western states, banks and multinationals. Asian firms and entrepreneurial diaspora networks rely upon very different financing, organizational and state linkages than in the West—puzzling many business observers.</p>
<p>Asian commercial, financial and political practices do pose significant new challenges for the South African state, firms and elites. Far more than any other African state, South Africa has a large manufacturing and technologically advanced mineral-energy complex. Asian competition not only presses upon the home market for locally-produced manufactures—a market opened at the behest of the now suffering Northern manufacturers and states—but also South Africa’s exports to Africa. The escalation of bilateral trade agreements between African states and China, Indian and Brazil also threaten to replace long-standing relationships with South African producers and distributors. At the same time, Chinese investments in mineral exporting projects in South Africa threaten to undermine South Africans’ own beneficiation technologies and strategies.</p>
<p>The South African state’s reaction to these developments, wedded as it is to its historic partners in the North, has come very belatedly. When it finally announced in June 2012 a new ‘Look East’ trade and industry policy, European officials could only express anger (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-2277976013493574">Africa–Asia Confidential 2012</xref>), while South African trade unionists protested lost manufacturing jobs (particularly in textiles) and ‘colonialism of a new type’; parliamentary opposition figures called for a focus on Africa as a replacement for declining trade with the North; and the white liberal establishment demanded more attention to historical alliances with Europe and the United States.</p>
<p>As these reactions suggest, the rise of Asia poses novel new problems for semi-peripheral South Africa. It is to these new relationships and actors and not the search for replications of past Western-centred, North–South frameworks, that we need to address our analytical and political attention. If there is one historical lesson that is particularly appropriate, it is that, in moments of global crisis, past dependencies can be broken and new and potentially more prosperous relationships might be forged. There should be no lamenting the passing of classic, Euro-American imperialism; there should be much attention to the new order being constructed before us.</p>
