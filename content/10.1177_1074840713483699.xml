<p>This book is a monograph written in the Swedish language comprising 17 chapters, eight of which were coauthored by the editors. Most of the remaining chapters were written by nurses with a doctoral degree. The book is intended for bachelor- and master’s- level nursing students as well as health care practitioners, informal caregivers, and those who have an interest in families experiencing illness.</p>
<p>The Introduction outlines the editors’ participation in the development of Family Nursing in Sweden. Dr. Eva Benzein and Dr. Britt-Inger Saveman have served as pioneers in Family Nursing in Sweden and, in collaboration with Dr. Margaretha Hagberg, have advanced family-focused nursing research and clinical practice at Linnaeus University in Kalmar, Sweden. In 2009, they established the Centre for Research on Family Health at Linnaeus University where health promoting conversations are offered to families within a research context. A total of 15 researchers and doctoral students are linked to the Centre, which has been influenced by the work of Dr. Lorraine Wright and Dr. Janice Bell of the Family Nursing Unit, University of Calgary.</p>
<p>The foundational assumptions of the book are that individuals are always part of a family, which must be understood as a whole and as a system, and that the experience of health is a process, where the focus is on meaning and increased awareness. This parallels the editors’ understanding of person-centered care in which individuals are part of and dependent on their social context. They also assert that an individual’s own experience of illness and ill health, the illness-perspective, is just as important as the disease-perspective. I agree with the editors that these aspects are of major importance for the way in which one views the patient and her/his significant others.</p>
<p>The book consists of two parts. In the first part, five chapters discuss the importance of a family-centered perspective in which the family is viewed as the unit of care and is the theoretical basis for a systemic approach to practice and research that the authors have since named, “The Family Health Conversation Model.” The importance of perceptions and beliefs is emphasized as well as how family-centered care interventions are offered through the medium of health-promoting conversations. The second part of the book presents new research findings with concrete examples of family members’ experiences of being part of a family and living with illness. There are examples of both family-centered and family-related research containing descriptions of the family experience of illness in children, older family members, and end-of-life and including a variety of illnesses such as dementia, psychosis, and stroke.</p>
<p>This is a well-written book and contains many useful references. Family nursing has always been a key element of humanistic care based on a life-world perspective. This book about advanced practice with families has been published at a time when more and more responsibility for care is being placed on the ill person and his/her family. Family responsibility for care is likely to increase in the future due to demographic changes (increases in the elderly population) in combination with lack of financial resources for professional care. This makes it essential for both the ill person and his/her family members to become visible participants in health care and receive the support they need. Facilitating families to recognize their strengths and resources for managing and coping with ill health and disease is therefore an important part of professional family nursing care.</p>
<p>I highly recommend this book and also hope that it will soon be translated into English.</p>
