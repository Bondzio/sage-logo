<abstract>
<p>Workplace voice has been the subject of much research over the past 30 years. Prior work has examined the precursors of a wide variety of voice types including prosocial voice, grievance filing, whistle-blowing, informal complaints, and participation in suggestion systems. However, research on each type of voice has largely been conducted in isolation from work examining alternate types of workplace voice. The goal of this article is to review and integrate the literature on the determinants of workplace voice. The authors’ review of the literature is organized around the major categories of determinants that have been observed in the separate literatures on workplace voice. Based on the review, the authors identify commonalities and differences across alternative forms of voice in the determinants observed. Following this, they explore how the nature and purpose of voice varies, with emphasis on three dimensions of voice: formality, focus, and identifiability. The authors then explore whether this variation is relevant for understanding the pattern of determinants observed across alternative forms of voice. They close by discussing the implications of an integrative perspective of scholars’ understanding of the processes that determine voice and for organizations as they strive to facilitate the productive use of workplace voice.</p>

<body>
<p>Workplace voice—in its various forms—has long been heralded as beneficial to organizations. Accordingly, the determinants of workplace voice have been the subject of much research over the past few decades (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0149206311423823">Brinsfield, Edwards, &amp; Greenberg, 2009</xref>). Recently, research in this area has focused most heavily on a specific form of voice—voice that is prosocial and informal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0149206311423823">Detert &amp; Trevino, 2010</xref>). Attention to this particular type of voice is clearly warranted in that innovation and process improvement are thought to depend on the willingness of employees to offer constructive suggestions about organizational processes, policies, and objectives (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0149206311423823">Edmondson, 1999</xref>). Over the past few decades, significant attention has also been given to alternative forms of voice, ranging from formal suggestion systems to grievance behavior to whistle-blowing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0149206311423823">Boswell &amp; Olson-Buchanan, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr81-0149206311423823">Miceli &amp; Near, 1994</xref>). Attention to these other forms of voice is also justified. For example, India’s Tata Group developed a social network application that allows ideas to be formally suggested and then evaluated and voted on by peers—a system that has resulted in more than 12,000 suggestions, several hundred of which were utilized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr104-0149206311423823">Scanlon, 2009</xref>). Grievance and whistle-blowing systems also have value because they can help identify potential workplace problems and discourage less productive responses to workplace conflict (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr92-0149206311423823">Olson-Buchanan &amp; Boswell, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>To date, separate and distinct literatures have emerged for the different forms of voice that have been studied, resulting in a somewhat fragmented view of the determinants of voice. Individual studies have focused on factors likely to affect a particular type of voice, and little effort has been made to examine in an integrative way the processes that lead to these alternative forms of voice. As a consequence, within these separate voice literatures, differing determinants of voice have been examined, and differing factors have been found to be important. Although these differences could well be the result of differences in disciplinary orientation, they may also be the result of alternative forms of workplace voice having very different attributes—attributes that may affect how employees determine whether to use voice. We would argue, then, that the rather fragmented approach to examining workplace voice has resulted in some ambiguity about the processes that lead to workplace voice.</p>
<p>The differences observed across the separate literatures that have emerged suggest that efforts to integrate them are likely to yield insights regarding how employees determine whether to engage in voice. By taking an integrative perspective, we can begin to examine the role played by attributes or dimensions associated with different forms of voice in determining usage. We can explore why certain factors and processes are relevant for forms of voice possessing one set of attributes but not for different forms of voice.</p>
<p>An integrative perspective is also likely to be of value from an applied view. There is an array of voice alternatives that potentially could be emphasized for employees, and barriers to usage are likely to differ from one alternative form of voice to another. By focusing on how the barriers to voice will vary as the nature of voice changes, an integrative perspective may yield insight regarding how overall workplace voice could be enhanced. Such a focus informs our understanding of whether (a) distinctive organizational policies and practices may be necessary to encourage particular forms of voice, (b) barriers observed for certain forms of voice could be addressed by emphasizing forms of voice less susceptible to these same barriers, and (c) multiple forms of voice can be encouraged by the same policies and initiatives.</p>
<p>Our goal, then, is to conduct an integrative review of the disparate literatures that have emerged with regard to the determinants of workplace voice. In doing so, we examine the relevance of the dimensions of voice for understanding when different processes and factors will be operative. We draw on work examining prosocial, informal voice, whistle-blowing, exit/voice/loyalty/neglect, and the use of formal voice procedures in both union and nonunion firms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0149206311423823">Colvin, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0149206311423823">Detert &amp; Burris, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0149206311423823">Klaas, 1989b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0149206311423823">Lewin, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr81-0149206311423823">Miceli &amp; Near, 1994</xref>).</p>
<p>We should note here that <italic>silence</italic> has also received much attention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0149206311423823">Greenberg &amp; Edwards, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr85-0149206311423823">Morrison &amp; Milliken, 2000</xref>). Silence includes both the withholding of discretionary communication and the refusal to share information required for the completion of basic job requirements and the safe conduct of business (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0149206311423823">Brinsfield et al., 2009</xref>). The focus of the current article is more specific, as we address literature that examines discretionary voice.</p>

<title>The Determinants of Workplace Voice: An Integrative Review</title>
<p>Very different forms of voice have been examined in prior work. Research has examined constructive suggestions made on an informal basis, the use of formal suggestion systems, formal grievances addressing contract violations, informal complaints about perceived mistreatment, and the use of hotlines and related systems for whistle-blowing or otherwise expressing concerns. Although these various forms of voice have been examined in distinct streams of research, a review of the literature suggests commonalities in terms of the types of determinants that have been examined. To facilitate our review of the determinants of workplace voice, we examine findings relating to the following categories for determinants of voice: (a) trait-like characteristics; (b) satisfaction, commitment, and loyalty; (c) risk and safety of voice; (d) voice legitimacy; (e) voice utility; (f) aversive conditions; and (g) culture.</p>
<sec id="section2-0149206311423823">
<title>Trait-Like Individual Differences</title>
<p>Research has examined a number of trait-like individual differences as determinants of prosocial and informal voice. A positive relationship was found between informal prosocial voice and self-esteem (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0149206311423823">LePine &amp; Van Dyne, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr97-0149206311423823">Premeaux &amp; Bedeian, 2003</xref>), conscientiousness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0149206311423823">LePine &amp; Van Dyne, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr115-0149206311423823">Thomas, Whitman, &amp; Viswesvaran, 2010</xref>), extraversion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0149206311423823">LePine &amp; Van Dyne, 2001</xref>), felt responsibility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0149206311423823">Fuller, Marler, &amp; Hester, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr94-0149206311423823">Parker &amp; Collins, 2010</xref>), proactive personality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr94-0149206311423823">Parker &amp; Collins, 2010</xref>), openness to change (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-0149206311423823">Lipponen, Bardi, &amp; Haapamaki, 2008</xref>), prosocial motives (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0149206311423823">Grant &amp; Mayer, 2009</xref>), and self-monitoring (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0149206311423823">Fuller, Barnett, Hester, Relyea, &amp; Frey, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr97-0149206311423823">Premeaux &amp; Bedeian, 2003</xref>). A negative relationship was found between informal prosocial voice and agreeableness and neuroticism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0149206311423823">LePine &amp; Van Dyne, 2001</xref>), and performance goal orientation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr94-0149206311423823">Parker &amp; Collins, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>Individual differences have also been relevant factors in predicting the use of prosocial voice within the context of formal mechanisms, such as suggestion systems. Employees rated as being more open to change and more focused on creativity and problem solving were found to more frequently use suggestion systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0149206311423823">Ekvall, 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-0149206311423823">Lipponen et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr95-0149206311423823">Pizam, 1974</xref>). Self-efficacy and work initiative have also been found to be predictors of suggestion system usage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0149206311423823">Frese, Teng, &amp; Wijnen, 1999</xref>).</p>
<p>Research on informal complaints has given more limited attention to trait-like individual differences as potential antecedents of voice. Prior research has found a positive relationship between assertiveness and informally voicing concerns about aversive conditions directly to supervisors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr87-0149206311423823">Naus, Van Iterson, &amp; Roe, 2007</xref>). In an experimental simulation, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0149206311423823">Harlos (2010)</xref> found that students high in work self-esteem were more likely to exercise formal voice by going to an internal mediator when addressing concerns about a superior. No such relationship was observed when addressing concerns about coworkers, suggesting that those high in self-esteem may believe in their capacity to address problems with coworkers through less formal processes.</p>
<p>Demographic factors, another trait-like characteristic, have been the subject of much study within the context of whistle-blowing and formal voice within grievance systems. However, for both types of voice, findings regarding the impact of demographic factors have been mixed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0149206311423823">Bamberger, Kohn, &amp; Nahum-Shani, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0149206311423823">Kaplan, Pany, Samuels, &amp; Zhang, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0149206311423823">Labig &amp; Greer, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-0149206311423823">Miceli &amp; Near, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr83-0149206311423823">Miceli, Roach, &amp; Near, 1988</xref>).</p>
<p>Although the different voice literatures have examined somewhat different individual differences as antecedents of voice, some interesting patterns have emerged. For example, work-related perceptions of self-esteem and competence have been identified as positively related to several forms of voice including informal prosocial voice, suggestion systems, and seeking voice through a mediator to address mistreatment concerns. Also, the relationships among proactive personality (and informal prosocial voice), work initiative (and suggestion systems), and assertiveness (and mediation) suggest a common thread relating to the role of initiative and proactivity in determining one’s willingness to speak up about workplace issues.</p>

<title>Satisfaction and Commitment</title>
<p>The roles of job satisfaction, commitment, and related constructs have been examined in regard to a number of different types of workplace voice. Informal, prosocial voice was found to be lower among those who are higher in psychological detachment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0149206311423823">Burris, Detert, &amp; Chiaburu, 2008</xref>). This finding suggests that once individuals feel detached from the firm and contemplate leaving, their willingness to improve the organization via prosocial and informal voice diminishes. Related to this, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr107-0149206311423823">Si, Wei, and Li (2008)</xref> found that managers were less likely to practice prosocial and informal voice when they perceived that the firm had violated a psychological contract. Attitudes toward one’s leader have been found to predict use of prosocial and informal voice, with research suggesting that this type of voice will be used more frequently when leader–member exchange is high and when the leader is seen as transformational (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0149206311423823">Botero &amp; Van Dyne, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-0149206311423823">Liu, Zhu, &amp; Yang, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr125-0149206311423823">Van Dyne, Kamdar, &amp; Joireman, 2008</xref>). Similar relationships were found when examining determinants of formal, prosocial voice. For example, the use of suggestion systems has been found to be related to identification with the firm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0149206311423823">Ekvall, 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0149206311423823">Hatcher, Ross, &amp; Collins, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-0149206311423823">Lipponen et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr95-0149206311423823">Pizam, 1974</xref>).</p>
<p>Informal voice about perceived mistreatment has also been found to be related to job satisfaction and other job attitudes. In an experimental simulation, job satisfaction was found to be positively related to the use of informal voice in response to a deteriorating situation at work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr90-0149206311423823">Olson-Buchanan, 1997</xref>). Similarly, field research has found that it is more likely that employees will address aversive conditions that emerge via informal voice when satisfaction and perceived investment in the firm is higher (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr103-0149206311423823">Rusbult, Farrell, Rogers, &amp; Mainous, 1988</xref>). Research has also found that informal voice designed to address mistreatment is more likely among employees who are higher in affective commitment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-0149206311423823">Luchak, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-0149206311423823">Mellahi, Budhwar, &amp; Li, 2010</xref>) and professional commitment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr110-0149206311423823">Tangirala &amp; Ramanujam, 2008a</xref>). With regard to this form of voice, the distinction has also been made between considerate and aggressive voice. When confronted with aversive conditions at work, employees who were more satisfied with work, supervision, and promotional opportunities were more likely to respond with informal voice that is considerate. More dissatisfied employees, by contrast, were more likely to respond with informal voice that is aggressive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0149206311423823">Hagedoorn, Van Yperen, Van De Vliert, &amp; Buunk, 1999</xref>).</p>
<p>However, a different pattern of relationships emerges when examining predictors of formal voice to address mistreatment. Simulations have demonstrated the importance of job satisfaction, suggesting that formal voice addressing concerns about mistreatment is more likely to occur when employees satisfaction is lower (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr90-0149206311423823">Olson-Buchanan, 1997</xref>). Simulations have also suggested that attitudes toward the supervisor play a role, with more negative attitudes associated with greater use of formal voice designed to address perceived mistreatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0149206311423823">Gordon &amp; Bowlby, 1989</xref>). Such findings are consistent with survey data, which have also shown that grievance behavior is more likely among dissatisfied employees (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0149206311423823">Allen &amp; Keaveny, 1985</xref>). Although the specific source of dissatisfaction may not be subject to the grievance process, grievance behavior can be used to express discontent and to restore perceived equity by taking action that may impose some cost on the supervisor and/or the organization. In addition, loyalty to the organization and affective commitment have been found to be negatively related to formal grievance behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0149206311423823">Boroff &amp; Lewin, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr91-0149206311423823">Olson-Buchanan &amp; Boswell, 2002</xref>).</p>

<sec id="section4-0149206311423823">
<title>Risk and Safety of Voice</title>
<p>Speaking up has the potential to create risk for the individual (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr105-0149206311423823">Seibert, Kraimer, &amp; Crant, 2001</xref>). As such, variables related to the risks of speaking up have been examined extensively within the different voice literatures. With regard to informal, prosocial voice, psychological safety has been found to play an important role in the willingness to voice. Even though this type of voice is prosocial, it still involves challenging existing processes, meaning individuals may be reluctant to do so absent perceptions of psychological safety. It should also be noted that psychological safety has been found to mediate or partially mediate the impact associated with how leaders are perceived. For example, perceptions regarding whether leaders (both direct and skip level) are ethical, open, and supportive of efforts to use voice have been found to affect voice (mediated or partially mediated by psychological safety; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0149206311423823">Detert &amp; Burris, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0149206311423823">Detert &amp; Trevino, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr128-0149206311423823">Walumbwa &amp; Schaubroeck, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Risk and the safety of voice have also emerged as important factors within the context of whistle-blowing. Evidence suggests that whistle-blowing is more likely when individuals believe that it will be supported within the organization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0149206311423823">Lee, Heilmann, &amp; Near, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-0149206311423823">Miceli &amp; Near, 1984</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-0149206311423823">1985</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-0149206311423823">1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr89-0149206311423823">Near &amp; Miceli, 1996</xref>). Related to this, expectations regarding the potential for retaliation have also been found to be related to whistle-blowing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0149206311423823">Casal &amp; Bogui, 2008</xref>). Employee willingness to use whistle-blowing has been found to be related to perceptions regarding the effectiveness of the whistle-blowing system and one’s ability to document whatever claims might be made, both of which are likely to minimize the risk of retaliation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0149206311423823">Casal &amp; Bogui, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0149206311423823">Lee et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-0149206311423823">Miceli &amp; Near, 1984</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-0149206311423823">1985</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-0149206311423823">1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr89-0149206311423823">Near &amp; Miceli, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr117-0149206311423823">Trevino &amp; Victor, 1992</xref>). Furthermore, studies have found that whistle-blowing is more likely in the presence of laws, regulations, or organizational policies that offer protection from retaliation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr80-0149206311423823">Miceli &amp; Near, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr82-0149206311423823">Miceli, Rehg, Near, &amp; Ryan, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr88-0149206311423823">Near, Dworkin, &amp; Miceli, 1993</xref>). The role of risk in the context of whistle-blowing can also be seen in studies comparing the use of anonymous versus identifiable whistle-blowing systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0149206311423823">Elliston, 1982</xref>). Whistle-blowers are more likely to choose to remain anonymous when they fear retaliation and when they believe that anonymous whistle-blowing would be effective (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr83-0149206311423823">Miceli et al., 1988</xref>).</p>
<p>Support for the role of risk and safety has also been found in survey research examining the willingness to engage in informal voice regarding perceived mistreatment. This form of voice has been found to be more likely when the employee has alternative employment opportunities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr103-0149206311423823">Rusbult et al., 1988</xref>). Risk and safety factors have also been examined with respect to using formal voice to address perceived mistreatment. This form of voice was more likely among employees who perceived the firm as being more dependent on labor, presumably because such dependency is thought to lower the risk of negative reactions and increase the likelihood of a cooperative response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0149206311423823">Bacharach &amp; Bamberger, 2004</xref>).</p>

<title>Voice Utility</title>
<p>Researchers have also examined the role of factors likely to affect the perceived utility of using voice within the workplace. Within the informal, prosocial literature, perceptions regarding personal control at work were critical, with a curvilinear relationship being observed between control and voice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr111-0149206311423823">Tangirala &amp; Ramanujam, 2008b</xref>). Specifically, voice was observed more frequently when personal control was lowest (because of dissatisfaction with the lack of influence over the work environment), and when it was highest—presumably resulting from a belief that proactive behavior such as voice would yield meaningful change (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr111-0149206311423823">Tangirala &amp; Ramanujam, 2008b</xref>). Supporting this, studies have found prosocial, informal voice to be related to perceptions regarding personal influence within the work-group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr127-0149206311423823">Venkataramani &amp; Tangirala, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>Factors relating to voice utility have also been examined within the context of suggestion systems. Interviews with managers suggest that willingness to use suggestion systems is often lower in the context of managerial indifference and delayed responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0149206311423823">Gorfin, 1969</xref>). By contrast, the presence of a learning culture has been found to be positively related to the use of this form of voice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0149206311423823">Leach, Stride, &amp; Wood, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>The issue of voice utility has also been examined within the context of other types of voice, including formal grievance filing. Research examining the use of the formal grievance process to address perceived mistreatment has shown that employees are influenced by factors likely to affect the relative attractiveness of this form of voice over other possible responses. Willingness to use the grievance process was found to be greater when individuals received above-market levels of compensation and when there were fewer labor market alternatives. Such conditions are assumed to motivate employees to avoid action that would risk termination such as withdrawal responses (e.g., shirking) that might lead to dismissal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0149206311423823">Cappelli &amp; Chauvin, 1991</xref>). Other contextual factors that are likely to increase the cost of alternative responses to perceived mistreatment have also been found to increase the likelihood of grievance filing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0149206311423823">Bacharach &amp; Bamberger, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0149206311423823">Lewin &amp; Peterson, 1988</xref>).</p>

<title>Voice Legitimacy</title>
<p>Given the role of hierarchy within organizations, issues relating to voice legitimacy are likely to be important. Furthermore, characteristics of the work group, the climate of the organization, and leadership all have the potential to affect whether voice is seen as legitimate and, in turn, the likelihood that it will be used. In the informal, prosocial voice literature, the climate for voice within one’s work group has been found to be related to an individual’s willingness to engage in voice. Where group-level beliefs emphasize the value of voice, individual use of voice is greater (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr86-0149206311423823">Morrison, Wheeler-Smith, &amp; Kamdar, 2011</xref>). The relevance of legitimacy of voice can also be seen in the relationship between informal, prosocial voice and whether one perceives making constructive suggestions to be part of one’s prescribed work role (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr125-0149206311423823">Van Dyne et al., 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>Factors relating to legitimacy have also been found to be relevant within the context of formal suggestion systems. Voice within this context has been found to be positively related to publicity campaigns designed to highlight the need for employees to improve organizational processes through the use of the suggestion system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0149206311423823">Leach et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr99-0149206311423823">Rapp &amp; Eklund, 2007</xref>). Similarly, the use of nonmonetary rewards and recognition has the potential to validate participation in suggestion systems. Consistent with this, use of nonmonetary rewards and recognition is associated with increased participation in formal suggestion systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0149206311423823">Leach et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr99-0149206311423823">Rapp &amp; Eklund, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>Factors related to legitimacy have also been examined for whistle-blowing, with this form of voice more likely when legitimized by the individual’s role. More specifically, whistle-blowing is more likely when an individual is obligated by role to protect others within the organization from violations of standards of conduct (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr100-0149206311423823">Rothwell &amp; Baldwin, 2007a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr117-0149206311423823">Trevino &amp; Victor, 1992</xref>). Similarly, policies mandating the reporting of wrongdoing have been found to increase the use of whistle-blowing, arguably because such policies legitimize voice regarding the behavior of leaders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr101-0149206311423823">Rothwell &amp; Baldwin, 2007b</xref>).</p>

<sec id="section7-0149206311423823">
<title>Aversive Conditions</title>
<p>Research has examined whether the presence and/or severity of aversive conditions increases the willingness to use several different forms of voice. Whistle-blowing has been found, for example, to be more likely when the behavior in question is seen as being more consequential for those affected and for the interests of the work group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0149206311423823">Lee et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-0149206311423823">Miceli &amp; Near, 1984</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-0149206311423823">1985</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-0149206311423823">1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr89-0149206311423823">Near &amp; Miceli, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr117-0149206311423823">Trevino &amp; Victor, 1992</xref>).</p>
<p>The presence of aversive conditions also has been found to play a role in determining the use of informal and formal voice to express concerns about mistreatment. The use of informal voice has been found to be positively related to perceived violations regarding the psychological contract (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr119-0149206311423823">Turnley &amp; Feldman, 1999</xref>). Research has also shown that the level of conflict within the labor–management relationship and the likely incidence of perceived mistreatment play an important role in determining employee willingness to file grievances. Programs designed to reduce labor–management conflict were found to be associated with fewer grievances (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0149206311423823">Katz, Kochan, &amp; Gobeille, 1983</xref>). Also, supervisory knowledge of the union contract was found to be negatively related to the grievance rate within a work group, perhaps because greater knowledge led to fewer potential contract violations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0149206311423823">Bemmels, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0149206311423823">Bemmels, Reshef, &amp; Stratton-Devine, 1991</xref>). Similarly, leadership behavior that emphasized consideration for members of the work group has also been found to be associated with fewer grievances, perhaps because it resulted in fewer incidents where employees felt mistreated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0149206311423823">Bemmels, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0149206311423823">Bemmels et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0149206311423823">Fleishman &amp; Harris, 1962</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr109-0149206311423823">Skinner, 1969</xref>). Technology and the structure of work processes have also been found to be relevant, with more structured environments associated with fewer grievances, perhaps because there were fewer opportunities for supervisor discretion and, thus, fewer incidents of perceived mistreatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0149206311423823">Bemmels et al., 1991</xref>).</p>

<sec id="section8-0149206311423823">
<title>Culture</title>
<p>Researchers have begun to explore the role of culture in the willingness to use voice. D. C. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr113-0149206311423823">Thomas and Au’s (2002)</xref> study of informal prosocial voice in Hong Kong and New Zealand found horizontal individualism positively predicts informal, prosocial voice and found an interaction between horizontal individualism and quality of job alternatives in predicting voice. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0149206311423823">Botero and Van Dyne (2009)</xref> found power distance negatively predicts informal, prosocial voice. Although evidence suggesting that cultural differences such as individualism and power distance can affect the willingness to use voice, cultural differences were not found to be important with regard to the role played by job satisfaction in predicting voice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr114-0149206311423823">Thomas &amp; Pekert, 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>Research on cross-cultural antecedents of whistle-blowing has also started to emerge. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr112-0149206311423823">Tavakoli, Keenan, and Crnjak-Karanovic’s (2003)</xref> comparison of U.S. and Croatian managers identified the importance of the cultural dimensions of power distance and masculinity in predicting the likelihood of whistle-blowing. Also, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr129-0149206311423823">Zhang, Chiu, and Wei (2009)</xref> examined internal whistle-blowing intentions in a Chinese sample and, in contrast to the whistle-blowing studies based in North America (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr89-0149206311423823">Near &amp; Miceli, 1996</xref>), they found younger and less experienced employees and those in lower level positions were less likely to engage in whistle-blowing. The role of culture is also supported by work in the procedural justice area, where it has been found that power distance affected preferences for how to deal with disputes, presumably because those from high power distance cultures were more concerned about being viewed benevolently by influential others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0149206311423823">Lind, Tyler, &amp; Huo, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr123-0149206311423823">Tyler, Lind, &amp; Huo, 2000</xref>).</p>

<title>Workplace Voice Determinants: Commonalities and Differences</title>
<p>The prior literature review allows for us to explore the different factors that have been found to inhibit or encourage various forms of workplace voice. In this section we discuss the commonalities in the determinants of alternative forms of voice including trait based, risk or safety, utility of voice, voice legitimacy, and culture. Following this, we examine where differences have surfaced in the pattern of determinants and also where gaps in the literature prevent definitive conclusions regarding commonalities and differences.</p>
<sec id="section10-0149206311423823">
<title>Commonalities in the Determinants of Alternative Forms of Workplace Voice</title>
<p>To what extent are employees affected by the same set of factors in deciding, for example, whether to file a formal complaint or whether to informally make a suggestion about how to improve a process? The different voice literatures have developed, for the most part, in isolation from one another. As such, the underlying assumption appears to be that various forms of voice are so different from one another that their determinants would be unique to a particular form of voice. But do determinants of voice shift when the attributes of the type of voice being examined shifts? We would argue that some commonalities emerge when looking across different forms of voice.</p>
<p>Our review suggests that some commonalities exist with regard to certain trait-based determinants of voice. Researchers examining different forms of voice have focused on slightly different personality traits, making direct comparisons more difficult. However, it appears that some similar traits have emerged as important across different forms of voice. For example, it appears that multiple forms of voice are affected by attributes relating to proactivity, assertiveness, and self-esteem (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0149206311423823">LePine &amp; Van Dyne, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr87-0149206311423823">Naus et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr94-0149206311423823">Parker &amp; Collins, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr97-0149206311423823">Premeaux &amp; Bedeian, 2003</xref>). With the types of voice examined most frequently in existing research, voice is inevitably a discretionary activity that calls attention to the views and ideas of the individual. As such, despite the content of voice, personality traits relating to proactivity, assertiveness, and self-esteem are likely to be relevant.</p>
<p>Other commonalities were observed as well. Issues related to the risk and safety of using voice were found to be relevant for multiple forms of voice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0149206311423823">Detert &amp; Burris, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0149206311423823">Detert &amp; Trevino, 2010</xref>). It should be noted that risk and safety were approached differently when examining different types of voice. For example, when examining informal, prosocial voice, psychological safety received significant attention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0149206311423823">Detert &amp; Burris, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr128-0149206311423823">Walumbwa &amp; Schaubroeck, 2009</xref>). When examining whistle-blowing, attention was focused more on legal or procedural protections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr82-0149206311423823">Miceli et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr80-0149206311423823">Miceli &amp; Near, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr88-0149206311423823">Near et al., 1993</xref>). With regard to voice focused on perceived mistreatment, the issue of risk was addressed by examining the availability of employment alternatives (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr103-0149206311423823">Rusbult et al., 1988</xref>). Voice can be exercised for a variety of reasons and can be used within a number of different contexts. But most forms of voice examined within the literature are discretionary and may easily expose the employee to consequences ranging from embarrassment (for having made a questionable suggestion) to retaliation (for having challenged a managerial decision; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr84-0149206311423823">Milliken, Morrison, &amp; Hewlin, 2003</xref>). Thus, across the different forms of voice examined to date, issues of risk and safety appear to be important—even if how employees think about risk and safety varies.</p>
<p>Factors relating to the utility of voice have also been found to be relevant across different forms of voice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0149206311423823">Detert &amp; Trevino, 2010</xref>). This is consistent with the idea that the decision to use voice includes a significant calculative element—it is not simply an automatic response to observing opportunities for improvement or incidents of mistreatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0149206311423823">Klaas, 1989a</xref>). However, once again, the specific way utility is examined in existing research varies. When voice focuses on process improvement and is offered informally, factors relating to employees’ perceived influence and control within the work unit have been identified as determinants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr127-0149206311423823">Venkataramani &amp; Tangirala, 2010</xref>). By contrast, when using formal systems for providing input—input that is systematically evaluated by a team of individuals—managerial commitment to that formal system is a key determinant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0149206311423823">Gorfin, 1969</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0149206311423823">Leach et al., 2006</xref>). Similarly, factors relating to the legitimacy of voice were found to be relevant across multiple forms of voice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0149206311423823">Leach et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0149206311423823">Lee et al., 2004</xref>). Although researchers examined—across different forms of voice—very different factors associated with legitimacy, there appears to be a consistent pattern. Because speaking up often challenges authority and/or established procedures and because it typically is not part of one’s prescribed organizational role, the willingness to engage in voice might well depend on whether efforts are made to legitimize voice behavior.</p>
<p>Research on cultural determinants of voice is fairly limited. However, even within this category, some commonality has emerged. In particular, power distance has been found to be negatively related to both informal prosocial voice and whistle-blowing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0149206311423823">Botero &amp; Van Dyne, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr112-0149206311423823">Tavakoli et al., 2003</xref>).</p>

<sec id="section11-0149206311423823">
<title>Differences in the Determinants of Alternative Forms of Workplace Voice</title>
<p>Although consistent patterns did emerge across the voice literatures, important differences were observed also. For example, with regard to variables relating to satisfaction and commitment, important differences were observed. For suggestion systems and informal voice (both prosocial and voice aimed at addressing mistreatment), voice was positively related to variables such as satisfaction and commitment. However, a very different pattern was observed when examining formal voice addressing perceived mistreatment. Employees with more favorable attitudes toward the organization and job were more reluctant to use voice when it involved formally registering a complaint about treatment by a manager or the organization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr90-0149206311423823">Olson-Buchanan, 1997</xref>).</p>

<sec id="section12-0149206311423823">
<title>Unexamined Commonalities and Differences</title>
<p>Given that the various forms of voice have been treated as different from one another in the literature, it is somewhat surprising how few differences in the determinants have been identified. It should also be noted, however, that we are limited in our ability to make direct comparisons of determinants between alternative forms of voice, partly because research has given limited attention to certain types of determinants for certain forms of workplace voice. For example, although aversive conditions were examined with regard to the determinants of voice in the mistreatment literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0149206311423823">Harlos, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr87-0149206311423823">Naus et al., 2007</xref>), such conditions received little attention within the informal, prosocial voice literature. Similarly, research has examined culture as a possible determinant of prosocial informal voice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0149206311423823">Botero &amp; Van Dyne, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr113-0149206311423823">Thomas &amp; Au, 2002</xref>) and whistle-blowing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr112-0149206311423823">Tavakoli et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr129-0149206311423823">Zhang et al., 2009</xref>) but has not examined its possible relation to voice surrounding perceptions of mistreatment. Another barrier to making direct comparisons is that there is little literature on the determinants of certain forms of voice. For example, nearly all of the studies discussed in the review above addressed the determinants of voice when the sender of the message is known. Only a limited number of studies focused on determinants of voice when the sender remains anonymous (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0149206311423823">Elliston, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0149206311423823">Kaplan et al., 2009</xref>). Thus, it is difficult to draw conclusions about how the determinants of voice might be different when voice is anonymous versus when the sender can be identified.</p>

<sec id="section13-0149206311423823">
<title>Workplace Voice: Dimensions and Determinants</title>
<p>We argue that although there is evidence of substantial commonalities in the determinants of voice, there is also evidence of some distinctive elements. Furthermore, given the gaps in the current literature, it is important to recognize that these commonalities and distinctive elements may be more significant than what has been documented in the existing literature.</p>
<p>The literature review suggests that when examining alternative forms of voice, the patterns observed for determinants of voice are likely to display both commonalities and distinctive patterns. To better understand <italic>why</italic> certain factors are common determinants across various forms of voice and others are unique to a particular form of voice, we need to look beyond the form of voice as it is traditionally defined in the literature (e.g., prosocial informal, whistle-blowing, grievance filing) and instead examine determinants of voice as it is defined in terms of certain underlying dimensions or characteristics. That is, we argue the key to understanding what facilitates voice is to move beyond the separate streams of voice literatures and instead examine voice in terms of critical dimensions. In this section, we examine three major dimensions associated with alternative forms of voice that may affect what factors will facilitate or inhibit the use of voice: (a) formality of the voice mechanism, (b) voice focus, and (c) identifiability of the message. We discuss the relevance of each dimension and then explore how the dimension is likely to affect processes that determine voice usage.</p>
<sec id="section14-0149206311423823">
<title>Formality of voice</title>
<p>When discussing the voice literature, attention was given to voice that was informal, where ideas or concerns were expressed directly and outside a structured process. Such informal voice could be expressed in casual conversation, a meeting involving multiple participants, or a written note or e-mail (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0149206311423823">Brinsfield et al., 2009</xref>). Given its informal nature, the recipient determines whether and how to respond and whether to inform others of the issues raised.</p>
<p>Attention was also given to formal voice. Voice expressed through formal mechanisms often requires that the idea or concern be recorded according to specified procedures and allows for systematic evaluation of the ideas or concerns presented (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0149206311423823">Budd &amp; Colvin, 2008</xref>). Examples of formal voice include formal suggestion systems, where employees may submit ideas or suggestions to improve organizational processes (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0149206311423823">Fairbank, Spangler, &amp; Williams, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-0149206311423823">Marx, 2008</xref>). Ideas typically are then evaluated by a team of individuals with formal feedback provided regarding whether the idea will be pursued. Other examples include whistle-blowing mechanisms where concerns are submitted and then investigated by a designated member of the organization who is also responsible for recommending an appropriate course of action (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0149206311423823">Gundlach, Douglas, &amp; Martinko, 2003</xref>). Grievance or appeal processes are still another example. Although the use of a formal grievance or appeal process is often preceded by informal voice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0149206311423823">Ichniowsky, 1986</xref>), once a formal grievance is filed, the grievance is recorded and evaluated by a senior manager, an HR manager, or parties designated as neutral third parties (e.g., arbitrators or peer review panelists; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0149206311423823">Budd &amp; Colvin, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>Clearly, the level of formality varies across forms of voice. But when we focus specifically on informal voice, do some determinants become more or less important? With informal voice, to whom the voice is directed and how the recipient(s) responds to the voice is not prescribed, per se. As such, an employee may use informal voice however he or she sees fit such as presenting an idea or concern face-to-face to a manager with whom he or she has an ongoing relationship (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0149206311423823">Botero &amp; Van Dyne, 2009</xref>). Or, an employee may choose to voice informally in a way that does not reveal his or her identity, such as by leaving a voicemail or note. An employee could also blow the whistle on unethical behavior by informally approaching others who are in a position to address the concern or by leaving anonymous voicemails or notes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr83-0149206311423823">Miceli et al., 1988</xref>). Given there is (generally) not a formal procedure for responding to informal voice, factors such as the employee’s belief in the recipient’s integrity or capacity for handling the idea or concern are likely to be particularly relevant.</p>
<p>Arguably, the use of formal voice makes other factors more relevant. Formal voice procedures require that the content of the voice be shared with others and certain procedures be followed in response to the voice. As such, in some contexts formal voice is seen as provocative (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0149206311423823">Greenberger, Miceli, &amp; Cohen, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0149206311423823">Klaas &amp; DeNisi, 1989</xref>). To illustrate, consider when employees are concerned about how they have been treated by their manager or about key managerial decisions. The use of formal voice in this situation usually occurs after the employee has already raised the issue informally with the manager (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0149206311423823">Ichniowsky, 1986</xref>). As such, the employee is escalating his or her complaint and the manager must explain his or her actions to those with the authority to overturn the prior decision. By formally raising those concerns, he or she is announcing and documenting his or her dissatisfaction with the manager.</p>
<p>Alternatively, consider when an employee has an idea for how to improve work processes. Choosing to voice this idea through a formal process rather than sharing it with the responsible person to evaluate its merits may also be seen as provocative—unless employees are explicitly directed to use formal rather than informal channels for particular kinds of issues or ideas. When formality serves to signal concerns about a manager’s ability or willingness to consider a suggestion or resolve a concern, it changes how voice is perceived by employees and how they evaluate whether to exercise voice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0149206311423823">Frese et al., 1999</xref>). In situations like these, where formal voice is viewed as provocative in that it violates norms regarding the chain of command (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0149206311423823">Greenberger et al., 1987</xref>), it may be seen by many as an option to be used when it is no longer tolerable to ignore the situation or there are no other viable alternatives. As a consequence, use of formal voice under such circumstances is more likely for those who have a poor working relationship with their manager. Employees with high levels of satisfaction or commitment may not see the benefits of addressing a suggestion or unfair treatment via formal means as worth the damage that might result to their relationship with their manager and organization.</p>
<p>Yet there are also likely to be conditions where formalization will not be seen as provocative. For example, consider again the use of formal suggestion systems. In many cases, the suggestion system is viewed as a way to offer ideas that may have implications beyond the employee’s department or work group or require resources or support from elsewhere in the organization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-0149206311423823">Marx, 2008</xref>). Furthermore, suggestion systems are often used because opportunities for input regarding process improvement do not occur on an ongoing basis, particularly for more complicated or elaborate organizational processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0149206311423823">Fairbank et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0149206311423823">Fairbank &amp; Williams, 2001</xref>). Thus, it may well be that use of the formal suggestion system is viewed as an additional opportunity to efficiently offer suggestions and ideas. As such, in contexts where formal voice is not seen as provocative, formalization would not affect which determinants are most critical.</p>
<p>A similar view emerges through the exit/voice/loyalty/neglect (EVLN) perspective. The EVLN perspective argues that voice will be used as an alternative to exit or neglect responses when deteriorating conditions emerge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0149206311423823">Farrell, 1983</xref>) and that the use of voice will be more likely among more loyal employees (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0149206311423823">Boroff &amp; Lewin, 1997</xref>). This perspective highlights why voice and loyalty are compatible, suggesting that loyal employees will make an effort to rectify the situation. We argue formalization of voice will affect how the EVLN perspective should be used to understand workplace voice. When the mechanism for voice allows concerns to be expressed in a way that is viewed as constructive and allows for relationships to be strengthened, the relationship between loyalty and voice is likely to be positive. However, where the mechanism for voice makes it more likely that voice will be seen as an act of provocation, voice is likely to be negatively related to loyalty. Thus, formalization has the potential to alter how voice is viewed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0149206311423823">Greenberger et al., 1987</xref>), making it seem more of an act of provocation than an effort to constructively resolve conflict.</p>
<p>Whistle-blowing presents an interesting situation with respect to formality. Formal whistle-blowing may consist of the use of an anonymous hotline or a complaint procedure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0149206311423823">Hassink, Vries, &amp; Bollen, 2007</xref>). How does formalization affect the determinants of voice when an employee is confronted with managerial or employee behavior that is ethically or legally questionable? Reporting unethical or illegal behavior might be viewed as having the potential to adversely affect the interests of some key stakeholders within the organization. Conversely, not reporting unethical or illegal behavior might also be viewed as having the potential to adversely affect the interests of other key stakeholders within the organization. Whistle-blowing voice is less easily viewed as an effort to engage in constructive problem solving and instead is likely to be viewed as an effort to stop the behavior in question and to address the wrongdoing that has been committed. As such, when firms formalize provisions for whistle-blowing, this is unlikely to make whistle-blowing seem to be more of an act of provocation.</p>
<p>By contrast, consider when voice is used for principled dissent such as where the employee disagrees with significant organizational strategies and policies because of the potential impact on organizational effectiveness or valued stakeholders—not situations where accusations of illegal or unethical behavior are being made (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0149206311423823">Graham, 1986</xref>). Although organizations may have formal processes that allow for principled dissent, given the substance of the issues being addressed, they would likely be used only after efforts to address the issues informally. Thus, once again, using a formal process is likely to be seen as an escalation, a provocative act, and potentially politically motivated. Within this context, formality is again likely to alter processes that determine the use of voice.</p>

<title>Voice focus</title>
<p>Workplace voice also varies on another critical dimension—the focus of voice. As was noted, many studies have examined what has been described as prosocial voice. The focus of this voice is on how the function or performance of the work unit or organization can be improved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr124-0149206311423823">Van Dyne, Ang, &amp; Botero, 2003</xref>). This can be contrasted with studies that have examined voice focused on perceived mistreatment or the identification of wrongdoing. This voice has been referred to as justice-oriented and presumes a focus on achieving restitution for perceived mistreatment and/or restoring justice via seeking retribution for wrongdoing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr92-0149206311423823">Olson-Buchanan &amp; Boswell, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>The distinction between prosocial and justice voice has received much attention (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0149206311423823">Dozier &amp; Miceli, 1985</xref>). In their pure forms, prosocial voice and justice-oriented voice stem from very different sources and are likely to be framed very differently by others in the organization. In its pure form, prosocial voice is framed as benefiting the organization by improving processes and performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr124-0149206311423823">Van Dyne et al., 2003</xref>). As such, the literature has given little attention to the potential for conflict of interest between the employee and recipient of the message. Although the sender may be concerned about the recipient’s reaction to the ideas suggested and concerned about how speaking up will be viewed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr85-0149206311423823">Morrison &amp; Milliken, 2000</xref>), the ultimate interests of the sender and recipient are assumed to not diverge. Instead, attention is focused on factors associated with the desire to assist the organization, as this form of voice is considered part of organizational citizenship (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr126-0149206311423823">Van Dyne &amp; LePine, 1998</xref>). Drawing from social exchange theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0149206311423823">Blau, 1964</xref>), it can be seen that where the employee has a more favorable attitude toward his or her supervisor or employer, he or she will see an obligation to reciprocate via citizenship behavior—which could potentially include prosocial voice. In addition, since this form of voice is motivated by a desire to advance the interests of the organization, employees are likely to be highly sensitive to cues regarding whether their input is desired. And consistent with the literature, where leaders exhibit openness to input, employees are more willing to engage in prosocial voice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0149206311423823">Detert &amp; Burris, 2007</xref>). Arguably, the importance of leader openness stems both from its role in encouraging perceptions of psychological safety and a sense that input will actually be used to improve processes and functions in the organization.</p>
<p>By contrast, in its pure form justice-oriented voice focuses on alleged mistreatment or wrongdoing, which are thought to lead to perceived inequity or injustice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0149206311423823">Bemmels &amp; Foley, 1996</xref>). With justice-oriented voice, the employee is usually seeking restitution or some form of retribution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0149206311423823">Bemmels &amp; Foley, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0149206311423823">Klaas, 1989a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-0149206311423823">McCabe, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr108-0149206311423823">Skarlicki &amp; Folger, 1997</xref>), and, as such, conflicting interests are typically assumed. Arguably, justice-oriented voice is likely to impose at least some short-term costs on the manager and firm, such as embarrassing the manager through calling attention to a questionable decision, or it could come in the form of requiring that the manager consume valued time and resources by reversing prior action.</p>
<p>A social exchange perspective might well suggest that employees with more favorable attitudes toward their supervisors or employers would be less likely to engage in voice if doing so would impose significant costs on the manager or firm. Instead, they would be more willing to reciprocate prior supportive behavior and accept modest instances of perceived injustice rather than use voice to avoid imposing costs on the manager or firm. However, where the costs likely to be imposed on the manager are <italic>minimal</italic>, it is likely that once again a positive relationship will emerge. That is, when costs are low, employees who are satisfied and committed to the organization may be more motivated to address areas of concern and ensure that the workplace remains a favorable environment. Thus, we argue the distinction between prosocial and justice-oriented voice is important because justice-oriented voice is more likely to be associated with conditions or features that will impose some level of cost on the affected manager(s) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0149206311423823">Bemmels &amp; Foley, 1996</xref>), whereas prosocial voice is often designed to offer some benefits for the affected manager(s) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr124-0149206311423823">Van Dyne et al., 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>Another possible difference between prosocial and justice-oriented voice relates to the importance of the magnitude of voice message. Specifically, because justice-oriented voice is thought to be motivated by an urge to restore justice, this urge is likely to be stronger when the mistreatment or injustice is perceived to be more severe (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0149206311423823">Bemmels &amp; Foley, 1996</xref>). The specific act that led to voice being considered and how that act is interpreted from a justice perspective would be a salient determinant with regard to justice-oriented voice, but not generally relevant for prosocial voice.</p>
<p>Another important difference relates to the relevance of factors that provide protection from negative reactions to voice. Because prosocial voice is designed to benefit the organization and not necessarily the individual employee, cues from leaders that suggest a lack of openness to input or low perceptions of psychological safety, are likely to discourage employees from engaging in this form of voice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0149206311423823">Detert &amp; Burris, 2007</xref>). However, for certain types of justice-oriented voice, speaking up offers the employee the potential to gain individual restitution or, at least, prevent the continuance of a negative situation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0149206311423823">Detert &amp; Burris, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr93-0149206311423823">Olson-Buchanan &amp; Boswell, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr94-0149206311423823">Parker &amp; Collins, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr119-0149206311423823">Turnley &amp; Feldman, 1999</xref>). As such, employees may be likely to consider engaging in voice even when cues suggest that managers are unlikely to be open to questions about their decision or policy. In deciding to voice, employees are likely to give substantial attention to the likely costs that will occur as a consequence of negative managerial reactions to voice. We argue that justice-oriented voice will be influenced more (relative to prosocial voice) by factors that might offer protection from negative managerial reactions, such as having access to employment alternatives or procedural protections within the organization.</p>
<p>However, it is important to note that the focus of voice is not always singular. For example, when filing a formal grievance against a manager for a contract violation, there is typically a focus on obtaining restitution for the violation—a justice orientation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0149206311423823">Detert &amp; Burris, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr119-0149206311423823">Turnley &amp; Feldman, 1999</xref>). Yet there may also be a focus on modifying dysfunctional supervisory behavior that negatively affects coworkers, consistent with a prosocial motive. The case of whistle-blowing is particularly reflective of the duality of motives. When individuals blow the whistle on illegal or unethical behavior, there is likely to be a justice-oriented focus, and by identifying wrongdoing, it is possible for justice to be restored via retribution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-0149206311423823">Mesmer-Magnus &amp; Viswesvaran, 2005</xref>). However, the act is also likely to contain a prosocial motive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0149206311423823">Bjorkelo, Einarsen, &amp; Matthiesen, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0149206311423823">Dozier &amp; Miceli, 1985</xref>). Segments of the organization may well have been harmed by the illegal or unethical behavior, thus allowing for whistle-blowing to ultimately benefit the individual’s work unit and the overall organization. It should be noted that this duality of motives has also been observed with related workplace behavior. Specifically, revenge has been found to be affected by a desire to both restore justice and to curb problematic behavior for the benefit of others within the organization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0149206311423823">Bies &amp; Tripp, 1998</xref>).</p>
<p>How does the presence of a mixed motive or dual motive affect the pattern of determinants? Consider, for example, when an employee makes a seemingly prosocial suggestion, such as formalizing the process for assigning work, which would also serve to make the decision process for work assignments more transparent and limit a manager’s discretion in making arbitrary or unfair decisions. As such, an employee’s suggestion could be designed to address future mistreatment while also helping the organization to run more efficiently. Conversely, consider a situation where a recently tenured faculty member files a grievance against the university regarding the tenure process. Although this faculty member has already been awarded tenure, he or she elects to file a grievance to help stimulate a fairer tenure process that will help other faculty and the university overall. How do these dual motives play a role in the determinants of voice? Will the pattern of determinants change as a consequence of there being a focus on both justice-oriented and prosocial elements? We argue that the determinants for both foci of voice could play a determinant, possibly additive, role in situations like these.</p>
<p>It should be noted that the prosocial element surrounding whistle-blowing often takes the form of “principled dissent” designed to correct inappropriate or questionable behavior within the organization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0149206311423823">Graham, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr106-0149206311423823">Shahinpoor &amp; Matt, 2007</xref>). We would suggest that although “principled dissent” can be designed to achieve benefits for others within the organization, its determinants are likely to follow the pattern observed for justice-oriented voice. The focus is not on suggesting improvements that benefit the entire work unit or organization but rather correcting bad actions or bad actors, while imposing costs. Furthermore, by imposing costs on some, this form of voice is likely to increase the risks associated with engaging in this form of voice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0149206311423823">Gundlach et al., 2003</xref>). However, the desire to correct the actions or actors is likely to stem from opposition to the behavior observed as opposed to dissatisfaction with some aspect of the job. Clearly, then, there are likely to be instances where justice-oriented voice is linked to a prosocial motive. But when this linkage is observed, the pattern of determinants is likely to be consistent with the pattern observed when voice is simply focused on a justice-orientation, because of the assessment of risks and costs associated with the voice behavior.</p>
<p>A self-promotional focus may also be relevant. Although prosocial voice is typically viewed as a form of citizenship behavior, it may also be influenced by a self-promotional motive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0149206311423823">Bolino, 1999</xref>). Prosocial voice allows individuals to demonstrate their value by offering ways to improve organizational processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr126-0149206311423823">Van Dyne &amp; LePine, 1998</xref>). It allows individuals to demonstrate their understanding of key processes and their ability to develop innovative ideas. Efforts to offer constructive suggestions may thus be driven by a desire to be recognized for having competencies and skills that are important to the organization.</p>
<p>We argue that when prosocial voice is linked to a self-promotional motive, the pattern of determinants might differ from what might be observed when prosocial voice occurs in its pure form. We noted earlier that prosocial voice is likely to be strongly affected by variables related to job satisfaction, affective commitment, and loyalty (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0149206311423823">Burris et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr91-0149206311423823">Olson-Buchanan &amp; Boswell, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr111-0149206311423823">Tangirala &amp; Ramanujam, 2008b</xref>). We argue that the impact of these variables will decline when there is both a prosocial and self-promotional motive. When self-promotional motives are present, greater consideration is likely to be given to how the message will be viewed and interpreted. Indeed, even those less satisfied or less committed may be willing to offer voice if a self-promotional motive exists and leader receptivity to input is high.</p>
<p>It is also important to consider the potential political aspects of prosocial voice. Constructive ideas and suggestions will not necessarily benefit every stakeholder within the organization. Some organizational members may actually be harmed by the employee’s suggestion. Consider, for example, suggestions about how budgets could be cut or even how the organization could be run more efficiently (e.g., eliminating particular jobs). Voice, under this scenario, becomes part of a political process where conflicts of interest exist between segments of the organization. Because of differing goals and objectives within the firm, there will be circumstances where voice that is seen as prosocial for some employees or units will be seen as harmful by others. Thus, just as voice can be prosocial and self-promotional, it also can be prosocial and political.</p>
<p>When voice is both prosocial and political, the determinants may differ from what would be observed when examining prosocial voice in its pure form in that consideration is likely to be given both to the way in which the organization will benefit and who is likely to be harmed. When viewed from a political framework, organizations contain alliances and coalitions, and individual self-interest is often advanced by promoting the interest of the alliances or coalitions with which one is affiliated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0149206311423823">Hammond, 1986</xref>). Thus, when prosocial voice is political in nature, new variables are likely to emerge as influential in determining the use of voice. Although leader openness to input has been found to be relevant in determining prosocial voice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0149206311423823">Detert &amp; Burris, 2007</xref>), in this case, openness of those within one’s coalition or alliance to the idea or suggestion may be even more critical in determining voice. Where there is both a prosocial and political motive, the impact of variables such as job satisfaction, affective commitment, and loyalty is likely to decline because the pursuit of self-interest will lead individuals to use voice of this type when the interests of one’s coalition is advanced—regardless of satisfaction or commitment.</p>
<p>The potential for mixed motives is also introduced by potential relational motives in the use of voice, as discussed within the procedural justice literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr121-0149206311423823">Tyler &amp; Blader, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr122-0149206311423823">Tyler &amp; Lind, 1992</xref>). Voice has been found to affect the perceived fairness of decisions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0149206311423823">Blancero &amp; Dyer, 1996</xref>), in part because the opportunity for voice affirms one’s status within the group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0149206311423823">Lind, Kanfer, &amp; Early, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0149206311423823">Lind &amp; Tyler, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr120-0149206311423823">Tyler, 1987</xref>). As such, it is possible that individuals use voice because it allows them to feel like a valid and respected member of the group. When the focus for voice incorporates a relational element, it is likely that factors that make voice seem likely to harm one’s status within the group are more salient. That is, the decision to use voice is likely to be negatively influenced by factors that would result in voice being seen as provocative or costly to key group members.</p>
<p>Within the workplace, voice can vary substantially in terms of its focus, and differences in focus are likely to affect what determines whether voice is actually used. As noted above, the literature has given substantial attention to the difference between voice with a prosocial focus and voice with a justice-oriented focus. Such attention can be justified by the fact that there are likely to be many instances where voice is singularly focused, with either a prosocial or justice orientation, and the pattern of determinants differs substantially. However, it should be noted that, although not specifically addressed in the literature, voice focus will sometimes be more complex than assumed within the literature when a mixed motive is observed. Complexity is further added by the fact that there are likely several different mixed motive scenarios. When justice-oriented voice is linked to a prosocial orientation, it is likely that this linkage will not alter the pattern of determinants typically expected when voice is solely justice oriented. However, in other instances, the nature of the mixed motive will alter the expected pattern of determinants.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section16-0149206311423823">
<title>Voice identifiability</title>
<p>Finally, a third dimension by which voice varies is whether the sender of the message can be identified. Although the distinction between identifiable and anonymous voice has received limited attention, we argue this dimension is likely to play a critical role in affecting the pattern of determinants for alternative forms of workplace voice. Most voice that has been studied is identifiable, including voice exercised by directly speaking to the relevant manager about a suggestion or concern (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr126-0149206311423823">Van Dyne &amp; LePine, 1998</xref>) and using a system where the employee’s ideas or concerns, as well as identity, are formally recorded (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0149206311423823">Fleishman &amp; Harris, 1962</xref>). Although research on anonymous voice is limited (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0149206311423823">Elliston, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0149206311423823">Kaplan et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr83-0149206311423823">Miceli et al., 1988</xref>), organizations frequently introduce systems that allow for anonymous voice. Hotlines and employee surveys are designed to allow employees to anonymously make constructive suggestions and raise concerns about policies. Similarly, some organizations have processes for suggestion systems and whistle-blowing that allow for issues to be raised anonymously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr83-0149206311423823">Miceli et al., 1988</xref>). Even where the organization does not have a specific system for anonymous voice, employees have the (unsolicited) opportunity to send messages and written notes without revealing their identity. Bad-mouthing a manager to a third party may also be viewed as a form of anonymous voice, as it is designed to use informal networks to send messages of disapproval and to signal a need for change (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr118-0149206311423823">Tripp &amp; Bies, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Anonymous voice is clearly a viable option for offering suggestions and raising concerns about managerial behavior or organizational policy that more broadly affects employees in the organization (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0149206311423823">Kaplan et al., 2009</xref>). Although hotlines or similar forums are limited in their capacity to retain anonymity while addressing concerns specific to an individual, they still provide an employee concerned about individual mistreatment with a mechanism by which to restore justice. If an individual perceives mistreatment, he or she can use a hotline to report managerial behavior—even behavior that is unrelated to the perceived mistreatment. By creating difficulty for the manager, the employee may restore justice by way of retribution. As noted earlier, some prosocial suggestions have political implications where the implementation of an employee’s suggestion could have negative consequences for others in the organization. As such, these types of suggestions would likely be strong determinants of anonymous voice because the individual making the suggestion would be less likely to incur political consequences.</p>
<p>However, there are limits on the utility associated with anonymous voice. Anonymous voice may be limited in its capacity to provide for restitution for a specific act of employee mistreatment. Similarly, anonymous voice does not always provide for an easy way to ensure a full exchange of ideas and knowledge sharing, and, related to this, it may prove difficult to share a complex suggestion that does not reveal one’s identity. These limits are particularly relevant in assessing whether the determinants of anonymous voice would differ from identifiable voice. Anonymous voice is typically chosen as an alternative to identifiable voice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr83-0149206311423823">Miceli et al., 1988</xref>). As such, it is necessary to consider factors likely to encourage the use of voice as well as factors that would encourage anonymous rather than identifiable voice.</p>
<p>Differences between identifiable and anonymous voice are likely to affect what factors are critical in determining these two categories of voice. Identifiable voice requires that the individual speak up in meetings or conversation or formally challenge ideas and decisions of organizational leaders (i.e., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0149206311423823">LePine &amp; Van Dyne, 1998</xref>). Thus, it is assumed that there is a natural reluctance to exercise voice. As such, many of the factors identified within the literature on identifiable voice function to reduce this natural reluctance including trait-like characteristics such as self-esteem, extroversion, and proactivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0149206311423823">LePine &amp; Van Dyne, 1998</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0149206311423823">2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr94-0149206311423823">Parker &amp; Collins, 2010</xref>). They also include leadership behavior that affects perceptions regarding openness to input and, ultimately, psychological safety (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0149206311423823">Detert &amp; Burris, 2007</xref>), as well as procedural protections from negative managerial reactions to voice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr80-0149206311423823">Miceli &amp; Near, 1989</xref>).</p>
<p>By contrast, with anonymous voice there is little accountability with regard to what is stated in any voice message. Individuals who use anonymous voice are unlikely to be confronted with the need to justify or defend ideas or comments made. This lack of accountability may limit the natural reluctance to engage in voice and, in turn, how employees determine whether to make use of voice. Because anonymous voice is chosen as an alternative to identifiable voice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr83-0149206311423823">Miceli et al., 1988</xref>), we suggest that traits such as self-esteem and extroversion will be negatively related to the use of anonymous voice. Low levels of self-esteem and extroversion will serve as a barrier to the use of identifiable voice, leading individuals to consider the anonymous voice alternative. The lack of accountability may also alter the impact associated with other trait-like characteristics. For example, although neuroticism was found to be negatively related to certain forms of identifiable voice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0149206311423823">LePine &amp; Van Dyne, 2001</xref>), a positive relationship is likely to be observed with anonymous voice. Individuals high in neuroticism are more likely to experience anger and frustration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr116-0149206311423823">Tong, 2010</xref>), and anonymous voice (with its lack of accountability) may provide an attractive way to express negative emotional reactions to events within the workplace. However, it is important to point out that there may be a reluctance to use anonymous voice as well, such as when an employee is motivated by self-promotion (i.e., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0149206311423823">Bolino, 1999</xref>).</p>
<p>Leader openness and psychological safety are also likely to operate differently with anonymous voice. Openness is thought to be important for identifiable voice both because it is suggestive as to whether input will be seriously considered and also because of its relevance for perceptions regarding psychological safety (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0149206311423823">Detert &amp; Burris, 2007</xref>). But if voice is anonymous, concerns about psychological safety are likely to be less relevant. Indeed, it may be that a negative relationship is likely to emerge between anonymous voice and leader openness and psychological safety. Where openness and psychological safety are low, employees seeking to provide input or raise concerns may be attracted to the use of anonymous voice. Such a prediction is based on the assumption that anonymous voice will not be the option of choice when openness and safety are high. Similarly, factors that offer protection from negative reactions to voice were found to be relevant for certain forms of identifiable voice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr82-0149206311423823">Miceli et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr80-0149206311423823">Miceli &amp; Near, 1989</xref>), presumably because they reduce the risks associated with speaking up. However, factors such as procedural protection from retaliation, the availability of employment alternatives, and management’s dependence on labor all are likely to operate differently with anonymous voice. When an employee does not benefit from any of these protections, he or she may be attracted to the lack of accountability associated with anonymous voice. As a consequence, vulnerability to negative reactions to the use of voice is likely to be positively related to the use of anonymous voice.</p>

<title>Implications</title>
<p>After reviewing the literature on the determinants of alternative forms of voice, it is clear that some forms of voice have been extensively examined whereas others have received relatively sparse attention. It is also clear that many questions remain regarding why employees make use of different forms of voice and how managerial behavior and organizational practices and policies might affect the actual use of voice within the workplace. In this section, we discuss critical questions raised by this review as well as important considerations for future research.</p>
<p>Although there appear to be some commonalities in determinants across the forms of voice, it is also evident that there will be some unique determinants as well. We argued that differences emerge because these alternative forms of voice vary on critical dimensions relating to the structure and purpose of voice. Although the pattern of findings within the literature provides support for this general argument, the specific role played by the dimensions identified above deserves significant attention in future research, as do some other key areas described below.</p>
<sec id="section18-0149206311423823">
<title>Voice Identifiability</title>
<p>First, consider voice identifiability. Both anonymous and identifiable voice have been examined in the literature, with the results highlighting the potential relevance of this dimension (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr83-0149206311423823">Miceli et al., 1988</xref>). However, several key arguments made here regarding the potential impact of this dimension remain unexamined. We argued that many of the factors that have been found to play a critical role in determining identifiable voice may play a very different role with regard to anonymous voice. The differences proposed suggest that there may be conditions under which anonymous voice may serve as a viable forum for voice even when an employee would be reluctant to use identifiable voice. However, research to date has not yet examined how anonymity affects the role played by trait-like characteristics, leader openness, psychological safety, or procedural or labor market factors that offer protection from retaliation. Thus, much remains to be known about the actual viability of improving overall opportunities for voice by emphasizing anonymous forms of voice. Indeed, relatively little research attention was given to processes or factors that would be uniquely important for anonymous voice.</p>
<p>Future research might well benefit from exploring determinants that would emerge because of the lack of accountability associated with using this form of voice. Motivation related to revenge or retribution may be more dominant here. Because there are fewer constraints on what is said when the identity of the source is not revealed, individuals may be more willing to offer comments (valid or not) designed primarily to embarrass organizational officials and/or to consume managerial time and energy in conducting whatever investigation is deemed appropriate. Research might well benefit from examining whether factors identified within the existing literature on revenge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0149206311423823">Aquino, Tripp, &amp; Bies, 2006</xref>) are likely to play a more dominant role in determining the use of anonymous versus identifiable voice.</p>
<p>Research might also benefit from examining how the substance of an employee’s concern affects the use of anonymous voice. Where the concerns addressed are such that they will likely allow for anonymity to be retained, willingness to use this form of voice will likely be greater. However, little is known about how employees evaluate whether to use anonymous voice when raising a concern that at least partially threatens their anonymity. In some cases, the nature of the concerns provides partial cues as to the identity of the messenger, or an investigation into claims would provide cues pointing to those responsible for the investigation. How does the structure of the process or perceptions of skip level managers affect the willingness to use anonymous voice when the concerns raised may provide clues to the identity of the messenger?</p>
<p>Other factors that may be particularly important relate to the credibility of the anonymous voice mechanism or the receiver of the anonymous informal voice (e.g., unsigned note or voicemail). Because of the anonymous nature of voice, employees are often not in a position to participate in deliberations regarding the issue or to defend claims made within the initial voice message. Anonymity may also limit open discussion among employees regarding how the process has been used over time or how certain managers have responded to anonymous voice in the past. As such, procedural features of a mechanism or perceptions of the integrity of a receiver may play a particularly important role in determining perceptions regarding credibility of the anonymous voice. Our understanding of the determinants of alternative forms of voice may, thus, benefit from research examining how the willingness to use anonymous voice is affected by features designed to ensure full and deliberative evaluation of messages—even in the absence of the involvement of the individual who raised the specific concern.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section19-0149206311423823">
<title>Formality of Voice</title>
<p>Our understanding of the determinants of voice would benefit from further research examining why formality has the impact that it does and the conditions under which an effect is most likely to be observed. Research has demonstrated the role of satisfaction, commitment, and loyalty change when an employee considers formal voice as opposed to informal voice in response to perceived mistreatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-0149206311423823">Luchak, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr90-0149206311423823">Olson-Buchanan, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr91-0149206311423823">Olson-Buchanan &amp; Boswell, 2002</xref>); however, it is unknown why this effect is observed. Are employees who are highly satisfied and committed simply unwilling to use voice when it might be construed as more confrontational? Or does the more positive relationship that they have with the firm allow for more productive, informal discussions and incur fewer costs to the involved parties? Does this pattern of productive, informal discussions, in turn, reduce the perceived need for formal processes, leading them to conclude that they will ultimately be able to address unresolved issues through continued use of informal voice? If the former explanation is correct, it suggests that the most loyal and committed employees are unwilling to fully utilize the processes available to them to address workplace conflict, perhaps a suboptimal outcome. If this is true, then it becomes important to understand whether any type of formal voice mechanism would be appealing or viable for these employees when addressing perceived mistreatment.</p>
<p>Very often, processes for formal voice to address perceived mistreatment are structured in a somewhat adversarial and public fashion, with one party making accusations against another (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0149206311423823">Bemmels &amp; Foley, 1996</xref>). However, formal systems can be structured in different ways, and the literature would benefit from efforts to understand whether different structures would result in even highly satisfied, committed, and loyal employees being willing to use formal voice. For example, where ombuds are used, processes are less adversarial, with emphasis given to understanding the basis for the disagreement and arriving at a mutually beneficial resolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0149206311423823">Kolb, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr102-0149206311423823">Rowat, 2007</xref>). Similarly, mediation programs are sometimes used, where third parities focus on exploring the basis for the conflict and options that would allow each party to achieve an acceptable outcome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0149206311423823">Amadei &amp; Lehrburger, 1996</xref>).</p>
<p>Would such systems reduce the apparent reluctance of satisfied and committed employees to use justice-oriented voice? Such systems still involve communicating the presence or existence of a dispute, thus ensuring others within the organization are aware that a policy or decision is being challenged. Furthermore, they still involve some escalation of conflict with one’s manager. However, such systems do not require that an employee make public specific claims. Statements about the specifics of the dispute can be addressed within the context of the informal discussions that occur as part of the mediation or ombuds process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0149206311423823">Kolb, 1987</xref>). Furthermore, the decision about how to proceed remains within the involved parties, as solutions are not imposed. Such decisions emerge out of efforts to ensure open communication regarding the substance of the conflict. Research to date examining the difference between formal and informal voice has examined more adversarial types of formal voice. The literature would clearly benefit from research examining whether the previously described effect associated with formality remains when the formal system employs mechanisms that are less adversarial in nature.</p>

<sec id="section20-0149206311423823">
<title>Voice Focus</title>
<p>The focus of voice is still another dimension proposed to have relevance for our understanding of what determines the usage of alternative forms of voice. Although the pattern of findings suggests the processes that determine voice will change as we move from prosocial to justice-oriented voice, research to date is silent on the reason for this difference. Are differences observed because the risks associated with prosocial voice differ from the risks associated with justice-oriented voice? Or do determinants differ because the underlying motivational basis differs between prosocial and justice-oriented voice? Related to this, our understanding of the processes that lead to voice would benefit from research that explores the role of mixed motives. To date, research has assumed singular motives associated with the different foci of voice. Yet mixed motives are likely to be common, and little is known about how such mixed motives might affect how employees approach decisions about whether to use voice.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section21-0149206311423823">
<title>Underexamined Determinants</title>
<p>Earlier we identified several categories of determinants and examined the degree to which variables relating to each category have been found to affect different forms of voice. This allowed us to observe whether patterns emerge across different forms of voice. It also allowed us to observe where our understanding of critical processes or factors is lacking for particular types of voice. For example, research on voice that is prosocial, informal, and identifiable has done much to examine how leader behavior can affect perceptions of psychological safety and, in turn, usage of voice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0149206311423823">Detert &amp; Burris, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr128-0149206311423823">Walumbwa &amp; Schaubroeck, 2009</xref>). Yet far less is known about the conditions necessary for encouraging perceptions of safety with regard to other forms of voice. It is unclear, for example, whether leader openness to suggestions regarding process improvements would also affect perceptions regarding support for whistle-blowing, particularly given the employee is reporting behavior that violates organizational or regulatory policy.</p>
<p>Similarly, some forms of justice-oriented voice (e.g., formal and identifiable) are likely to be seen as confrontational, as the employee is claiming mistreatment. Here, too, it is unclear whether leader openness regarding process issues would affect perceptions among employees regarding supervisor tolerance of justice-oriented voice. This then leads to questions about whether there are policies and certain types of managerial behaviors that contribute to perceptions regarding acceptance of these other, seemingly riskier, forms of voice. At first blush, it does not appear that the methods used to enhance informal, prosocial voice would necessarily work with other forms of voice. For example, although leaders can take steps to praise those who use prosocial voice, opportunities may arise less frequently for justice-oriented voice given that confidentiality concerns may sometimes limit opportunities for public discussion.</p>
<p>This highlights the potential relevance of explicit protections from retaliation for those considering the use of voice. Explicit policies relating to retaliation have been found to be effective in encouraging whistle-blowing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr82-0149206311423823">Miceli et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr80-0149206311423823">Miceli &amp; Near, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr88-0149206311423823">Near et al., 1993</xref>). Although retaliation policies are sometimes observed in organizations that offer formal justice-oriented voice mechanisms, whether such policies serve to encourage such voice has not been explicitly examined. More broadly, limited attention has been given to factors that affect the extent to which the employee sees himself or herself as vulnerable to retaliation for exercising voice, particularly voice that is seen as involving substantial risk for the employee.</p>
<p>The need to examine the relevance of such vulnerability to retaliation is particularly relevant given that the literature examining justice-oriented and formal voice has primarily focused on grievance behavior in union settings (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0149206311423823">Boroff &amp; Lewin, 1997</xref>). Within this context, the union plays a key role in helping to reduce perceptions regarding vulnerability to retaliation. The grievance process itself can be used to raise the costs to management associated with retaliation for exercising voice. However, it is less clear what factors are most influential within the nonunion sector in reducing perceptions regarding vulnerability to retaliation for the use of justice-oriented, formal voice. The roles played by labor market power and procedural protections remain unexplored but offer promising areas for future research.</p>
<p>Perception of long-term safety is another unexplored area of research. Within the nonunion context, is it feasible to encourage certain types of voice among those who are highly dependent on senior managers for future discretionary rewards. For employees who anticipate competing for promotion and discretionary rewards, can organizations reduce perceptions of vulnerability to the point where they would be willing to use justice-oriented, formal voice? Indeed, perhaps that is why previous research has found employees with lower turnover intentions are less likely to use formal justice-oriented voice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0149206311423823">Fleishman &amp; Harris, 1962</xref>). For such employees, if concerns cannot be resolved via informal processes, will formal voice be seen as too risky, almost independent of organizational policies and initiatives? This, then, suggests the possibility that for justice-oriented, formal voice, characteristics relating to the future employment status of the employee will serve as critical determinants.</p>
<p>A final unexplored area of research relates to whether social media and new communication technologies change how different forms of voice are viewed both by employees and organizations. Such technology has made it increasingly easier for complaints to be registered, even by multiple individuals simultaneously (not always with the complainant’s consent or knowledge, as in the case of forwarded e-mails). It has also made it easier to share suggestions or complaints anonymously, which may be particularly appealing to employees who are concerned about retaliation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr118-0149206311423823">Tripp &amp; Bies, 2009</xref>). Furthermore, the lack of face-to-face interaction may reduce constraints on the willingness to share information and concerns. As a consequence of communication technology, norms within organizations about the appropriateness of submitting concerns to skip-level managers may be changing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0149206311423823">Blair, 2010</xref>). New communication norms may reduce the extent to which raising concerns with multiple levels of managers is seen as provocative or an escalation of the conflict. To the extent, then, that organizations rely on emerging forms of media for employee voice (both formal and informal), the impact of the dimensions identified above may be reduced or enhanced as a consequence of changing norms.</p>
<p>We should also consider social media as a form of voice where employees can express concerns about their employer more broadly within the community. Such voice can be characterized as justice oriented in that the employee is seeking to restore justice by using voice as revenge. Harming the reputation and image of the employer in the community may be seen as a way to impose costs on the employer and achieve some level of retributive justice. These forms of voice are particularly relevant in light of a recent ruling by the National Labor Relations Board protecting communication about workplace concerns on social media and in light of the potential for such communication to go viral (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0149206311423823">Gupta, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr98-0149206311423823">Pyrillis, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr118-0149206311423823">Tripp &amp; Bies, 2009</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section22-0149206311423823">
<title>Considering the Dark Side of Voice</title>
<p>Implicit in much of the literature on voice is the assumption that voice is functional for the organization. As discussed above, the potential exists for workplace voice to allow for information sharing and improved processes as well as to serve as an alternative to more disruptive responses to conflict and perceived unfairness. Understanding the determinants of voice, then, has value if it creates awareness of how barriers to voice can be minimized and how firms can facilitate the usage of voice. It should be noted, however, that although voice is likely to often be functional for organizations, consideration should also be given to the ways in which voice can be counterproductive and what factors may lead to voice that is designed to be counterproductive. As noted above, justice-oriented voice includes voice attempting to rectify perceived mistreatment as well as voice that attempts to restore justice by causing problems for others in the organization. Voice can be used to make baseless allegations or raise concerns that will cause difficulties for the manager involved or the organization more generally. The allegations may be unrelated to actual issues of concern. Indeed, voice in this instance is not used to rectify specific concerns and instead is designed largely to cause embarrassment and irritation or consume resources. Thus, it becomes feasible for voice to be used as a form of revenge or retribution for other actions or decisions that the employee finds objectionable.</p>
<p>The revenge literature suggests that when employees are angered by some action taken by managerial action or treatment, there are likely to be instances where constructive problem solving is not seen as a viable option. How employees will respond to such circumstances varies, with forgiveness cognitions formed in some instances and revenge cognitions formed in others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0149206311423823">Bies, Tripp, &amp; Kramer, 1997</xref>). These forgiveness and revenge cognitions are, in turn, strongly related to actual forgiveness and revenge behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0149206311423823">Bradfield &amp; Aquino, 1999</xref>). This literature also suggests that employees are sensitive to the costs of engaging in revenge, with forgiveness being pursued more frequently when the costs of revenge are high (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0149206311423823">Aquino et al., 2006</xref>). With regard to the use of voice as revenge, it is likely that employees will be sensitive to the costs. Since the risks and costs associated with using voice often vary with the type of voice, it is likely that differences will be observed in the role of revenge across the forms of voice. For example, with anonymous voice, employees are not held accountable for claims made, allowing for claims that may not be valid or that may not be related to the actual source of employee concern. When organizations introduce systems for anonymous voice, they are reducing the costs associated with one form of revenge. Because the employee has easy access to at least one low-cost mechanism for revenge, he or she is more likely to engage in revenge cognitions and, in turn, more likely to use voice in a way that is designed to be counterproductive.</p>
<p>Other situations exist where voice may be designed largely to be counterproductive, situations where even the costs of counterproductive voice are low. In the unionized sector, the complexity of the collective bargaining contract makes it feasible to identify potential contract violations—violations that are not necessarily of concern to employees. As such, where significant conflict exists, the grievance process can be used to raise concerns about a multitude of possible contract violations—even those that are of little concern to the employees. The nature of the collective bargaining contract and the protections offered to employees within a unionized environment may reduce the perceived costs of using voice as revenge or as a bargaining chip when negotiating about issues of greater concern to employees. Voice as a form of revenge or retribution can also be observed in other contexts as well, even when examining voice that might otherwise be classified as prosocial. Consider situations where the employees see themselves as protected because of the critical nature of their skills or the presence of procedural protections. Once again, if the employee sees few costs associated with using voice, it becomes feasible to use voice as revenge or retribution. This could include voice that challenges a superior purely in an effort to embarrass, or it could include voice that claims mistreatment about issues that do not significantly concern the employee. In all these instances, the motivation is primarily one of revenge and thus, fundamentally, is designed by the employee to be counterproductive.</p>
<p>Although it is important to acknowledge the potential for voice to be used in ways that are designed to be counterproductive, it is also important to acknowledge that little is actually known about the extent to which this occurs or what conditions lead to such voice. The literature on revenge has outlined many factors associated with revenge cognitions and revenge behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0149206311423823">Aquino et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0149206311423823">Bies et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0149206311423823">Bradfield &amp; Aquino, 1999</xref>). What remains unclear, however, is how those factors operate within the context of voice, a context where opportunities exist to modify and change managerial behavior that led to the desire for revenge. Also, little is known about the degree to which voice that is designed to be counterproductive is actually harmful to the organization. Although there are inevitably costs associated with the processing and investigation of voice designed to be counterproductive, it remains unclear whether using such voice for revenge ultimately allows for reconciliation. Does the opportunity to restore some sense of justice via the use of counterproductive voice make it easier for the employee to subsequently reconcile with relevant managers? Or does the formation of revenge cognitions and subsequent revenge behavior create a downward spiral, making it more difficult for the employee to subsequently form forgiveness cognitions and engage in reconciliation efforts?</p>
<p>Within the procedural justice literature, voice has been found to enhance fairness perceptions regarding a decision even when the exercise of voice occurred after a decision and was not considered as a decision was being made (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0149206311423823">Lind et al., 1990</xref>). The act of expressing voice has a value-expressive impact. It affirms the individual’s status within the organization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0149206311423823">Avery &amp; Quinones, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr96-0149206311423823">Platow, Filardo, Troself, Grace, &amp; Ryan, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr121-0149206311423823">Tyler &amp; Blader, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr122-0149206311423823">Tyler &amp; Lind, 1992</xref>). Although such findings highlight the potential for even voice designed to be counterproductive to affect fairness perceptions and the potential for reconciliation, there are limits on our ability to generalize from procedural justice research to the settings being examined here. For example, one form of counterproductive voice discussed here was anonymous, and anonymity may prevent affirmation of status from occurring. Thus, it remains very possible that the formation of revenge cognitions and subsequent revenge behavior make it more difficult for the employee to subsequently form forgiveness cognitions and engage in reconciliation efforts.</p>
<p>In discussing factors that may inhibit or encourage different forms of voice in the workplace, it is important to acknowledge that much remains to be learned about the actual consequences of different forms of voice. How we view initiatives or practices designed to address barriers to voice may well be informed by our understanding of the consequences associated with voice in its various forms. For example, the availability of anonymous voice might be viewed as a viable mechanism by which to address barriers observed with other forms of voice. However, the availability of this form of voice also offers a path for the expression of voice designed to be counterproductive. Whether the organization ultimately benefits from making available such voice mechanisms requires that research also explore the consequences associated with alternative forms of voice.</p>

<sec id="section23-0149206311423823">
<title>Summary</title>
<p>From an organizational perspective, clearly much is likely to be gained from efforts to expand our understanding of what determines the use of alternative forms of voice. In particular, research that examines the underlying dimensions of various forms of voice will serve to help us better understand why employees choose to voice and consequently help us better understand how to broaden the appeal and usage of voice. Such research has the potential to develop an understanding of how leadership behavior and organizational policies and practices might lead to increased use and benefits of workplace voice to organizations. However, important questions are also raised with regard to the consequences of voice, highlighting the need for the literature to include within its focus attention to the link between why voice is used and the impact on subsequent behavior and attitudes.</p>
