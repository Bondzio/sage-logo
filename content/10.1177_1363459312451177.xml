<abstract>
<p>This ethnographic study, based on empirical work carried out in an Israeli rehabilitation hospital, discusses the physical rehabilitation of lower limb amputees, during which body normalcy is re-constructed. Throughout the process, physiotherapists serve as social agents who teach pragmatic and discursive practices to manage the body as well as the prosthesis in the re-cultivation of body techniques. The findings, portraying four spheres of meaning, show that the mere use of prosthesis is insufficient since it stigmatizes the body as absent a limb. To avoid such stigmatization, the staff teach compensatory and discursive skills which enable incorporation of the prosthesis in body techniques while referring to it as a biological leg. Constructed as a ‘social organ’, the device is gradually transformed from an extension to an integral part of the body. Disability and its remedies, thereby concealed, facilitate able-bodied performance. Paradoxically, the prosthesis, though meant to benefit patients, induces pain and discomfort, a fact that challenges the acceptance of its conventionality as a medical aid for amputees. Yet, physical rehabilitation by means of prosthetics remains one of the many medical practices in Israel that ensure a disability-free society, together with the promotion of rights to accessibility and anti-discrimination regulation. The study contributes to the theoretical debate regarding the relationship between the biological and the social in disability studies. The findings indicate the need to encompass the cultural and the corporeal when exploring disability. The ethnography of disability, I suggest, should be viewed as a juncture of socio-cultural perceptions of the body, embedded in its own corporeal constraints.</p>

<p>In recent years we have witnessed the proliferation of sociological research carried on in biomedical settings. Yet, relatively little has been written on physical rehabilitation even though it is a core intersection of cultural ideas regarding the body and disability. In this article I propose an analytical account of physical rehabilitation of lower-limb amputees by delving into the professional practices that reconstruct body normalcy. I explore how physical therapists teach pragmatic and discursive practices to manage the body as well as the prosthesis in the re-cultivation of body techniques. These practices, portrayed as four spheres of meaning, reflect and revalidate cultural ideals of the (dis)abled body while challenging the conventions of prosthesis use.</p>

<title>An able body for an able nation</title>
<p>Notions of disability as well as able-bodiedness reflect an array of beliefs, processes and practices that produce a certain kind of body (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1363459312451177">Moss and Dyck, 2003</xref>). In western societies, of which Israel is generally considered to be a part, the ideal body image is constructed as young, healthy and, most importantly, externally intact (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1363459312451177">Elias, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1363459312451177">Shilling, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1363459312451177">Turner, 1996</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1363459312451177">Williams, 1998</xref>). These perceptions are constantly reinforced by advances in biomedical technologies as well as the dynamics of the consumer economy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1363459312451177">Featherstone, 2010</xref>). In light of these developments, amputation conveys cultural meanings beyond its bio-medical definition of ‘removal of an external part of the body, most often a limb or a part of a limb’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1363459312451177">Whyte and Carroll, 2002</xref>: 462). The irreversible rupture of external body boundaries is problematic functionally as well as aesthetically; hence, the contention of amputation as ‘archetypal impairment’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1363459312451177">Manderson and Warren, 2010</xref>). In <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1363459312451177">Goffman’s (1972</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1363459312451177">1986</xref>) terminology this is ‘abomination of the body’, a cause for stigmatization concluding in discrimination and social discreditation. Being a hyper-visual impairment, amputation exacerbates exclusion of amputees from the world of the ‘able-bodied’, who are now ‘repressed from public view and forgotten’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1363459312451177">Siebers, 2004</xref>: 6).</p>
<p>When reviewing the Israeli cultural context, these ideas acquire special impetus. The Israeli state was established on the foundations of Zionism, an ideology that glorified the tough-skinned native-born ‘<italic>tzabar</italic>’ and the pioneer. These embodiments represented a mirror image of the weak and persecuted Diaspora Jew, now modeled as the strong, active soldier, a conqueror and defender of the land (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1363459312451177">Almog, 1997</xref>). Following <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1363459312451177">Douglas (1996)</xref>, these body images reflect the rebirth of a social body prepared to struggle for its survival. The Zionist body, like the ‘Fordist body’, was judged in terms of productivity, competence and functionality – major criteria for determining and measuring disability in western societies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1363459312451177">Jorgensen, 2000</xref>). In consequence, all people considered unfit for productive tasks – the sick, old and disabled – were excluded from consideration as potential citizens and often denied their right to immigrate to the budding state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1363459312451177">Mor, 2007</xref>). This policy has led the Israeli government to support advanced pre-natal technologies in order to ensure the ‘quality’ of children parallel to permitting abortion of defective fetuses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1363459312451177">Ha’elyon, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1363459312451177">Hashiloni-Dolev, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>This socio-historical background frames the findings and adds some insights regarding the meaning of rehabilitation in the Israeli context.</p>

<sec id="section2-1363459312451177">
<title>Lost body techniques and physical rehabilitation</title>
<p>The current study explores the third of the nine phases of rehabilitation – ‘prosthetic training’ – which centers on adjustment to prosthetic limbs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1363459312451177">Esquenazi, 2004</xref>). Prostheses, which are basically leg-shaped devices, have benefited from technological advances introduced to meet functional as well esthetical needs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1363459312451177">Haiken, 2002</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1363459312451177">1</xref></sup> These aids are targeted to facilitate the restoration of one’s ‘most lost functions, in order to bring him back to work, to a productive life and to various social arenas as soon as possible’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1363459312451177">Ori, 1990</xref>: 217).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1363459312451177">2</xref></sup> Physical therapy accordingly leads patients to a ‘resumption of roles in family and community activities … and recreational activities’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1363459312451177">Esquenazi, 2004</xref>: 833). These goals are resonant in the Hebrew word for rehabilitation (<italic>shikoom</italic>), a noun rooted in the descriptive verb ‘getting up’ (<italic>koom</italic>), which is defined as ‘the action of raising, building, returning to one’s strength and to previous condition’. The Hebrew term differs from the English (rehabilitation) and the French (<italic>rééducation</italic>) by emphasizing the return to one’s previous condition as well as to physical activities. With respect to social theory, these activities, such as moving or standing, can be described as <italic>body techniques</italic>, a concept coined by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1363459312451177">Mauss (1973)</xref> to depict socially accepted body habits and movements. In his words, these are: ‘(the) ways in which from society to society men know how to use their bodies’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1363459312451177">Mauss, 1973</xref>: 70). Among these body techniques, Mauss has given special attention to walking:<disp-quote>
<p>(t)he <italic>habitus</italic> of the body being upright while walking, breathing, rhythm of the walk, swinging the fists, the elbows, progression with the trunk in advance of the body or by advancing either side of the body alternately (we have got accustomed to moving all the body forward at once). Feet in or out. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1363459312451177">Mauss, 1973</xref>: 82, emphasis in original)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Body techniques are thus acquired by educating or training raw and ‘natural’ corporeality. Although obviously serving the goal of functionality, they are shaped by and reflect aesthetic ideas; that is, their exercise orients the body towards the moral order that they honor, reflect and reproduce (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1363459312451177">Crossley, 2005</xref>). As such, body techniques embody social constructs, including those of gender, class and age.</p>
<p>Further elaboration of these non-discursive aspects of culture can be found in the writings of Bourdieu and Elias. Bourdieu sees bodily gestures as predominantly configured by social structure – the habitus – and bodily orientation – or ‘<italic>hexis</italic>’ – meaning gestures that individuals acquire through their upbringing in a particular culture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1363459312451177">Bourdieu, 1977</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1363459312451177">1984</xref>). According to Bourdieu (in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1363459312451177">Weiss and Haber, 1999</xref>: 4), ‘bodily hexis’ is ‘political mythology realized, em-bodied, turned into a permanent disposition, a durable way of standing, speaking, walking and thereby of feeling or thinking’. It is from this perspective that <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1363459312451177">Elias (1994)</xref> portrays the evolvement of western societies’ <italic>manners</italic>, the refined and well-controlled codes of bodily behavior. Once shaped by culture, these ways of what I call <italic>techniquing</italic> the body reflect perception of ideal body images; they encompass premises of the body’s boundaries, according to which any deviation is a subject for treatment. Within this framework, amputation emerges ‘not as a difference to be accommodated but as a defect to be remedied through rehabilitation’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1363459312451177">Johnson, 2009</xref>: 44). ‘Body techniques’ are therefore pivotal for analyzing physical rehabilitation as a process preparing patients for their ‘return’ to society.</p>

<sec id="section3-1363459312451177">
<title>The normalization discourse and the (dis)abled body</title>
<p>The discussion of body techniques is deeply rooted in the conceptual framing of normalization. It was <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1363459312451177">Foucault (1980)</xref> who established the foundations for theories of normalization, a process in which the State employs various practices to produce docile, subjected and improved bodies. In this sense, both the ‘able’ as well as the ‘disabled’ body is discursively produced in medical institutions. These institutions exert bio-power in the sense that they function as intervention agents directed at subjecting bodies to bio-political normalizing practices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1363459312451177">Tremain, 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>However, this perspective disregards the sensuous materiality of the living body, which ultimately disappears (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1363459312451177">Siebers, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1363459312451177">Turner, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1363459312451177">Williams, 2006</xref>). If bodies are only representational products of social discourses and practices of ablement, the disabled subject effectively has no ‘body’. Yet, the body possesses ontological depth, corporeal enablements as well as constraints, neither reduceable to social discourse nor ignorable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1363459312451177">Shilling, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1363459312451177">Williams, 1999</xref>). Exploring disability merely as a discursive byproduct can therefore only facilitate the decoding of images of disability and thus makes the ethnography on this subject impossible or irrelevant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1363459312451177">Shakespeare and Watson, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1363459312451177">Turner, 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>The Foucauldian tradition has deeply influenced the terminology of disability-related issues. The ‘social model of disability’, for example, focuses on <italic>disability</italic>, meaning the oppressive and controlling society which excludes people with physical impairment. At the same time it disregards <italic>impairment</italic>, which is used to describe a corporeal body deficiency viewed as a medical problem (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1363459312451177">Oliver, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1363459312451177">Shakespeare, 2006</xref>). This distinction, however important, problematizes the reading of the term disability, which concludes in a ‘disembodied notion of disability’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1363459312451177">Hughes and Paterson, 1997</xref>: 330). Yet, focusing on the medically derived definition of impairment precludes the body’s cultural features and thereby reduces it to a pre-social biological entity. Hence, some authors have called for the development of sociology of impairment in order to explore the social construction of the impaired body (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1363459312451177">Hughes and Paterson, 1997</xref>). Alternatively, others have dwelled on the essential, pre-discursive features of the body, found in ‘critical realism’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1363459312451177">Williams, 2006</xref>) and the ‘ethnography of physicality’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1363459312451177">Shakespeare, 2006</xref>). In other words, a trend has emerged seeking new ways of conceptualizing the relationship between the biological and the social in disability-related studies.</p>
<p>In replying to these voices I wish to explore the physical rehabilitation of amputees by taking cultural and physical features of the body into account. Indeed, medical institutions may not <italic>create</italic> the body, but they do <italic>recreate</italic> some of its features through conceptualization and regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1363459312451177">Frank, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1363459312451177">Turner, 2000</xref>). A combined consideration of the cultural and corporeal body thus provides a more insightful framework for analyzing and theorizing the empirical data.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1363459312451177" sec-type="methods">
<title>Method</title>
<p>The data for this study were collected during ethnographic observations of sessions involving lower limb amputees and their physiotherapists. The medical encounters took place in a physiotherapy hall in an orthopedic ward of an Israeli rehabilitation hospital. My arrivals were planned according to a timetable of therapy sessions and lasted up to four hours, depending on the daily schedule.</p>
<p>Regarding the patients, amputees who had lost a lower limb; these men and women came from diverse backgrounds in terms of ethnicity, age, residential location, income, and so forth. Personal details of the patients, such as age and etiology of amputation, were transmitted to me by the staff. The research was restricted to acquired lower limb amputees because first, hands and legs are two culturally distinct phenomena and second, amputation involves the loss of a formerly existing organ, a context that differs from the congenital absence of a limb. The etiology of amputation ranged from accidents to vascular diseases and tumors. Amputations also differed in degree – from feet to through-hip amputation.</p>
<p>The setting, the physiotherapy hall, was a spacious room where various activities were conducted on a daily basis. The hall accommodated beds, gym balls and other athletic devices such as weights and practice mattresses as well as a 5-meter-long walking track with bars on both sides.</p>
<p>With respect to ethics, the study was approved by the hospital’s Helsinki Committee. In line with the ethnographic research methodology as well as the setting’s nature, all the patient names mentioned in the following are pseudonyms and all the physiotherapists will be referred to as the ‘physiotherapist’ or ‘therapist’.</p>
<p>The fieldwork’s location enabled realization of a major principle of qualitative research, specifically, access to the core of the process by means of close and unmediated observation of the participants’ words and actions in their natural setting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1363459312451177">Lincoln and Guba, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1363459312451177">Patton, 1998</xref>). Many writers have, furthermore, indicated the salience and importance of social research carried out in biomedical settings (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1363459312451177">Morris and Chenail, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1363459312451177">Pope, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1363459312451177">Warren and Manderson, 2008</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1363459312451177">Mattingly (1994</xref>: 812) asserts that: ‘[n]arrative analysis of clinical interaction helps to uncover the moral dimensions of clinical practice’. She claims that clinical encounters involve the creation and negotiation of a plot structured within clinical time by clinicians together with patients.</p>
<p>In order to obtain a comprehensive picture of amputee–therapist interactions, I systematically documented all the encounters I observed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1363459312451177">Marshall and Rossman, 1989</xref>). Following <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1363459312451177">Merriam (1998)</xref>, I focused on the discursive as well as non-discursive communication conducted during the interactions. I documented the verbal and non-verbal communication observed during therapy sessions as well as compiling field notes written immediately after. Verbal communication focused on conversations between therapists and their patients. Non-verbal communication was given special stress with respect to patients since documentation of their bodily movements was essential. In this sense, the field notes made during and after observations enhanced the richness of the raw data and helped deepen interpretation of the clinical encounters. Documentation was produced by audio-recording and handwriting. In order to track a specific activity in an often crowded room, old-fashioned handwriting became the more efficient technique.</p>
<p>All the documentation was transcribed for purposes of qualitative textual analysis. My purpose was to extract empirically based thematic categories and patterns that together might construct a meaningful process. The findings were eventually divided into four main themes, which I refer to as the <italic>four spheres of meaning</italic>. These spheres represent the most significant patterns that emerged from the field. In the following section I present the four spheres together with relevant ethnographic illustrations.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1363459312451177">
<title>Findings</title>
<p>The findings take us to the physiotherapy hall, where practices and strategies of normalization are inculcated. This process is captured in four spheres of meaning, which I have designated as <italic>Prosthetics only, Compensatory skills, Enduring pain</italic> and <italic>Talking prosthetics</italic>. These spheres are inter-related analytic constructs that encapsulate the complex process in which meaning is assigned to the body as well as to the prosthesis. All four are oriented toward and support the re-acquisition and cultivation of body techniques. As they unfold, they separately as well as together tell the story of physical rehabilitation.</p>
<sec id="section6-1363459312451177">
<title>Prosthetics only</title>
<p>As mentioned earlier, the declared concern of physical rehabilitation is prosthetic training. Accordingly, the first sphere of meaning shows how therapists emphasize the exclusiveness of prostheses in the re-acquisition of body techniques. To demonstrate this idea I open with an ethnographic illustration.</p>
<p>Abraham, a 32-year-old man who had lost his right leg above the knee in an accident is a patient at the orthopedics ward. During his physiotherapy session, he converses with his physiotherapist as follows:</p>
<speech>
<speaker>Physiotherapist:</speaker>
<p>We’re going to keep on practicing, but first put the sock on [the stump], don’t forget.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Abraham:</speaker>
<p>Maybe we’ll work with crutches today; I don’t have the energy for the effort.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Physiotherapist:</speaker>
<p>No, you’d better not, crutches won’t give you anything for now … You need to stand on both your legs and practice walking.</p>
</speech>
<p>It has been over a month since his first prosthesis fitting and Abraham is practicing its use. The therapist instructs him on how to prepare to use the prosthesis and objects to the possibility of using crutches. The latter aids are considered insufficient because they do not ‘give’ him ‘anything for now’ in the sense of functional achievement. Abraham finds the crutches easier to use since he has lost his sense of balance and control over the prosthesis. Since prostheses are less flexible than human legs, their activation requires significant effort and energy expenditure, problems aggravated with the level of amputation. Although difficult, Abraham is told to repeat his trial walks with his prosthesis. Later in this session, he addresses this issue once again:</p>
<speech>
<speaker>Abraham:</speaker>
<p>I thought I would use the crutches more often.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Physiotherapist:</speaker>
<p>But how are you going to get used to something you’re not practicing on?</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Abraham:</speaker>
<p>I know but it’s like swinging in the air on a stilt, without holding on to anything; I think I’ll take a break.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Physiotherapist:</speaker>
<p>Take a short break … But, please make an effort right after.</p>
</speech>
<p>Once again, Abraham stresses his difficulties in using the prosthesis because he feels like ‘swinging in the air on a stilt’ due to his lack of balance. His therapist suggests a short break but advises Abraham to make an ‘effort’ right after he resumes practice. The message conveyed is that Abraham should overcome his difficulties by training with the prosthesis, which is more appropriate for re-acquisition of body techniques despite the greater discomfort involved.</p>
<p>In another illustration we meet Joe, a 30-year-old man who lost his left leg below the knee due to a car accident. Joe comes to physiotherapy leaning on a cane:</p>
<speech>
<speaker>Physiotherapist:</speaker>
<p>What’s with the cane? Come, walk toward me without the cane.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Joe:</speaker>
<p>I feel that I can’t stand on my left leg for more than a second …</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Physiotherapist:</speaker>
<p>But you have to try … Here, now you’re leaning on your right side too much, your whole body is tilting.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Joe:</speaker>
<p>So let it tilt [he laughs] let people think I’m dancing … Now I’ll walk crookedly.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Physiotherapist:</speaker>
<p>Don’t walk crookedly; step with your left leg pushed hard against the floor.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Joe:</speaker>
<p>But I’m afraid to lift up my right leg.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Physiotherapist:</speaker>
<p>Move forward slowly; if you feel you have to tilt, lean to the right from the moment you lift your left leg, until you lay it down on the floor, but no longer than that.</p>
</speech>
<p>Joe raises the problem of balance when using a prosthetic limb. He is insecure regarding what used to be trivial body actions – standing still and walking. His therapist delegitimizes his use of a cane because it is irrelevant to accepted practice. Instead, Joe is urged to walk and stand straight exclusively with the aid of his prosthesis. Tilting his body is thus acceptable only until he lays his left leg down on the floor, but no longer.</p>
<p>As visible mechanical aids, instruments such as canes challenge the rehabilitation routine; as such, they are considered inappropriate. Patients are expected to perform body techniques solely with prosthetics. This basic idea orders physical therapy sessions regardless of etiology or level of amputation. On one occasion, Sara, a 63-year-old woman with a high-level amputation (through her left hip) was sitting in her wheelchair, waiting for her session. When the therapist came she told Sara: ‘We’re working here; we’re getting you out of this chair.’ The message was that Sara’s wheelchair did not belong to the work-practice routine and thus should be neglected in favor of a prosthetic leg.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, instructions such as ‘use prosthesis’, ‘don’t walk crookedly’ or ‘do not use crutches’ are too general. Lacking specification they are not sufficient in instructing the exact manner of <italic>how</italic> to use prosthetics adequately in accordance with body techniques. Therefore, the staff further elaborates the directions for use, as will be illustrated in the next sphere.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-1363459312451177">
<title>Compensatory skills</title>
<p>Parallel with general instructions, amputees learn what I label as <italic>compensatory skills</italic>, meaning specific motor skills that enable improved maneuvering of the prosthetic device. It is important to distinguish between compensatory skills and <italic>compensatory movements</italic>. The latter is a professional term referring to the reflex movements that maintain a particular body position, often observed in cases of impairment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1363459312451177">Cary et al., 2008</xref>). While these movements are automatic and spontaneous, compensatory skills are based on professional knowledge and experience; they must be learned during purposive practice. To better understand this concept, I present an ethnographic illustration. Debby, a 23-year-old woman who lost her left leg below the knee in a car accident, is talking to her therapist:</p>
<speech>
<speaker>Debby:</speaker>
<p>You see; that’s what I meant when I told you my leg is dragging.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Physiotherapist:</speaker>
<p>You don’t give enough leverage. Lift up your knee.</p>
</speech>
<p>Debby walks a few more steps and says:</p>
<speech>
<speaker>Debby:</speaker>
<p>All right, but I still feel I’m dragging it.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Physiotherapist:</speaker>
<p>You’re not dragging it but you can lift it higher; bend your knee harder and lift … feel how your back hip muscles tighten [the therapist is grabbing Debby’s hip muscles]. Here, feel how your muscles tighten.</p>
</speech>
<p>The therapist asks Debby to pay special attention to the way she bends her knee in order to create the leverage necessary to lift the prosthesis. To determine whether she follows the therapist’s instructions correctly, Debby is asked to direct her attention to a physical indicator – how hard she tightens her back hip muscles. The new skill Debby learns is a motoric nuance that should help in her prosthesis management. Employing this skill will help her control the device and thus achieve better balance, which will consequently enable performance of normative body techniques. The instruction ‘walk’ is, by itself, insufficient because a gap exists between the desired way of walking and her current abilities. Compensatory skills can bridge this gap for they are more detailed. Being custom-designed maneuvers, they fit the patient’s specific needs. The next illustration will further demonstrate this idea.</p>
<p>Sara, a 63-year-old woman, is amputated through her left hip, due to vascular complications. During a physical therapy session her therapist instructs her how to sit down properly:</p>
<speech>
<speaker>Physiotherapist:</speaker>
<p>The chair is right behind you, now reach out backwards and lean to catch the chair.</p>
</speech>
<p>Sara leans back but fails to reach the chair. She crashes down on the seat.</p>
<speech>
<speaker>Physiotherapist:</speaker>
<p>Don’t get nervous, you don’t have to throw your body like that, practice … You have to learn how to catch the chair properly so that you can sit down comfortably.</p>
</speech>
<p>The physiotherapist teaches Sara the precise maneuver she should perform – lean backwards while reaching out for the chair. That should assist her in sitting down gently, in the acceptable way. When Sara fails to do so, the therapist corrects her and recommends that she ‘practice a lot’ because compensatory skills should be learnt and performed fluently, almost as ‘second nature’. These skills enable ‘normal locomotion’, a medical term depicting the seven phases of body movements involved in completing a normative ‘gait cycle’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1363459312451177">Engstrom and Van de Ven, 1985</xref>: 80). All body movements and postures depicted in this ‘gait cycle’ reflect cultural ideas of functionality as well as aesthetics; both embedded in body techniques. Hence, if Sara learns to catch the chair properly, she will be able to avoid ‘throwing’ her body uncontrollably and thus achieve such ‘normal locomotion’ when sitting down.</p>
<p>Although lower limbs are at the focus of attention, other body parts contribute to the process: hands catch, arms lengthen and the back straightens up. In the following illustration we learn how Joe, whom we met earlier, is instructed to exercise the muscles in his buttocks:</p>
<speech>
<speaker>Physiotherapist:</speaker>
<p>Sit on the edge of the [practice] bed and take down your legs on the floor.</p>
</speech>
<p>Joe sits up and puts down his leg and then the prosthesis. Then he stands by the bed and bends forward.</p>
<speech>
<speaker>Physiotherapist:</speaker>
<p>… Tighten your buttocks; tuck them in.</p>
</speech>
<p>Like Sara’s arm, Joe has to practice his posterior muscles in order to control his prosthetic body movement. That way he can create the momentum to lift up the device properly, according to the refined body technique.</p>
<p>When considering the purpose of compensatory skills it seems that they move beyond pure functionality. Their exercise enables activation of the prosthetic device but also the well-coordinated flow of movements. This flow prevents limping, bending or dragging one’s prosthesis, all of which are related to the aesthetics of the body. They consequently support the performance of body techniques in an adequate, able-bodied manner while avoiding disclosure of the prosthesis or the stump.</p>
<p>However, simultaneously with ensuring the triumph of bodily order, the clinical encounter raises voices of pain and discomfort, the direct outcomes of prosthesis use. The staff, as we will see, manage these voices in ways that do not interrupt the practice routine.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-1363459312451177">
<title>Enduring pain</title>
<p>Although taken-for-granted solutions for amputation, prosthetics are not pain-free. Rather, they demand long periods of adjustment, during which amputees may face an array of physical challenges. The main reason for ‘prosthetic pain’ is standing and ambulating with the prosthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1363459312451177">Esquenazi, 2004</xref>). Health ramifications range from irritation, rash, infection, wounds, edema and arthritic or phantom limb pain that may persist for many years after the surgical incision has healed. In fact, pain and discomfort have been found to be the main reasons against regular prosthesis use since it increases the sweating and pressure that produce infections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1363459312451177">Whyte and Carroll, 2002</xref>). For this reason, it should come as no surprise that during the observations, pain and discomfort were constantly present. As we will see, the staff handle this issue as part of the therapeutic routine.</p>
<p>In the next illustration we meet Becky, a 40-year-old woman amputated below her right knee due to vascular complications. Becky is sitting on a chair and talking to her therapist:</p>
<speech>
<speaker>Physiotherapist:</speaker>
<p>I’ve heard that the technician made some adjustments [in the prosthesis].</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Becky:</speaker>
<p>Yes … But it’s still sore … I’ll show you.</p>
</speech>
<p>Becky takes off the prosthesis and the sock which covers her stump. The therapist leans closely toward her and touches the stump.</p>
<speech>
<speaker>Physiotherapist:</speaker>
<p>There aren’t changes from last time; no swelling or discolorations.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Becky:</speaker>
<p>Less on the sides but still right below [the stump], it has left marks on the skin.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Physiotherapist:</speaker>
<p>It should take time … If the technician made the adjustments, you need to carry on practicing … Maybe use an additional sock. It will take its course and get better but now we have to work.</p>
</speech>
<p>Becky complains about the pain caused by the prosthesis while pointing out the marks that the device has left on her skin. Her physiotherapist claims that there are no irregularities in Becky’s skin condition and advises using an additional sock on her stump. According to the therapist, Becky’s pain ‘will take its course’ and get better. Yet, this does not justify a break in practicing. The message conveyed is that pain is an experience that Becky has to expect and endure in her prosthetic training.</p>
<p>This clinical encounter introduces two conflicting ‘voices’ of pain: for Becky, pain is an embodied experience that evokes the need for assigning meaning and immediate alleviation (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1363459312451177">Morris, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1363459312451177">Scarry, 1985</xref>). Alternatively, the staff perceive pain as an intrinsic part of physical rehabilitation. As such, it is considered an acceptable side-effect of the future achievement of normalcy. This gap between the voices of pain is known to engender conflicts between patients and health professionals regarding therapeutic intervention options, accountability and pain assessment ( <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1363459312451177">Del Vecchio-Good et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1363459312451177">Kleinman, 1995</xref>). In many cases, medical personnel fail to relate to many of the factors that contribute to pain, while hearing only those details that they think are relevance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1363459312451177">Lorber and Moore, 2002</xref>). In the current study, pain is constructed into the process as an anticipated side-effect of prosthetic training. This may explain why when one of the patients pointed at his stump and said ‘It hurts here’, his therapist replied ‘You probably walked too much … the leg works too much.’ Her reply acknowledges the limitation of the device by explaining pain in terms of its cause – the prolonged use of the prosthesis. Yet, professional recognition does not necessarily mean refraining from using it, as will be further demonstrated in the next illustration. Isaac, a 42-year-old man who is amputated below his right knee, is lying on a practice bed and talking to his physiotherapist:</p>
<speech>
<speaker>Isaac:</speaker>
<p>I have this pain in my leg so I couldn’t walk at all today.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Physiotherapist:</speaker>
<p>… Have you walked lately other than here?</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Isaac:</speaker>
<p>No.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Physiotherapist:</speaker>
<p>There probably wasn’t enough activity or the bandage may have loosened … Try activating; come, slowly get up from the bed.</p>
</speech>
<p>Isaac complains about his pain which is so severe that he feels he cannot walk at all. His therapist asks about the period of time Isaac has used his prosthesis and the condition of the bandage on the stump. Right afterwards she suggests he ‘try activating’ it. Isaac is thus expected to endure his pain in order to continue practicing.</p>
<p>As the findings show, patients are expected to learn to endure prosthetic pain in the process of their re-acquisition of body techniques, a message that underlies physiotherapy sessions. Their endurance is fundamental to expectations of the device’s future place in the rehabilitation regime.</p>
<p>I have so far discussed the physical aspects of the process. However, rehabilitation goes one step further, figuratively speaking, in its normalization of the body, as will be demonstrated by the concluding sphere.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-1363459312451177">
<title>Talking ‘prosthetics’</title>
<p>The popular and professional literature alike often refers to prostheses as ‘artificial limbs’. Yet, to what extent should this definition be taken for granted? In an age of advanced biomedical technology, we might assume that prosthetics would not pose any questions of meaning for users; however, the ethnography states otherwise. As the findings will show, therapists instruct amputees to refer to their mechanical devices as ‘legs’, as their own limbs, even though they are clearly artificial.</p>
<p>In the next illustration we meet Jonathan, a 60-year-old man, amputated above his left knee due to a tumor. During his session, Jonathan is discussing instructions with his therapist:</p>
<speech>
<speaker>Physiotherapist:</speaker>
<p>Now stand up on both your legs with your knees straight, left and right.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Jonathan:</speaker>
<p>What’s ‘the left’?</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Physiotherapist:</speaker>
<p>Your left leg … Straighten up your knees, I want both your legs parallel at the same line.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Jonathan:</speaker>
<p>The prosthesis, too?</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Physiotherapist:</speaker>
<p>Prosthesis, too; when we say left we mean prosthesis.</p>
</speech>
<p>When the physiotherapist asks him to stand on both his legs, Jonathan fails to understand and asks for clarifications – why does the therapist mention a left leg when there is no left leg? An explanation is given immediately – ‘it is your left leg’, yet the therapist cannot grasp why Jonathan does not understand. In return, Jonathan asks if he should straighten his prosthesis, too; the answer is – yes. The physiotherapist indeed said left, but she meant the prosthesis, which should be the correct term to use from now on.</p>
<p>For Jonathan, it was neither clear nor taken for granted that the term ‘leg’ was a substitute for ‘device’. His bewilderment may stem from the problematic nature of the body–technology dualism that exists in biomedical arenas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1363459312451177">Schepper-Hughs and Lock, 1997</xref>: 10, in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1363459312451177">Kurzman, 2002</xref>). Moreover, the confusion is rooted in the very definition of ‘artificial limb’, an oxymoron combining biology and technology. And so, one patient asked his physiotherapist what exactly she meant when she said ‘prosthesis’. Being amputated above his left knee, the patient wanted to know what the term stands for in terms of his body. Is it just the mechanics, or his stump together with the attached prosthetic device? The therapist told him: ‘I call prosthesis everything from here (pointing on the stump’s margin) to the tip of the shoe, the foot.’</p>
<p>The body–technology dualism calls for linguistic creativity, such as the use of the English terms ‘donning’ and ‘doffing’, borrowed from the context of dress to depict the acts of putting on and taking off a prosthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1363459312451177">Kurzman, 2002</xref>). Research has shown that when lacking a precise vocabulary, clinicians often employ the language of ‘technology’ in favor of the language of ‘biology’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1363459312451177">Schepper-Hughs and Lock, 1997</xref>: 10 in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1363459312451177">Kurzman, 2002</xref>: 230). As our findings show, the staff employ the ‘language of biology’ rather than the ‘language of technology’. In this way, they turn a hinge into a ‘knee’ and a prosthetic plastic base into a ‘foot’. As sessions proceed, these ‘biological’ terms come to dominate the interactions; now articulated by patients and their therapists in instructions, questions and answers.</p>
<p>In the following illustration Nelly, a 45-year-old woman, who is amputated above her left leg due to vascular complications, is lying on the practice bed:</p>
<speech>
<speaker>Physiotherapist:</speaker>
<p>First, step down and lean forward.</p>
</speech>
<p>Nelly steps with her left leg [the prosthesis] and hesitates to move further.</p>
<speech>
<speaker>Physiotherapist:</speaker>
<p>What happened? Is your knee open? Lock up your knee; you forgot it’s open.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Nelly:</speaker>
<p>It may have opened …</p>
</speech>
<p>The physiotherapist uses the biological term ‘knee’ to ask whether Nelly’s prosthetic hinge is open. Nelly understands that the ‘knee’ stands for the mechanical hinge and answers accordingly, without any need for clarification. In another example of ‘terminological fluency’, I heard Jacob’s therapist asking him: ‘Jacob, where did you put your leg?’ Jacob pointed at a distant corner of the room and said: ‘It’s over there, but I can’t reach it.’ There was no doubt to the conversant about what the therapist meant.</p>
<p>Physiotherapists evidently teach patients the adequate terminology to accompany the use of prostheses in their performance of body techniques. By instructing patients in this symbolic practice they teach them not only how to ‘walk the walk’ but also how to ‘talk the talk’. By doing so they silence the spoken expression of disability since we no longer hear of the ‘deviant’ bodily condition – prosthesis and stump. Disability now disappears not only from the public eye but also from the public ear; with successful achievement of <italic>these</italic> goals, the body as well as the rehabilitation process are complete.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The four spheres of meanings identified in the research portray the complexity of physical rehabilitation of lower limb amputees, which re-constructs body normalcy. By means of this disciplinary process, physical therapists teach pragmatic and discursive practices for managing the body as well as the prosthesis. These practices are oriented toward the re-acquisition and re-cultivation of body techniques now performed exclusively with prosthetic limbs.</p>
<p>It appears that the straightforward use of prosthetics does not automatically promise successful execution of the activities marking able-bodiedness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1363459312451177">Murray, 2005</xref>). The mere presence of the prosthesis is evidently as stigmatizing as the absence of a limb. Unlike the blind man’s cane, prostheses are meant to be fully assimilated in body layout. Based on this expectation, the staff transmits compensatory skills and discursive practices that are in fact manipulative tactics, meant to eliminate overt traces of disability. The device consequently turns from an extension to an integral part of the body, now referred to as a ‘leg’ – a ‘social organ’. In this sense, physical therapy re-civilizes the ‘deviant’ body by guiding patients’ practical and discursive strategies for ‘passing’ as normal, especially the strategy of concealment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1363459312451177">Goffman, 1986</xref>). This strategy assists the management of visible stigma by taking preventative measures to avoid any disclosure of the stump or the prosthesis; it thus helps maintain the impression of a normal, able-bodied person.</p>
<p>In this educative process, physiotherapists serve as social agents who, like other medical personnel, exercise authority, management and control over bodies considered abnormal. In this sense, their clinical work is tutorial in nature since it disciplines the body through teaching various normalizing practices (for further reading see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1363459312451177">Wheatley’s (2005)</xref> work on cardiac rehabilitation). Nevertheless, normalcy and disability are not cultural ideals merely reflected in these practices. Rather, they are constructed and revalidated through the dynamics of the medical encounters between physiotherapists and their patients.</p>
<p>Paradoxically, a process that claims to benefit patients inflicts pain and discomfort revolving in its entirety around application of the solution it offers – the prosthesis. Patients are urged to learn to endure these experiences during and after rehabilitation. When considering the accompanying tribulations, an ethical issue arises regarding the necessity of prosthetics: are they solutions or problems in themselves? We thus challenge their conventionality as medical aids for amputees.</p>
<p>It is important to note that patients are not forced into rehabilitation. Yet, although they may negotiate meaning and suggest alternatives, they rarely oppose treatment. I suggest two possible reasons for their sometimes reluctant but continued participation in the process: first, the medical staff represent the professional authorities, accredited as having the knowledge and expertise to treat these conditions; second, patients share the medical staff’s ideas of the (ab)normal body and its treatment in western society. Prosthetics are not, however, a given even though they have been taken for granted in anthropological studies of amputation (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1363459312451177">Messinger’s (2009)</xref> work in the USA and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1363459312451177">Manderson and Warren and (2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1363459312451177">Warren and Manderson, 2008</xref>) work in Australia). Research has shown that patients coming from non-western cultural backgrounds often resist this kind of treatment. Such a case was described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1363459312451177">Ling-Hui and Jye (2009)</xref> in their study of traditional Chinese people and their rehabilitation therapists in Taiwan. This case differs significantly from the Israeli rehabilitation experience, where medical practices are harnessed to normalize ‘deviant’ bodies regardless of their demographic or etiological history.</p>
<p>The current findings portray an able-body-centric ideology that although not exclusive to Israel, acquires special meaning within the local context. In replying to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1363459312451177">Douglas (1996)</xref>, both amputation and prosthetics symbolize a threat to the social body, an entity intolerant of the physical weaknesses symbolized by limping or leaning due to their implicit threat to the national struggle for survival. Social reintegration of amputees is therefore conditioned by physical rehabilitation, one of the many medical practices in Israel that promise a disability-free society. Despite promoting accessibility, anti-discrimination legislation and equal opportunities for disabled people (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1363459312451177">Feldman et al., 2007</xref>), organized efforts attempt to prevent and conceal those same disabilities. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1363459312451177">Siebers (2004)</xref> argues, the ideology of able-bodiedness has embraced uniformity, a stance that opposes the <italic>individualization</italic> of the body that characterizes postmodern societies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1363459312451177">Featherstone, 2010</xref>). This ideal of uniformity in fact fits the Zionist call for a collectivist, thoroughly able-bodied society, supported by medical practice. This may explain why all amputees in Israel receive financial support to purchase a basic standard prosthesis and the reason why the Ministry of Defense provides Israeli soldiers and veterans with the most extensive and continuous financial support for non-standard prosthetics (on that matter also see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1363459312451177">Mor, 2006</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-1363459312451177">3</xref></sup></p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-1363459312451177">
<title>Cultural boundaries, corporal constraints</title>
<p>The findings contribute to the critical sociological debate on the body and disability. As discussed earlier, Foucauldian tradition views impairment and disability as ‘historical artifacts of the regime of bio-power’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1363459312451177">Tremain, 2001</xref>: 185), a position that leaves the material body out of debate. However, the findings show that throughout rehabilitation, the body is neither absent nor dissolved into the world of symbols that float about in a hyper-real world. On the contrary, the body is present as the very ground on which the entire therapeutic process takes place. It challenges the staff when speaking in the voices of its pain and discomfort, caused by the devices employed in that therapy. And yet, patients are faced with coping with all these corporeal constraints while trying to master the use of prosthetics. Their questions and suggestions are often ignored by therapists who acknowledge the accepted model of rehabilitation as the sole means to help patients comply with standard body techniques such as walking, standing or sitting. This model dictates the naming of prosthetics and their parts as if they were biological limbs. The symbolic practice of naming is not discussed in rehabilitation textbooks, nor does it stem from the body’s pre-discursive necessities even though it reflects cultural perceptions of body image and boundaries. As a normalizing process which disciplines and regulates the body in a culturally acceptable fashion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1363459312451177">Good, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1363459312451177">Moss and Dyck, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1363459312451177">Turner, 1996</xref>), it makes no effort to eliminate its material essence. Such an outcome would be alien to its purpose.</p>
<p>The findings also shed light on the terminological split within the social model of disability as discussed earlier. Each concept – disability and impairment – when considered separately would not provide adequate theoretical or methodological foundations for the conduct of this study nor make the fieldwork at all possible. Therefore, instead of distinguishing disability from impairment, I suggest viewing disability as a juncture of socio-cultural ideas of the body embedded in its own corporeal constraints. In doing so, I join those authors who have called for further development of the ‘golden pathway’ between non-essentialist and post-structuralist theories (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1363459312451177">Hughes and Paterson, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1363459312451177">Shakespeare, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1363459312451177">Turner, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1363459312451177">Williams, 2006</xref>). All have acknowledged the raw, palpitating materiality that society asks to acculturate on the one hand and the powerful social forces exerted on the corporeal on the other. All underlie the process of physical rehabilitation.</p>
