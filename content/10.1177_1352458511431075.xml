<abstract>
<p><bold>Background:</bold> Preservation of locomotor activity in multiple sclerosis (MS) patients is of utmost importance. Robotic-assisted body weight-supported treadmill training is a promising method to improve gait functions in neurologically impaired patients, although its effectiveness in MS patients is still unknown.</p>
<p><bold>Objective:</bold> To compare the effectiveness of robot-assisted gait training (RAGT) with that of conventional walking treatment (CWT) on gait and generalized functions in a group of stable MS patients.</p>
<p><bold>Methods:</bold> A prospective randomized controlled trial of 12 sessions of RAGT or CWT in MS patients of EDSS score 5–7. Primary outcome measures were gait parameters and the secondary outcomes were functional and quality of life parameters. All tests were performed at baseline, 3 and 6 months post-treatment by a blinded rater.</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> Fifteen and 17 patients were randomly allocated to RAGT and CWT, respectively. Both groups were comparable at baseline in all parameters. As compared with baseline, although some gait parameters improved significantly following the treatment at each time point there was no difference between the groups. Both FIM and EDSS scores improved significantly post-treatment with no difference between the groups. At 6 months, most gait and functional parameters had returned to baseline.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic neurological disease characterized by patchy inflammation, gliosis and demyelination within the central nervous system.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1352458511431075">1</xref></sup> It is the third most common cause of neurological disability in adults between 18 and 50 years of age.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1352458511431075">2</xref></sup> Preservation of locomotor activity in MS patients is of utmost importance. Several studies have evaluated the effect of interdisciplinary rehabilitation programmes and specific exercise programmes in MS patients.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1352458511431075">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1352458511431075">4</xref></sup> This Cochrane Library review consists of nine randomized controlled trials of high methodological quality, including 260 participants with EDSS score between 1.0 and 6.5. Six trials focused on comparison of exercise therapy with no exercise therapy and three trials compared two interventions that both met the definition of exercise therapy. Strong evidence was found in favour of exercise therapy compared with no exercise therapy in terms of muscle power, function, exercise tolerance functions and mobility-related activities. No evidence was observed for exercise therapy on fatigue and perception of handicap when compared with no exercise therapy. No evidence was found that specific exercise therapy programmes were more successful in improving activities and participation than other exercise treatments.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1352458511431075">4</xref></sup> Physical treatment for MS includes stretching to reduce spasticity and exercises to maintain range of motion, exercises to develop trunk control and upper arm muscles, transfer training, training in walking and appropriate use of assistive devices, such as ambulatory aids, braces and wheelchairs. Physical therapy has been shown to be effective in improving gait and mobility, and reducing the risk of falls.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1352458511431075">5</xref></sup></p>
<p>In recent years a novel locomotor training that incorporates high numbers of repetitions of task-oriented practice by the use of body weight-supported treadmill training (BWSTT) has been developed to enhance gait recovery following insults such as stroke or spinal cord injury.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1352458511431075">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1352458511431075">7</xref></sup> The use of BWSTT enables early initiation of gait training, integration of weight-bearing activities, stepping and balance by the use of a task-specific approach, and a symmetrical gait pattern. In MS patients, few studies on BWSTT have been conducted with any positive outcomes;<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1352458511431075">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1352458511431075">9</xref></sup> the manual administration of BWSTT is cumbersome and demanding on the physiotherapist, and therefore inefficient.</p>
<p>To facilitate the delivery of BWSTT, a motorized, robotically driven gait orthosis was developed<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1352458511431075">10</xref></sup> that has many advantages over conventional BWSTT methods, including less effort for the physiotherapist, longer session duration, more physiological and reproducible gait patterns and the possibility of measuring patient performance. Several studies have shown that robotic-assisted gait training (RAGT) improves overground walking ability in individuals with stroke and incomplete spinal cord injury.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1352458511431075">11</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1352458511431075"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1352458511431075"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1352458511431075">14</xref></sup> Locomotor training using the robotic device resulted in significant improvements in subjects’ gait velocity, endurance and performance of functional tasks.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1352458511431075">12</xref></sup> Only two studies have investigated the effect of RAGT on gait function in MS patients,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1352458511431075">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1352458511431075">16</xref></sup> one of which investigated the long-term outcome of this treatment as compared with conventional walking treatment (CWT). In these studies, although no advantage of RAGT over regular BWSTT or conventional gait training was found, RAGT was found to be feasible and effective in improving gait function in MS patients. However, the number of MS patients treated by RAGT in these studies was small and the question remains open with regard to whether RAGT offers better outcome than regular physiotherapy. In addition, the long-term effect of RAGT in MS patients is still unknown. The aim of the present study was to examine the effect of RAGT on daily activities and motor function in a group of stable MS patients and to compare short- and long-term effectiveness of this treatment with the effect of CWT.</p>

<title>Participants</title>
<p>Multiple sclerosis patients were recruited from the MS unit in Hadassah medical centre. All patients eligible for the study were given the opportunity to participate. Relapsing progressive, secondary progressive and primary progressive MS patients according to McDonald et al’s criteria<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1352458511431075">17</xref></sup> were included in this study. Inclusion criteria were: stable phase of disease, chronic progressive pattern or relapsing–progressive with no relapse during the last three months, and severe walking disabilities with EDSS score 5–7. This prospective randomized controlled trial was approved by the IRB committee of Hadassah medical centre and all patients signed an informed consent. Block randomization with blocks of two was used. An independent blinded collaborator who was not involved in the treatment or care of patients performed the randomization.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1352458511431075">
<title>Interventions</title>
<p>The study group was treated by a robotically driven gait orthosis, the Lokomat<sup>TM</sup> (Hocoma Inc., Zurich, Switzerland), which includes a treadmill, a body-weight support system and two lightweight robotic actuators attached to the subject’s legs. The locomotor treatment was administered 2–3 times per week for 4 weeks. The overall duration of Lokomat therapy, including the time getting in and out, was 45 min while the net robotic gait training lasted 30 min. The speed of the treadmill can be adjusted from 0 km/h to approximately 3 km/h according to patient tolerance. In our study, the velocity of the treadmill was set to the maximum speed tolerated by the patient. At the beginning of the treatment 40% of each patient’s body weight was supported by the harness system. After 2 weeks the body weight support was reduced to 30% and in another 2 weeks to 20% of the patient’s body weight. In the CWT group, patients were trained by gait and dynamic balance exercises, standing from sitting training and walking with or without walking aids. The net treatment time was 30 min with the assistance of a physical therapist.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1352458511431075">
<title>Measurements</title>
<p>All evaluations were performed by a senior physiotherapist who was blinded to the group allocation of study patients. The primary outcomes measurements were gait parameters, including walking velocity by the 10 m walk test (10MWT), walking endurance by the 6 min walk test (6MWT) and basic functional mobility according to the time up and go test (TUG). All gait measurements were recorded on the ground. Secondary outcomes were the BBT, EDSS, FIM and RAND-36 scales. All tests were performed at baseline, at the end of the treatment and at 3 and 6 months after the end of the treatment.</p>
<p>Gait parameters were assessed by the following tests: 10MWT is the common measure for gait velocity in neurologically disabled patients. Patients were requested to walk as quickly as possible for 10 m using their customary walking aids. The time taken to complete this task was measured in seconds and gait velocity was calculated.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1352458511431075">18</xref></sup> Patients who were unable to walk were considered to have a walking velocity of 0 m/s. The TUG test<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1352458511431075">19</xref></sup> assesses gait efficacy and reflects the ability to transfer from sitting to standing and to walk a short distance. Subjects were required to stand up from a chair with armrests, walk 3 m, turn around, return to the chair and sit down using their customary walking aids. The best time, measured in seconds, from two trials was taken for analysis. The 6MWT is thought to measure exercise tolerance. Patients were required to walk as far as they could in 6 min using their customary walking aids, the distance walked being measured in metres.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1352458511431075">20</xref></sup> Patients’ balance was assessed using the Berg balance test,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1352458511431075">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1352458511431075">22</xref></sup> a clinical scale that evaluates balance in sitting and standing and rates performance from 0 (cannot perform) to 4 (normal performance). The scale has 14 items that explore the ability to sit, stand, lean, turn and maintain an upright position on one leg. The Berg balance scale (BBS) has been validated for use in patients with MS.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1352458511431075">22</xref></sup> It was found to have good concurrent validity, and a cut-off score of 44 (out of 56) was established as a criterion in identifying MS patients with a high risk of falls. The BBS is widely used by physiotherapists and takes approximately 15 min to complete. It has also been used in other studies evaluating interventions in MS patients, thereby making it possible to compare results with other studies. Neurological status was evaluated using Kurtzke’s expanded disability status scale.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1352458511431075">23</xref></sup> The EDSS is an ordinal scale ranging from 0 (normal) to 10 (death) and is the traditionally used impairment scale for MS. Daily living functions were evaluated with the functional independence measure (FIM<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1352458511431075">24</xref></sup>) by an independent assessor unaware of the patient’s allocation. The FIM is an ordinal scale that assesses the severity of motor and neuropsychological disability, consisting of 18 items classified into 6 domains – 4 motor and 2 cognitive. Each item envisages 7 levels of independent performance (7 equating to total independence and 1 equating to total dependence or inaccessible). The minimum total FIM score is 18 and the maximum 126, which is equivalent to total functional independence. Quality of life (QoL), including physical and mental health parameters, was assessed using the RAND-36 instrument. The questionnaire included a Hebrew version of the Medical Outcomes Study Short-Form 36 (RAND-36) instrument.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1352458511431075">25</xref></sup> This instrument includes 36 questions measuring 8 health domains, including physical functioning; physical limitation in role performance such as work, pain and general health; emotional and mental well-being; and emotional limitations (such as pain, anxiety or depression) in roles, performance, social functioning and vitality. Each domain is measured on a 0–100 scale, where a score of 100 signifies perfect health. For purposes of evaluation, the RAND-36 is divided into 2 categories relating to physical and mental subscales and the sum of the scores is the total QoL.</p>

<title>Population</title>
<p>Fifteen patients were randomly allocated to RAGT and 17 to CWT. The demographic data of both groups are presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1352458511431075">Table 1</xref>. No significant differences were noted between groups regarding age and gender. Both groups were comparable at baseline, and mean age of the treatment group was 46.8 ± 12.0 years compared with 50.5 ± 11.0 years in the control group (<italic>p</italic> = 0.36). Disease duration and severity according to the EDSS score were similar between the groups (11 years and 14 years and 6.2 and 6.0 in the RAGT and control groups, respectively, <italic>p</italic> = 0.28). In both groups a similar percentage of patients were treated by natalyzumab and interferones (40% and 33% in the RAGT group and 47% and 35% in the CWT group, respectively. Both groups presented moderately high functional abilities in activities of daily living (FIM 111 and 110 in the RAGT and control groups, respectively, <italic>p</italic> = 0.9). There were no side effects of the RAGT treatment. There were 3 drop-outs in the RAGT group and 1 in the CWT group, leaving 12 RAGT patients and 16 CWT patients for post-treatment analysis. None of the drop-outs were caused by side effects of the RAGT or CWT treatments. An additional 4 patients and 6 patients dropped out of the RAGT and CWT groups, respectively at the 6-month follow-up (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1352458511431075">Figure 1</xref>).</p>

<title>Gait parameter changes during the study</title>
<p>The primary end points during the study were the changes in the 3 gait parameters, 6MWT for endurance, 10MWT for gait velocity and TUG for gait efficacy. At the end of the treatment, 6MWT and 10MWT had improved significantly only in the CWT group whereas TUG had improved significantly only in the RAGT group (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1352458511431075">Table 2</xref>). At 3 months, 6MWT had improved significantly only in the CWT group, 10MWT had not changed in either group whereas TUG had improved significantly in both groups. At 6 months, only TUG in the RAGT group was significantly higher than baseline values, all other parameters having returned to baseline scores. Therefore it seems that in 2 out of 3 gait parameters, the CWT group showed better results using within-group analysis even if this improvement was short-lived. However, for each time point there was no difference in mean values and changes from baseline between the RAGT and the CWT groups, except with regard to the change from baseline for 10MWT in the CWT group immediately following the treatment. In order to determine whether one treatment method shows any advantage in more or less handicapped MS patients, we compared the results of gait parameters between less handicapped (5 ≤EDSS ≤6) and more handicapped (EDSS &gt;6) groups. We did not find any significant difference in the mean and mean change from baseline of gait parameters between RAGT and CWT in both groups (Tables 2a, 2b supplement).</p>

<title>Balance changes during the study</title>
<p>Multiple sclerosis patients suffer from severe disturbances in motor balance, as shown by the low BBT score at baseline in both groups (36.5 and 37.3 out of 56 in the RAGT and CWT groups, respectively, <italic>P</italic> = 0.5). At 1 month following treatment, both groups showed significant improvement in balance functions without any difference between groups. The improvement in balance functions was sustained at 3 months follow-up in the CWT group but not in the RAGT group. At 6 months follow-up, the BBT value for the CWT group was still higher than baseline although not statistically significant, whereas that for the RAGT group had returned to baseline (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1352458511431075">Table 3</xref>). This may reflect the fact that conventional walking exercise may have better long-term influence on equilibrium mechanisms compared with robotic treatment.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The primary finding of this study was that locomotor training using RAGT in chronic MS patients has beneficial effects in terms of ambulation and neurological parameters comparable to conventional walking treatment. Immediately after the intervention, the CWT group showed significant improvement in 2 out of 3 gait parameters whereas the RAGT improved significantly in the third parameter. However, no advantage has been found for any of the interventions since no significant difference was found between the groups at all time points along the study. Although we found no major clinical inter-group differences between robotic and conventional treatment in gait parameters or functional scores, we believe that the addition of robotic treatment – which requires less effort and manpower than conventional walking training – may be beneficial in functional improvement for MS patients.</p>
<p>Our data should be interpreted with caution, taking in account the concept of the minimal detectable change (MDC) measure. The MDC indicates the degree of change required to exceed measurement variability and therefore it represents the smallest change on an outcome measure that would be considered genuine.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1352458511431075">26</xref></sup> With regard to MS, only two studies have evaluated MDC for changes in functional parameters over time. However, the patients in these studies were fully ambulatory with median EDSS scores of 2.0 and 2.5,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1352458511431075">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1352458511431075">28</xref></sup> and therefore their data cannot be compared with our patients of EDSS ≥5. Data from other studies regarding severely disabled patients with stroke and Alzheimer’s disease showed that MDCs for 10MWT were in the range 0.094–0.160 m/s, for 6MWT 33.4 m, for TUG 4.09 s and for BBT 2.33–2.84.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1352458511431075">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1352458511431075">30</xref></sup> These values were quite similar to ours, implying that the inter-group improvement found in our study had some clinical relevance.</p>
<p>Only two previous studies of RAGT in MS patients have been published.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1352458511431075">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1352458511431075">16</xref></sup> Beer et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1352458511431075">15</xref></sup> found that in a group of 19 MS patients treated with RAGT there was significant improvement in walking velocity, walking distance and knee-extensor strength, whereas in the 16 patients treated with CWT only walking velocity was improved at the end of the study. Both groups were treated by an effective regimen of 30 min of RAGT or CWT daily for three weeks, with a total of 15 sessions, in addition to a specified standardized multimodal rehabilitation programme without further walking activities. Therefore the improvement found in walking distance that was not noted in our study may be attributed to the higher intensity and number of walking training sessions. Another difference from our study was that these workers performed RAGT in combination with a multidisciplinary rehabilitation programme, which may represent an advantage over RAGT alone as provided in our study. As in our study, at 6 months follow-up, all outcome values had returned to baseline in both groups. The second study was conducted using a different method and compared BWSTT with and without robotic assistance in two groups of 6 or 7 MS patients using a randomized crossover design.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1352458511431075">16</xref></sup> Patients received 6 training sessions over 3 weeks of each intervention; one group started with robotic training and the other with regular training and they were crossed after 6 weeks of wash-out. There were no major differences in outcomes between treatment groups and both groups showed significant improvement in gait parameters and EDSS following treatment. However, MS in these patients was less severe than in the patients in our study with regard to mean EDSS (4.9 [3.5–7.0] compared with 6.5 [5.0–7.0] in our study). These authors concluded that BWSTT with or without a robotic component has some potential to reduce gait impairment in MS patients; this is similar to our findings in that every gait-improving intervention, robotic or conventional, may have some advantage for MS patients.</p>
<p>Our main finding was that RAGT has similar effects to conventional walking exercise in MS patients. Conventional exercise programmes have already been shown to be beneficial in MS patients, improving mobility and gait parameters as well as other functional domains.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1352458511431075">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1352458511431075">31</xref></sup> Several studies investigated the effect of physical exercise on gait parameters in MS patients.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1352458511431075">32</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1352458511431075"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1352458511431075">34</xref></sup> It has been demonstrated that general aerobic and resistance training improves general strength, aerobic capacity, self-reported mobility levels and gait parameters. A recent study by Collett et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1352458511431075">35</xref></sup> examined the effect of 3 different exercise intensities in people with MS. They found that while no differences were found between the groups, greater benefit may be associated with higher-intensity exercise, but this may be less well tolerated. Treatment by RAGT therefore may provide higher-intensity exercise without increasing fatigue for MS patients and therefore may be applied for a longer duration and at higher intensity.</p>
<p>As in previous studies, the improvement in gait functions of MS patients found in our study following robotic locomotor treatment was limited with regard to time and was not detectable at the 6 months follow-up. Most of the studies that have evaluated the effect of exercise on the function of MS patients used only short-term follow-up, although in studies that applied long-term follow-up the results were similar to ours<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1352458511431075">36</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1352458511431075"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1352458511431075"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1352458511431075">39</xref></sup>. This finding indicates that the benefit of exercise treatment reduces with time if the patient does not train any more after the intervention period, and suggests that benefit is to be gained by repeated courses of exercise treatment every 3–6 months.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1352458511431075">40</xref></sup></p>
<p>Our study is the first to show a positive short-term effect of RAGT similar to CWT on the balance disturbance of MS patients as indicated by improvement in BBT scores. Several systematic studies have demonstrated that balance abnormalities are common in MS patients, including those with significant impairments as well as those with minimal or even no clinically assessable impairments.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1352458511431075">41</xref></sup> Small, uncontrolled studies have also suggested that various physical exercises may improve balance in MS patients.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1352458511431075">42</xref></sup> However, other studies have argued that the interventions most likely to be effective are those related to sensory facilitation and dual-task practice, as these specifically address the proprioceptive and central integration deficits that underlie imbalance and falls in people with MS.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1352458511431075">43</xref></sup> Our findings support the notion that RAGT or CWT may also stimulate central integrative centres in the brain stem and spinal cord, which has positive effects on balance in MS patients.</p>
<p>In previous studies, manual BWSTT has been shown to have some benefits in MS patients.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1352458511431075">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1352458511431075">9</xref></sup> Giesser et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1352458511431075">8</xref></sup> investigated the effect of 40 sessions of BWSTT using manual facilitation in 4 MS patients with severe functional limitations in ambulation (EDSS 7.0–7.5). At the end of training, all subjects showed improvement in muscle strength, and 3 of the 4 subjects demonstrated improvements in balance, spasticity, endurance and quality of life. A recent prospective study of BWSTT, including 6 patients with progressive MS treated with BWSTT for 12 weeks, demonstrated significant improvement in quality of life measurement and potential reduction in fatigability.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1352458511431075">9</xref></sup> This uncontrolled pilot study in a small number of patients supports the potential benefit of BWSTT in patients with progressive MS. The American National MS Society therefore decided to support the conducting of a larger trial using a robotic device, providing BWSTT with a control resistant exercise group similar to that in our study.</p>
<p>Our results support the effectiveness of BWSTT using a robotic device in MS patients, although no advantage over CWT was noted in the current robotic protocol. The effective protocol of RAGT in general neurological diseases, and in MS patients in particular, is still unknown. There are many parameters of the robotic system such as velocity of treadmill, percentage of body weight support or guidance force that may influence the functional outcome, and the optimum combination of these parameters remains to be established. This may be the reason for the lack of advantage of the robotic treatment found in our study, as well as in that of Lo and Triche that directly compared the effect of RAGT with manual BWSTT.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1352458511431075">16</xref></sup> Another open question is the cost/benefit ratio of robotic treatment as compared with manual treatments. Locomotor training with manual assistance usually requires the involvement of 3–4 therapists, and therefore it is a very expensive and elaborate procedure. RAGT usually requires usually less resource allocation and therefore it is less expensive to operate, although considerable investment is required for the infrastructure. Direct comparison with CWT is not feasible, but it seems that for walking patients when only 1 therapist is required for CWT this latter treatment is cheaper; however, for patients with more advanced debility RAGT may be beneficial.</p>
<p>In recent years, research on MS has increasingly focused on QoL, particularly health-related QoL, which describes an individual’s perception of how a disease affects his or her life, physically, psychologically and interpersonally.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1352458511431075">44</xref></sup> Some studies on rehabilitation for people with MS have included indices of QoL among outcome measures, while other studies have focused exclusively on QoL.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1352458511431075">45</xref></sup> In a recent prospective study of BWSTT in 6 patients with severe MS, which also included the evaluation of MS Quality of Life-54 (MSQOL-54), there was a significant improvement in both the mental (<italic>p</italic> = 0.01) and physical (<italic>p</italic> = 0.02) subscales of this measurement.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1352458511431075">9</xref></sup> The effect of BWSTT with or without a robotic device on QoL for MS patients was also examined by Weir et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1352458511431075">46</xref></sup> This study suggests that task-repetitive gait training can effectively improve QoL in patients with chronic MS, even after a brief training period. Among the study participants, no quantifiable differences were found between BWSTT alone and BWSTT with robotic assistance. However, the results of the study clearly demonstrated a longitudinal improvement in QoL as a result of BWSTT. In our study, however, during the longitudinal follow-up, only short-term benefits in QoL were found in the CWT group. The reason for this finding may be attributed to the paucity of patient–therapist interaction in RAGT treatment, and emphasizes the need for a combination of regular and robotic methods in MS patients.</p>
<p>Our study had several limitations; first, the number of patients in each group was small. Power calculation with walking velocity as the primary outcome and mean changes and variance in change, as found in this study, revealed that 39 patients would be needed in each group for demonstration of a significantly moderate effect of 20% (α = 0.05 with power of 80%). There was a difference, although not significant, in the severity of gait disturbances between the groups, being more marked in the RAGT group according to initial EDSS scoring. There were several drop-outs during the treatment regimen, mainly in the RAGT group, and this combined with the high rate of drop-out during the follow-up may have changed the final outcomes. Due to the study structure it was impossible to conduct a blinded study; the fact that patients know they are receiving RAGT treatment can influence their performance and self-reporting.</p>

<title>Summary</title>
<p>To summarize, our results show that RAGT is feasible and safe in MS patients. Although no differences in gait parameters and functional outcomes were found between treatment groups, our small pilot study resulted in significant within-subject improvements. Robot-assisted gait training may be an effective additional therapeutic option in MS patients with severe walking disabilities. However, further randomized studies with a larger number of patients and more effective robotic protocol are needed to investigate whether the addition of RAGT to regular treatment will have an advantage for MS patients.</p>
