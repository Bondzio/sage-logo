<abstract>
<p><bold>Background:</bold> Rotator cuff reconstructions may be improved by adding growth factors, cells, or other biologic factors into the repair zone. This usually requires a biological carrier (scaffold) to be integrated into the construct and placed in the area of tendon-to-bone healing. This needs to be done without affecting the constructs mechanics.</p>
<p><bold>Hypothesis/Purpose:</bold> The hypothesis was that scaffold placement, as an interposition, has no adverse effects on biomechanical properties of double-row rotator cuff repair. The purpose of this study was to examine the effect of scaffold interposition on the initial strength of rotator cuff repairs.</p>
<p><bold>Study Design:</bold> Controlled laboratory study.</p>
<p><bold>Methods:</bold> Twenty-five fresh-frozen shoulders (mean age: 65.5 ± 8.9 years) were randomly assigned to 5 groups. Groups were chosen to represent a broad spectrum of commonly used scaffold types: (1) double-row repair without augmentation, (2) double-row repair with interposition of a fibrin clot (Viscogel), (3) double-row repair with interposition of a collagen scaffold (Mucograft) between tendon and bone, (4) double-row repair with interposition of human dermis patch (ArthroFlex) between tendon and bone, and (5) double-row repair with human dermis patch (ArthroFlex) placed on top of the repair. Cyclic loading to measure displacement was performed to 3000 cycles at 1 Hz with an applied 10- to 100-N load. The ultimate load to failure was determined at a rate of 31 mm/min.</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> There were no significant differences in mean displacement under cyclic loading, slope, or energy absorbed to failure between all groups (<italic>P</italic> = .128, <italic>P</italic> = .981, <italic>P</italic> = .105). Ultimate load to failure of repairs that used the collagen patch as an interposition (573.3 ± 75.6 N) and a dermis patch on top of the reconstruction (575.8 ± 22.6 N) was higher compared with the repair without a scaffold (348.9 ± 98.8 N; <italic>P</italic> = .018 and <italic>P</italic> = .025). No significant differences were found for repairs with the fibrin clot as an interposition (426.9 ± 103.6 N) and the decellularized dermis patch as an interposition (469.9 ± 148.6 N; <italic>P</italic> = .73 and <italic>P</italic> = .35).</p>
<p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Scaffold augmentation did not adversely affect the zero time strength of the tested standard double-row rotator cuff repairs. An increased ultimate load to failure was observed for 2 of the augmentation methods (collagen patch as an interposition and decellularized dermis patch on top of the reconstruction) compared with the nonaugmented repairs.</p>
<p><bold>Clinical Relevance:</bold> Scaffolds intended for application of growth factors or cellular components in a repair situation did not adversely jeopardize the stability of the operative construct.</p>

<body>
<p>Biomechanical strength of primary tendon reconstruction in rotator cuff (RC) repair has been continuously improved over recent years.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0363546512437835">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0363546512437835">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0363546512437835">26</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0363546512437835">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0363546512437835">34</xref></sup> Repaired RC tendon often results in the formation of fibrovascular scar tissue between the tendon and the bone. This formation has been shown to diminish the mechanical properties of the repair, thereby making it prone to structural failure, which may negatively affect clinical outcome.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0363546512437835">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0363546512437835">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0363546512437835">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0363546512437835">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0363546512437835">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0363546512437835">37</xref></sup> Experimental studies have shown promising results with regard to improved healing of rotator cuff reconstructions by adding growth factors, cells, or other biologic factors into the repair zone.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0363546512437835">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0363546512437835">16</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0363546512437835">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0363546512437835">31</xref></sup> This usually requires a biological carrier (scaffold) to be integrated into the construct and placed in the area of tendon-to-bone healing.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0363546512437835">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0363546512437835">8</xref></sup> However, these techniques are still under evaluation and not yet considered standard of care.</p>
<p>Such scaffolds are defined by Longo et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0363546512437835">24</xref></sup> and Derwin et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0363546512437835">12</xref></sup> as temporary scaffolds aimed at enhancing and accelerating the biology of tissue repair. Ideally, such scaffolds would prevent repair gap formation or failure by modulating load distribution at the repair site and promote cell infiltration to allow the scaffold to be replaced by host tissue.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0363546512437835">24</xref></sup> To date, clinical evidence on the use of scaffolds in repairs of RC tears is limited.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0363546512437835">24</xref></sup> The various graft types available have been used as a bridge for nonrepairable tears or on the superior surface of repairs to protect the reconstruction from potentially adverse biomechanical forces.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0363546512437835">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0363546512437835">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0363546512437835">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0363546512437835">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0363546512437835">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0363546512437835">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0363546512437835">32</xref></sup> However, “interpositioning” of the scaffold between the bone and tendon may be favorable if the scaffold (eg, collagen, fibrin) is intended as a biologic carrier and loaded with growth factors or cellular components (eg, mesenchymal stem cells), which may improve the tendon-to-bone healing. This technique has been used previously in the in vivo studies by Rodeo et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0363546512437835">31</xref></sup> and in other studies.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0363546512437835">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0363546512437835">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0363546512437835">22</xref></sup> The biomechanical characteristics of such a tendon-scaffold-bone construct are not known. Placing a scaffold between the tendon and bone in RC repair may jeopardize the primary strength of the repair, as opposed to improving the repair’s properties as a result of the added tissue.</p>
<p>Surgical methods for scaffold application, including the number, type, and location of fixation sutures, contribute to the mechanical performance of the device. Effects of different scaffolds on the repairs’ biomechanical performance can only be tested if the whole construct is evaluated.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0363546512437835">11</xref></sup> We are aware that the development and implementation of a biological option suitable for augmentation of the rotator cuff repair is a multistep process requiring thorough basic science investigation before use in human subjects. In this regard, the intention of this study was only to examine the effect of scaffold interposition on the initial biomechanical strength of rotator cuff repairs.</p>
<p>We hypothesized that placement of various scaffolds (decellularized dermis graft, collagen graft, or fibrin clot) as an interposition at the tendon-bone interface of an RC repair has no adverse effects on the displacement under cyclic loading or the load to failure. The purpose of this study was to demonstrate that interposition of scaffolds between bone and tendon in a standard double-row supraspinatus repair in a human cadaveric model does not adversely affect the constructs’ zero time strength.</p>

<title>Materials And Methods</title>
<sec id="section2-0363546512437835">
<title>Specimen</title>
<p>Specimens were harvested from 25 fresh-frozen cadaveric upper extremities (mean age: 65.5 ± 8.9 years). All donors had died from causes unrelated to the musculoskeletal system and had no known injury or surgery that would have affected the shoulder joint and its surrounding soft tissue. The 25 specimens were randomly assigned to 5 groups. To allow for equal allocation, a blocked randomization scheme was used to assign each specimen to 1 of the 5 treatment conditions, and final groups showed no significant difference in donor age.</p>
<p>Before testing, each shoulder specimen was thawed overnight at room temperature. Specimens were prepared according to previously published methods.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0363546512437835">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0363546512437835">27</xref></sup> Soft tissue was dissected carefully from each specimen to isolate the supraspinatus, infraspinatus, and subscapularis tendons. Tendons were thoroughly checked for any tears or degenerative lesions, and if such were detected, the specimen was excluded. The proximal humerus was then potted using plaster of Paris in rigid polyvinyl chloride piping and secured with screws.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0363546512437835">21</xref></sup> The footprint of the supraspinatus tendon was measured with a digital caliper.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0363546512437835">27</xref></sup> The entire supraspinatus insertion was then released sharply from the greater tuberosity, and the distal 10 mm of the supraspinatus tendon was excised to simulate a rotator cuff defect.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0363546512437835">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0363546512437835">35</xref></sup></p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0363546512437835">
<title>Scaffolds and Repair Groups</title>
<p>The scaffolds chosen for comparison represent several commercially available products.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0363546512437835">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0363546512437835">24</xref></sup> Three different types of scaffold were selected for comparison: fibrin carriers, non-cross-linked collagen scaffolds, and highly cross-linked human dermis scaffolds. Representing a fibrin matrix, a combination of a platelet-rich plasma (PRP) product and a gelling agent (Viscogel, Arthrex, Naples, Florida) was used. A bilayer collagen matrix (Mucograft, Geistlich Pharma, Lucerne, Switzerland) consisting of type I and type III porcine collagen served as a representative of a non-cross-linked pure collagen scaffold.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0363546512437835">20</xref></sup> As a representative of a highly cross-linked human dermis allograft scaffold, the ArthroFlex (LifeNet Health, Virginia Beach, Virginia) decellularized human dermis patch was chosen. To mimic the intraoperative use of the scaffold during a rotator cuff repair, 1 × 2 cm of each scaffold was soaked 30 minutes in a concentrated bone marrow solution known for its increased content of mesenchymal stem cells.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0363546512437835">26</xref></sup> Scaffolds were prepared as close to a “real-life” scenario as possible, so scaffolds intended as cell carriers were soaked in the respective cell suspension previous to implantation. The bone marrow was harvested from the proximal humerus of 1 patient (age: 49 years; male) undergoing rotator cuff surgery the day before testing, and it was concentrated in a centrifugation process (4 minutes/800 rpm) according to Mazzocca et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0363546512437835">26</xref></sup> (IRB#: 08-057-3). The reconstruction groups were defined as the following:</p>

<p>All supraspinatus tendons were reconstructed in a previously described standard double-row repair using 3 anchors.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0363546512437835">27</xref></sup></p>

<title>Group 1 (control)</title>
<p>A 3-anchor double-row RC repair was performed according to previous literature with only slight modifications to standardize the experimental setup.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0363546512437835">27</xref></sup> A double-loaded 5.5-mm PEEK corkscrew anchor (Arthrex) was inserted 15 mm posterior to the biceps sulcus at the cartilage-tendon junction. Sutures were passed through the tendon at a distance of 10 mm medial to the tendon edge with 5 mm distance in between the sutures.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0363546512437835">21</xref></sup> The medial row was fixed using a sliding triple half-hitch knot, followed by alternating simple half-hitches, to a total of 6 throws. One limb of each suture was then crossed over the reconstruction and the second limb was longitudinally traversed. The lateral row was then finally fixed with two 5.5-mm PEEK Swivelock anchors (Arthrex), which were placed 12.5 mm lateral to the medial anchor with a distance of 10 mm between anchors. The reconstruction was grossly evaluated for any obvious failure before testing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0363546512437835">Figure 1</xref>).</p>

<title>Group 2 (fibrin clot interposition)</title>
<p>For the production of the fibrin clot, 20 mL of peripheral blood (drawn from 1 male donor; age: 26 years; IRB#: 10-204-2) was centrifuged at 1500 rpm for 5 minutes and the platelet-rich suspension was aspirated. This suspension was then mixed at a ratio of 10/1 with thrombin and calcium chloride solution to create a fibrin clot. The fibrin clot was soaked in the concentrated bone marrow for 30 minutes. Finally, the clot was positioned on the footprint of the repair after the medial row was fixed as described above and covered with the tendon. The lateral row was then closed according to the above-described technique. When the lateral row was tensioned, a certain amount (approximately 20%) of the viscous fibrin clot was squeezed out at both sides of the repair.</p>

<p>The ArthroFlex (LifeNet Health) decellularized human dermis patch is a highly cross-linked human allograft scaffold. After the membrane was soaked for 30 minutes, the sutures of the medial anchor were passed through the patch and subsequently through the tendon. Subsequent to fixing the medial row, the lateral row was fixed, which placed the patch between the tendon and the bone.

<title>Experimental Testing</title>
<p>Biomechanical evaluation was performed as previously described using an MTS Servo-hydraulic testing system (MTS Systems Corp, Eden Prairie, Michigan) with an accuracy of ±1% of reading (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0363546512437835">Figure 3</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0363546512437835">27</xref></sup> After the completion of each repair, the proximal humerus was fixed with the potting device in a custom fixture device oriented in 45° of abduction.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0363546512437835">21</xref></sup> The supraspinatus muscle and tendon were fixed into a soft tissue clamp, and continuous application of dry ice was used to securely fix the tendon and prevent any slippage. Care was taken to ensure equal and symmetric tension on the tendon before clamping. After the specimen was mounted securely, 2 white reflexing markers with a central black point were fixed on the proximal humerus approximately 5 mm distal to the 2 lateral row anchors. Two similar markers were then fixed onto the tendon at a 5-mm distance proximal to the medial fixation. A video digitizing system that involved video recording of the markers, computer digitization of the markers, creation of centroids representing the center of the markers, and the calculation of distances with MaxTRAQ 2D (Innovision Systems, Inc, Columbiaville, Michigan) was used to evaluate the cyclic displacement according to previous literature (accuracy: 0.5%-1% of the field of view).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0363546512437835">21</xref></sup></p>

<p>An a priori power analysis was calculated with a difference to detect of 70 N for load to failure and a standard deviation of 35 N. It established a sample size of 4 specimens per group with α = 0.05 and β = 0.2 for a power of 80%. Tests of significance for displacement under cyclic loading and ultimate load to failure were performed with analysis of variance (ANOVA), and if significant differences were found, the Tukey post hoc analysis was added to determine which pairwise comparisons were significant. An α level of 0.05 was set for all tests for determination of significance.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The purpose of this study was to demonstrate that interposition of scaffolds in the bone-tendon interface in double-row RC repair does not adversely affect the constructs’ biomechanical properties. No negative effects of scaffold augmentation on the initial strength of the tested constructs were observed. Two of the augmentation methods (collagen patch as an interposition and decellularized dermis patch on top of the reconstruction) resulted in an increase in ultimate load to failure compared with the control repairs.</p>
<p>This study was centered on the notion that the surgical methods described for scaffold application will result in variations of the biomechanical properties of the final construct. Few studies have evaluated the effects of patch augmentations on the biomechanical stability of RC repairs and have shown variable results.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0363546512437835">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0363546512437835">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0363546512437835">33</xref></sup> Most studies have assessed scaffolds for bridged grafting or augmentation of RC repair (ie, the scaffold is applied over the primary tendon repair).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0363546512437835">11</xref></sup> However, very limited data exist on the effects of scaffold augmentation on the biomechanical properties of RC repair in human cadaveric models.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0363546512437835">6</xref></sup></p>
<p>A standard double-row repair using 3 anchors was chosen as fixation technique because we believed that the increased tendon-bone contact of double-row repairs would increase the contact of the scaffold at the tendon-bone interface.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0363546512437835">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0363546512437835">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0363546512437835">30</xref></sup> The biomechanical properties of the repair constructs in this study achieved results comparable with those of previous studies testing different types of double-row repairs in an analogous setup.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0363546512437835">27</xref></sup> These studies showed mean displacement rates of 1.8 to 2.4 mm and mean ultimate loads to failure of 256 to 305 N for their double-row repair techniques.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0363546512437835">27</xref></sup></p>
<p>The tested scaffolds were intended to represent a broad spectrum and were selected because of their potential capabilities as carriers for growth factors or cellular components (eg, concentrated bone marrow aspirate with an increased level of mesenchymal stem cells).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0363546512437835">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0363546512437835">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0363546512437835">31</xref></sup> To simulate a “real-life” scenario, the scaffolds were soaked in a suspension of concentrated bone marrow harvested in a live surgery the day before testing according to a previously published procedure.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0363546512437835">26</xref></sup> This produced a construct that was thought to be comparable with the conditions in which scaffolds would be applied in an operative setting.</p>
<p>Fibrin carriers, which are commonly used in an orthopaedics setting, have been shown to be a viable carrier for the application of mesenchymal stem cells in tendon repair models.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0363546512437835">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0363546512437835">17</xref></sup> Advantages of these scaffolds include their viscous structure, rapid resorption, and the additional growth factor content.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0363546512437835">13</xref></sup> On the other hand, the viscous structure of the fibrin clot makes it prone to being squeezed out under the repair due to the contact pressure of the reconstruction. We observed about 20% of the clot to be squeezed out beneath the repairs performed in this study. Other stable scaffolds, such as non-cross-linked collagen or highly cross-linked dermis patches, may be more suitable to resist this pressure without being squeezed out of the repair. Non-cross-linked collagen matrices have also been used as resorbable carriers for growth factors and mesenchymal stem cell application.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0363546512437835">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0363546512437835">36</xref></sup> The decellularized human dermis patch, which has promised the highest strength because of its dense structure, and comparable patches have also been used before for augmentation of RC repairs in animal models.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0363546512437835">1</xref></sup> In our study, placement of the scaffold on top of the repair resulted in significantly higher loads to failure compared with placement between the tendon and bone. This finding was expected considering that previous studies have shown similar biomechanical effects with placement of a carrier on the top of the repair.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0363546512437835">33</xref></sup></p>
<p>The material properties of the dermis scaffold are different from those of the non-cross-linked collagen scaffold. When soaked, the collagen scaffold is a very flexible construct and compressible. The dermis scaffold, in contrast, has a tough structure and is less compressible even after soaking in the concentrated bone marrow. This may explain the observed advantage for the dermis scaffold as a restraint against suture slippage on top of the construct, and it also may be the reason for less favorable results as an interposition. In summary, non-cross-linked collagen scaffolds demonstrate biomechanical advantages when used as a carrier for biologic factors in the interface between the tendon and the bone, whereas the allograft dermis scaffolds may be more beneficial as a biomechanical support on top of the reconstruction.</p>
<p>There are several weaknesses of this study. The in vitro nature of biomechanical evaluation can be a limiting factor in the application of the findings to the in vivo conditions of the shoulder complex. Accurate replication of these forces in a cadaveric study might be difficult. We used previously published methods and established techniques for measurement to minimize these effects.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0363546512437835">27</xref></sup> The study was powered using pilot data obtained from a small group of specimens. The results of the present study indicate higher variability among the tested groups. Therefore, findings of statistical significance may be due to specimen numbers used for each group (sample size). Biomechanical testing with cadaveric specimens does not allow the evaluation of the biological healing process. Therefore, only conclusions for the biomechanical strength of the repair construct at a time point immediately after surgical reconstruction can be made. However, this study was specifically planned to demonstrate the zero time strength and feasibility of placing a scaffold between the tendon and bone in double-row RC repair. We have no intention to promote a specific type of biological factor (eg, certain growth factors, mesenchymal stem cells) and its effectiveness. The potential of these biological treatments requires further in vivo investigation. In that regard, the data resulting from this study may serve as a basis for the setup of such future models.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Scaffold augmentation did not adversely affect the zero time strength of the tested standard double-row RC repairs. An increased ultimate load to failure was observed for 2 of the augmentation methods compared with the nonaugmented repair (collagen patch as an interposition and decellularized dermis patch on top of the reconstruction).</p>
