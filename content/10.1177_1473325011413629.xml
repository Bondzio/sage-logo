<abstract>
<p>In the Danish employment system social workers have the important institutional task of trying to establish a labour market perspective for each cash benefit recipient, even when the client has other problems in addition to unemployment. The client’s ‘capacity for work’ must be documented and described. In this article we examine the dilemmas that occur in the interaction between clients and social workers. We show how clients try to evade the demands of labour market related identities in their negotiations with social workers. Our analysis focuses on two cases, selected from a vast qualitative material, that represent cases in which the client’s dissatisfaction becomes apparent. The results indicate that clients are active participants who resist, protest against and sometimes even avoid the identities offered by the employment system.</p>

<sec id="sec1-1473325011413629" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title>
<p>Recent years have seen a major change in the discourse on the treatment of unemployed marginalized citizens in the Danish welfare state alongside political change (Caswell et al., 2010, Eskelinen et al., 2010). The national legislation on employment focuses on the clients’ resources rather than on their problems. This creates an overall positive framework for social workers’ interaction with clients in the job centres. The social workers’ task is to try to encourage their clients to construct identities that in one way or another relate to the labour market. This article shows how dilemmas occur when social workers talk with clients who have problematic, marginalized and socially proscribed stories to tell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1473325011413629">Jenkins, 2000</xref>). Taking as our point of departure the concepts of ‘exit’ and ‘voice’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1473325011413629">Hirschman, 1970</xref>), we develop the concept of exit, and show how problematic elements of client identities bring about different ways in which the recipients of cash benefit handle their dissatisfaction with the labour market oriented identities.</p>
<p>Clients’ resistance towards the labour market focus becomes an important factor for the creation of institutional identities that are not forced upon the client, but rather negotiated and co-constructed in collaboration between client and social worker (Eskelinen et al., 2010). The focus of this article is to answer the following questions:</p>
<p><italic>How do clients resist the positive narrative framework</italic> <italic>of active employment policy?</italic></p>
<p><italic>How do clients oppose institutional demands in their interactions with social workers in the job centres?</italic></p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec2-1473325011413629"><title>The empirical context: Danish job centres</title>
<p>The overall goal of the Danish job centres is to make the client independent of the benefits system. The Active Employment Effort Act (2003) aims at helping the unemployed gain employment as ‘quickly and efficiently’ as possible. It is the responsibility of the client to participate in improving his/her situation, for example, by taking part in activation<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1473325011413629">1</xref></sup> measures and in actively looking for work (Olesen 2001). Social workers need to work on establishing a labour market perspective for the clients, even when the client has other problems in addition to unemployment such as mental health issues, addiction or social problems. In 2009 almost 70 percent of cash benefit recipients were categorized as ‘having other problems in addition to unemployment’ according to statistics published by The National Labour Market Authority (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jobindsats.dk">http://www.jobindsats.dk</ext-link>). The resource oriented discourse took a leap forward in 2003, when legislation on the Early Retirement Pension was revised and ‘The Work Capability Method’ was implemented. Using this method the social worker, together with the client, explores the client’s resources within five centrally defined areas deemed important for labour market participation.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1473325011413629">2</xref></sup></p>
<p>If the employability of the client is marginal, it is the task of the social worker to document how and to what extent this is the case. The client is offered different activation measures in the hope that these may provide the client with the necessary competences or support changes. Furthermore, the social worker has a duty to assess the client using the resource profile<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-1473325011413629">3</xref></sup> and the advice of external experts, e.g. health professionals. The assessment process can be long and comprehensive, and may lead to the client being offered another form of benefit. Early Retirement Pension is one option that provides the client with lasting financial support. However, according to the legislation it must not be granted until all other options have been exhausted.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec3-1473325011413629"><title>Negotiating problem identity in institutional settings</title>
<p>Our analysis looks at client identity as it emerges during the client’s interaction with the social worker as well as the narrative framework provided by the institutional setting of Danish job centres. When an unemployed client interacts with a social worker in the job centre, identity is at stake. Our concept of identity is based on Jenkins’s claim that ‘...social identity is never unilateral’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1473325011413629">Jenkins, 2000: 8</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1473325011413629">Holstein and Gubrium (1994)</xref> argue that identity and the ‘self’ are increasingly being negotiated, revealed and produced in a public rather than a private domain. Thus, looking at how individuals behave within a specific institutional setting will provide knowledge about the formation of client identity. Different institutions provide different frameworks for the formation of identity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1473325011413629">Holstein and Gubrium, 1994: 691</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1473325011413629">Gubrium and Holstein (1998: 164)</xref> argue for the importance of including the institutional context when analysing the formation of self, specifically in the case of people processing institutions: ‘People processing institutions elicit, screen, fashion, and variously highlight personal narratives (…) and provide narrative frameworks for conveying personal experience (…) such organizations incite participants to construct the stories they need to do their work’.</p>
<p>Clients’ resistance in social work and in institutional settings has been analysed in numerous ways, for example, as social action in which clients avoid answering certain questions or dismiss certain advice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1473325011413629">Heritage and Sefi, 1992</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1473325011413629">Juhila (2004)</xref> has analysed how clients ‘talk back’ to stigmatized identities. She argues that when clients resist culturally dominant categories, they actually affirm these categories while insisting that they do not apply to themselves. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1473325011413629">Jenkins (2000: 9)</xref> claims that ‘... labelling may evoke resistance’. He underlines that the idea of labelling is not solely applicable to deviance, but also has explanatory efficacy when it comes to positive identifications.</p>
<p>Cash benefit recipients may find themselves unable to convey personal experiences that fit the expectations created by a predominantly resource oriented narrative framework. The social worker at the institutional front line of the active employment policy attempts to apply positive labels to the client, who may or may not perceive him- or herself as ‘potentially employable’. The client may therefore resist this positive labelling in different ways. This resistance is interesting because it enables us to analyse ways in which identities are negotiated and co-produced in the interaction between marginalized clients and social workers within job centres.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec4-1473325011413629"><title>Exit as one response to dissatisfaction</title>
<p>When someone feels dissatisfied with a situation, there are basically two possible responses. First, one can voice a protest to the relevant person or organization responsible for the problematic situation or, second, one can choose the more radical solution of leaving the situation all together. The first option is what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1473325011413629">Hirschman (1970)</xref><sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-1473325011413629">4</xref></sup> calls ‘the voice option’ and the second he calls ‘the exit option’. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1473325011413629">Hirschman (1970: 16)</xref> voice is ‘... a far more “messy” concept because it can be graduated, all the way from the faint grumbling to violent protest’. Hirschman’s theory attempts to build a conceptual bridge between two different models of man: <italic>homo economicus</italic> who is a self-regarding, rational shopper in the market and <italic>homo politicus</italic> who is a social animal in a world of political activity. The first model will automatically use exit as a strategy when dissatisfied whereas the second model will use the strategy of voice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1473325011413629">Klein, 1980</xref>). Since 1970 the idea of voice and exit has been used in a number of different settings such as dissatisfaction within the realm of politics, with consumer goods and, most frequently, when analysing employee responses to dissatisfaction with organizations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1473325011413629">Saunders, 1992</xref>). However, the concepts of voice and exit may also contribute to our understanding of the dilemmas of clients who are dissatisfied with public institutions. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1473325011413629">Brodkin (1997: 25)</xref> argues that the concepts of voice and exit must be used with caution when applied to clients of the welfare state since there are considerable risks attached to the use of both strategies within this context ‘... in which rights are uncertain, “voice” is risky, and “exit” means forgoing basic income support’.</p>
<p>When clients interact with the welfare state, exit may be just as ‘messy’ a concept as voice. Exit is not an easy option. It may mean losing one’s benefits because there are no other providers to turn to. Where customers may decide to use different supermarkets or employees may apply for jobs in other organizations, clients’ options are more restricted. Using the concept of exit to analyse how clients deal with dissatisfaction in their relation to the welfare state, it is necessary to develop the concept of exit further than Hirschman’s original concept. Here we depart from categorical and mutually exclusive concepts of voice and exit in Hirschman’s terms. The subsequent analysis aims especially to discuss different forms of exit strategies, showing clients’ options for expressing dissatisfaction and disagreement with the identities emanating from the resource oriented framework. Our use of the concept of exit focuses on how clients handle their dissatisfaction with the demands they face when interacting with social workers in the job centre. Although unable to exit the institutional set up altogether, clients can attempt to exit on a smaller scale. Possible options are exit from the different demands inherent in the job centre, such as the requirement to be active and of defining oneself in relation to the labour market.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec5-1473325011413629"><title>Methods and empirical material</title>
<p>During our field studies in Danish job centres, our main research interest has been the potentials and dilemmas in social work practice both from a professional and a client point of view (Eskelinen et al., 2008, Eskelinen et al., 2010). Over time we have observed changes in the discourse, practice and effects of the active employment policy. We discovered that the focus on employability and the client’s resources causes dilemmas for the clients as well as for the social workers in this institutional setting. In particular, this happens in interactions in which the client finds him- or herself a long way from the labour market. At the same time, on a national level, analyses of cash benefit recipients have shown that dependency on income support is often a rather permanent condition for many clients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1473325011413629">Arendt et al., 2004</xref>). This is despite the fact that activation efforts ideally are supposed to lead to the client being self-supporting. Many clients receive temporary benefits for long periods of time – a situation that points to failures or unwanted outcomes of the active employment policy. Thus, a substantial part of daily social work in job centres concerns clients with multiple problems. Not only is the majority of clients categorized as such, but these clients find themselves in complex situations and often require comprehensive assistance.</p>
<p>The empirical material in this article stems from two quite different qualitative studies on marginalized clients and social work in Danish job centres. One study (Eskelinen and Olesen, 2010) is a large qualitative study concerning the impact of active employment policy on clients. This study had a longitudinal design involving 19 clients (11 female, 8 male) from two different job centres. The clients were followed over an average period of 12 months (2007–2009) using semi-structured narrative interviews as well as observations of the interaction between the clients and the social workers. The other study (Caswell et al., 2010) is a qualitative study concerning practice in dealing with long-term sick benefit and cash benefit recipients in two job centres in Denmark. The empirical material consists of 49 semi-structured interviews with professionals (social workers and managers), 20 observations of meetings between clients and social workers as well as 15 observations of case meetings with groups of professionals discussing selected clients (2008–2010). Neither of these studies focused specifically on identity work and client resistance. However, we found that further analysis of this material was needed in order to understand how marginalized clients handle their dissatisfaction with the labour market oriented identities on offer within the institutional setting of Danish job centres. Thus two empirical cases, one from each of the above mentioned studies, were selected for further analysis. The cases are not to be regarded as extreme cases. They represent cases in which dissatisfaction comes to the surface through interactions and interviews. They also represent cases in which the clients do not remain passive and obedient, but rather express and act on their frustration and dissatisfaction. The cases were chosen because they clearly illustrate how the dilemmas and dissatisfaction that arise from the clients’ meeting with the political and institutional framework gradually emerge in their interaction with the social worker.</p>
<p>Both clients are cash benefit recipients and categorized as unemployed with other problems in addition to unemployment. <italic>Case K</italic> is a 52-year-old female assistant nurse who was sacked around six years ago because of alcohol abuse. She has been offered alcohol abuse treatment in the healthcare system and she has been participating in different activation measures with the purpose of supporting her return to the labour market. However, her relation to the labour market is still ambiguous. <italic>Case M</italic> is a male cash benefit recipient in his late 30s. He has been homeless, but has just received money from social services for the down payment on an apartment. He had previously been living in a large Danish city, but has recently moved to a smaller municipality. He has (and may still have) a drug addiction and he has been a cash benefit recipient for a number of years. <italic>Case K</italic>’s contact with the job centre was followed during 13 months through recorded interviews, social worker-client talks, as well as through interviews with her social worker. In this analysis we have extracted quotes that illustrate how <italic>K</italic> experiences her interactions with professionals within the political and institutional framework of the active employment policy. The material on <italic>Case M</italic> consists of a recorded social worker-client talk as well as a follow-up interview with the social worker. The interaction between the client and the social worker is one of a series of regular contacts between the client and ‘his’ social worker. In this analysis we use three chronological extracts from the interaction between M and the social worker. Both long-term clients are still in an intermediate situation where further clarification and assessment is needed in order to fulfil the requirements of documentation. Activation has been used as the primary ‘treatment’ for the clients’ problems, so far without the desired effect.</p>
<p>We use extracts from interviews and interactions to describe how the clients in question use voice and exit as strategies to manage their dissatisfaction with the labour market oriented identities offered within the job centre. Interviews can be regarded as researcher provoked data, whereas interactions can be seen as naturally occurring data that derive from situations which exist independently of the researcher’s intervention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1473325011413629">Silverman, 2001</xref>). In this context both types of data provide insight into the dilemmas that occur in the interaction between clients and social workers.</p>
<p>Our analysis of interactions and narratives of interaction between the job centre and the client is based on a critical discursive tradition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1473325011413629">Billig, 1999</xref>) that is informed by a dialogic perspective on conversation analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1473325011413629">Linell, 1998</xref>). Critical discourse analysis aims at understanding the social as an ongoing production and reproduction of meaning with a specific focus on uncovering societal changes. The dialogical perspective implies a specific focus on the contexts in which the interaction takes place.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-1473325011413629">5</xref></sup> Drawing on critical discourse analysis as well as a dialogically inspired variant of conversation analysis combines an empirical focus on linguistic utterances by participants with a focus on a macro-level political and institutional framework.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec6-1473325011413629"><title>Raising the voice or finding an exit: How clients resist the narrative framework of the job centre</title>
<p>Social work within an active employment policy can be regarded as a transformative practice that focuses on changing a client’s social position from being unemployed to something else (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1473325011413629">Mäkitalo, 2006</xref>). The analysis shows how clients use different voice and exit strategies to resist the identities available within the institutional framework of the job centre and in negotiation with the social worker. The analysis highlights three different identities that are negotiated by the client and the social worker in the process of assessment.</p>
<sec id="sec7-1473325011413629"><title>Resisting identity as someone being dependent on cash benefit</title>
<p>The first extract illustrates the basic situation in which cash benefit recipients find themselves: they are financially dependent on the welfare state and their benefit is paid <italic>quid pro quo</italic> conditional on their participation in different forms of activation. In this particular case the client distances herself from the category of cash benefit recipient. She finds the category problematic in two respects. First, the benefit is limited which has consequences for her way of life. Second, the client is obliged to participate in activation measures, but there is no guarantee that activation will improve her chances of getting a job.</p><disp-quote>
<p>Interviewer: What do you think your future will be like if you get or don’t get a job respectively?</p></disp-quote><disp-quote>
<p>Client: It will probably look better than it does now on cash benefit, if I had a job and had a different responsibility other than just being at home and looking after my two cats. Also financially of course, because you are totally blocked, you know you have no freedom of action. It’s just repetition after repetition. If they didn’t discontinue my cash benefit I would stay at home.</p></disp-quote>
<p>The client is voicing her protest to the interviewer and revealing her critical opinion of her position as a cash benefit recipient. She points to two possible exits from this situation. One option is staying at home, thus being able to avoid the institutional demands that she finds meaningless (‘repetition after repetition’). However, in her opinion this is not a realistic option, as it would cause her to lose her benefit, leaving her in a financially problematic situation. The other possible exit is getting a job. This option is a positive one leading to a better situation, including other responsibilities than her present ones (‘just being at home and looking after my cats’). Besides being financially independent, a labour market affiliation would give her a legitimate status both in relation to the welfare system and in her own perspective. However, this exit is not so straightforward since she has not had a job for six years and her former attempts to return to the labour market have failed.</p>
<p>The client directs her dissatisfaction towards the welfare system’s way of treating her. She finds that the system is overruling her in two ways: ‘They’ force her to participate in activation measures that she finds useless, and, she has to obey because otherwise she will lose her means of existence. She feels caught in an asymmetric relation to the welfare system, without freedom of action and with very limited possible exits, if any. The client’s resistance towards an identity as someone being on cash benefit mirrors the risks pointed out by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1473325011413629">Brodkin (1997)</xref> when applying the idea of exit to welfare state settings: exit is hazardous because it jeopardizes the financial situation of the client.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec8-1473325011413629"><title>Resisting identity as someone who is fit for work</title>
<p>The next example takes as its point of departure a cash benefit recipient who argues against the institutional narrative, claiming that he is simply not fit for work. The social worker is obliged to assess if the client is, or can be transformed into being, fit for work. If this is not the case, the law states that it must be assessed how and why he is unfit for work. The client manages his dissatisfaction by using voice to protest against the identity as someone not yet adequately documented as being unfit for work.</p><disp-quote>
<p>Client: I will never get into the labour market with all my meniscus damage and stuff</p>
<p>SW: no... Yes.... yes</p>
<p>SW: He [the doctor] writes... yes, he writes or... that there are some wear damages in your neck. That is what he writes, isn’t it?</p>
<p>Client: yes that is my entire meniscus throughout my neck</p>
<p>SW: Yes...yes</p>
<p>Client: That was also what I said to you... I haven’t got that swaying...</p>
<p>SW: yes</p>
<p>Client: I was already told this from [last municipality he lived in]</p>
<p>SW: yes... yes.. yes that is...</p>
<p>Client: but it seems that....</p>
<p>SW: but to get on with that pension, then we have to try to assess your situation, right? … That is also what we have talked about, right?</p>
<p>Client: Assess?</p>
<p>SW: yes, well, what I am thinking, is, that we need to try to find out, if you can go to some place where they can make some descriptions of you. How you manage your everyday life.</p>
<p>Client: but in my everyday life, I just lie on my sofa,</p>
<p>SW: yes</p>
<p>Client: almost all day to rest my neck</p>
<p>SW: Yes but that is what we need to see if we can get a description of.</p>
<p>Client: but you have got that description fifty times already...</p></disp-quote>
<p>The client expresses his critical opinion and uses a voice strategy that is mainly based on his insisting on a different storyline from that of the social worker. The client clearly understands that the labour market perspective is central when it comes to interacting with social workers in the job centre. The client himself introduces this perspective by replying that he will never be able to get into the labour market. The line followed by the social worker aims at getting the client to accept that in order to move the case forward, possibly towards an Early Retirement Pension, more assessment is needed to describe his capacity for work. The client, however, does not accept this line. His utterances are similarly consistent in resisting and questioning the demands put on him by the social worker. He voices his protest making two claims. First, his neck hurts; he has meniscus damage and needs to lie on the sofa all day to rest. Second, he protests against the need to obtain further descriptions of his situation. The social worker uses the voice of the doctor to play down the issue of the neck (‘some wear damages’) but the client opposes this by underlining the magnitude of the problem (‘my entire meniscus throughout my neck’).</p>
<p>The client continues to persist in this voice strategy and the social worker plays the role of the active listener, acknowledging the client’s statements by using the word ‘yes’ no less than eight times. She then uses pauses and the word ‘but’ to shift the focus of the conversation. The social worker exercises her discretion and states that further assessment is needed in order to move the case forward, possibly towards a pension. She tries to create a mutual storyline by referring to a talk they have had previously (‘what we have talked about’), ending her sentences by using the word ‘right?’ to appeal to the client to join this line. However, the client holds on to his critical voice strategy and does not accept the social worker’s invitations. He simply questions the whole idea of further assessment and opposes the need for external experts to document his everyday life. First, by positioning himself as the expert (‘I just lie on my sofa – almost all day to rest my neck’) and then, by referring to previous documentation possibly provided by other experts (‘you have got that description fifty times already’). However, there is limited room for him to convey his personal experience of being someone who has severe neck pain and who is unfit for work, as the next extract shows.</p><disp-quote>
<p>Client: is it not enough that I have been in pain so many times?</p>
<p>SW: no it really is not</p>
<p>Client: No, no, you have to be in pain one last time (snuffles) that is also one of the reasons why most of all I feel like going back to [the old municipality]</p></disp-quote>
<p>The client finds himself confronted with a lack of compliance with his voice strategy. He then moves on to a possible exit strategy. He introduces the idea of leaving the municipality and returning to the municipality where he lived previously. Exit in the shape of changing municipality does not represent a definitive exit from the welfare state as such. The client will be faced with similar demands of assessment and activity when entering the new municipality, according to the national legislation. However, the interpretation of these demands may differ; for instance, research shows that access to Early Retirement Pension varies substantially between municipalities in Denmark (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1473325011413629">Kolodziejczyk et al., 2010</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec9-1473325011413629"><title>Resisting identity as someone who can participate in assessment measures</title>
<p>The obligatory requirement to participate in the assessment measures of the job centre often causes dissatisfaction for recipients of cash benefit. They do not necessarily see the point of repeated efforts that have not previously resulted in any improvement of their situation. Extract 4 illustrates how the client experiences the system as working after its own logic and, simultaneously, that her needs and opinion are overlooked.</p><disp-quote>
<p>Client: During the time I have been ill and this [receiving cash benefit] I have been on so many courses and I’m so sick and tired of it, because they are the same over and over again. They believe that this would be good for me. But how do I feel about it? They have been throwing pills down my throat and they made me deathly ill, and Antabus, which also made me deathly ill, and job training, courses, and talks, all of it.</p></disp-quote>
<p>She accordingly remains critical towards the activation measure she has been attending. The subsequent extract is from the end of her course.</p><disp-quote>
<p>Client: I have been out here for one year now. I haven’t moved one step further. They have thrown me into the [outpatient clinic for alcohol abuse]. That is that bloody thing. That is what I have gained from it. Not to mention the other courses they also wanted to throw me on. Those just made me have a breakdown.</p></disp-quote>
<p>The client’s main narrative is the feeling of powerlessness in relation to others who make decisions about her life, and how these perceived injustices have harmed her. This is very much the case in relation to measures within the active employment policy, but she feels in a similar way about the treatment she received in the healthcare system. Using the word ‘they’ she is criticising the powerful social and healthcare systems that are overruling her and ‘throwing’ her into activation as well as treatment without asking how she feels about it. She finds that her situation has deteriorated rather than improved (‘I haven’t moved one step further’) in the course of the activation efforts she has been exposed to. At the same time, her possibilities for voicing her dissatisfaction have proved very limited because she is placed in measures she opposes.</p>
<p>Resisting the identity as someone who is capable of being active is often part of the client’s negotiations in meetings with social workers in the job centre. However, activity is required even if it is directed at activities documenting lack of resources and limitations for future labour market participation, as the next extract will illustrate.</p><disp-quote>
<p>SW: yeah but then you can say, we can plan that it will be a limited period, in which it takes place, and after that period, then we will get a description of you, and then we will see how they describe you</p>
<p>Client: yeah but I won’t turn up half the times</p>
<p>SW: No</p>
<p>Client: because I can’t do that</p>
<p>SW: No no, but that is okay</p>
<p>Client: but that will be a failure for me</p>
<p>SW: yes, that is just fine if you say that I cannot do that, right? But then all you have to do is call them and say, that today I cannot make it, because my back is hurting that does not need to feel like a failure</p>
<p>Client: [mumbles something inaudible, pushes the chair out, opens the door and slams it behind him]</p>
<p>At the beginning of the extract the social worker once again attempts to encourage the client to participate (‘for a limited period’) in a process of assessment. The client’s response is a reluctant ‘yeah, but’ followed by the statement that he will be absent from this process half of the time. As mentioned previously, the process of documenting working capacity is a process in which the client and the social worker are mutually dependent. The social worker has difficulty moving the case forward without the active participation of the client, and the client will often need the support of the welfare state in order to change his or her social position from being unemployed to something else. The absent client,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-1473325011413629">6</xref></sup> as one who does not turn up, poses a problem to the job centre. Absence can be seen as an exit strategy, although risky, as it jeopardizes the continuation of social benefits. If a client does not turn up at one of the regular ‘individual job interviews’ or is absent from an activation or assessment offer, the job centre can sanction this by discontinuing the benefits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1473325011413629">Statutory Order of the Active Employment Effort Act 2009</xref>). In the extract above, the client warns the social worker about his likely absence if he were to be submitted to an assessment measure. However, the social worker deals with this by saying that it is only the unaccounted for absence that is problematic (‘all you have to do is call them’). This prompts an immediate response from the client, as he claims that absence will be a failure for him. The social worker holds on to the institutional narrative of assessment, rather than the client narrative of personal failure and defeat. Her focus is that absence is fine so long as it is accounted for, as it will contribute to documenting his lack of resources. The client’s exit strategy of getting up and leaving the room can be seen as a response to the social worker’s professional reframing of the client’s social problem.</p>
<p>Within the perspective of negotiating client identities, two identities appear to be at stake in these cases. One identity is that of a client, who accepts the demands of the welfare system and plays along with the institutional requirements. The other identity at stake here is the role of the client who is already aware of his lack of resources, who is not well, and who is unwilling to be exposed to further failure. The lack of latitude within the institutional framework of the job centre for conveying a personal story of problems and being unwell can promote the clients to use voice and exit strategies in their interaction with the social workers.</p></disp-quote>

<sec id="sec10-1473325011413629" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title>
<p>Internationally, Danish welfare benefits are considered to be generous. They are based on a universal distribution model that aims to provide a safety net for all citizens. Nevertheless, recently there has been a movement away from the universality of the welfare model. Activation reforms have increased the requirements placed on the unemployed and, in turn, introduced harsher penalties for their failure to meet them, thus placing greater emphasis on client compliance (Caswell et al., 2010, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1473325011413629">Larsen and Van Berkel, 2009</xref>). At the same time, the discourse on active employment policy in Denmark emphasizes the resources of clients rather than their problems.</p>
<p>Interactions between clients with problematic and proscribed stories to tell, and social workers working at the front line of active employment policy are to some extent defined by the political and institutional framework. However, theoretical inspiration from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1473325011413629">Jenkins (2000)</xref>, as well as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1473325011413629">Holstein and Gubrium (1994)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1473325011413629">Gubrium and Holstein (1998)</xref> allows us to recognize not only the constraints placed on the client and the professional by the system, but also opportunities for clients to resist and oppose the identities on offer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1473325011413629">Juhila et al., 2010</xref>).</p>
<sec id="sec11-1473325011413629"><title>Identity at stake</title>
<p>Our focus has been to describe and analyse the resource-based approach, the positive institutional narrative and not least their consequences for clients who are in a marginal position. Being active is not only a requirement of those clients categorized as having unemployment as their only problem. Active participation is also required of clients with substantial problems in addition to unemployment. Establishing a labour market perspective includes the institutional task of the social workers in collaboration with the clients to exclude labour market participation as a future option. This will often mean that clients have to participate in prolonged assessment measures. The limbo of the assessment process can itself represent a challenge to the client’s perception of him- or herself and therefore becomes relevant for the client’s negotiations of identity. The social worker at the job centre needs to ‘orchestrate’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1473325011413629">Aronsson and Cederborg, 1994</xref>) the direction and focus of the talk in order to reach this goal. This may include disattending utterances made by the client, cutting the client short, as well as repeating or elaborating on the institutional position (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1473325011413629">Buttny, 1996</xref>) as shown in the analysis above.</p>
<p>When analysing negotiations between social workers and clients on client identity, it becomes clear that although structured by the institutional agenda, the outcome of the interaction is not a predetermined matter. Resistance from the client, as well as clients using exit and voice to manage their dissatisfaction, plays a major role in what is mutually accomplished in meetings between social workers and clients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1473325011413629">Juhila et al., 2010</xref>). However, when clients interact with an employment system that primarily focuses on labour market potential it is the responsibility of the client to introduce alternative and competing narratives. The clients in this article find themselves confronted by a resource and labour market focus that they do not acknowledge. They also find themselves confronted by possible identities relating to the labour market discourse to which they object.</p>
<p>We show how clients participate in negotiations of identities offered in their interaction with social workers in the job centre. Three different identities have been presented to illustrate different forms of resistance from the client. One identity is that of being dependent on cash benefit. Although clients may find themselves opposing this identity, the price for exit is high and clients may find themselves having to accept the asymmetry inherent in this identity. Another identity is that of being fit for work. Even when clients find themselves very far from that, this identity still plays a part because it needs to be dismissed as an option. The last identity presented in the analysis is that of participating in assessment measures. This identity is closely linked to the demands on the client to be active. Resisting this identity may not only cause problems for the client, but even for the social worker who cannot perform his or her institutional task without the client’s participation.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec12-1473325011413629"><title>A graduated use of the concept of exit</title>
<p>The concepts of voice and exit have enabled us to illuminate how macro-elements of active employment policy and the demands for the clients’ active participation are re-enacted at a micro-level when clients negotiate possible identities in their interaction with social workers. The concepts of voice and exit offer an opportunity to observe that clients are not merely passive objects who are having certain institutional identities forced upon them, but rather active participants who resist, protest against and sometimes even avoid certain identities offered by the employment system.</p>
<p>The original concept of exit implies a strong and active choice in finding a better alternative. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1473325011413629">Hirschman (1970)</xref>, voice is the only way to react when the exit option is unavailable, which according to him is the case in relation to the state. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1473325011413629">Brodkin (1997)</xref> argues, slightly less radically, that exit means leaving the position as client and no longer receiving benefits.</p>
<p>When we apply the concept of exit to clients in the Danish employment system, we find that their alternatives are limited. Exiting means giving up on the current situation and opting out rather than positively accepting an alternative option. However, we find that both voice and exit options <italic>are</italic> used by clients when attempting to manage their dissatisfaction. Clients use voice continually to protest against the narrow employment focus of the cash benefit system. Furthermore, we find that clients also use exit, although in a less categorical way. Whereas previous research applying the concepts of voice and exit has mainly focused on voice being a ‘messy’ concept (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1473325011413629">Hirschman, 1970</xref>), we find that exit seems to be equally ‘messy’. When exit is used as a strategy to express dissatisfaction with the welfare state, it is not the simple form of exit we may find in other arenas. Exit then becomes a graduated concept because the client cannot ultimately exit the role of cash benefit recipient without forgoing his or her basic income. Exit is not leaving the welfare system all together, but rather exiting from the demands placed on cash benefit recipients. Thus, graduated forms of exit take the shape of moving to a different municipality, walking out of or being absent from meetings, activation or assessment measures. Another exit strategy is the option of getting an Early Retirement Pension. This is a possible exit from the notion of being ‘on the way’ to inclusion into the labour market, since Early Retirement Pension is a permanent benefit and generally means a complete exit from the labour market. It is also an exit from the present status of cash benefit recipient, and, most importantly, an exit from the demands this status entails. Albeit negative and limited, clients use exit to resist and oppose different labour market oriented identities. We have shown that clients use these dissatisfaction strategies although they may be risky and hazardous.</p>
<p>The article set out to illustrate how clients resist the positive narrative framework of active employment policy by using different forms of exit when negotiating possible identities. We have shown how clients, in diverse ways, question the relevance of the inherent labour market focus and how they strive to evade the institutional demands. This does not necessarily represent deliberate client strategies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1473325011413629">Hydén, 2001</xref>). It does represent, however, the clients balancing on a knife-edge while attempting to hold on to their dignity as well as their means of existence.</p>
