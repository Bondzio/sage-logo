<abstract>
<p>We report a case of massive pulmonary embolism in a 63-year-old female caregiver of her terminally ill husband. Venous thromboembolism in family caregivers is a rare but a serious problem. Increased awareness and implementation of policies and guidelines to decrease potentially preventable venous thromboembolism are vital to help prevent unnecessary death, to increase patient safety, and to contain rising costs in health care.</p>

<title>Case</title>
<p>A 59-year-old male patient, bedridden after left leg amputation for mixoid liposarcoma, right leg amputation for diabetic foot, and severe right hand lymphedema due to axillary lymph nodes metastases of liposarcoma, was admitted to the oncology department for palliative and end-of-life treatment. His 63-year-old wife stayed at his bedside approximately 20 to 22 hours everyday. Most of the time she sat in a chair and at night slept on the chair. On day 19 of hospitalization, the patient’s wife felt left-sided pleuritic chest pain accompanied by breathing difficulty and was referred to the emergency room. </p>
<p>On physical examination, her heart rate was 80 beats/min, blood pressure of 106/61 mm Hg, tachypnea of 22 breaths/min, and hypoxemia with oxygen saturation 83% on room air. There were no clinical signs of deep vein thrombosis. Electrocardiogram and chest X-ray were normal. Laboratory evaluation was remarkable for a D-dimer of 883 ng/mL (reference range &lt;250 ng/mL). The patient’s medical history was remarkable only for essential hypertension treated with bisoprolol and ramipril.</p>
<p>Contrast-enhanced chest computed tomography demonstrated bilateral massive pulmonary emboli with thrombus that filled the right main pulmonary artery and multiple filling defects in segmental pulmonary arteries (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1049909111426137">Figure 1</xref>). The patient was treated with low-molecular-weight heparin, enoxoparin, with improvement in symptoms. She was discharged 3 days later. Her husband died on the same day.</p>

<p>Because the primary caregiver of a terminally ill person is often a family member, it is important to understand that caregiving can adversely affect the caregivers’ health. The demands of caregiving contribute directly, to both the psychological and the physical health of the caregivers. The practical challenges of day-to-day care of the terminally ill patients are so demanding that the caregivers tend to neglect their own physical and mental state.<sup>

</p>
<p>Spousal caregivers identified many of the negative reactions, such as fatigue or weariness, depression, anger and sadness, financial stresses, and lack of time.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1049909111426137">2</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>Studies have also shown that women’s health is more likely to be adversely affected by caregiving than men’s.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1049909111426137">3</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>Ramsay et al reported that the incidence of idiopathic deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism is much higher in nurses than in women of childbearing age in the general population.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1049909111426137">4</xref>
</sup> </p>
<p>We have found no reference in the literature regarding the incidence of venous thromboembolism in family caregivers. On one hand, family caregiving demands significant physical efforts, on the other hand, most of the time the caregivers sit in inconvenient armchairs near a patient's bed, comparable with long distance flights.</p>
<p>Prolonged sitting and sleeping in armchairs are a recognized risk factor for venous thromboembolism, mainly caused by immobilization and local venous drain deficiency.</p>
<p>In our opinion, venous thromboembolism in family caregivers is a rare but serious problem. However, increased awareness and implementation of policies and guidelines to decrease potentially preventable venous thromboembolism is vital to help prevent unnecessary death, to increase patient safety, and to contain rising costs in health care.</p>
