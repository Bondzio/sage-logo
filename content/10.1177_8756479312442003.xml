<abstract>
<p>A Sister Mary Joseph nodule (SMJN) is a malignancy located in the periumbilical region. Often misinterpreted as a simple hernia, it is associated with advanced metastatic cancer. First reported in 1846, its primary sources include the gastrointestinal system and female reproductive sites. The most common origins include gastrointestinal (52%), gynecologic (28%), stomach (23%), and ovarian (16%). The presence of SMJN usually indicates widespread disease and is associated with a poor prognosis and complex therapeutic implications, with average patient survival of only 10 to 11 months after diagnosis. This report demonstrates the capability of sonography to evaluate soft tissue periumbilical masses, describes their sonographic appearance, and evaluates the utility of sonography to accurately locate the SMJN for biopsy.</p>

<body>
<p>On a routine abdominal sonogram, a solid vascular mass was discovered in the umbilical region. The prior computed tomography (CT) studies reported this as a simple hernia. A surgical consult also reported this as an “umbilical protuberance, most likely due to increased intra-abdominal pressure.” Despite these reports, the gastroenterologist suspected the mass was a Sister Mary Joseph nodule (SMJN). A biopsy was performed, which resulted in a diagnosis of malignant epithelioid mesothelioma. This case contradicted the common perception that all umbilical masses were only simple hernias. Greater care needs to be taken when interrogating the umbilical region to separate the benign (hernia) from the malignant mass.</p>
<p>The discovery of a metastatic mesothelioma in the umbilical region prompted this cohort study, collecting data on all new or suspected umbilical masses. Prior studies have been written on SMJN, but most have a limited number of patients, often reporting only one or two cases.</p>
<p>CT imaging has long been used to obtain images of patients’ internal structures. However, it does lack the ability to image small structures with detail. This can result in false-negative results. The most striking of these is that not all masses protruding through the abdominal wall are hernias.</p>
<p>This study was conducted to show that sonography, in conjunction with CT or alone, can evaluate soft tissue abdominal paraumbilical masses to determine if the suspected hernia is in fact a metastatic implant. The sonographic appearance of actual SMJNs was compared with that of other modalities. The study also evaluated the utility of sonography to accurately locate the SMJN for biopsy and determine whether the addition of sonographic imaging would have a positive impact differentiating a simple hernia from that of a metastatic mass.</p>
<sec id="section1-8756479312442003" sec-type="materials|methods">
<title>Materials and Methods</title>
<p>This study was conducted starting in August 2003 on all patients with a solid mass herniating through the umbilicus or mass in the periumbilical region. The study was limited to patients who presented to the radiology department and had a CT and/or sonographic study performed. Patients with known umbilical hernias were excluded. When a suspected SMJN was seen in one modality, the records were searched for all previous imaging records that pertained to this condition. This extended the dates back to August 2000 and resulted in a total of 13 patients (male, n = 3; female, n = 10) evaluated retrospectively. The patients ranged in age from 57 to 89 with an average age of 71. Two new patients presented during the course of preparing the manuscript, and their data have been included in the analysis as well, giving a total of 15 (male, n = 4; female, n = 11). This extended the dates of the study from May 2000 to March 2011. The patients’ age range also increased, from 52 to 89 years, with a mean age of 72.</p>
<p>To comply with Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) regulations, approval for this study was obtained from the director of patient care services and the hospital radiology committee to perform this study. Approval was granted such that the author was the sole reviewer of the imaging and medical chart information. To ensure anonymity, all patient information was removed from the collected imaging files and chart data. A case study number was then assigned to each patient, eliminating all patient information from the compiled information.</p>
<sec id="section2-8756479312442003">
<title>Equipment</title>
<p>All sonographic examinations were performed by staff sonographers. All procedures were performed using available sonographic equipment, including the following: Acuson 128 XP/10 (Mountain View, California), Sequoia (Mountain View, California), GE LOGIQ 9 (General Electric, Waukesha, Wisconsin), and Phillips IU22 (Bothell, Washington). A high-frequency (7–12 MHz) broadband linear array transducer was used to obtain most of the superficial images. To obtain images from deeper structures, a lower frequency (3–5 MHz) curve linear transducer was used.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-8756479312442003">
<title>Procedure</title>
<p>Information was obtained from the review of the medical record and medical imaging studies of patients having a suspected umbilical lesion on either CT or sonographic studies. The CT and sonogram findings were separated into eight categories (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-8756479312442003">Table 1</xref>).</p>

<p>In the CT findings category, only those with known history of cancer or imaging evidence of a lesion were included. In the sonographic category, only those suspicious for tumor were included. The medical records were reviewed for all patients with a suspected tumor on CT to determine if a sonogram was performed.</p>
<p>The location of the suspected SMJN was meticulously scanned with a broadband linear transducer using the highest frequency possible. When the lesion was large, it was necessary to use a curved linear transducer with a lower frequency to image the entire nodule. Normal gray-scale imaging along with color or power Doppler and tissue harmonics were used to better delineate the sonographic appearance of the nodule. Care was taken to vary the position and angle of the transducer while imaging in attempt to obtain the best image possible.</p>
<p>When CT images were available, they were reviewed to determine the general location of the nodule prior to sonographic imaging. This is especially helpful when external signs such as swelling or redness were not present. When suspected mesenteric implants were seen on CT, their location was determined and attempts were made to image them sonographically (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-8756479312442003">Figure 1A</xref>,<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-8756479312442003">B</xref>).</p>

<p>Core biopsies were performed when possible to confirm the presence of a malignant metastasis. Fine-needle aspirations could also be performed, but this requires a cytopathologist; either method can provide results with minimal risk to the patient.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-8756479312442003">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-8756479312442003">2</xref></sup> When large intra-abdominal masses were present along with a suspected SMJN, only the superficial lesion was biopsied (five of six cases in this study). This decreased the risk of complications to the patient.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>Fifteen patients with a suspicious umbilical mass were found. There were 4 male and 11 female patients ranging in age from 52 to 89 years, with a mean age of 72 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-8756479312442003">Table 2</xref>). Of the 15 cases, all had CT imaging, whereas sonographic imaging was performed on 13. Six of the 15 had a biopsy performed on the nodule, and pathology results were available. Biopsies were not performed on the remainder for various reasons, including patient demise, known history of cancer and the family felt no need for the additional test, or the patient was transferred to hospice prior to biopsy.</p>

<p>Sonograms were performed in 3 of the 15 cases as the first imaging modality. CT was obtained in 7 of the 15 cases as the first imaging modality and the only imaging modality in 2 cases. In the remaining 3 cases, CT and sonographic imaging were performed on the same day (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-8756479312442003">Table 3</xref>). Thirteen of 15 patients had both sonogram and CT examinations performed. One patient not having sonography was transferred to another facility and lost to follow-up. The second patient who did not have sonography had a history of colon cancer; he elected to have no additional treatment and was transferred to hospice. Of the 15 patients in which CT was performed, seven CT scans were reported as simple hernia, four did not report the mass, and one was reported as likely/possible hematoma (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-8756479312442003">Table 4</xref>). CT ultimately suggested a mass in 7 of the 15 patients. Of the 13 patients in whom a sonogram was performed, all were reported as a mass with biopsy performed or suggested.</p>

<p>A Sister Mary Joseph nodule is a malignancy located in the periumbilical region. It often presents as a firm, indurated umbilical nodule. When present, it is associated with advanced metastatic cancer and generally indicates a poor prognosis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-8756479312442003">3</xref></sup></p>
<sec id="section6-8756479312442003">
<title>Origin of the Name and Condition</title>
<p>The first published report of cancer involving the umbilicus was in 1846,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-8756479312442003">4</xref></sup> when the first case of umbilical metastasis originating from the stomach was reported.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-8756479312442003">5</xref></sup> The rarity of umbilical metastasis was later described by William J. Mayo of the Mayo Clinic in 1928, referring to it as a “pants-button umbilicus.”<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-8756479312442003">6</xref></sup> In 1949, Sir Hamilton Bailey used the phrase “Sister Mary Joseph’s nodule” in his book <italic>Demonstrations of Physical Signs in Clinical Surgery</italic> to describe all metastatic lesions of the umbilicus, and this term remains in current use today.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-8756479312442003">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-8756479312442003">8</xref></sup></p>
<p>Sister Mary Joseph (1856–1939), born as Julia Demsey,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-8756479312442003">9</xref></sup> worked at St Mary’s Hospital in Rochester, Minnesota, beginning in 1889 and was made superintendent there in 1892. As a surgical assistant for Dr Mayo, Sister Mary Joseph was responsible for prepping patients scheduled for surgery. It was while performing this task she first identified the clinical signs that bear her name. She noted that some patients discovered to have diffuse intra-abdominal cancer at surgery had unusual nodules located around the umbilicus.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-8756479312442003">3</xref></sup></p>

<title>Anatomy and Circulation of the Umbilical Region</title>
<sec id="section8-8756479312442003">
<title>Embryologic Development</title>
<p>The umbilicus is a complex structure located on the abdominal wall between the peritoneum and transversalis fascia appearing as an invaginated scar. After birth, the fetal umbilical cord structures develop into ligaments or peritoneum folds. The median umbilical ligament results from the obliterated urachus. The umbilical arteries become the medial umbilical ligaments, and the left umbilical vein becomes the ligamentum teres continuing on to form the falciform ligament in the liver. Inferior epigastric vessels and, sometimes, a vestigial vitelline duct connecting the umbilicus to the ileum can be recognized on the lateral umbilical folds.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-8756479312442003">10</xref></sup></p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-8756479312442003">
<title>Arterial Circulation</title>
<p>The umbilical region shows a rich arterial supply that includes the inferior epigastric and deep circumflex iliac branches of the external iliac artery, as well as the superior epigastric branch of the internal mammary artery.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-8756479312442003">10</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-8756479312442003"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-8756479312442003"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-8756479312442003"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-8756479312442003"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-8756479312442003">15</xref></sup></p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-8756479312442003">
<title>Venous Circulation</title>
<p>A network of vessels that drain to three main regions accomplishes venous drainage from the umbilical region. The superficial epigastric vein drains caudally into the femoral vein. The internal mammary veins accept a network of small vessels and continue cranially, emptying into the axillary vein.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-8756479312442003">11</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-8756479312442003"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-8756479312442003"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-8756479312442003"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-8756479312442003">15</xref></sup> Finally, small veins are connected to the portal system by way of the ligamentum teres.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-8756479312442003">10</xref></sup></p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-8756479312442003">
<title>Lymphatic System</title>
<p>Lymphatic drainage of the umbilical region often follows the venous system. The lymphatic system drains the umbilical region to the axillary, inguinal, and para-aortic lymph nodes. It can be further separated into superficial and deep systems. The superficial system connects and drains into the axillary nodes from above the umbilicus and the inguinal nodes from below the umbilicus. The deeper lymphatic network connects to and drains into the internal thoracic nodes and courses to the nodes around the external iliac arteries and/or abdominal para-aortic nodes. Other branches pass along the falciform ligament, piercing the diaphragm and entering the anterior mediastinum.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-8756479312442003">16</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-8756479312442003"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-8756479312442003"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-8756479312442003">19</xref></sup></p>
<p>Ligaments that connect with the umbilicus are remnants from embryologic development. These include the ligamentum teres and median umbilical ligament. The remnant of the vitelline duct, which connected the yolk sac to the midgut, is sometimes present connecting the umbilicus to the ileum. It is this vast network of arterial, venous, lymphatic communications as well as ligamental attachments that results in metastasis to the umbilical region and may account for the variety of cancers that metastasize to this region.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-8756479312442003">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-8756479312442003">16</xref></sup></p>

The second patient was transferred to another facility where a biopsy was not performed. In each of these cases, the patient had a history of cancer, so it was felt that a biopsy was unnecessary.

<p>In most cases of SMJN, the route of metastasis is unclear.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-8756479312442003">2</xref></sup> However, the most common routes for metastatic lesions involving the umbilicus area are thought to be arterial circulation, venous circulation, or direct extension.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-8756479312442003">15</xref></sup> Lymphatic spread also occurs through one of four sets of lymphatic ducts that pass through this region.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-8756479312442003">3</xref></sup></p>

<p>Although imaging may suggest the presence of a cancerous lesion in the periumbilical umbilicus, a biopsy is required for a definitive diagnosis. This can be obtained safely through a fine-needle aspiration (FNA) or core biopsy and can expedite patient management.</p>
<p>FNA is a rapid, cost-effective diagnostic method that can minimize unnecessary surgery and obtain a definitive diagnosis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-8756479312442003">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-8756479312442003">2</xref></sup> Fleming and Oertel<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-8756479312442003">2</xref></sup> performed 20,000 aspirations, with 8 involving umbilical malignancies.

<title>Limitations</title>
<p>Sonography can be very effective in evaluating a patient for the presence of an umbilical hernia. However, there are some limitations in distinguishing it from a metastatic SMJN.</p>
<p>One limitation is the knowledge and experience of the operator. Many sonographers equate all umbilical protrusions as a hernia. With proper understanding of this condition, SMJN when imaged can readily be differentiated from that of a hernia. Reviewing the patient’s records for a history of cancer can be helpful to differentiate SMJN from a hernia. With positive laboratory (tumor markers) results, SMJN should also be suspected.</p>
<p>The second limitation is persevering to make a definitive diagnosis. In case 1 of this series, the surgeon refused to do a surgical biopsy on the patient because he felt it was a hernia and of no significance. Both sonography and CT imaging demonstrated the mass. However, the physicians failed to see it as a potential SMJN. It was not until the patient was transferred to another facility that the biopsy was performed, confirming it to be a malignant SMJN. Had it not been for the insistence of a gastroenterologist, this too would have been missed.</p>
<p>The final limitation is the low number of documented SMJN (15 cases over a 10-year period) in this report. However, in an extensive literature review conducted for SMJN, Shetty<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-8756479312442003">25</xref></sup> found 265 reported cases from 1830 to 1989. This at least raises the question that if at one small community hospital, 15 documented cases can be found, why is the reported number so low?</p>

<title>Summary</title>
<p>A Sister Mary Joseph nodule may be the first or only indication of an underlying occult cancer. It can indicate recurrence of previously treated malignancy. The mere presence of SMJN suggests an advanced metastatic process characterized by poor prognosis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-8756479312442003">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-8756479312442003">37</xref></sup> Diagnosis is often delayed, with clinicians treating them as a simple hernia or other condition. In this series of 15 patients, a total of 20 CT scans were performed. Seven were reported as a simple hernia, and four masses were not reported at all. The literature reports cases masquerading as umbilical hernias finally turning out to be metastatic deposits.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-8756479312442003">41</xref></sup> Thus, although the literature reports SMJN to be rather rare, it may be more common than previously reported due to misdiagnosis.</p>
<p>Histology of the metastatic umbilical tumor usually reveals adenocarcinoma, but rare reports of umbilical metastasis from sarcomas, mesotheliomas, and melanomas have also been seen.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-8756479312442003">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-8756479312442003">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-8756479312442003">42</xref></sup> The inability to locate the primary site has been reported to be as high as 30%.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-8756479312442003">26</xref></sup> If SMJN is suspected, an FNA or core biopsy can be performed to obtain definitive diagnosis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-8756479312442003">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-8756479312442003">2</xref></sup> In most cases of SMJN, the route of metastasis is unclear.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-8756479312442003">2</xref></sup> However, the most common routes include direct extension from ligamental attachments, arterial or venous circulation, or through one of four sets of lymphatic sites that pass through this region.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-8756479312442003">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-8756479312442003">15</xref></sup> A firm nodule is the most common physical finding.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-8756479312442003">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-8756479312442003">11</xref></sup></p>
