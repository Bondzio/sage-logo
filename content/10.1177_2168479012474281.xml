<p>Adequate medicine regulation requires nations to establish robust regulatory agencies that will subject all pharmaceutical products to pre- and postmarketing evaluation. These agencies are essential for any country wishing to ensure that the medicinal products it authorizes for use in its territory meet internationally agreed standards of safety, quality, and efficacy. Many developing nations, however, lack regulatory systems that can guarantee this set of requirements. As a result, almost all of these nations tend to rely on regulatory decisions made by well-resourced institutions, particularly the US Food and Drug Administration, the European Medicines Agency, and the World Health Organization. In this paper, the authors review the objectives, strengths, and weaknesses of some key regulatory initiatives instituted by these bodies to facilitate product registration in developing countries with constrained regulatory capacities.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Regulation of pharmaceutical products is a highly complex endeavor. It requires nations to establish robust regulatory systems that will subject all pharmaceutical products to pre- and postmarketing evaluation as well as designate competent teams to inspect the entire pharmaceutical supply chain, including clinical trial and manufacturing sites, importers, exporters, wholesalers, distributors, and final sellers.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-2168479012474281">1</xref>
</sup> Having a robust and independent national regulatory authority (NRA) is mandatory for a country wishing to ensure that the medicinal products it authorizes for use in its territory meet internationally agreed standards of quality, safety, and efficacy.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-2168479012474281">2</xref>
</sup> In addition, a robust NRA can provide assurance that all approved products, when in use, will continue to comply with these standards. Furthermore, the NRA is also obliged to institute a rigorous pharmacovigilance system,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-2168479012474281">3</xref>
</sup> which in recent years has become an extremely important requirement for the identification of undocumented safety signals.</p>
<p>Many countries, however, lack NRAs that can fully meet this set of requirements. Indeed, according to a report by the World Health Organization (WHO), about 80% of WHO member states—particularly developing nations—lack the capacity to effectively regulate medicinal products that are circulating on their markets.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-2168479012474281">4</xref>
</sup> This incapacity is directly linked to a combination of factors, including lack of human and material resources, regulatory experience and know-how, and political backing.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-2168479012474281">5</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-2168479012474281"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-2168479012474281">7</xref>
</sup> This limitation implies that the majority of NRAs in developing nations are not well positioned to guarantee the quality, safety, and efficacy of new medicinal product that are intended for their markets. As a result, almost all developing countries tend to rely on regulatory decisions made by well-resourced authorities, particularly the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the European Medicines Agency (EMA). In fact, when an NRA in a developing nation considers authorizing the use of a new pharmaceutical product in its territory, the decision would positively be influenced if the product has already been approved by a Western NRA.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-2168479012474281">5</xref>
</sup> In almost all cases, provision of a certificate of pharmaceutical product, which attests prior approval by a Western regulatory agency, is an explicit requirement and is mandatory before a marketing authorization application (MAA) can be assessed.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-2168479012474281">5</xref>
</sup> However, in 2004 and 2007, respectively, the EMA<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-2168479012474281">8</xref>
</sup> and FDA<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-2168479012474281">9</xref>
</sup> decided to no longer accept MAA for medicines that are intended for use outside their geographical jurisdictions. Although this decision initially raised a concern about the future supply of new life-saving medicines to developing countries, new initiatives have emerged over the past years that are specifically designed to address regulatory concerns for products intended to prevent, manage, or cure diseases that disproportionately affect the developing world. In this paper, we review some existing regulatory initiatives that are aimed at facilitating access to safe, effective, and quality medicinal products in developing countries.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-2168479012474281">
<title>The European Union Article 58</title>
<p>In 2004, the European parliament passed and enacted Regulation (EC) No. 726/2004, laying down procedures for the authorization of medicinal products in the European Union (EU) (“centralized procedure”).<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-2168479012474281">8</xref>
</sup> In particular, Article 58 of the regulation specified a mechanism whereby EMA, in collaboration with the WHO, may issue a “scientific opinion” for medicinal products intended exclusively for markets outside the EU. This scientific opinion is equivalent to the opinion given to products intended for European use.</p>
<p>Products that are eligible for the Article 58 process must be intended to prevent or treat a disease of major public health importance in third countries and should be endorsed by WHO. Such products include, among others, products for conditions such as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)/AIDS, malaria, tuberculosis, and other neglected tropical diseases. The list also extends to vaccines that can potentially be used in the Expanded Program on Immunization and vaccines that are part of a WHO-managed stockpile for emergency response.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-2168479012474281">10</xref>
</sup> The MAAs for eligible products are submitted to the Article 58 process on a case-by-case basis; once accepted, the applications are subjected to a rigorous scientific assessment during a standard EMA Centralized Procedure.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-2168479012474281">11</xref>
</sup> Although the standards and timelines for this assessment are identical to those required for products intended for the EU market, products reviewed under Article 58 do not receive an approval from the European Commission. Instead, a “scientific opinion” is issued by the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-2168479012474281">11</xref>
</sup> This opinion outlines the quality, safety, and efficacy of the medicinal product as well as its relevance and appropriateness for use in these countries. The opinion also delineates the risk/benefit balance of the product, which is estimated based on the situation in developing countries where the product will be used.</p>
<p>One peculiarity about the process is that during a standard Article 58 process, WHO experts and, in some instances, regulators from developing countries are invited to participate in plenary discussions on the product as well as in inspection of manufacturing facilities. One of the aims of this collaboration with WHO is to facilitate enlisting of approved products in the WHO list of prequalified medicinal products. In fact, valid scientific opinions that emanated from the procedure have been used by WHO to incorporate 2 HIV drugs and 1 antimalarial drug in its list of prequalified medicinal products.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-2168479012474281">12</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>Besides issuing a scientific opinion, Article 58 also has provisions for scientific advice. Under this section, the EMA can provide scientific advice to sponsors during the entire drug development process to guide them on trial design and other aspects that may influence the development of the product. Indeed, it has been shown, for a number of products registered in the EU, that if such advice is sought and acted on, the likelihood of obtaining regulatory approval is greater.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-2168479012474281">13</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>Article 58 has several advantages. Assessments are rigorous and fast (averaging 210 days) and generally incorporate risk/benefit calculations that depict reality in the developing world.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-2168479012474281">14</xref>
</sup> Additionally, the process engages regulators from WHO and developing countries, an approach that facilitates regulatory capacity building. Finally, Article 58 has risen above a specific statutory provision in the EU law—the “sunset clause,”<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-2168479012474281">15</xref>
</sup> which requires the revocation of a license if the product has not been marketed in the community for 3 years. This, indeed, does not apply to products reviewed under the Article 58 process as they are not granted a market authorization in the EU.</p>
<p>Although Article 58 offers great promise, it also has downsides. It does not specifically state the obligations of developing nations and WHO in the process. It is also unclear about the entity that will be responsible for postmarketing surveillance and pharmacovigilance once the product is in use outside the EU. In addition, the article—compared with other initiatives such as the orphan drug designations<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-2168479012474281">16</xref>
</sup>—has no incentives in place that can attract sponsors. Consequently, the procedure continues to be ill-suited and heavily underused. In fact, since its inception in 2004, only 6 applications have been submitted to the process,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-2168479012474281">17</xref>
</sup> 5 of which received a positive opinion, including 3 antiretroviral drugs (Aluvia, Lamivudine Viiv, and Lamivudine/Stavudine ViiV), 1 antimalarial (Pyramax), and 1 combination vaccine, Hexaxim. On the other hand, 1 application (Globorix, a combination vaccine) did not receive a positive opinion because the product did not meet the required standards and characteristics when taking into account the situation in countries where it was intended to be used.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-2168479012474281">18</xref>
</sup>
</p>

<sec id="section3-2168479012474281">
<title>WHO Prequalification Schemes</title>
<p>The primary goal of WHO prequalification systems is to ensure that medicinal products for high-burden diseases procured through United Nations (UN) agencies meet global standards of quality, safety, and efficacy.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-2168479012474281">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-2168479012474281">20</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>To meet this need, WHO’s Department of Immunization, Vaccination and Biologics established the first prequalification scheme in 1987. The objective of the scheme is to ensure the quality of vaccines procured through UN systems.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-2168479012474281">19</xref>
</sup> Slightly over 20 years after initiation, the scheme has prequalified 210 vaccines from 23 manufacturers (both industrialized and developing nations), and these vaccines are used in 112 countries to immunize 53% of the global birth cohort against 19 infectious diseases.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-2168479012474281">21</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>In order for a vaccine to be prequalified,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-2168479012474281">22</xref>
</sup> it must, inter alia, be classified as a priority product by UN purchasing agencies and other partners, notably the GAVI Alliance. Second, the vaccine must meet particular operational specifications (eg, presentation, antimicrobial preservatives, stability, dose volume, schedule, labeling, packaging), as defined by WHO. Third, the NRA in the manufacturing country that will serve as a “reference NRA” for prequalification must be “fully functional”—in other words, the NRA must be implementing all the 6 core regulatory functions, as prescribed by WHO.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-2168479012474281">2</xref>
</sup> Furthermore, an accord must be established between WHO and the “reference NRA” for proper lot release and information sharing in case of good manufacturing practice (GMP) deviations, adverse events following immunization, or withdraws due to quality issues.</p>
<p>Eligible vaccines for prequalification are evaluated via a stepwise process<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-2168479012474281">22</xref>
</sup> that consist of a thorough assessment of product summary files, testing of samples of finished products, and inspection of the manufacturing sites. The aim of these assessments is to ascertain whether the vaccine is manufactured and overseen in accordance with the principles and specifications for GMP and good clinical practice. If the outcome of the process is satisfactory, the vaccine will be included in the WHO list of prequalified vaccines,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-2168479012474281">21</xref>
</sup> and this status is maintained until a new reassessment is schedule by WHO.</p>
<p>In a bid to improve the prequalification process, WHO has recently revised the entire procedure<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-2168479012474281">23</xref>
</sup> and is considering a streamlined option for vaccines that have already been licensed by selected NRAs that are fully exercising the 6 critical regulatory functions. In this revised procedure, WHO can request the reference NRA—after establishing a formal collaborative agreement—to share its assessment and inspection reports as well as test results with them. WHO can then rely on these reports, on a case-by-case basis, to prequalify a vaccine instead of conducting a full assessment of the product summary file (PSF), testing of samples, or performing a full inspection. This streamlined procedure will enable WHO to focus its resources on aspects that are specific to national immunization programs of nations that are served with vaccines procured through UN systems.</p>
<p>Besides vaccine prequalification, WHO runs a drug prequalification scheme through its Department of Essential Drugs and Medicines Policy. This system was introduced in 2001 as a means of ensuring the quality of drugs procured through the UN system.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-2168479012474281">20</xref>
</sup> This task is accomplished via a thorough assessment of regulatory dossiers of eligible products to determine their safety, efficacy, and quality and through inspection of manufacturing and clinical sites to verify compliance with good manufacturing practice and good clinical practice.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-2168479012474281">24</xref>
</sup> If the outcome of this process is satisfactory, the drug is “prequalified” and incorporated in the WHO list of “prequalified products.”</p>
<p>The drug scheme essentially focuses on products for HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, malaria, influenza, and reproductive health. As of October 3, 2012, the system has prequalified 386 products, including 299 drugs for HIV (77.4%), 44 for tuberculosis (11.3%), 25 for malaria (6.5%), 11 for reproductive health (2.8%), and 7 for influenza (1.8%).<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-2168479012474281">12</xref>
</sup> A vast majority of these products come from firms in developing nations, with India alone accounting for over two-thirds of the products.</p>
<p>Evidently, WHO prequalification systems symbolize a fundamental pathway for the delivery of drug and vaccines in the developing world, and the systems are widely accredited for the growing proportion of quality medicinal products being used in these countries.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-2168479012474281">25</xref>
</sup> Indeed, several developing nations rely on these systems for prior regulatory review before authorizing the use of a product in their territory. The prequalification schemes have also greatly contributed in building regulatory capacity in developing nations in several ways, including the engagement of regulators from these countries during each prequalification process as well as running rotational fellowship programs.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-2168479012474281">26</xref>
</sup> Owing to these advantages, the prequalification systems continue to be strongly supported by most governments in the developing world.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-2168479012474281">25</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>Although prequalification schemes have been successful, the systems also have some drawbacks. The processes are relatively slow, averaging not less than 24 months for drugs<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-2168479012474281">27</xref>
</sup> and 31 months for vaccines.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-2168479012474281">21</xref>
</sup> In addition, although the drug scheme is free, vaccine prequalification is expensive, costing about US$25,000 for a traditional vaccine and up to US$65,500 for a novel vaccine.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-2168479012474281">28</xref>
</sup> Furthermore, the programs’ approach of uniting regulators from 5 continents to perform each assessment can be costly and time-consuming, and each review may result in a divorce in opinions. Similarly, as noted by Moran et al,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-2168479012474281">29</xref>
</sup> some critics question the schemes’ practice of repeatedly engaging a limited group of experts from few developing nations, while others feel that the WHO prequalification process as a whole is hindering the growth of indigenous regulatory capacity in developing countries, which by and large continue to transfer regulatory reviews to WHO.</p>

<sec id="section4-2168479012474281">
<title>FDA Regulatory Pathway for Approving Generic HIV Drugs for Use Outside the US</title>
<p>The President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) was instituted in 2004 by the US government to combat the global HIV/AIDS epidemic.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-2168479012474281">30</xref>
</sup> One of the objectives of this initiative at inception was to scale up access to safe, effective, quality, and cheap antiretroviral (ARV) drugs in poorer parts of the world, where the prevalence of HIV/AIDS is unacceptably high.</p>
<p>To address the need for safe, effective, and quality HIV drugs, the US FDA introduced a new regulatory initiative that will enable the agency to rapidly assess and approve HIV drugs for purchase under the PEPFAR program.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-2168479012474281">31</xref>
</sup> Product dossiers for ARVs submitted under this initiative are rapidly assessed via an expedited review process, and if they are found to meet the required standards of safety, efficacy, and quality, they are granted either a full approval if their patent rights have expired or a “tentative approval” if the products are still under patent or other market protection rights that exist in the United States.</p>
<p>As of September, 21, 2012, the program has approved a total of 153 products,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-2168479012474281">32</xref></sup> 125 of which were tentatively approved, whereas 28 were granted full approval. A significant proportion of these products are innovative formulations such as fixed-dose combination (ie, products that contain 2 or 3 drugs in the same tablet or capsule) and tablet formulations that can be dispersed in water. These innovative combinations have the potential of simplifying as well as enhancing adherence to treatment.</p>
<p>All the products approved under this program come essentially from 4 countries: 146 from India, 3 from China, 2 from South Africa, and 2 from the United States.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-2168479012474281">31</xref>
</sup> Because most manufacturers outside the United States have little or no prior experience with the FDA, the agency works closely with these manufacturers prior to each process. The aim of this collaboration is to help manufacturers to prepare application dossiers in a way that is consistent with the expectations of the FDA as well as to help them get ready for regulatory inspections of the manufacturing and clinical sites. These preparations are necessary to increase the chance of a product being approved by the agency.</p>
<p>Besides working closely with manufacturers, the FDA also collaborates fully with the prequalification unit of WHO during each PEPFAR process.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-2168479012474281">31</xref>
</sup> This collaboration may facilitate immediate integration of PEPFAR products into the WHO list of prequalified products. Indeed, most of the drugs approved by the FDA under the PEPFAR program are enlisted in the WHO’s prequalified list of products.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-2168479012474281">12</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>The PEPFAR scheme offers numerous advantages. First, no fees are charged if the products submitted to the scheme are generic; for novel products, the fees are waived. Additionally, the process is comparatively fast, with some reviews being completed in as little as 6 weeks after submission of a high-quality application.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-2168479012474281">31</xref>
</sup> Moreover, the FDA collaborates with drug regulatory authorities in developing countries, helping them to understand the PEPFAR initiative and the science that stands behind the regulatory decisions the FDA is making so that they can readily use the FDA decisions for local registration. To this end, PEPFAR has supported a number of regulatory building and strengthening activities for developing countries’ NRAs.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-2168479012474281">33</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>Undoubtedly, the PEPFAR program has expanded access to HIV treatment in developing countries in an unparalleled way. Indeed, prior to the program, only 67,100 people had access to antiretroviral therapy (ART), but today the program supports ART for close to 4.5 million individuals.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-2168479012474281">34</xref>
</sup> However, the majority of the products that have been approved for use in the program are first-line generics.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-2168479012474281">35</xref>
</sup> Only a few second-line regimens have been approved by the FDA under the PEPFAR program.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-2168479012474281">31</xref>
</sup> These few products, however, may not be enough to address the rising trend of resistance to the first-line regimen, which is becoming a major issue in many regions in the world.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-2168479012474281">36</xref>
</sup> Although provision of second-line therapy to patients who fail or become resistant to first-line therapy is a major challenge, there is evidence that PEPFAR is collaborating with both generic and innovator companies to improve access to second-line medications.<sup>

<p>On September 27, 2007, the US Congress enacted the Food and Drug Administration Amendment Act (FDAAA),<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-2168479012474281">9</xref></sup> also known as the US Public Law 110-85, which covers a wide range of health topics, including provisions for the authorization of biological products. In particular, section 524 of the act gave the FDA the mandate to approve vaccines for conditions that disproportionately affect the developing world. Backed by this law, the agency published a guidance document in 2008 indicating that the agency can license vaccines for a wide range of infectious diseases such as tuberculosis, malaria, cholera, and other neglected tropical diseases for which there is no significant market in the United States.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-2168479012474281">37</xref></sup> According to this guideline, biologic license applications submitted under this initiative will undergo the same regulatory pathway as for those intended for the US population. In other words, approvals can only be granted if the data submitted by the sponsor show that the vaccine is safe, effective, and of good quality and that the product was manufactured in accordance with current GMPs. A unique feature of this guideline is that approvals can be based entirely on data from clinical trials conducted outside the United States. Additionally, the guideline indicates that the agency can grant accelerated approvals using (1) surrogate or clinical end points and (2) data from animal studies, especially in situations where human efficacy studies are not ethical or feasible. Approvals granted based on both scenarios are subjected to postmarketing commitments, where the sponsor is requested to conduct additional studies in order to verify and describe the vaccine’s clinical characteristics and benefits.</p>
<p>In addition to authorizing vaccines for global infectious diseases, the US FDA also has the mandate to license drugs to prevent, treat, or cure neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) that are not endemic in the United States. This mandate has its roots in the Agriculture, Rural Development, Food and Drug Administration and Related Appropriations Act (also known as Public Law 111-80) that was enacted by US Congress on October 21, 2009.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-2168479012474281">38</xref></sup> Section 740(b) of this act recommends the FDA to provide specific guidance and recommendations on various aspects, including appropriate preclinical, clinical, and regulatory paradigms regarding the development of drugs for 16 NTDs. Under this direction, the FDA published a guideline document<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-2168479012474281">39</xref></sup> that clearly outlines the regulatory requirements as well as regulatory pathways and standards that the agency will use to approve drugs for NTDs.</p>
<p>According to the initiative, different regulatory models—which offer certain benefits to sponsors—can be used, when appropriate, to review applications. First, developers of products against NTDs can submit an application to the Office of Orphan Product Development for consideration for orphan designation (OD).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-2168479012474281">40</xref></sup> Applications that receive OD would not be subjected to a prescription drug user fee and may qualify the developer of the product for tax credit and numerous marketing incentives.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-2168479012474281">41</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>Second, marketing applications for NTDs can also receive a priority review designation. In such a case, regulatory assessment will be completed in 6 months as opposed to the standard 10-month FDA review timeframe under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act. Similarly, the FDA can grant accelerated approval for some applications in circumstances where human efficacy trials are not ethical or feasible. Finally, developers of drugs to treat or prevent NTDs may also receive a priority review voucher (PRV) at the time of approval of a drug for an NTD. This voucher may entitle the sponsor or another sponsor to obtain a priority review from the FDA for a different application submitted at a later time.</p>
<p>Like the vaccine pathway, product approval by the agency under this initiative can be based entirely on clinical data from trials conducted outside the United States. Additionally, the regulatory pathways and standards that will be used to approve these products will be the same as that used to license drugs for use in the United States. An additional advantage of the program is that it offers sponsors the possibility of having preconsultation meetings with the agency to discuss issues related to nonclinical and clinical studies that should accompany an application.</p>
<p>The vaccine and drug regulatory pathways offer several advantages, including a rigorous review of registration dossiers. This thorough review can provide a trustworthy judgment on the characteristics of the products that developing countries can rely on for registration of the product in their markets. Additionally, the pathways can facilitate incorporation of a new drug vaccine in the WHO list of prequalified products for worldwide delivery. Also, both initiatives indicate that marketing applications for products targeting global infectious diseases can receive a priority or an accelerated review, a pathway that can significantly expedite access to new drugs and vaccines in developing countries. Although these pathways have incentives that encourage sponsors to engage in research and development activities for drugs against NTDs, they do not, however, alter the standard regulatory requirements and process for obtaining marketing approval from the FDA. Safety and efficacy of a product must be established through adequate and well-controlled studies.</p>
<p>Certainly, these regulatory paradigms have advantages that can promote successful development of products for NTDs, and they clearly strengthen the FDA’s commitments in facilitating access to new drugs and vaccines in the developing world. However, the initiatives have some downsides. First, the guidance documents do not specifically state the standards that the FDA will use to approve products for which there is no US target population. For instance, given that the agency has traditionally not approved a vaccine whose efficacy level is less than 80%,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-2168479012474281">42</xref></sup> what principles will it use to license a vaccine with moderate efficacy (eg, malaria or tuberculosis vaccine)? Another important consideration is how risk/benefit calculations will drive the approval process given that products with higher risks and lower benefits would generally not be accepted in the United States, where the disease burden is low; however, such products may have a major impact in developing countries, where the disease burden is high.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-2168479012474281">43</xref>
</sup> These scenarios may lead developing nations to view these initiatives as a form of “double standard,” as was the case with EU Article 58, given that the FDA will use different principles to approve products that will hardly be used in the United States.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-2168479012474281">29</xref>
</sup>
<sup>,42</sup> Additional concerns include issues related to labeling of products approved via these initiatives as well as the willingness of the US government to provide the FDA with the necessary resources to implement these initiatives. Finally, there are no indications whether the initiatives will engage regulators from developing countries in regulatory assessments.</p>

<title>FDA’s Priority Review Voucher for Tropical Diseases</title>
<p>In 2006, Ridley et al<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-2168479012474281">44</xref>
</sup> conceived the idea of a PRV that could be used to motivate drug companies to develop therapies for NTDs. The FDAAA<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-2168479012474281">9</xref>
</sup> addresses this need by including provisions for authorizing new therapies to treat or prevent NTDs. Section 524, in particular, gave the FDA a legal mandate to issue PRVs to companies that obtain an FDA approval for a new medicine or vaccine targeting any of the 16 tropical diseases listed in the act. This PRV would entitle the bearer or another manufacturer to obtain a priority review from the FDA for a different application of its choice at a later time, or it can be sold by the bearer to another company or traded as a commodity.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-2168479012474281">45</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>A fascinating feature of a PRV is that it has the potential of shortening FDA review time by 6 months,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-2168479012474281">46</xref>
</sup> possibly allowing new drugs to enter the market earlier.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-2168479012474281">47</xref></sup> This early entry may give a company greater advantage over its competitors, which can translate into significant earnings for that company, especially if the company uses the voucher to obtain approval for a potential blockbuster. Indeed, according to economic models, the values of the voucher may be worth between US$50 and $300 million,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-2168479012474281">44</xref>
</sup>
<sup>-47</sup> which may be enough to help recoup costs that the sponsor incurred during the research and development (R&amp;D) of a drug or vaccine against an NTD.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-2168479012474281">46</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>Clearly, PRVs may serve as an important incentive to motivate industries to develop therapies for NTDs. Indeed, according to Robertson et al,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-2168479012474281">47</xref></sup> a significant number of companies involved in R&amp;D for NTDs consider the PRV program as a major driving force for initiating and continuing R&amp;D activities for NTDs. This observation is reassuring in that it highlights the potential of PRVs in addressing one of the major challenges (ie, lack of incentives) that has been hindering R&amp;D activities for NTDs.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-2168479012474281">48</xref></sup>
</p>
<p>Although recent forecasts indicate that several products could likely be eligible for PRVs,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-2168479012474281">49</xref>
</sup> only one PRV has so far been awarded by the FDA.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-2168479012474281">50</xref>
</sup> The PRV was awarded to Novartis in 2009 for developing the antimalarial drug, Coartem, and was subsequently used by the company to obtain a priority review for a drug (Ilaris) against gouty arthritis. The priority review, although completed in 6 months, did not culminate into an approval.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-2168479012474281">51</xref></sup> This experience indicates that although a PRV entitles the bearer to a priority review, it may not guarantee a positive outcome. It also highlights the FDA’s commitments to the initiative (ie, completing a review in 6 months), which should, in principle, encourage sponsors to develop treatment for NTDs.</p>
<p>The initial voucher program had some limitations such as restrictions on transferability, a limited portfolio of eligible drugs, high fees for using the program, and the need for sponsors to notify the FDA 1 year in advance prior to the use of the voucher.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-2168479012474281">45</xref>
</sup> Some of these limitations, however, are currently being reviewed under the Creating Hope Act.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-2168479012474281">52</xref>
</sup> In addition, the FDA has recently slashed the fiscal year (FY) 2012 fee for PRVs by 32%.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-2168479012474281">53</xref>
</sup> These improvements have the potential of significantly changing the face of the PRV program in many ways. This promise has led some researchers to forecast that about 3.5 vouchers may be awarded annually over the next decade, and the first could be issued as early as 2013, possibly for a drug against river blindness.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-2168479012474281">46</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>Priority review vouchers clearly hold considerable promise in accelerating access to therapies for both developing and developed nations. Because of this promise, the originators of the initiative have recently proposed an extension of the program to the EU, where the EMA can grant a priority voucher that would entitle the bearer to a priority review, as well as accelerated pricing and reimbursement decisions for a medicine of the bearer’s choice.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-2168479012474281">54</xref>
</sup> There are no indications, however, whether the EMA has instituted the program.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>The quest to have safe, effective, and quality medicinal products in developing countries, with constrained regulatory capacities, has gradually increased over the past decade. Several innovative regulatory pathways have been introduced, and these systems are working in parallel to address regulatory issues that surround product registration as well as access to medicinal products of assured quality in developing countries.</p>
<p>Although these mechanisms, particularly PEPFAR and WHO prequalification systems, have significantly improved access to life-saving medicinal products in developing countries, the pathways also have some inherent limitations. These limitations highlight the pressing need for developing countries to develop their own independent, reliable, and properly functioning NRAs. This is not only necessary to expedite registration of safe, effective, and quality medical products that take into account relevant risk/benefit calculations, but also because there may come a time when these agencies no longer have the resources or legal authority to address the exponential growth in product registration in developing countries, especially in the coming years, when demand for generic products and efforts to treat noncommunicable diseases will rise.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-2168479012474281">55</xref>
</sup> Additionally, although benchmark agencies can approve a product for use in a developing country, monitoring how fully the approved product complies with international standards will continue to be the role of the developing country’s NRAs. Therefore, there is the need for an evolution of the current regulatory paradigm in developing countries, from one that completely relies on regulatory expertise from well-resourced and experienced Western agencies to one that partakes more actively in research and development processes directed toward new treatments and interventions for health conditions that are widely prevalent in their territories.</p>
