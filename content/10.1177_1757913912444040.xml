<title>Letter from a member</title>
<p>Dear Editor,</p>
<p>As a member of the RSPH since the early 1970s, I have seen a lot of changes in the view of health which society holds.</p>
<p>Today there is a plethora of understanding, and lots of data, but part of the conversation is not necessarily based upon fact. For instance there is a push today for more health! We must all be fit, run or cycle to work, eat our ‘5 a day’ and exercise regularly.</p>
<p>Imagine my surprise, after over 25 years in the public health arena, when I saw for the first time the slogan (for that can only be what it was meant to be) of ‘wellness’!</p>
<p>Suddenly the slogan was everywhere. A bald statement, but what defines this? What actually IS wellness? For if you are engaged in the Olympics this Summer, your wellness is superior to mine, as my physical activity is limited to my walk to the car or bus stop.</p>
<p>Unfortunately as the prevalence of ‘opinions’ has grown, with government desperately seeking to ensure everyone is ‘healthy’, there has in my opinion been an error. As politicians infrequently measure anything, there is a tendency to assume a point of view.</p>
<p>Wellness is an example. For though we clarify almost every activity we undertake, political initiatives prove difficult, after all, how do you define that political construct, “wellness”?</p>
<p>We have had several political forays into ensuring ‘wellness’. For example white lines were painted on roads to ensure people could ride freely; ignoring the fact that roads were made more hazardous by narrowing them because it was in the cause of ‘wellness’.</p>
<p>In the rush to move with the times, pressure groups have a lot to answer for in my opinion. They disagree with something, society has to ban it. Smoking, drinking and obesity come to mind.</p>
<p>I take your point about health literacy, and it is well made, but where there is more than one causal factor evident why is it that we sometimes neglect the obvious in favour of an accepted prevailing wisdom which either does not reflect the picture, or deliberately, for a good cause, refuse to accept alternatives.</p>
