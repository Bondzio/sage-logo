<abstract>
<p>This exploratory study aims to develop an understanding of caseworker views on the challenges and opportunities of kinship care. This sample includes protection and kinship service caseworkers who service families in Ontario. Focus groups with a self-selected sample of 27 caseworkers explored the current attitudes of ongoing caseworkers toward kinship caregivers and the policies that mandate their exploration. Results indicated that workers are embracing the idea of kinship care; however they note several limitations and frustrations with the practice. Lack of resources and services for kinship caregivers, issues of conflict and difficulty in monitoring kinship homes hinder positive attitudes about this practice. Further, workers felt that the current legislation encourages the approval of kinship homes that are viewed as substandard and unsafe for children.</p>

<sec id="sec1-1473325011424086" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title>
<p>‘The apple doesn’t fall far from the tree’ has historically been a popular adage used by child welfare workers to avoid the placement of children with their relatives. However, when the Ontario government mandated the exploration of kin for all children removed from their parents care, child welfare practice in Ontario dramatically changed. In 2006, this writer attended several meetings at which participants engaged in heated debates and discussions around issues of intergenerational abuse and neglect, substance abuse and inadequate parenting. There was a clear message throughout the province that child protection workers feared these new standards and expectations of practice. There was a strong belief in the propensity for generational abuse and neglect as workers expressed the belief that living with imperfect families is too great a risk for children. Such attitudes may influence the placement success of children with their kin. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1473325011424086">Argent (2009)</xref> posits that, for kinship placements to be successful, professionals ‘need to believe that it should be done and that it is worth doing it well’ (p. 7). While there is certainly some validity to this statement, workers may struggle with fully supporting kinship placements. Several studies have underscored the challenges of kinship care. Kin families experience higher rates of poverty, social isolation and lower rates of education (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1473325011424086">Geen, 2003</xref>). Kinship caregivers are more likely to be single, unemployed, less educated and in a lower socioeconomic class (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1473325011424086">Cuddeback, 2004</xref>). Furthermore, the use of kin homes can be riddled with complex issues, and complicated family dynamics that can challenge and frustrate workers. Existence of these problems may reinforce the generally negative attitudes about this practice and influence worker decisions and service provision (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1473325011424086">Harris and Hackett, 2008</xref>). The exploration of potential kin caregivers and the actual approval of these families can hinge on various subjective factors and worker assumptions about families. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1473325011424086">Hasenfeld (1983)</xref> posits that workers in human service organizations exercise considerable discretion when making decisions.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec2-1473325011424086"><title>Purpose of the study</title>
<p>This research aims to determine if caseworkers hold assumptions about kinship families that could influence their case decisions. It will also advance our knowledge of caseworker and organizational attitudes toward the use of kinship caregivers. For child welfare workers in Ontario, the systematic use of relatives to care for children is a relatively new phenomenon. In fact, it was not until 2006, that agencies became mandated, upon removal of a child from his/her home, to explore potential placements with a relative, a member of the child’s extended family or a member of the child’s community (O.Reg206/00, Part 2.3). This new legislation, known as ‘Bill 210’, aims to expand permanency-planning options for children at risk of removal from their families, specifically around the use of kin and other community members to care for children. Current caseworker and organizational attitudes regarding this legislation are relatively unknown. Therefore, this research will examine the current attitudes of child welfare workers toward kinship care at two agencies that serve certain geographical jurisdictions in Ontario. The primary goal of this exploratory study is to provide information on caseworker and perceived organizational attitudes regarding the use of kinship care.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec3-1473325011424086"><title>Background</title>
<p>In a substantive synthesis of research on kinship foster care, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1473325011424086">Cuddeback (2004)</xref> summarizes that ‘child welfare professionals have reported that kinship foster families are often more difficult to supervise, require more time to assess and make case plans harder to enforce … ’ (p. 633). Further, caseworkers question the ability of kinship caregivers to parent, especially if those kin raised troubled children of their own (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1473325011424086">Peters, 2005</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1473325011424086">Gray and Nybell (1990)</xref> found that workers tended to attribute parental failure to the extended family network. These attitudes resulted in professional decisions to remove children entirely from the family system. Workers have also articulated frustration with issues of triangulation when working with kinship placements. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1473325011424086">Peters (2005)</xref> defines triangulation as situations in which caseworkers feel the need to constantly negotiate matters and investigate allegations between biological parents and kinship caregivers. Triangulation matters can divert caseworker energy and decrease their focus on the child (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1473325011424086">Peters, 2005</xref>). These barriers may have an effect on a caseworker’s willingness to enter into a kinship arrangement when removing children from their parents. However, because the literature shows evidence that kinship care can provide children with greater opportunities for permanency and placement stability than foster homes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1473325011424086">Albert et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1473325011424086">Chamberlain et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1473325011424086">del Valle et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1473325011424086">Koh, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1473325011424086">Winokur et al., 2008</xref>), it is important that workers fashion their assessments free of bias. In her recent dissertation, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1473325011424086">Dill (2010)</xref> asserts that the Ontario child welfare system continues to view kinship ‘as a second-rate option’ despite attempts to shift our thinking toward a more inclusive approach (p. 54).</p>
<p>Once children are placed with kinship caregivers, worker attitudes can also influence the services provided to kin after placement. Through their advocacy work, or ability to maneuver through the child welfare system, caseworkers can influence the benefits and sanctions provided by an agency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1473325011424086">Ryan et al., 2006</xref>). Positive worker attitudes may be important for successful placements for children. A study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1473325011424086">Coakley et al. (2007)</xref> found that the inability of kin caregivers to deal with the child welfare system inhibited successful fostering of the child in their custody. Successful kin placements may be contingent on agency attention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1473325011424086">Iglehart, 1994</xref>) and caseworkers’ willingness to tailor services specifically for kinship caregivers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1473325011424086">Coakley et al., 2007</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec4-1473325011424086"><title>Paradigm</title>
<p>The social construction perspective can assist in understanding caseworker’s thoughts and feelings about kinship care. For constructionists, critical reflection about our assumptions is essential (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1473325011424086">Gergen, 1999</xref>). An important proposition of social construction is the need to examine what passes as knowledge in society, regardless of the validity of such knowledge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1473325011424086">Potter, 1996</xref>). If caseworkers cling to antiquated thinking about kinship caregivers, and these beliefs are reinforced organizationally, the rebuilding of knowledge required to embrace the intent of Bill 210 may never be realized. Epistemologically, constructivism is based on the belief that knowledge is evolutionary and the reconstruction of knowledge can occur with the passage of time and altered circumstances (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1473325011424086">Granvold, 2010</xref>). This research will provide valuable information about whether or not this reconstruction of knowledge has occurred.</p>
<p>Past studies on the attitudes and experiences of child welfare employees demonstrate that qualitative methods are helpful in this type of research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1473325011424086">Coleman and Clark, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1473325011424086">Morazes et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1473325011424086">Zell, 2006</xref>). Further, qualitative design is conducive to exploratory research with a goal of understanding phenomena about which little is known (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1473325011424086">Padgett, 2004</xref>). While research in the area of kinship foster care has exponentially increased over the past decade, there is minimal research in the area of worker attitudes toward placing children with kin. There is still less from a Canadian perspective. Five years have passed since the approval of kinship legislation, and the current attitudes of child welfare workers toward kin and the policies that mandate the exploration of caregivers have not yet been assessed.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec5-1473325011424086"><title>Data collection</title>
<p>I entered into this exploration with the assumption that caseworkers involved with kinship caregivers were knowledgeable and could provide valuable information about this practice. I collected data from six focus groups that consisted of two to eight participants. A total of 27 caseworkers were involved in the focus groups. Data collection terminated when little new information emerged. Focus groups aimed to ‘stimulate discussion and obtain information on the beliefs, attitudes, or motivations of participants … ’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1473325011424086">Linhorst, 2002</xref>: 208) regarding kinship caregivers. All groups were facilitated by this author and were scheduled at various times over a two-week period. Group meetings ranged between 50–70 minutes in length. Groups were semi-structured to allow for discussions to be somewhat open-ended. While standardized questions (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1473325011424086">Table 1</xref>) facilitated discussion; further exploring, probing and promotion of group interaction aimed to elicit data that otherwise may not have been shared. At times, the answers to certain questions were captured during other discussions, and consequently there was no need to pose those questions. This flexibility is characteristic of in-depth interviewing, data collection and analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1473325011424086">Strauss and Corbin, 1990</xref>) and leads to an understanding of the true experiences of participants and challenges. To ensure that all information was captured and available for data analysis, I made audio recordings of all focus groups. Because of recording difficulties during one group, coding occurred from notes taken contemporaneously with the meeting. This research gathered information from two departments (Family Services and Kinship Services), resulting in the segmentation of groups. This set-up allowed for a comparative component and enabled group members to share with others with whom they were more familiar (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1473325011424086">Morgan, 1996</xref>).

<sec id="sec6-1473325011424086"><title>Sample</title>
<p>The sampling approach for this study is of a non-probability design with purposeful and convenience sampling. All front-line workers in Family and Kinship Services at two agencies in Ontario were invited to participate in this study. Participants were invited via email and flyers that were posted in their workplaces. The agencies involved in this study service urban, rural and suburban geographical areas. Groups were not segregated based on these differences. Duration of work experience in the field of child welfare ranged from 3 months to 10 years (<italic>M</italic> = 4.15 years, <italic>SD</italic> = 3.32). Twenty-five of the twenty-seven participants were Caucasian.</p>
<sec id="sec7-1473325011424086"><title>Data analysis</title>
<p>Qualitative data analysis consisted of an inductive process to build themes and to allow for useful narratives of the information. This process involved reading every response numerous times and searching for specific words, recurring themes and concepts. When a large amount of data fit into a particular area, categories were divided into sub-themes. In an effort to ensure that participants had a clear understanding of the research questions, data was analyzed concurrently with collection. I developed a qualitative codebook that included definitions of codes and emerging perspectives, to ensure consistency. Only one researcher was involved in content analysis. The initial three groups were transcribed and entered into QSR NVivo 9 qualitative software to help code, sort and organize information. Data from the final three groups were also entered in QSR NVivo 9 and themes were further refined and subcategorized.</p>

Any statements consistent with thematic definitions were counted as one. While efforts were made to include all participants in the focus groups, similar comments from the same individual could have been counted more than once.

For the purposes of coding, this question was initially divided into comments considered to be positive or negative. However, as interviews continued it was clear that several of the statements initially considered to be positive, were often attached to a comment or phrase that highlighted some reluctance. While many workers supported the premise of Bill 210, it was evident that the practice is fraught with frustration and limitations. As a result, a third theme was added and coded as ‘hesitancy.’<disp-quote>
<p>Positive:</p>
<p>I can’t believe that these families are doing such a great job! They have so much heart and compassion. To me, they are at the same level as a foster parent. They’re opening their home and their hearts to these kids and it’s a tough situation.</p>
<p>Hesitancy:</p>
<p>There is a very fine line, some kin are a dream …  there’s no in-between. It’s either smooth or it’s always in a constant state of chaos …</p>
<p>Negative:</p>
<p>Sometimes it would just be better if foster care was the only option. But when a family member comes forward and they pass the assessment that is what you have to do.</p></disp-quote></p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec10-1473325011424086"><title>What do you view as the opportunities of kinship caregivers? What in your opinion are the benefits of utilizing kin to care for children?</title>
<p>Caseworkers discussed the importance of keeping families together and their ability to be more creative with the placement process when using kin. The continued connection of the child to the parents and extended family is seen as a positive outcome of kinship care:<disp-quote>
<p>Even if their parents are not going to be able to care for them long-term, this still will give the parents a chance of having that long-term relationship with their child …</p>
<p>… they can stay with siblings and the connection to cousins. With foster parents, we hear ‘they’re only taking girls or boys, they only have one bed’ and siblings are separated.</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>While some of the workers discussed difficulty in monitoring access in certain kinship situations, several workers felt that kinship diminished workload and provided a more natural access opportunity for parents and their children. In addition, the theme of access during holidays and special occasions was recurrent. Workers saw the value and increased opportunity for families to spend quality time during meaningful occasions that otherwise may not have been available in an access center. Workers enjoyed the ability of kinship caregivers to maintain the child’s connection with extended family. Whereas access programs typically only facilitate visits for primary caregivers, workers took comfort in knowing that children would not be disconnected from extended family members.<disp-quote>
<p>Mom arranges with her parents, she comes and goes, but if it was happening at the visit center it would be less frequent. Access is better at their house, they can have dinner, relax and she gets along with her parents and that is good and they supervise.</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>Workers felt that placement with kin was less traumatic for parents and children than placing them in foster care. Workers discussed how kinship can provide a sense of continuity and familiarity for a child and they seem to adapt more quickly with kin. Placement staff believed children were more readily able to remain in their community and school, while being able to maintain contact with their friends:<disp-quote>
<p>Several foster homes are in the county. That usually means changing schools. For teenagers it’s about friends … and by removing them from that … friends in the teenager’s life – it is the most important thing.</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>Another common theme was the belief that kinship caregivers are more emotionally attached to the children placed in their care than are foster parents. Caseworkers saw kinship caregivers as showing a vested interest in children and as being more willing to go out of their way to maintain connections. While foster parents are paid, many kinship caregivers take their relatives into their home and ask for little in return.<disp-quote>
<p>The emotional attachment piece, because foster parents may not let themselves get emotionally attached, but in a kin home there is a different type of comfort and emotional security.</p></disp-quote></p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec11-1473325011424086"><title>What do you view as the challenges of using kinship caregivers? Describe any challenges or frustrations in dealing with kin caregivers</title>
<p>Caseworkers were forthcoming with information regarding their challenges and frustrations when working with kinship caregivers. Of particular concern was the lack of funding and services for kinship-service homes. Several workers discussed the incredible burden and high expectations placed on kin. For example, kin are often expected to drive children to access and appointments with no agency support. Many workers felt that increased funding for kinship homes would decrease the number of placement breakdowns. While workers cite some potential avenues for funding, systemic issues that block their ability to obtain this funding create further problems. Kinship homes approved and licensed as foster homes receive a per diem rate, but these homes are more the exception rather than the rule. Workers reported:<disp-quote>
<p>A big piece of the assessment is finances. To go out and say this is wonderful but, by the way, we are never giving you anything – so don’t even ask for it.</p>
<p>It was sad, I had a kin who said ‘I don’t have any food in the fridge, what am I going to do?’ and it came down to ‘well you are going to have to find the money or we are going to have to take the kids if you can’t financially support them.’</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>Several workers discussed ongoing enmeshment issues with kinship caregivers who are so emotionally involved that they worry about the child being sent home to the parent. Often times, kinship caregivers are phoning and making allegations or giving information that is difficult to substantiate. Caseworkers felt that these issues do not happen when children are in foster care and discussed their frustration with the blurred boundaries. To the other extreme are those kinship caregivers who are so aligned with the parent that they fail to comprehend the magnitude of protection concerns. These cases are cited as especially difficult to monitor when kin providers fail to follow restrictions regarding access and place the child at risk:<disp-quote>
<p>Once I went to a home visit and the kin didn’t come to the door. And then they called me and said the kids wanted to go home so we took them to their parents. Kin are so anxious to make it right … they’re so anxious to make it work that their perceptions are skewed about the protection factors.</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>Another common challenge for caseworkers is negotiating constant conflict between the kinship home and the parent. Caseworkers discussed frustration with issues of triangulation and expressed empathy for kin who endure ongoing criticism from the parent. Some workers expressed dismay with this conflict and chaos and discussed concerns for the children who are hearing conflict play out between their parent and kin. Ongoing interference from the parents and unsubstantiated allegations of abuse and neglect against the kinship caregiver create workload issues and undue stress on placements. Many workers felt that this conflict causes placement breakdowns, as kin eventually become too frustrated with the constant stress and interference in their lives:<disp-quote>
<p>With foster parents there is no family drama coming into the home. The drama comes into that home, the kid never escapes it.</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>Disruption for kin was another common theme among the groups. Ongoing dialogue in focus groups revolved around the high expectations the society places on kinship caregivers. Caregivers are expected to drive children to frequent court-ordered access or they are required to open up their homes and supervise visits. Caseworkers felt that these expectations often resulted in the breakdown of placements. Court-ordered access can also influence the kin’s ability to travel or enjoy personal activities. Such disruption often frustrates kin and they begin to feel that continuing care of the child is too much to manage:<disp-quote>
<p>I had a placement breakdown because access couldn’t move to the society. The kin mom said for months – ‘I can’t do it.’ It was overwhelming her and the mother was a problem and it was eating away at her – she just couldn’t do it.</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>Several workers expressed worry with the fact that Ontario child welfare has lowered the standards too far in order to accept kin as placements. Several approved homes are noted to be substandard and workers feel that child welfare has moved too far in accepting kinship caregivers, many of whom share the same struggles as the parent from whom the child was removed. Numerous kinship caregivers are noted to have their own history with the agency and many have criminal records. Workers struggle with the double standard, because foster parents would rarely be considered under similar circumstances. While most workers felt that a negative history with the agency or criminal records should not automatically preclude examination of kinship caregivers, many discussed placements that, in their opinion, should never have been approved. Workers felt that their primary goal of keeping children safe is not always satisfied when those children are placed with kin.<disp-quote>
<p>On one of my cases the child was taken out of a kin home because they were being abused the same way they were in their biological home. We took them out of a home and told them you’re going to be safe and then they weren’t. It’s really sad for those kids (voice quivers).</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>Another common theme discussed in the focus groups, is the difficulty with a lack of timelines. Although Bill 210 aimed to expand permanency-planning options for children, in practice, it may actually be extending the amount to time a child remains in limbo. When children live with kin under a Supervision Order or there is no court order at all, workers discussed children with no permanent plan over a number of years. Workers and kinship caregivers struggle with cases that tend to drag out with no resolution in sight. These cases are difficult on the kinship caregiver and the child. There was a strong consensus among workers that timelines need to be put in place, regardless of the manner in which a child is placed with kin.<disp-quote>
<p>Most kin go into this thinking that the child will be with them for six months. They give the parents the benefit of the doubt that they are going to do what is needed. Then six months comes and the parents haven’t done what they need to do …  The matter drags out and they feel very frustrated and angry. One grandmother said to me ‘it’s really not Children’s Aid Society’ it’s the ‘Parents’ Aid Society.’ She said it’s not about the children, the parents have so much control and the kin don’t feel empowered.</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>In conjunction with the lack of timelines, is the sense that parents do not work as hard in getting their children back when they are placed with kin. Parents enjoy the security of knowing that their child remains with family, and they are less motivated to make changes. Caseworkers felt that parents are more motivated when children are placed in foster care. The court mandated timelines and the lack of freedom they experience when a child is not with relatives motivates parents to work toward their goals more so than when they are placed with kin.<disp-quote>
<p>It would be great if kinship had timelines, it gives the parent some accountability. Kids sit in kinship for a long time. That prolongs permanency … parents get comfortable. They see their child and make a lot of decisions but they don't have the responsibility that goes with parenting.</p></disp-quote></p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec12-1473325011424086"><title>What do you feel is the general philosophy of your agency toward kinship caregivers?</title>
<p>Several caseworkers felt that the need to consider kin placement options is encouraged and promoted throughout their agencies. They discussed efforts made to support the workload involved in exploring and assessing kinship caregivers, but still felt that the practice was only verbally supported. Again, the lack of services and funding available for kin caregivers dominated the discussion around agency backing of the practice. Many questioned the motivation behind the push for kin placements. While some felt that supervisors and directors saw value in the practice, others felt that the push was simply because kinship providers cost less. Others were frustrated with the need to explore kin placements when they felt it was a substandard solution, and wished their agencies allowed more discretion in this regard.<disp-quote>
<p>I feel like it’s verbally supportive but there’s not the services in place to support and maintain it.</p>
<p>I see the agency putting in new positions. I feel the support from the agency that this is something that we really need to look into.</p></disp-quote></p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec13-1473325011424086"><title>Do you support the idea of placing children with kin rather than non-relative foster homes? What reasons lead you to this decision?</title>
<p>The resounding answer to this question is ‘it depends.’ Workers discussed cases where children were flourishing in kinship care; however these stories were often coupled with situations that were viewed as less positive. Not one worker gave the simple answer of ‘yes.’ The majority of caseworkers discussed kinship situations that were positive, but they also experienced placements that were fraught with problems and aggravation. Many discussed liking the practice, but recognized that there are limitations and frustrations that go along with placing children with kin:<disp-quote>
<p>It depends … when you know a placement is going to break down and you place with kin anyways and it breaks down … .it’s traumatic for the kid. But when kin families scrape by and we place there, I don’t agree with that.</p>
<p>If you averaged it all out, they probably get better quality in foster care overall.</p>
<p>You still have to look at what would be the best long-term solution. Just because this person is kin, it may not necessarily be the best solution.</p></disp-quote></p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec14-1473325011424086"><title>How do you believe that Bill 210 has helped your practice?</title>
<p>Workers discussed the importance of exploring kin and felt that mandating them to do so was necessary. Certain workers felt that Bill 210 encouraged them to be more proactive in their casework and assisted in helping them plan better for families. Caseworkers took some comfort in the clear assessment guidelines and felt that Bill 210 gave them more direction in their practice. Some workers who began working in child welfare after the passing of Bill 210, questioned why this wasn’t always the practice.<disp-quote>
<p>It forces us to think outside the box, our goal is to go away and not be involved with this family anymore. The only way that can happen is if they have the support system in place. In this job you get caught up with the formal supports and you ignore the potential supports of neighbours, families and friends. In the end those are the things that are going to sustain people.</p>
<p>It changes the way other people see the society that we are not just taking kids away from families, that’s not our goal. Maybe people are trying to see the positive side of Children's Aid Society (CAS). We are trying to keep children with families and not tearing families apart.</p></disp-quote></p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec15-1473325011424086"><title>How do you believe that Bill 210 has hindered your practice?</title>
<p>Many caseworkers discussed their dismay with the level of intrusiveness mandated by the Ontario standards of kinship care. When kin are doing well, workers want the ability to allow families to raise their kin without the constant involvement of the Society. While workers recognized that CAS could be a source of support, they also mentioned that several kin caregivers felt that agency involvement was overly intrusive. Workers felt that unyielding standards and procedural demands caused more stress for kin:<disp-quote>
<p>… if my sister came to me and asked me to take my niece, I would say sure but CAS stay out of it. I have two kids of my own, I’m doing fine. Who are we protecting with kinship sometimes? Are we protecting us or are we protecting the kids?</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>Workers cited the incredible amount of time and work that is required to adhere to the standards of Bill 210. Often times, families are putting forward several names of potential kin, and workers are left completing assessments on numerous individuals, many of whom are believed to be inadequate even before the assessment process begins:<disp-quote>
<p>Sometime parents present 6–7 people and then you are doing 6–7 assessments and there is a lot more pressing things that could be happening rather than looking at six people – look at one, if it doesn’t work then we’ll go into foster care. These assessments take a lot of time. I could spend two straight weeks looking at family members for one file and then other families get neglected.</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>In addition, workers are frustrated with mandated assessments. Judges are ordering assessments and supervisors are expecting exploration of kin even when the workers feel that the history is too extensive. When workers must explore kin who are known to be inadequate, they feel that they are wasting precious time and resources. Further, judges are seen as ordering children into sub-standard, problematic homes that the worker is left to manage. Workers question this practice, and would prefer more control over this process:<disp-quote>
<p>When judges order assessments for kin that we know are inappropriate – that is frustrating, and such a waste of time. We should be able to just say that we know they are inappropriate and that is the end of it.</p></disp-quote></p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec16-1473325011424086"><title>How do you feel that your service provision to kinship caregivers differs from your work with non-relative foster parents?</title>
<p>Again, caseworkers expressed their dismay with the lack of financial support and services provided to kin by the agency. Workers felt that, in general, foster parents were more respected by the agency and people were quick to put services in place to ensure that foster placements are successful. They also felt that kin were scrutinized more than foster parents and that the agency tolerated less from kin.<disp-quote>
<p>We do everything to keep our foster parents happy, cuz we are always in need of more beds. I have been in meetings where supervisors don’t want to criticize foster parents, even when what they are doing is wrong. That wouldn’t happen with kin.</p></disp-quote></p>

<sec id="sec17-1473325011424086"><title>Study limitations</title>
<p>These findings are influenced by some potential limitations. First, this researcher is a supervisor at one of the agencies involved in this study. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1473325011424086">Linhorst (2002)</xref> cautions against groups that include employees and supervisors as they may not elicit the required information. This limitation was addressed in two ways. First, none of the focus groups included any participants who were under the researcher’s direct supervision. Second, the importance of confidentiality was addressed at the beginning of each focus group. In an effort to mitigate any concerns with this researcher’s role in the organization, ground rules regarding the protection of shared information were highlighted. While these strategies may not fully eliminate the potential for bias, they may minimize potential effects. In addition, this researcher has worked in child welfare for 16 years. Certainly this history in child welfare and personal experiences with kinship caregivers means that I entered into this research with feelings, thoughts and ideas about the practice. For this reason, I was careful to listen to participants without assuming to know what they meant. I also entered into self-reflection to gain an understanding of how my personal experiences shape my entry into the data. On the other hand, my intimate knowledge of the topic can lead to richer understanding of the phenomena under study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1473325011424086">Bogdan and Bilken, 1998</xref>). This familiarity with the struggles and opportunities of kinship care may have helped participants share their ideas more freely, allowing for deeper comprehension (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1473325011424086">Bogdan and Bilken, 1998</xref>).</p>
<p>Further, readers are cautioned regarding the representativeness of the respondents as twenty-five of the twenty-seven participants were Caucasian. In addition, all interviews were completed in a specific geographic location in Ontario; therefore participants may differ in race and ethnicity from those in other areas and that may limit the transferability of these findings. The organizational culture of the societies that participated in this research may also differ from the rest of the province. Future follow-up studies could strengthen the sampling procedures and allow for participation from a wider range of caseworkers across the entire province.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec18-1473325011424086" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title>
<p>This study advanced our knowledge of caseworker and organizational attitudes about kinship care and the legislation that mandates the exploration of family when a child is removed from parental care. In general, caseworkers discussed the benefits for children and families through kinship caregivers; however these positives were often overshadowed by situations perceived as difficult and inadequate. A disproportionate amount of time was spent discussing frustrations and challenges, compared to opportunities. With the exception of two workers who stated that they fully supported the practice, the remaining caseworkers hedged their support on several conditions. True to the theory of social construction, the reconstruction of knowledge and the willingness to accept this practice appears to be underway. This study did not address changes over time. However, based on this researcher’s personal experiences in 2006, caseworker willingness to accept kinship caregivers as a positive opportunity for children seems to have grown. Several workers recognized the importance of promoting kin ‘when they are appropriate.’ In fact, when workers did deem kin as ‘appropriate,’ they shared the belief that kinship care is a preferred placement over non-relative foster homes. Unfortunately, issues of triangulation and conflict can frustrate workers and undercut these beliefs. A large majority of workers appreciated the new standards and expectations of practice, but expressed the need to have more discretion to reject inappropriate kin placements. When workers are required to explore potential caregivers who they deem as inappropriate, their inability to cease these assessments at an earlier stage creates workload issues and dismay regarding this practice. Most workers were willing to accept kin caregivers with minor criminal records or a history of some financial struggles. By no means did they feel that kinship caregivers should be perfect, but they did express a need to have higher standards. In an effort to comply with legislation that supports the use of kin, many children are being placed in homes that are unsafe, with neglectful relatives, according to the workers I interviewed. Clearly, this was not the intention of Bill 210, and this practice should be re-examined. New policies and standards are required to ensure that children are receiving safe and appropriate care when placed with relatives.</p>
<p>An overwhelming number of workers discussed the financial stress placed on many kinship caregivers, and felt that more services should be provided to support these placements. Workers discussed their advocacy work and attempts to maneuver through a system that does not entirely support the unique situation of kinship caregivers. While positive worker attitudes may be important for successful placements for children, when workers feel powerless to help kinship caregivers, attitudes may not be enough to promote successful placements. Workers are willing to tailor services specifically for kin caregivers, but the current provincial funding has made it difficult for them to do so. While the Ontario Ministry of Child and Youth Services enables kinship caregivers to receive payment if they are approved as ‘foster parents,’ the majority of kin homes are not approved to receive such funding. As a result, kinship homes are often left to their own devices when it comes to finances. In order for kinship homes in Ontario to receive this per diem, they must be approved as ‘foster homes.’ Given budgetary pressures, agencies may avoid this practice because of the expense (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1473325011424086">Broad, 2002</xref>). Further, research interviews with kinship caregivers have found that they do not want nor do they feel the need to become official ‘foster homes’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1473325011424086">Broad, 2002</xref>). There is a common view that social work practice with kinship caregivers must recognize the uniqueness of their situation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1473325011424086">Aldgate and McIntosh, 2006</xref>), and Ontario policy should re-examine this approach.</p>
<p>This research has provided promising evidence that workers are embracing the idea of kinship care. These professionals note several limitations and frustrations with the practice, but expressed a true desire to try and improve the current practice. While professionals expressed opposition to the practice prior to the passing of Bill 210, today’s workers embrace the spirit of the legislation, while recognizing that certain areas require improvement.</p>
