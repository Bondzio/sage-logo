<abstract>
<p>The current study represents the first attempt to examine how genetic and environmental factors work in concert to influence gang membership, victimization, and the effect of gang membership on victimization experiences. Using data drawn from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health, the present study employs behavioral genetic modeling (i.e., the ACE model and the DeFries-Fulker model) to examine these associations. The findings indicate that gang affiliation is influenced significantly by both genetic factors and environmental factors that are uniquely experienced by the individual. Controlling for heritable influences, gang membership increased the risk of victimization over time. The latter finding suggests that gang membership operates as a nonshared environmental influence on victimization.</p>

<p>Beginning with the seminal work of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-1541204011429948">Thrasher (1927)</xref>, the connection between gang membership and delinquent and criminal behavior has been demonstrated consistently across a variety of samples (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1541204011429948">Barnes, Beaver, &amp; Miller, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1541204011429948">Cohen, 1969</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1541204011429948">Decker &amp; Van Winkle, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1541204011429948">Esbensen &amp; Huizinga, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1541204011429948">Hagedorn, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1541204011429948">Huff, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1541204011429948">Katz, Webb, &amp; Decker, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1541204011429948">Klein, 1971</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1541204011429948">Klein &amp; Maxson, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1541204011429948">Maxson &amp; Klein, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1541204011429948">Melde, Taylor, &amp; Esbensen, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1541204011429948">Spergel, 1964</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-1541204011429948">Thornberry, Krohn, Lizotte, &amp; Chard-Wierschem, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-1541204011429948">Vigil, 1988</xref>). That there is a correlation between gang membership and criminality is well established. As a result, some scholars have begun to examine the extent to which gang members are also <italic>victims</italic> of crime (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1541204011429948">Taylor, 2008</xref>). Specifically, there are at least three reasons to suspect that gang membership may increase the likelihood of criminal victimization.</p>
<p>First, decades of gang research has indicated that gang members are involved in criminal behavior, which some researchers suggest places them at a heightened risk of victimization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-1541204011429948">Taylor, Peterson, Esbensen, &amp; Freng, 2007</xref>). In other words, victimization may be a by-product of offending for gang members. Drawing from a routine activities perspective (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1541204011429948">Cohen &amp; Felson, 1979</xref>), participation in crime (e.g., drug sales, armed robberies, and assaults) contributes to gang members becoming suitable targets for victimization, given their exposure to motivated offenders and the lack of capable guardians (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1541204011429948">Taylor, Freng, Esbensen, &amp; Peterson, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>Second, gang members may be at an increased risk of victimization simply by nature of their gang membership status. Gang members may be victimized by members of their own gang during the process of initiation, which can involve being “jumped in” (i.e., physically assaulted) or “sexed in” (i.e., sexually assaulted or raped; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1541204011429948">Miller, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1541204011429948">Molidor, 1996</xref>). Alternatively, gang members are often victimized by rival gang members due to conflicts over specific “turf” (e.g., control over a particular location or neighborhood) or retaliatory violence such as drive-by-shootings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1541204011429948">Decker &amp; Van Winkle, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-1541204011429948">Taylor et al., 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>The third reason to suspect a relationship between gang membership and victimization concerns a more general link between criminal offending and victimization. Given the considerable evidence suggesting an overlap between offenders and victims (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1541204011429948">Gottfredson, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1541204011429948">Jensen &amp; Brownfield, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1541204011429948">Lauritsen &amp; Laub, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1541204011429948">Lauritsen, Laub, &amp; Sampson, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1541204011429948">Lauritsen, Sampson, &amp; Laub, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1541204011429948">Singer, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-1541204011429948">Wolfgang, 1958</xref>), it is plausible that gang members—people with a deeper commitment to delinquency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1541204011429948">Huff, 1998</xref>)—are more likely to be crime victims. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1541204011429948">Sparks (1982)</xref> argued that offenders may be more attractive targets to victimize, given that they may be unlikely to report the crime to police for fear of calling attention to their own wrongdoing. Alternatively, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1541204011429948">Apel and Burrow (2011)</xref> recently demonstrated that gang membership may arise as a <italic>response</italic> to victimization. To date, there has been only a modest amount of empirical research bearing on the link between gang membership and victimization.</p>
<sec id="section1-1541204011429948">
<title>The Relationship Between Gang Membership and Victimization</title>
<p>Qualitative research provided some of the initial evidence connecting gang membership and victimization. Decker and Van Winkle’s (1996) ethnographic interviews with active gang members suggested that these individuals are often injured from assaults and gunfire. Recently these researchers reported that nearly one third of the original sample of gang members (29 of the original 99) have died as a result of violence (Decker, personal communication, April 18, 2010). During interviews with juvenile gang members, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1541204011429948">Joe and Chesney-Lind (1995)</xref> identified an emerging trend for gang members to admit being victimized by childhood physical and sexual abuse. Furthermore, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1541204011429948">Miller and Decker (2001)</xref> determined through interviews with female gang members that most had witnessed violence—nearly 75% had witnessed someone being killed—and many had been personally victimized. Over half of the female gang members had been threatened with a weapon (59%), and about half had been physically attacked (48%) or sexually assaulted (44%).</p>
<p>More recently, quantitative research has begun to empirically assess the gang–victimization relationship using juvenile and young adult samples. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1541204011429948">Peterson, Taylor, and Esbensen (2004)</xref> compared gang and nongang elementary students from the Gang Resistance Education and Training (G.R.E.A.T.) program regarding their exposure to violent crime victimization, including simple assault (i.e., physical assault without a weapon), aggravated assault (i.e., assault with a weapon), and robbery. The results of the study suggested that gang members were more likely than nongang members to be victimized before they joined, while they were active members, and after they left the gang (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1541204011429948">Peterson, Taylor, &amp; Esbensen, 2004</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1541204011429948">Gover, Jennings, and Tewksbury (2009)</xref> reported that male and female gang members in high school were significantly more likely than nongang members to be victims of dating violence, sexual assault, and violent victimization.</p>
<p>Similar findings have been uncovered in samples of incarcerated juvenile arrestees (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1541204011429948">Decker, Katz, &amp; Webb, 2008</xref>) and adult jail inmates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1541204011429948">Fox, Lane, &amp; Akers, 2010</xref>). Examining the Arizona Arrestee Drug Abuse Monitoring (ADAM) program data, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1541204011429948">Decker, Katz, and Webb (2008)</xref> found a significant correlation between current and former juvenile gang member arrestees and victimization. Moreover, surveys administered to incarcerated jail inmates indicated that gang members were significantly more likely to be victims of property crime (e.g., theft and vandalism) and personal crimes (e.g., being threatened with weapon, attacked without weapon, attacked with weapon, robbed, stabbed, carjacked, witness intimidation, home invasion, drive-by shooting, shot at, and shot) as compared to nongang members (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1541204011429948">Fox et al., 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>Despite the findings mentioned above that support a link between gangs and victimization, at least two studies have presented mixed results regarding the association between gang membership and victimization. First, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1541204011429948">Spano, Freilich, and Bolland (2008)</xref> examined African American youth from the Mobile Youth Survey who were questioned about their gang status and victimization experiences. Although bivariate analyses suggested that gang membership was significantly associated with victimization, logistic regression models did not support the gang–victimization link once other factors were held constant. Second, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1541204011429948">Katz, Webb, Fox, and Shaffer (2011)</xref> reported that, prior to controlling for the effects of involvement in gang crime, that active gang members reported the highest victimization levels, followed by ex-gang members, gang associates, and finally by nongang youth. Once the effects of gang crime were controlled, however, the gang–victimization link fell to nonsignificance.</p>
<p>Collectively, the studies mentioned above offer support for a correlation between gang membership and victimization. Given the discrepant evidence produced by some studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1541204011429948">Katz et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1541204011429948">Spano, Freilich, &amp; Bolland, 2008</xref>), however, a number of researchers have begun to question whether gang membership exerts a causal influence on victimization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1541204011429948">Gibson, Miller, Jennings, Swatt, &amp; Gover, 2009</xref>). More specifically, some scholars have suggested that the relationship between gang membership and victimization may be spurious, owing instead to a selection effect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1541204011429948">Apel &amp; Burrow, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1541204011429948">DeLisi, Barnes, Beaver, &amp; Gibson, 2009</xref>). According to this perspective, a third variable (or variables) would predict both gang membership and victimization. To this point, relatively few studies have directly tested this possibility, and of the existing research, the findings have been mixed.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-1541204011429948">
<title>Gang Membership and Victimization: Selection and Enhancement Effects</title>
<p>There are various theoretical lenses that can be utilized to understand the effect of gang membership on a range of outcomes. Two of the most viable—at least for the current purposes—are referred to as the <italic>selection hypothesis</italic> and the <italic>enhancement hypothesis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-1541204011429948">Thornberry et al., 1993</xref>). Although these models were originally designed to explain the relationship between gang membership and offending, they may also explain the gang–victimization link. For example, the selection hypothesis states that youth who join gangs are those most likely to be victimized in the first place—perhaps suggesting that gang membership is sought as a protective mechanism (but see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1541204011429948">Melde &amp; Rennison, 2010</xref>). Thus, the gang is unlikely to have any direct effect on victimization. The enhancement hypothesis differs by suggesting that selection effects underlie gang membership, but that gang membership maintains a positive influence on victimization experiences. In other words, high-risk youth are most likely to join gangs. Once initiated, however, gang members have an elevated risk of being victimized—beyond their baseline (i.e., pregang) risk level.<sup>

</p>
<p>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1541204011429948">DeLisi, Barnes, Beaver, and Gibson (2009)</xref> attempted to account for possible selection effects through the use of propensity score matching (PSM). PSM is intended to approximate the random assignment portion of a true experimental design via the creation of matched groups based on a variety of covariates. These researchers utilized PSM to analyze data drawn from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (Add Health). The findings produced by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1541204011429948">DeLisi et al. (2009)</xref> suggested that gang members were significantly more likely than nongang members to be victims of crime even after controlling for selection effects among the participants. Thus, DeLisi and colleagues reported evidence to support the enhancement hypothesis. Similarly, an examination of the G.R.E.A.T. longitudinal data revealed support for the enhancement model, given that violent victimization was significantly higher for gang members before and after their gang membership (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1541204011429948">Peterson et al., 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>Gibson and associates (2009) adopted a similar analytic strategy to that of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1541204011429948">DeLisi et al. (2009)</xref> in their reexamination of the G.R.E.A.T. data. These authors reported that prior to the creation of matched groups, gang members were significantly more likely to be victimized (i.e., selection effects). Once youth were matched on a series of covariates, however, the relationship between gang membership and victimization failed to reach the level of statistical significance. Thus, Gibson et al.’s analysis suggests that selection effects completely account for the gang–victimization link. It is worth noting, however, that the data utilized by Gibson and colleagues only included information from 22 gang members, thereby reducing their power to detect significant differences (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1541204011429948">Ozer &amp; Engel, in press</xref>).</p>
<p>Ultimately, research on the issue of selection effects and enhancement effects in the gang–victimization relationship remains limited. Thus far, very few studies have directly examined these hypotheses and both arrived at different conclusions. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1541204011429948">DeLisi et al. (2009)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1541204011429948">Peterson et al. (2004)</xref> provided evidence that gang membership enhances victimization risks, while <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1541204011429948">Gibson, Miller, Jennings, Swatt, and Gover (2009)</xref> presented evidence that the correlation between gangs and victimization may be due to selection (but note the limited power of their statistical models). Although these studies offer important insight into the relationship between gangs and victimization, there is a need for additional research in this area. Moreover, there is an alternative possibility that has yet to be explored. Specifically, genetic factors have been found to influence both gang membership (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1541204011429948">Beaver, DeLisi, Vaughn, &amp; Barnes, 2010</xref>) and victimization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1541204011429948">Beaver, Boutwell, Barnes, &amp; Cooper, 2009</xref>). As a result, it is possible that genetic effects are driving the association between gang membership and victimization experiences (i.e., a selection effect may be operating at the genetic level).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-1541204011429948">
<title>The Genetic Underpinnings of Gang Membership and Victimization</title>
<p>Until very recently, there has been almost no empirical research aimed at examining the genetic underpinnings of either gang membership or victimization. Interestingly, however, much of the selection process into gangs and victimizing situations may be influenced by genetic factors. Research suggests that nearly every personality trait is under genetic influence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1541204011429948">Harris, 1998</xref>). For the current purposes, this means that personality traits which predict gang membership and propensity toward victimization might be, at least in part, heritable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1541204011429948">Beaver et al., 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>To begin, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1541204011429948">Ball et al. (2008)</xref> analyzed data from a sample of over 1,000 twin siblings in order to estimate the genetic and environmental contributions to victimization. These researchers were specifically interested in whether genetic factors played a role in the experience of being bullied among school-aged children. Ball and her team found that approximately 73% of the variance in measures of victimization was accounted for by genes. The remaining variance was attributable to the nonshared environment (i.e., environmental factors that work to make siblings less similar to one another).</p>
<p>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1541204011429948">Beaver, Boutwell, Barnes, and Cooper (2009)</xref> examined both the genetic and environmental influences on criminal victimization in adolescence among a sample of twins drawn from the Add Health data. The results of the analysis revealed that genetic factors accounted for approximately 40% of the variance in adolescent victimization. The remaining variance was primarily attributable to the nonshared environment. Interestingly, additional analyses revealed that around 60% of the variance in measures of repeat victimization was also attributable to genetic influences.</p>
<p>The studies mentioned thus far help to shed light on the genetic underpinnings of victimization. Comparatively less attention has been directed toward uncovering the genetic contributors to gang membership. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1541204011429948">Beaver, DeLisi, Vaughn, and Barnes (2010)</xref>, however, recently provided initial insight into this issue. These researchers were interested in whether specific variants in the monoamine oxidase A (<italic>MAOA</italic>) gene were related to various aspects of gang membership. The results of the analysis revealed several important findings. First, individuals who carried the low functioning alleles in the <italic>MAOA</italic> gene were more likely than other members of the sample to report gang membership. Second, carriers of the low-activity alleles were more likely to use a weapon in a fight compared to other members of the gang who did not carry the low-activity alleles. In short, Beaver and his colleagues found evidence that certain genetic variants predicted not only gang membership but also weapon use among gang members (i.e., a Gene × Environment interaction).</p>
<p>A nascent line of research has investigated the genetic underpinnings to victimization, while others have analyzed the genetic influences on gang membership. These studies have reported a genetic component to both outcomes. These results open the possibility that the gang–victimization link is driven, at least in part, by genetic factors that operate on the selection into both outcomes.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1541204011429948">
<title>The Current Study</title>
<p>Research has recently provided evidence for a link between gang membership and being victimized by crime. Several explanations have been proposed in order to account for the correlation between gang membership and victimization (e.g., social learning processes, exposure to violence, social disorganization, and routine activities). Some researchers, however, have argued that the association may be spurious, owing instead to a selection bias among certain individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1541204011429948">Gibson et al., 2009</xref>). For instance, it may be the case that persons most likely to be victimized by crime join gangs for protection. If victimization is partially scripted by genetic factors, then genetic influences may indirectly influence selection into gangs. Alternatively, if genetic factors impact selection into a gang and gang membership influences victimization probabilities, then genetic factors may indirectly influence selection into victimization.</p>
<p>There is emerging evidence suggesting that genetic factors are implicated in both becoming a gang member and being victimized. As a result, it is possible that genetic factors may be responsible, at least in part, for the association between gang membership and victimization. Along this line of reasoning, the current study has two goals. First, we examine the genetic and environmental contributors to both gang membership and victimization separately. Second, we test whether gang membership increases the risk of victimization once genetic influences are held constant.<sup>

<title>Data</title>
<p>Data for the current study were drawn from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (Add Health). The Add Health is a nationally representative and ongoing study of adolescents born in the United States (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1541204011429948">Harris, 2009</xref>). First, stratified cluster sampling techniques were employed in order to select 132 junior high and high schools. Second, students attending these schools were asked to complete a self-report questionnaire, with more than 90,000 adolescents participating in the Wave I in-school survey. Third, a subsample of in-school participants was selected in order to be reinterviewed in their homes. Overall, 20,745 adolescents and 17,700 of their primary caregivers participated in the Wave I in-home component of the study. During Wave I, information was gathered about the respondent’s personality traits, social relationships, and involvement with delinquency and substance use.</p>
<p>Data collection for Wave II began in April of 1996 and included approximately 71% of the participants who were sampled during Wave I. Wave II data collection procedures and survey items mirrored those used previously during Wave I. Approximately 5 years after Wave II data collection, a third round of interviews were conducted (i.e., Wave III). At the time of the Wave III interviews, a majority of the participants had reached the age of 18. As a result, the questions at Wave III featured an array of topics germane to early adulthood such as employment history, marital status, and criminal history. During Wave III, approximately 15,000 individuals agreed to participate in the interviews. Most recently, a fourth wave of data collection took place with 15,701 of the original Wave I respondents. Wave IV data were collected approximately 13 years after Wave I data collection began. Similar to Wave III efforts, respondents were asked to report on a number of topics relevant to young adulthood such as their marital history, experience with child rearing, and criminal behaviors.</p>
<p>One of the unique and important features of the Add Health data set was the oversampling of siblings who lived in the same household at Wave I (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1541204011429948">Rowe &amp; Jacobson, 1998</xref>). More specifically, monozygotic (MZ; identical) twins, dizygotic (DZ; fraternal) twins, full siblings, half-siblings, and cousins who lived together at Wave I were included in the sample (Harris et al., 2006). A total of 289 MZ twin pairs, 450 DZ twin pairs, 1,036 full sibling pairs, 358 half-sibling pairs, and 134 cousin pairs were utilized in the current analysis. The levels of genetic relatedness for these pairs are as follows: MZ twins share 100% of their DNA, DZ twins share 50% on average, full siblings share 50% on average, half-siblings share 25% on average, and cousins share 12.5% on average. Participants in the siblings sample were administered the same survey instruments as the other Add Health participants.</p>
<p>In the analyses that follow, these data were structured so that each case (i.e., row in the data file) corresponded to a twin pair. This method of formatting is known as single-entry, meaning that each sibling only appears once in the data set. Because the data are formatted with single-entry, information for Sibling 1 and for Sibling 2 will be presented separately.</p>

<title>Gang membership</title>
<p>During Wave III interviews, respondents were asked to indicate whether they had ever belonged to a named gang. Responses were coded dichotomously to represent those who had been in a gang (coded as 1) and those who had never belonged to a gang (coded as 0). Prior research on gangs largely relies on the self-report method for measuring gang membership (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1541204011429948">Barnes et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1541204011429948">Curry, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1541204011429948">Decker et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1541204011429948">Esbensen, Winfree, He, &amp; Taylor, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1541204011429948">Melde, Esbensen, &amp; Taylor, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1541204011429948">Peterson et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1541204011429948">Taylor et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-1541204011429948">Webb, Katz, &amp; Decker, 2006</xref>).

<title>Victimization</title>
<p>During Waves II, III, and IV interviews, respondents were asked about their victimization experiences over the past 12 months. At Wave II, respondents were asked to indicate whether and how often over the past 12 months they had seen someone get shot or stabbed, someone had pulled a knife or gun on them, someone had shot them, someone had cut them, and someone had jumped them. Responses were coded as 0 = <italic>never</italic>, 1 = <italic>once</italic>, and 2 = <italic>more than once</italic>. Factor analysis indicated that the 5 items could be combined into a single scale. As a result, the 5 items were summed together to create the Wave II victimization index (α = .70).</p>
<p>During Wave III interviews, respondents were again asked about recent victimization experiences. In addition to the 5 items included at Wave II, respondents were also asked to indicate whether they had been beaten up but nothing was stolen from them and whether they had been beaten up and something was stolen from them. The Wave III response categories differed from those at Wave II; Wave III response categories were 0 = <italic>no</italic> and 1 = <italic>yes</italic>.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-1541204011429948">3</xref>
</sup> For this reason, the range (and most likely the mean) of values for the Wave III victimization scale are expected to be smaller than for the Wave II victimization scale. Factor analysis suggested that the 7 items loaded onto a single underlying construct. Thus, the 7 items were summed into a single index tapping Wave III victimization experiences (α = .71).</p>
<p>Finally, during Wave IV interviews, respondents were asked to indicate whether any of the following six incidences had happened to them in the past 12 months: someone stole something from them that was worth more than $50, saw someone shoot or stab another person, someone pulled a knife or gun on them, someone shot or stabbed them, someone slapped, hit, choked, or kicked them, or they were beaten up (0 = <italic>no</italic>, 1 = <italic>yes</italic>). Factor analysis indicated that the underlying structure of the 6 items could be explained with one latent factor. As a result, the 6 items were summed together to create the Wave IV victimization index (α = .92).</p>

<sec id="section11-1541204011429948">
<title>Control variables</title>
<p>In order to account for any potential confounding influences, control variables for the respondent’s age (coded in years), race (0 = <italic>non-Black</italic>, 1 = <italic>Black</italic>), and gender (0 = <italic>female</italic>, 1 = <italic>male</italic>) were included in the multivariate analyses.</p>

<title>Analysis Plan</title>
<p>The analysis proceeded in three interlocking steps. The first step was to garner an understanding of whether genetic and environmental influences explained variance in Wave III gang membership and the three victimization scales. In order to glean these observations, cross-sibling statistics were calculated. Specifically, cross-sibling odds ratios were calculated for gang membership and cross-sibling correlations were calculated for the victimization scales. These statistics were estimated for each of the different sibling types (i.e., MZ twins, DZ twins and full siblings, half-siblings, and cousins) and will provide preliminary evidence of whether genetic and environmental factors underlie the etiology of gang membership and victimization. Evidence that genetic factors underlie each of the outcome variables will be obtained to the extent that the cross-sibling statistics reveal MZ twins as being more similar than DZ twins and full siblings, that DZ twins and full siblings are more similar than half-siblings, and that half-siblings are more similar than cousins (i.e., <italic>r</italic>MZ &gt; <italic>r</italic>DZ &amp; full siblings &gt; <italic>r</italic>Half-siblings &gt; <italic>r</italic>Cousins). Any deviation from this cascade of results suggests that environmental factors influence a portion of the variance. Also, evidence of nonshared environmental influences will be gleaned to the extent that the cross-sibling comparisons fall below unity for MZ twins.</p>
<p>The second step was to estimate the ACE model, which is presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1541204011429948">Figure 1</xref>, for Wave III gang membership, Wave II victimization, Wave III victimization, and Wave IV victimization. The ACE model was estimated using the structural equation modeling program, <italic>Mx</italic>, and is an improvement over the cross-sibling statistics because it provides direct estimates of the extent to which genetic, shared environmental, and nonshared environmental factors explain variance in the different variables. To do so, the ACE model partitions the variance in a phenotype into three components; a genetic component (denoted in the figure as A), a shared environmental component (denoted in the figure as C), and a nonshared environmental component (denoted in the figure as E). It is important to note that shared environments work to make siblings more similar to one another, while nonshared environments work in the opposite direction (i.e., to make siblings less similar to one another).</p>

</fig>
<p>The ACE model is often analyzed by behavioral geneticists, and it has recently been utilized by criminologists interested in examining the genetic and environmental underpinnings to various phenotypes (Barnes, Beaver, &amp; Boutwell, forthcoming; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-1541204011429948">Wright, Beaver, DeLisi, &amp; Vaughn, 2008</xref>). In order to estimate the ACE model on Wave III gang membership, the threshold model suggested by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1541204011429948">Neale and Maes (2004)</xref> was analyzed. In the analyses that follow, the best-fitting model is always presented.</p>
<p>The third step in the analysis was to determine whether, after accounting for genetic influences, gang membership acted as a nonshared environmental influence on Wave III victimization and on Wave IV victimization. Nonshared environmental factors work to make siblings less similar to one another. As a result, scholars can analyze nonshared environmental influences on the development of different phenotypes by observing between-sibling differences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1541204011429948">Beaver, 2008</xref>). In order to analyze nonshared environmental factors, it is important to first account for genetic differences between two siblings; since any differences between two siblings (with the exception of MZ twins) could be due to between-sibling differences in genetic factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1541204011429948">Plomin, 2011</xref>). For this portion of the analysis, the DeFries-Fulker model (DF; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1541204011429948">DeFries &amp; Fulker, 1985</xref>) presented by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1541204011429948">Rodgers, Rowe, and Li (1994)</xref> is analyzed:<disp-formula id="disp-formula1-1541204011429948">

</disp-formula>There are several points to note about the above <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="disp-formula1-1541204011429948">DF equation</xref>. First, the dependent variable is Sibling 1’s (<italic>K</italic>

<sub>2</sub>) information. Third, the coefficient of genetic relatedness is measured as <italic>R</italic> and the <italic>ENVDIF</italic> variable taps measured nonshared environments. The <italic>ENVDIF</italic> variable will capture the effect of gang membership on victimization experiences. Fourth, the coefficient estimates are interpreted as follows: <italic>b</italic>

<sub>2</sub> is interpreted as the genetic effect, and <italic>b</italic>
<sub>3</sub> reflects the impact of any measured nonshared environment (i.e., gang membership) on victimization. In sum, the DF model will allow for the investigation of whether gang membership serves as a nonshared environmental influence on both contemporaneous (Wave III) and longitudinal (Wave IV) victimization experiences after accounting for the genetic influences on victimization experiences (i.e., after controlling for possible genetic selection effects). In these analyses, Wave II victimization was utilized as a control variable to account for any environmental effects that may explain longitudinal stability in victimization experiences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1541204011429948">Beaver et al., 2009</xref>).</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>The first step in the analysis was to analyze the degree to which genetic and environmental factors influenced gang membership and the three victimization scales. To do so, two analytic techniques were carried out. The first was to analyze cross-sibling similarities. These statistics are presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1541204011429948">Table 2</xref>. Presented in the first column are the cross-sibling odds ratios for gang membership. A quick glance reveals that MZ twins were more concordant for gang membership than any of the other three sibling types. To be sure, if Sibling 1 was a gang member, the odds that Sibling 2 was a gang member were increased by nearly 250% for MZ twins. DZ twins and full siblings, half-siblings, and cousins did not show concordance rates anywhere near that observed for MZ twins. Preliminarily, these findings suggest that genetic factors predict variation in gang membership, but the environment may also be at play (note that cousins are more similar to one another than were half-siblings).</p>

<p>The cross-sibling correlations for the three victimization scales are presented next. A quick glance at the correlations for Wave II victimization suggests that genetic factors are important (i.e., <italic>r</italic>MZ &gt; <italic>r</italic>DZ and full siblings), but that the environment may explain a portion of the variance (<italic>r</italic>Half-siblings &gt; <italic>r</italic>DZ and full siblings). A similar conclusion is drawn from the cross-sibling correlations for Wave III victimization. Specifically, MZ twins were more similar than DZ twins and full siblings. Half-siblings were, however, more similar to one another than any other pair type. Note also that the cross-sibling correlations were weak across all pair types for Wave III victimization. These findings suggest the environment, particularly the nonshared environment, may explain a large portion of the variance. Finally, the Wave IV victimization cross-sibling correlations reveal a pattern of findings that suggest nonshared environmental influences are important. Note that the MZ twin correlation is nearly .00. This finding strongly implicates the nonshared environment in the etiology of Wave IV victimization experiences.</p>
<p>The second technique used to analyze the genetic and environmental contributions to gang membership and victimization was the ACE model. The results from these analyses can be found in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1541204011429948">Table 3</xref>. Turning first to the results from the gang membership model, we see that genetic factors accounted for approximately 26% of the variance in Wave III gang membership. This result indicates that genetic factors partially influence a person’s decision to join a gang. Nonshared environments, however, played a much larger role in gang membership. As shown in the table, the nonshared environment explained 74% of the variance in the gang membership variable. The shared environment did not explain any of the variance in Wave III gang membership.</p>

<p>Also presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1541204011429948">Table 3</xref> are the ACE model estimates for the three victimization scales. Victimization experiences reported at Wave II were under genetic influence (<italic>h</italic>
<sup>2</sup> = .34), while the nonshared environment explained the remaining variance (<italic>e</italic>
<sup>2</sup> = .66). The shared environment did not account for any of the variance in the Wave II victimization scale. The results from the Wave III victimization analysis painted a similar picture; genetic factors (<italic>h</italic>
<sup>2</sup> = .12) and nonshared environmental influences (<italic>e</italic>
<sup>2</sup> = .88) accounted for all of the variance. The shared environment did not explain any variance in Wave III victimization. The ACE model estimates for the Wave IV victimization scale, however, were slightly different. As shown in the table, genetic factors did not play a role in respondents’ victimization experiences that were reported at Wave IV. Instead, the nonshared environment accounted for nearly all of the variance (<italic>e</italic>
<sup>2</sup> = .99), with the shared environment explaining the remaining portion (<italic>c</italic>
<sup>2</sup> = .01).</p>
<p>In broad strokes, the ACE model results from the three victimization scales indicated two important findings. First, genetic factors partially underlie victimization experiences (at least those reported at Waves II and III), leaving open the possibility that the relationship between gang membership and victimization is spurious due to shared genetic influences. The second finding to note is that the nonshared environment explained the largest portion of the variance for all three victimization scales. This finding is compatible with the argument that gang membership has a causal effect on victimization—to the extent that gang membership operates as a <italic>nonshared</italic>
<italic>environmental</italic>
<italic>influence</italic>. The next step in the analysis attempted to discern whether the gang–victimization overlap was spurious, owing to uncontrolled shared genetic factors, or whether the overlap was due to gang membership affecting victimization experiences via nonshared environmental mechanisms.</p>
<p>Presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-1541204011429948">Table 4</xref> are the results from the DF models where gang membership is utilized as a nonshared environmental predictor of victimization experiences.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-1541204011429948">4</xref>
</sup> Recall that these models analyze sibling differences and, therefore, remove the influence that uncontrolled genetic factors may have on the gang–victim overlap. If, however, gang membership has a true (i.e., nonspurious) relationship with victimization, the DF models will identify a statistically significant relationship between the gang membership variable and the victimization scale.<sup>

<p>The findings from the two DF models were quite similar in their substantive interpretation. To be specific, when Wave III gang membership is measured as a nonshared environmental influence, we see that it has a positive and statistically significant relationship with victimization experiences reported at Wave III and victimization experiences reported at Wave IV. These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that gang membership has an effect on the likelihood that a person will be victimized.<sup>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>There is a growing recognition among criminologists that the likelihood of being victimized increases in conjunction with joining a gang (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1541204011429948">Decker et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1541204011429948">Fox et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1541204011429948">Gover, Jennings, &amp; Tewksbury, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1541204011429948">Melde, Taylor, &amp; Esbensen, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1541204011429948">Peterson et al., 2004</xref>). A number of hypotheses have been suggested to account for the link between gang affiliation and victimization. Routine activities explanations, for example, posit that victimization would be naturally correlated with gang membership due to increased exposure on the part of gang members to potentially dangerous situations during the commission of a crime (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1541204011429948">Cohen &amp; Felson, 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1541204011429948">Taylor et al., 2008</xref>). Researchers have also highlighted the possibility that criminals (e.g., gang members) are less likely to report criminal victimization to the authorities, thus they are by definition more attractive targets to potential assailants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1541204011429948">Sparks, 1982</xref>). Other scholars have recently begun to argue that the association between gangs and victimization is spurious, owing to unmeasured variables (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1541204011429948">Gibson et al., 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>The current study proposed a unique research question: specifically, whether genetic influences accounted for the correlation between (i.e., the selection into) gang membership and victimization. Analysis of the Add Health sibling pairs revealed three broad findings that merit discussion. First, genetic factors accounted for approximately 26% of the variance in gang membership measured at Wave III. The remaining variance was captured by the nonshared environment. The shared environment failed to explain any of the variance in gang membership. What this pattern of findings suggests is that gang affiliation is influenced significantly by both genetic factors and environmental factors that are uniquely experienced by the individual. This is not altogether surprising, given prior research which revealed a genetic influence on both gang membership and gang violence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1541204011429948">Beaver et al., 2010</xref>). The lack of a shared environmental influence, however, stands in stark contrast to traditional criminological explanations of gang membership (i.e., those that point to familial and even neighborhood-level influences on gang membership), suggesting that the etiology of this phenomenon is more complex than has been anticipated. As a result, the role of the nonshared environment warrants further investigation on the part of researchers and was the guiding focus for the remainder of the current analysis.</p>
<p>The second important finding in the current study involves the contributing factors to victimization. Approximately 34% of the variance in victimization at Wave II, for example, was attributable to genetic factors. The remaining variance was captured by the nonshared environment and measurement error (66%). As with gang membership, the shared environment failed to contribute to victimization experiences. Across Waves III and IV, however, genetic effects began to wane and the nonshared environment emerged as the most salient predictor of victimization. Indeed, when Wave IV victimization was analyzed, nearly all of the variance was attributable to the nonshared environment.</p>
<p>Prior research suggests that nonshared environmental influences begin to “stack-up” over time and will, as a result, explain more variance in certain outcomes over different periods of the life course (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1541204011429948">Ferguson, 2010</xref>). The current finding that Wave IV victimization is primarily influenced by the nonshared environment may reflect these processes. Also, it may be that Wave IV victimization experiences were more likely to result from random or chance events as compared to Waves II and III victimization. If this were the case, the nonshared environment would be implicated most strongly as a causal factor. Consider that the Add Health respondents were adolescents at Wave II and young adults at Wave III. Both waves, therefore, were drawn from periods marked by higher rates of interpersonal conflict as compared to other stages of the life course. Thus, it may be no surprise that adolescent and early adult victimization involves a greater degree of genetic influence as compared to the more random and infrequent victimization experiences typical of older adults (i.e., Wave IV). This explanation does not appear to map up with the mean victimization scores reported in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1541204011429948">Table 1</xref> (which revealed that Wave IV victimization was more frequent than victimization at earlier waves), but it must be noted that the Wave IV victimization scale included an item not available at earlier waves. Namely, Wave IV victimization included whether the respondent had been slapped or hit. This divergence in coding from wave to wave may also explain some portion of the effects observed here.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-1541204011429948">7</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>Because both gang affiliation and victimization were found to be at least somewhat heritable, the possibility that shared genetic factors might be driving the association between gang membership and victimization was necessarily raised. To control for this possibility, and to also investigate the effects of gang affiliation on victimization, we utilized DF analysis to isolate the impact of gang membership on victimization experiences. This phase of the analysis uncovered the third important finding in the current study. Specifically, even after controlling for heritable influences on victimization (and controlling for prior victimization experiences), gang membership increased the risk of victimization at both Waves III and IV.</p>
<p>This final portion of the analysis is particularly appealing because it highlights one possible <italic>nonshared</italic> environmental mechanism—gang membership—that may underlie victimization. Contemporary behavioral geneticists have begun to theorize about the various nonshared environmental factors that influence phenotypic development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-1541204011429948">Turkheimer &amp; Waldron, 2000</xref>). Since the nonshared environment has consistently been found to have the largest environmental impact on personality development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1541204011429948">Harris, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1541204011429948">Moffitt, 2005</xref>), future research would do well to try to identify the different nonshared environments that are operative. In this way, the current study represents an advancement of the current gang literature.</p>
<p>The empirical findings also have important implications for preventing and addressing gang membership and victimization. Our finding that gang membership increases victimization even after accounting for heritable factors may help inform antigang policies. It is interesting to note that the <italic>shared</italic> environment contributed little to understanding the gang–victimization link, especially given that prior research suggests that having a family member in a gang is a reason why some join gangs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1541204011429948">Decker &amp; Van Winkle, 1996</xref>). Recall that shared environments manifest similarities between siblings while nonshared environments yield sibling differences. It is possible, then, that tailoring gang awareness and antigang programming toward youth with gang-involved family members may not make as big of an impact as programs focused on nonshared environmental factors. For example, the influence of peers may play a larger role, especially given that gang members report that the gang is a surrogate family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1541204011429948">Joe &amp; Chesney-Lind, 1995</xref>). Regardless, reducing the prevalence of gang membership among youth is likely to have positive effects on the target youth, as well as youth on the periphery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1541204011429948">Randa &amp; Wilcox, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>Given the importance of nonshared environmental factors in the etiology of gang membership, it is possible that the “ties that bind” among youth are actually better explained by peers than biology. If this is true, prevention policies may be more effectively geared toward identifying at-risk youth and tailoring prevention strategies to each individual’s unique needs. Educational campaigns may also benefit certain youth, though it is uncertain whether school-based interventions would exert nonshared environmental influences. If school-based interventions do work as nonshared environments, then programs such as G.R.E.A.T. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1541204011429948">Esbensen, Osgood, Taylor, Peterson, &amp; Freng, 2001</xref>) may be a viable intervention strategy. If G.R.E.A.T. operates as a shared environmental influence, however, the efficacy of this program may be drawn into question.</p>
<p>The role of genetics in the etiology of gang membership and victimization raises some interesting questions that must be tackled by future research. The current results would appear to suggest that prevention and intervention strategies should be multifaceted, including perhaps early detection technologies such as genetic testing. It would, however, be <italic>far</italic> too premature to recommend anything of the sort. The current study revealed that genetic variance in the Add Health sample explains a portion of the variance in gang membership and adolescent victimization. While important, this says nothing about <italic>which</italic> genes have an impact on these outcomes. Indeed, we know of only one study that speaks to the molecular genetic linkages to gang membership (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1541204011429948">Beaver et al., 2010</xref>). With recent estimates showing that the human genome consists of roughly 25,000 genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1541204011429948">International Human Genome Sequencing Consortium, 2004</xref>), it is easy to see that we are far from reaching a “genetic explanation” of gang membership or victimization (Beaver et al., 2011). In other words, there is much to be learned about the molecular genetic factors that underlie gang membership, victimization, and antisocial behavior. Future research is likely to benefit most by studying genes known to impact brain function or formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1541204011429948">Raine, 2008</xref>) such as genes that code for dopamine production, receptors, and/or neurotransmission.</p>
<p>Prior to concluding, it is important to recognize that the current study was not without limitations. Specifically, there are two shortcomings that need to be addressed. First, the measurement of gang membership included in our analysis consisted of asking respondents whether they had <italic>ever</italic> been a member of a named gang, thereby combining gang and ex-gang members. The nature of the gang measure, in other words, limited our ability to distinguish current gang members from former members. It is possible, then, that our pattern of findings would be altered somewhat had we been able to distinguish current and former gang members. Despite this possibility, it is likely the case that any bias introduced by including former gang members along with current members would diminish the effect of gang membership on victimization. Given that individuals are less likely to be victimized after leaving a gang (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1541204011429948">Katz et al., 2011</xref>), lumping former and current gang members together is likely to downwardly influence the association between victimization and gang membership. As a result, the current study represents a conservative test of the gang–victimization relationship (i.e., we were <italic>less</italic> likely to find an effect by combining current and former gang members).</p>
<p>The second limitation of the current study concerns the generalizability of our findings. Specifically, the data contained in the Add Health sample were not capable of identifying the particular gang affiliations of the participants. As a result, it would be premature to suggest that our findings apply to all types of gang affiliations equally. However, it is important to note that these data were derived from a nationally representative sample, and that the existing gang–victimization literature has not disaggregated based on gang affiliation to date. Future research that is capable of probing deeper into the relationship between gangs and victimization should be able to provide clarity on the generalizability of the results contained herein.</p>
<p>The goal of the current study was to further unpack the relationship between gang membership and criminal victimization by using two genetically informed research designs. Similar to other studies that have investigated theoretical explanations for victimization, the current study should not be misinterpreted as blaming crime victims for their victimization (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1541204011429948">Schreck, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1541204011429948">Stewart, Elifson, &amp; Sterk, 2004</xref>). Instead, we aimed to widen the “conceptual lens” by examining risk factors for victimization (and the gang–victimization link) from an alternative perspective (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1541204011429948">Lauritsen et al., 1991</xref>, p. 287). The current study also supports the contention of prior researchers that behavioral genetic techniques are among the most powerful avenue for examining environmental influences on human outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1541204011429948">Rutter, 2006</xref>). Indeed, the importance of the current study is not restricted to the gang–victimization literature. As has been noted previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1541204011429948">Beaver, 2009</xref>), the only way to capture a pure estimate of environmental influences on a behavioral phenotype is to first control for genetic influences. Whereas some environmentally oriented researchers have contended that behavioral geneticists are <italic>only</italic> concerned with genetic effects on behavior, the current analysis is an example of how genetic effects can be held constant in order to more directly explore the role of the environment (e.g., gang membership) on a given outcome. Moving forward, criminology as a field stands to benefit from incorporating behavioral and molecular genetics research designs into the study of antisocial behavior. The current study may help serve as a template for future researchers who desire to rigorously examine the role of the environment on human development.</p>

<p>It should be noted that the social facilitation hypothesis was also proposed, which posits that gang membership causes delinquency. Although this model could also be modified to explain the relationship between gang membership and victimization (i.e., gang membership causes victimization), the few studies that have tested these models have not provided support for the social facilitation hypothesis.</p>

<p>The covariance between gang membership and Wave III victimization was decomposed with a bivariate Cholesky model.

<p>A third explanation for the large nonshared environmental component to Wave IV victimization may lie in the fact that the ACE model includes measurement error as part of the nonshared environmental estimate. This appears to have played less of a role, however, because the reliability coefficient for the Wave IV scale was higher than either of the prior two waves, suggesting <italic>less</italic> measurement error at Wave IV.</p>
