<abstract>
<p>Digital data inundation has far-reaching implications for: disciplinary jurisdiction; the relationship between the academy, commerce and the state; and the very nature of the sociological imagination. Hitherto much of the discussion about these matters has tended to focus on ‘transactional’ data held within large and complex commercial and government databases. This emphasis has been quite understandable – such transactional data does indeed form a crucial part of the informational infrastructures that are now emerging. However, in recent years new sources of data have become available that possess a rather different character. This is data generated in the cultural sphere, not only as a result of routine transactions with various digital media but also as a result of what some would want to view as a shift towards popular cultural forms dominated by processes of what has been termed prosumption. Our analytic focus here is on contemporary prosumption practices, digital technologies, the public life of data and the playful vitality of many of the ‘glossy topics’ that constitute contemporary popular culture.</p>

<p>It has long been obvious that ‘[a]s more and more behaviour is conducted electronically, more and more things can be measured more and more often’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0263276413476542">Abbott, 2000</xref>: 298). According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0263276413476542">Abbott (2000: 299)</xref> this requires that we ‘rethink data analysis from the ground up’. However, this digital data inundation is not just a narrow technical methodological matter for the social sciences; it has been argued that it has far broader implications for disciplinary jurisdiction, the relationship between the academy, commerce and the state and, indeed, for the very nature of the sociological imagination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0263276413476542">Savage and Burrows, 2007</xref>). Hitherto much of the discussion about these matters has tended to focus on what has come to be termed ‘transactional’ data held within large and complex commercial and government databases – data that is generated as a by-product of routine transactions between citizens, consumers, business and government. This emphasis has been quite understandable – such transactional data does indeed form a crucial part of the informational infrastructures emerging under conditions of <italic>Knowing Capitalism</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0263276413476542">Thrift, 2005</xref>). However, in recent years new sources of data have become available that possess a rather different character. This is data generated in the cultural sphere not only as a result of routine transactions with various digital media – although that remains important – but also, and crucially, as a result of what some would want to view as an epochal shift towards popular cultural forms dominated by processes of what has been termed <italic>prosumption</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0263276413476542">Ritzer and Jurgenson, 2010</xref>). Our analytic focus here is on such data – data that is, for the most part, actively both produced and consumed via myriad acts of ‘playbour’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0263276413476542">Kane, 2004</xref>). A concrete focus on such data provides an interesting illustration of a central thesis of Thrift’s <italic>Knowing Capitalism</italic> – that the analysis of contemporary sociocultural transformations should not only foreground the role of often-unseen informational infrastructures in the co-construction of everyday lives but also that we should take <italic>play</italic> seriously. For Thrift, ‘capitalism is not just hard graft. It is also fun. People get stuff from it – and not just more commodities. Capitalism has a kind of crazy vitality … It gets involved in all kinds of extravagant symbioses’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0263276413476542">Thrift, 2005</xref>: 1). It is with some of the ‘extravagant symbioses’ that are emerging between contemporary prosumption practices, digital technologies, the public life of data and the playful vitality of many of the ‘glossy topics’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0263276413476542">Beer and Penfold-Mounce, 2010</xref>) that constitute contemporary popular culture that concerns us here. Play generates data in the kind of digital and information-dense context described by Thrift and others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0263276413476542">Crang and Graham, 2007</xref>). We are certainly interested in how digital prosumption activities generate new forms of social data, but we also want to describe the recursive ways in which such data can be re-appropriated as a part of the organization and relations of contemporary popular culture, or what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0263276413476542">Mackenzie (2005)</xref> has called the ‘performativity of circulation’. Popular culture is at the centre of the transformations that have facilitated the accumulation of digital data; but it is also at the heart of the issues and debates that face the social sciences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0263276413476542">Beer and Burrows, 2010a</xref>). In order to understand new forms of social data we need to understand the part played by popular culture in its accumulation and flow; that is to say that we need to think about the way in which popular culture is folded into this ‘performativity of circulation’.</p>
<p>We use the notion of prosumption here simply as a sensitizing concept that points towards the perhaps rather banal observation that the analytic distinction between consumption and production has often been overdrawn by social scientists (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0263276413476542">Beer and Burrows, 2010b</xref>). It simply alerts us to the observation that various Web 2.0 applications, or social media as they are now often referred to – Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, Wikipedia, blogs and the rest – have facilitated the increasing participation of people in the formation of media content. This involvement, according to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0263276413476542">Turner (2010)</xref>, is part of a much broader ‘demotic turn’, in which ‘ordinary’ people have become much more prominent in media content (for more on the spectacular and moralistic melodrama of this coverage of ordinary lives see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0263276413476542">Skeggs, 2005</xref>). Although <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0263276413476542">Ritzer and Jurgenson (2010)</xref> perhaps overstate the significance of the concept of prosumption, they do point to the significant phenomena of the growing amount of ‘labouring’ people are undertaking as they ‘play’ with these new technologies: creating profiles; making status updates; distributing information; sharing files; uploading images; blogging; tweeting; and the rest. These can be thought of as spaces of cultural engagement that extend the boundaries of the ‘social factory’ across everyday life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0263276413476542">Gill and Pratt, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0263276413476542">Terranova, 2000</xref>). This type of media engagement, premised on participation of various types, is creating new and vast forms of data about us, some of which is not necessarily transactional in content. Our primary concern here is with the manner in which these activities are creating new forms of social data – data generated as a by-product of new forms of popular cultural engagement. We are concerned with how this by-product data also comes to constitute and reshape cultural forms and practices as they occur.</p>
<p>We begin with some reflections upon the component parts of the infrastructure that affords this new data accumulation. We then draw upon this framework in order to provide an overview of the types of data archives that are emerging. The article identifies four different types of archive that capture different types of by-product data in different ways; we loosely organize this overview in terms of differences in the levels of ‘prosumer’ activity involved in the co-construction and maintenance of the archive. We then shift our attention to the <italic>recursivity of data in popular culture</italic>; here we draw upon a range of examples to illustrate the ‘performativity of circulation’ of contemporary culture and show the different ways in which by-product data affects the form and ‘doing’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0263276413476542">Savage et al., 2010</xref>) of popular culture. We briefly conclude with some reflections on the relations between popular culture and by-product data and by returning to the challenges and potentials for social and cultural research in such a changing technological and cultural landscape.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec2-0263276413476542"><title>Popular Culture and Digital Archives</title>
<p>There are some conceptual points of reference that are needed in order to begin to appreciate the generation of digital by-product data as well as the form this data takes and the way it is organized. We begin with some reflections on how popular culture accumulates by-product data through and within different types of archives. In order to do this it is useful first to identify four component features of popular cultural archives that enable us to differentiate their form, use and content: <italic>profiles</italic>; <italic>linkages and data intersectionality</italic>; <italic>metadata</italic>; and <italic>play</italic>.</p>
<p>The <italic>profile</italic> is the site or node of data accumulation and is central to contemporary culture. Much of contemporary culture requires us to build up an individual profile that accumulates information about a particular person. This profile might be constructed by the user to allow them into a social networking site, or it could be the product of the music consumed through a music streaming service or when purchasing books and the like, or it might be the types of profiles generated on games consoles, such as the Mii profile on the popular Nintendo Wii games console. We should perhaps expect this tendency, for as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0263276413476542">Featherstone (2006: 592)</xref> notes, the modern nation-state has been ‘based not on the ideology of individualism, but the actuality of individuation’. The profile is the aspect of contemporary culture that enables ‘people’s lives … [to be] seen as singularities’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0263276413476542">Featherstone, 2006</xref>: 592). Profiles are the case-based instances in which data is accumulated.</p>
<p>Second, we can point to the significance of <italic>linkages</italic> and what might be thought of as <italic>data intersectionality</italic>. These linkages and intersections are the connections that form between people and things as a consequence of data harvesting and mining, or through the connections made between people and things as they search and browse pre- and self-organized content. Some linkages are automated and occur through algorithmic processes of recommendation and selection, others are more agentic and occur through routine practices and shared tastes and preferences. Thinking in terms of linkages and data intersectionality allows us to consider broader data assemblages, or as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0263276413476542">Kitchin and Dodge (2011: 7)</xref> have put it: ‘coded assemblages’ which occur where ‘several different coded infrastructures converge’. We can begin to see how data generated moves between archives and how archives feed into one another – we can also begin to think about how these ‘<italic>agencements</italic>’ – the manner in which ‘agency and action are contingent upon and constituted by the sociotechnical arrangements that make them up’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0263276413476542">Ruppert, 2011</xref>: 225) – enact subjectivity and produce populations.</p>
<p>The third component feature is <italic>metadata</italic>. Metadata enables the organization and self-organization of archives; it classifies content and makes it searchable and accessible. Metadata is transcendent and overarching. It is data itself, of course, but it plays the part of filtering, making content readily searchable, it classifies and groups, it is created through processes of data tagging and can be thought of as a type of classification system that works from the ground up (as it is created in everyday cultural engagements rather than being imposed upon cultural forms). Popular culture increasingly generates both data <italic>and</italic> metadata as a by-product.</p>
<p>Finally, <italic>play</italic> is crucial in understanding the new social data and the social life of this data and of the methods that work through it. As we have already intimated, through referring to the work of Thrift, this is about how people generate and create data both actively and passively through their engagements with popular culture, as they have fun and as they find and consume stuff. As we will discuss, various forms of data are lending themselves to play in various forms of vernacular social research, particularly in the sphere of visualization. Among other things, we begin to open up here a culture of visualization built upon types of play, formed in a vast cultural ludodrome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0263276413476542">Atkinson and Willis, 2007</xref>) and its attendant expectations of playfulness.</p>
<p>With this basic framework in place for differentiating forms of content and the practices involved in their creation we can turn our attention to the archives themselves. Archives are often the product of accumulated constituent profiles organized through metadata, but they might also be archives of content created by a variety of means (e.g. through wikis and the like). This creates questions about the way in which we might understand what an archive is or how we might think of different types of archive. Should we treat websites as individual archives? This would most likely be quite narrow. Should we think of one big digital archive with component strands? Perhaps this would be too broad. Instead we choose here to use the framework we have outlined to work with a differentiated vision of contemporary cultural archives based upon the type of content that they hold and the practices that underpin that content. As things stand these new archives have been given little attention beyond <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0263276413476542">Featherstone’s (2000: 170)</xref> crucial observation that, as a result of developments in contemporary media, we should no longer just ‘see the archive as a specific place’ in which documents are deposited. Instead he asks, ‘should the walls of the archive be extended and placed around everyday life?’ As we show below, the answer to this is clearly in the affirmative. This statement is some dozen years old now and we have been a little slow to follow up on using the archive as a conceptual device for understanding the formation of cultural content. In fact, there is a good deal to suggest strong support for <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0263276413476542">Featherstone’s (2006: 595)</xref> assertion that ‘the will to archive is a powerful impulse in contemporary culture’. Archives are central to the operation of much of contemporary popular culture and are organized and searchable in a variety of ways with ‘non-linear’ points of entry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0263276413476542">Lash, 2002</xref>). Archives provide a useful focal point for understanding the interplay of component parts of the framework and enable us to see the concrete ‘instantiation’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0263276413476542">Hayles, 1999</xref>) of information (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0263276413476542">Moore et al., 2010</xref>). We might usefully think of this new data as being generative of four interrelated types of archive that can be placed on a loose continuum based upon the level of prosumer activity present in their operation; that is to say simply that using the framework above we can crudely arrange the different types of archives we have located based upon the level of participation of those engaging with various types of cultural resource: <italic>transactional archives</italic>; <italic>archives of the everyday</italic>; <italic>viewpoint or opinion archives</italic>; and <italic>crowdsourcing archives</italic>. We will very briefly sketch each of these out before showing how they fit into the framework we have outlined, and in order to provide an infrastructural and contextual backdrop for the flows of culture that we go on to describe in more detail. We begin with the types of archives that are more consumer-oriented and transactional and work towards those that are defined more in terms of the ‘playbour’ of their users.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0263276413476542">1</xref></sup> From the outset we would like to be clear that this should not be seen as a rigid typology; rather these types of archive should be thought of as overlapping and fluid – they are intended as a device for thinking about the formation of contemporary culture. It might, for example, even be the case that particular web applications can be thought of as containing multiple types of archive content. The value of the framework used here is that it might help us to unpick such instances, to see how they operate and to understand how this flows back into cultural constellations.</p>
<sec id="sec3-0263276413476542"><title>Transactional archives</title>
<p>Transactional archives capture the cultural forms that are consumed by ‘transactional actors’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0263276413476542">Savage et al., 2010</xref>: 11). Taken in its narrowest sense, the content of these archives tends to be largely defined by commercial organizations rather than those that use the archives (although users might be engaged in rating and reviewing or perhaps commenting on the content). These transactional archives contain materials that can be searched and purchased, viewed or streamed from the source. Typical examples would be iTunes, Spotify, Amazon and now even something like the BBC iPlayer. An engagement with these archives is usually relatively easily defined as an act of consumption, of locating and consuming a cultural product. These archives, though, are perhaps a little more complex than this would at first suggest. Just to partly begin to elaborate upon this complexity, these transactional archives are responsible for generating a kind of back-end archive about users as data is generated through acts of consumption and is captured for harvesting by commercial organizations. These archives contain the cultural forms themselves as well as data about the transactions that occur; these sit as visible and invisible dimensions of transactional archives – the high-profile theft of data from the Sony Playstation network in April 2011 is one illustrative moment where these back-end archives suddenly become publicly visible. Profiles are built up about individuals and populations of consumers, both directly from their engagement with the archive or by ‘scrobbling’ information about cultural consumption patterns from various mobile logjects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0263276413476542">Dodge and Kitchin, 2009</xref>), about which more below.</p>
<p>It is perhaps obvious that our engagement with contemporary cultural forms often requires some form of interface – or in fact an interplay of interfaces and materiality in the form of hardware devices and software (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0263276413476542">Kittler, 1995</xref>). As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0263276413476542">Poster (1996: 20)</xref> explains, ‘the interface stands between the human and machinic, a kind of membrane’. These various interfaces have of course become ubiquitous, with iPods, iPhones, iPads and the like contributing to the formation of a kind of ‘interface culture’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0263276413476542">Johnson, 1997</xref>) in which, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0263276413476542">Kittler (1996)</xref> puts it, the ‘city is a medium’ and space and place become part of the ‘content’ of media (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0263276413476542">Adams, 2010</xref>). Or, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0263276413476542">Featherstone (2006)</xref> has argued with reference to Benjamin, the city is an ‘archive’. A good example of the type of detailed data that might accumulate around the consumption of popular culture is in the area of music and mobile music. Mobile music devices are now a common staple of everyday life; massive sales figures for such devices indicate just how integrated they have become in the practices of popular cultural consumption. The use of such devices creates a detailed log of the music that is consumed, which songs, how many times, for how long and so on. These are then recorded when the device is docked with a computer and the software records the data about these listening practices, which can then be harvested by commercial organizations. We might also imagine that these data may contain locational and time data that allow the consumption of popular culture to be placed within a temporal geography. These devices act as what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0263276413476542">Dodge and Kitchin (2009)</xref> refer to as ‘logjects’, objects that record their own history and usage. The result is that popular cultural consumption is eminently more ‘trackable’, to the extent that massive accumulations of data are occurring that record exactly what it is that people are consuming. We can only imagine the scale and density of such a body of information about people’s cultural consumption practices and what it might reveal. If we then begin to add in the range of sources that individuals are using for such cultural consumption we begin to see that there are many variegated places in which such data might end up: the different software used for supporting mobile music devices; the range of retailers from which music downloads may be purchased; the illegal cultural consumption we hear so much about (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0263276413476542">David, 2010</xref>); and the rise of cultural streaming sites that allow any music to be consumed for free at the cost of listening to advertising. These are all generating and capturing data about the consumption of popular culture, some clearly on a greater scale than others.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec4-0263276413476542"><title>Archives of the everyday</title>
<p>The next type of archive speaks directly to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0263276413476542">Bauman’s (2007)</xref> much discussed observations concerning what he calls the ‘confessional society’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0263276413476542">Beer, 2008</xref>); this we might think of as being a set of observations about the emergence, to return to Featherstone, of <italic>archives of the everyday</italic>. Developments in social networking sites in particular have rendered undoubtedly true Featherstone’s observations about the shifting boundaries of the walls of the archive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0263276413476542">Featherstone, 2000</xref>: 161; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0263276413476542">Featherstone, 2006</xref>), with applications like Facebook representing an archive of (selected aspects of) the everyday lives of some (currently) over 500 million people. Similarly we find archives of videos of everyday lives or photos on applications like YouTube and Flickr. One can spend hours or even months on YouTube watching people brush their teeth and perform innumerable other mundane routines. These then might be thought of as ‘ordinary’ archives (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0263276413476542">Osborne, 1999</xref>): spaces in which we find rich data about people categorized through tags and linked together by, as we used to call it, hypertext. In short, the accumulation of data afforded by prosumption practices with an elective affinity to Bauman’s ‘confessional society’ have facilitated the accumulation of these vast archives containing information about people’s lives. But what do these archives capture and what can analysts do with this data? To give some indication of these everyday archives and what it is that they can possibly capture and reveal, consider the visualization created by David McCandless and Lee Byron in 2008<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0263276413476542">2</xref></sup> that shows the aggregate pattern of relationship ‘break-ups’ during an annual cycle based upon changes in ‘status updates’ on Facebook. This reveals both the level of detail about something as private as relationship breakdowns, the public visibility of this and also the possibilities that arise for using such data in creative and insightful ways. We get a real sense here of the ebbs and flows of relationship change, something that is not straightforward to study using traditional social science methods but which in a confessional society is made publicly available and visible.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec5-0263276413476542"><title>Viewpoint or opinion archives</title>
<p>The next type of archive generated and developed by movements in popular culture is the <italic>opinion</italic> or <italic>viewpoint archive</italic>. These types of archives can be thought of as being created through the practices of blogging, micro-blogging (e.g. Twitter) and the contributions made to a broad range of Web 2.0 type websites. We might also include here the rating and reviewing practices that popular commercial sites routinely incorporate in order to provide people with the opportunity to express their views about certain products and services such as those dedicated to giving people a voice about holidays, restaurants, and the smoothness of transactions and exchanges of goods, books and so on. These sites provide numerous opportunities to postulate on any range of matters for public dissemination. They enable individuals to respond to the day’s events, to react to articles or other opinions, to comment on football transfers or sporting incidents and so on. Prime examples of such archives are those relating to celebrity gossip (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0263276413476542">Beer and Penfold-Mounce, 2009</xref>). Contemporary popular culture is densely populated with images and narratives about celebrities and their lives. Beyond the traditional print media and TV, in recent years there has emerged an additional layer of commentary on celebrity life provided by, to turn again to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0263276413476542">Turner’s (2010)</xref> phrase, ‘ordinary people’. The stories and images of celebrities and their lifestyles are now available through blogs and other user-generated sources through which views can be communicated; the ‘new melodramatic imagination’ is exercised in content about the physical attributes of celebrities, their lifestyle choices, the morality of their behaviour, their intimate relationships, how inspirational or aspirational they might be and so on (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0263276413476542">Beer and Penfold-Mounce, 2009</xref>). There are in fact now innumerable sites dedicated to celebrity gossip which contain vast and revealing insights into the sentiments and opinions of those consuming these stories and images. To take one example, the celebrity gossip blog of Perez Hilton provides detailed daily updates on what is happening in celebrity culture. Each entry, organized by date and by the individual under scrutiny, is accompanied by dozens of views and comments from the readers upon each individual story. This is just one instance of the widespread practices of commenting and providing opinion that are a motif of participatory cultures. Indeed, many platforms now invite comment as a part of their infrastructure.</p>

<sec id="sec6-0263276413476542"><title>Crowdsourcing archives</title>
<p>A final related type of archive might be thought of as the <italic>crowdsourcing archive</italic>. These are products of often huge communal prosumptive effort on the part of participants. There are thousands of examples, but the most well known is Wikipedia. These archives do not just accumulate data in the form of text, but within each of the wiki entries there is metadata that people tag the entries with, allowing users to track interactions, edits, additions and disagreements that underpin the entries – the data has also been extracted to create maps and other visualizations of the content. In line with this development, Appadurai has noted the ‘capability of interactive users to more easily enter and edit the archive’, and, following this, a tendency ‘for the archive itself to be expanded by the nature and distribution of its users’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0263276413476542">Appadurai, 2003</xref>: 17). The performance of producing these archives as well as consuming their content is creating new forms of data about social interactions, memory and the nature and tensions of contested knowledge. The media theorist Mark <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0263276413476542">Hansen (2010: 180)</xref> suggests that developments in participatory media such as wikis demonstrate the social and collective dimensions of what he refers to as ‘transcendental technicity’, as the technical capacity of these platforms transcend the limits of social networks.</p>
<p>To summarize our initial discussion of data accumulation and digital archiving in popular culture we have created a table that attempts to show what we take to be the patterns of association between them (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0263276413476542">Table 1</xref>). Here we use the initial framework of component features – profiles, linkages, metadata and play – in order to show how these different types of archives – transactional, everyday, viewpoint and crowdsourcing – might be differentiated. This table provides a schematic overview of these archives and gives a general sense of how we might go about drawing lines between their form and content. The above cursory discussion, which of course imposes some illusory order upon a quite chaotic cultural constellation, might lead us to wonder what happens to the data as it accumulates through routine engagements with popular culture. Is this accumulation the end of the road? What happens to the data after it has been produced? The data harvesting practices of the commercial world are crucial and are still generally hidden from the gaze of the social researcher, placed as they are within <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0263276413476542">Thrift’s (2005)</xref> ‘technological unconscious’. We wonder, though, what else happens to the data other than it being used to extract value out of personal details. It is by asking such questions that we can begin to decipher some of the ways in which data feeds back into popular culture and thus begins to have a constitutive shaping effect; it is here that we might see in a more concrete way the enactment of the social through data in the context of everyday life and thus an elaboration of the emergent ‘cultures of circulation’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0263276413476542">Mackenzie, 2005</xref>). The point then might be to push this agenda by focusing upon the recursivity of this new data in popular culture. The recombinant relations between popular culture and the new social data are now becoming central to mundane cultural engagements, and as yet we have not really engaged with understanding these crucial shifts in culture.

<sec id="sec7-0263276413476542"><title>Recursive Data in Contemporary Culture</title>
<p>Some prominent social theory, such as the work of Scott <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0263276413476542">Lash (2007)</xref>, has suggested that information and data do not just capture but now actually constitute everyday life. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0263276413476542">Hansen (2010: 181)</xref> puts it, ‘media today mediates the conditions of mediation’. The notion here is that data is recombinant and recursive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0263276413476542">Uprichard et al., 2009</xref>), it shapes as well as merely captures culture. We have seen this idea being elaborated upon by human geographers, perhaps most notably in the accounts of prediction in service provision, monitoring, and management of cities and borders in the illuminating work of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0263276413476542">Amoore (2009)</xref> and more generally by Graham (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0263276413476542">2005</xref>; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0263276413476542">Crang and Graham, 2007</xref>). We have seen so far how popular culture contributes toward data accumulation, but what happens to this data and how does it come to constitute everyday life? Some of these feedback loops will be hidden in what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0263276413476542">Thrift (2005)</xref> describes as the ‘technological unconscious’. It might not be possible, for example, to understand exactly how one’s listening practices feed into the production of large-scale national geodemographic systems that in turn provide a postcode-level analysis of people’s tastes and preferences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0263276413476542">Burrows and Gane, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0263276413476542">Uprichard et al., 2009</xref>). We can, though, open up some of the more visible and direct feedback loops within which such data have come to co-construct popular culture and a range of everyday practices.</p>
<p>Perhaps the most visible feedback of data accumulated through engagements with popular culture comes in the form of comments upon comments or even comments upon pictures, posts, videos, music and other content – these we have shown are definitive properties of viewpoint and crowdsourcing archives in particular. This is a kind of direct feedback and layering of data upon data made possible by individual participation. This is a quite obvious form of data generating data, and even data generating metadata as individuals reflect upon or tag and organize existing content. Indeed, tagging content with organizational metadata can be understood as play in itself; there is certainly a highly visible <italic>classificatory imagination</italic> at work in contemporary popular culture. We know little about how or why people engage in this – and yet, as we have already outlined, such practices are at the centre of the emergence of the new forms of archive we have identified. It is also possible that the now frequent use by journalists and amateur bloggers of celebrities’ and famous persons’ Twitter feeds as the source for stories and insights into other stories have come to shape older and more established media content. The use of social media content to inform the official news media’s reporting of the recent (summer 2011) social unrest in London is one such example. There are of course wide-scale changes in journalism that are related to the issues discussed here, not least where live data about the favourite news stories of the moment might shape cultural production and what it is that gets reported on from day to day. The image of the live feed of most read stories present in the newsroom is pertinent here (for a discussion of the technological transformation of journalism see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0263276413476542">Weiss and Domingo, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>A little less direct but equally visible is one of the most commented upon ways in which data about popular culture feeds back into popular culture, the now increasingly common process of automated recommendations – or, as it is sometimes referred to in the popular press, ‘behavioural advertising’. We have already spoken about the transactional data accumulated through the purchases made, a process central to transactional archives, as we have described them. This clearly feeds directly in to the predictive analytics of contemporary capitalism in the form of the personalized recommendations that we frequently receive that point us toward possible future purchases. To use the most obvious example, Amazon clearly uses information about our purchases, our transactional profile, to then predict other cultural products we might also wish to purchase. This is the archetypal vision of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0263276413476542">Thrift’s (2005)</xref> ‘knowing capitalism’ and shows how data flows back into transactional archives. The predictive capacities come to shape the purchasing options we encounter and thus are likely to become embodied in transactional decisions, which in turn are then recorded again as the by-product data is stored in the archive and harvested repeatedly to inform further predictive recommendations.</p>
<p>This type of predictive process is more deeply embedded, though, in music consumption, particularly where music is consumed in a virtual format. In these instances profiles are built up about listening practices, and in some instances by the songs that we select that we ‘like’. A good example here is the online music source Last.fm, a widely used web resource for legal music consumption. It operates a little like a personalized radio station in that it identifies music based upon the things you have previously listened to and the songs that you have a preference for. This is a predictive music service that uses the aggregate-level data gathered to make inferences on a case-level basis. Transactions, as we might call them, are not then a linear process, rather they are a product of recursive data flows shaping encounters and consumer choices (even where the recommendations are ignored or overlooked). The transactional archive is a site of circulation of cultural information instantiated in performative consumer activity. The result is that the information about listening practices feeds back into this resource and shapes the type of music that listeners then encounter. The recursive feedback of data in popular culture then has a constitutive affect on people’s life-worlds in the form of recommendations and also in the form of music that these automated systems play back to the user. Last.fm is one example, and, because of its market presence, we can also point toward Apple’s iTunes to give some indication of how embedded these constitutive powers might be. The software package iTunes has a built-in optional facility, known as Genius; this operates in a similar way to Last.fm, using actual listening practices to intuit music tastes and to use this to make linkages to music that fit this profile. In this instance we can imagine that the level of data harvested through iTunes is of a scale that such analytic practices are highly refined, if not always accurate. This, then, is before we even start to contemplate the predictive capacities of the rapidly expanding free and legal music streaming sites like Spotify, through which profiles are again built about individual practices creating both aggregate-level and case-based data that may feed back into popular culture (as well as metadata-level tags and tag clouds revealing clusterings of tastes and preferences). In addition to this we have yet to fully appreciate the biggest archive of people, Facebook, and how targeted advertising informed by ‘prosumer’ content is being developed and utilized (there have been ongoing stories of targeted advertising emerging over the last two or three years as Facebook content is being used to associate people with products).</p>
<p>What we have in the case of recommendations and predictions of taste and the linkages that this creates is a very grounded example of what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0263276413476542">Lash (2007)</xref> has referred to as ‘power through the algorithm’. Lash has attempted to conceptualize this context within which data ‘find us’, where algorithms have a constitutive power and act to shape everyday experiences, cultural encounters and other aspects of our life-worlds (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0263276413476542">Amoore, 2009</xref>; the importance of ‘feedback’ in information systems has been highlighted elsewhere by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0263276413476542">Clarke, 2010</xref>: 168). Lash’s argument is that we now need to expand our concept of power to grasp ‘algorithmic’ or ‘generative’ rules which are:<disp-quote>
<p>virtuals that generate a whole variety of actuals. They are compressed and hidden and we do not encounter them in the way that we encounter constitutive and regulative rules. Yet this third type of generative rule is more and more pervasive in our social and cultural life of the post-hegemonic order. They do not merely open up opportunity for invention, however. They are also pathways through which capitalist <italic>power</italic> works. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0263276413476542">Lash, 2007</xref>: 71)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>We might be a little cautious about Lash’s terminology, but in this instance it becomes clear that popular culture is constituted by data about popular culture, whatever the potentials for resistance and apathy. In short, there is some suggestion in the examples discussed here that algorithms are taking on some constitutive power as they begin to shape listening and other consumption practices within popular culture – as they enable raw data to be converted into predictive linkages.</p>
<p>The use of data, though, is not just about making direct linkages between individuals and forms of popular culture. We also find that data becomes a form of entertainment – ‘infotainment’ – as it becomes a resource used for play. This takes at least four forms. The first is where individuals draw upon existing sources of data and create visualizations of this data, such as ‘mashups’ of crime data with Google Maps to produce crime maps. Here this social data is appropriated into popular culture to inform and stimulate creative practices and playful visualizations for people to consume. To give an illustrative example we can look to a visualization produced by <italic>Wired</italic> magazine and Pitch Interactive.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0263276413476542">3</xref></sup> It is a visualization of the type of complaint and time of day that complaint calls were made to the 311 phone service in New York during a week in September 2010 – here data from a type of transactional archive is extracted and appropriated to create a visual image that then circulates through other forms of cultural archives as it is shared, tweeted and re-tweeted, posted to blogs and so on. The horizontal axis is time of day and the vertical width of the segments indicates the volume of that type of complaint, such as graffiti, streetlights, illegal parking and the like.</p>
<p>This gives a clear indication of the types of social problems and nuisances that are occurring in a particular place; it is interesting that the data is gathered in a way that makes it readily available for temporal and geographical analysis. Notable, in this instance, is the continual and dominant presence of noise as a social agitator. This presence of noise, the large portion in the centre, continues throughout the day but ‘balloons’ through the evening into the early hours of the morning. This is an unequivocal illustration of the importance of developing understandings of noise as a social nuisance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0263276413476542">Atkinson, 2007</xref>) that comes from a single and simple visualization that is circulating on blogs and the like as a form of entertainment. We will not explore this kind of ‘vernacular sociology’ in detail here as it has been described in detail elsewhere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0263276413476542">Hardey and Burrows, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0263276413476542">Ruppert and Savage, 2012</xref>); it also distracts us a little from the central focus of the article – but this example is useful in showing how data is being used in culture and how data can have a social life across different types of archive as it is injected with vitality from the playfulness of those appropriating it. What is clear, however, is that there is at work both a ‘visualization of culture’ and a ‘culture of visualization’; this can be seen from even a cursory search of any cultural sphere – there are not many things that have yet to be visualized and archived.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0263276413476542">4</xref></sup></p>
<p>A second form of data play in popular culture, which is more directly about the by-product of popular culture feeding back into popular culture itself, is where the data generated by popular cultural engagements are used to generate social insights of various types. Here the routine contributions and accumulated archived data of popular culture are used to see (and even create) ‘social facts’. In this instance social research can be thought of as becoming a form of popular cultural entertainment that draws upon the data accumulated in popular culture. A wonderful example from outside of the academy is provided by wefeelfine.org, a ‘fun’ web resource created by the computer scientists Jonathan Harris and Sep Kamvar that scours the internet every 10 minutes and captures where the phrases ‘I feel’ or ‘I am feeling’ are being used. It captures details about the person who posted the comment and the other words in the sentence attached to ‘I feel’ or ‘I am feeling’. These then feed into real-time visualizations of this data about emotions linked to a range of social categorizations that the visitor can play with to create real-time insights (including gender, age and location). As they put it in their mission statement:<disp-quote>
<p>Every few minutes, the system searches the world’s newly posted blog entries for occurrences of the phrases ‘I feel’ and ‘I am feeling’. When it finds such a phrase, it records the full sentence, up to the period, and identifies the ‘feeling’ expressed in that sentence (e.g. sad, happy, depressed, etc.). Because blogs are structured in largely standard ways, the age, gender, and geographical location of the author can often be extracted and saved along with the sentence, as can the local weather conditions at the time the sentence was written. All of this information is saved. The result is a database of several million human feelings, increasing by 15,000–20,000 new feelings per day. Using a series of playful interfaces, the feelings can be searched and sorted across a number of demographic slices.</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>This instance is an example of where the various new types of data generated through routine engagements with popular culture are then used to create new forms of popular culture in the shape of visualizations that are created by the individuals who run the site but which can also be manipulated by visitors to the site. Again, the possibilities of the accumulated archives of data about everyday life become apparent, with the data accumulating in particular in what we have called everyday archives being used to produce insights which then are drawn together to form a new archive of emotions, a subset perhaps of the everyday archive. We might think of an application like wefeelfine.org as being a kind of portal onto everyday archives, a device that allows us to see patterns among the chaos of data flows, that brings the data to life from among the mess and density so that it can be observed in an intelligible way on a more aggregate level. Most of the mobile visualizations from wefeelfine.org would not work well on the printed page so we would recommend a visit to the site to create some up-to-date visuals of the expression of various emotions in real time.</p>
<p>A third way in which data is played with in popular culture is to generate insights into popular culture itself. Here the mashups are not created with any particular social insight in mind but instead aim to visualize popular culture or to make some aspect of it more visible. We have already discussed the way in which the music application Last.fm builds an individual-profile-based transactional archive as users consume music. There are examples of how this data can be used to create visualizations of music taste.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0263276413476542">5</xref></sup> This visualization shows how transactional archives can be used to extract information about tastes and preferences. The data’s social life is extended as the visualization is passed around again, moving across archive types, as the method and tool are used by people to play with their own data and as <italic>cultural capital goes metric</italic> within and through cultural evaluations and positionings.</p>
<p>This visualization indicates the type of music that these categories of people are listening to and have a preference for. Other similar visualizations take advantage of the ground-up classificatory systems of tagging popular in these participatory archives in order to make visible the classificatory imagination operating as the users actually classify and self-organize the materials in the archive. It also records the type of genre metadata that users actually attach to music. This then could be viewed as a rather nuanced way of carrying out Bourdieusian musical field analyses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0263276413476542">Bennett et al., 2009</xref>: 75–93); here we have data that reveals what people <italic>actually listen to</italic> and the categories they <italic>actually attach to</italic> the music. The words in the visualization are the names of bands and artists, the larger the names the more frequently they have been consumed. This is a clear example of how information generated as a by-product of popular culture has fed back into popular culture and popular cultural analysis for entertainment. In this instance the visualization was created by blogger and Last.fm intern Joachim Van Herwegen. This is illustrative of how these applications encourage people to use the data they create; Last.fm actually has a facility for such visualizations to be created and shown. In fact many of these popular cultural web resources contain some form of blog containing vernacular analysis of the data which we can think of as being viewpoint archives based upon the data extracted from popular culture itself. Similarly, there are often applications that allow users to visualize their own data; Last.fm’s ‘playground’ is a good example of this.</p>
<p>A fourth way in which data can constitute popular culture – sitting between the types of recommendations generated by data harvesting and the insights created by mashups – is via popular culture data aggregators. These provide people with a real-time indication of what is ‘hot’ in popular culture based upon the discussion or the consumption of popular cultural forms. Often data aggregators – some of which are free, others of which are more commercially oriented – are used to follow responses to brands and the like. They draw together data from across the different types of archives outlined earlier in this article and are able to pull different forms of materials together to provide overviews of buzz and trends as they emerge – a technology of ‘pattern recognition’ for those familiar with the more recent novels of William Gibson. In this context it is not necessary to wait for the <italic>NME</italic> (<italic>New Musical Express</italic>) to be published on a Tuesday or for <italic>Top of the Pops</italic> to air on Thursday, or for radio DJs to get word. These aggregators provide instantaneous insights into trends in tastes and preferences in popular culture. This is the ultimate trackability and speed-up of popular cultural movements. To choose one example to explain these popular culture data aggregators we can focus for a moment upon <italic>Hype Machine</italic>; this is a data aggregator that follows music blog discussions. The site explains: ‘Song listings that appear on this website are automatically gathered from music blogs all over the internet. We do this to let people discover new artists, fall in love, buy their CDs and go to their shows.’ This then is undoubtedly an attempt to use data to shape culture and cultural practice. The explanation of the benefits of this service is that it enables the visitor to Hype Machine to see the songs that ‘people are falling in love with right now’ through a live feed of blog entries about music, or alternatively, if this is too rapid and you need a more cumulative and considered account on which to base your judgments, you can see the music that bloggers talked about last year. Illustrating the intersectionality and connections of the data assemblage in popular culture, Hype Machine can also be linked to individual Twitter and Last.fm accounts in order to make it follow the profile of the music one listens to. The importance again of profiles about individuals is illustrative here in these case-based analytics.</p>
<p>Elsewhere the data aggregator klout.com provides individual scores that indicate the impact that people or entities have across Twitter and Facebook; essentially archives of the everyday and viewpoint archives become data sources for the measurement and reporting of cultural influence. Any name can be searched to locate a Klout score from 1 to 100. Klout, we are told, uses 35 variables to measure influence based upon audience size, responses to actions and how influential one’s audience is. All of which can be used to get a sense of the broader cultural trends and movements around individuals or topics – these Klout scores are taken in real time or can be used historically; we can see for instance that Barack Obama and Justin Bieber (the teen ‘popstar’) were the most influential people of 2010 and that social media and Iran were the top two topics. What these aggregators allow is for trends and shifts in popular culture consumption to be made visible and trackable. The data generated about popular culture can be harvested from the different types of archive to be visualized, so that it can again feed directly back into informing interested parties about popular culture – and we might also add things like the iTunes charts and similar real-time indicators of cultural consumption. This is a much accelerated and in some ways entirely new set of organizations and relations in popular culture about which we so far have little understanding. Nor, we could add, do we have a clear sense of the socio-technological infrastructures and archives that organize and underpin it, the way the data is played with or algorithmically sorted, and how this shapes culture; we know little of the cultural version of the ‘<italic>agencements</italic>’ to which <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0263276413476542">Ruppert (2011)</xref> refers.</p>
<p>In a slightly slower form of circulation, by-product data is also used to reflect on patterns of popularity over longer periods of time. The highly influential media organizations Google, Twitter and Facebook now all draw upon their archived data to inform annual ‘Zeitgeist’ reviews. Google uses the data about the things people search for to capture the ‘spirit’ of the year (locationally and through time, using various static and mobile visual tools). Facebook produces an annual ‘Memology’ report using data from profile-based status updates. Twitter uses the content of posted Tweets to accumulate details of the top trends of the year (using 25 billion Tweets). These separately and together draw upon the accumulated and archived data produced through routine engagements with culture, and provide the type of insight that has hitherto been out of the reach of social scientists.</p>
<p>It should be said that many of the trends for 2010 are fairly obvious, with many revealing an interest in Lady Gaga, Justin Bieber, the iPad and the oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico, but there are also some hidden dimensions that the use of these data reveals. We could list a number of insights provided by this recirculation of data generated in popular culture. Let us, though, just give the example of the phrase ‘hit me up’ as emblematic of the relatively concealed aspects of popular culture that we find here. This phrase and its abbreviation as ‘HMU’ emerged from nowhere as the top status trend on Facebook. This emergence can be followed through the data.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0263276413476542">6</xref></sup> The report reveals that the HMU acronym grew from just 20 posts a day in early 2009 to 1600 posts a day by the end of the year, then in 2010 it grew ‘aggressively’ by 75 per cent a month and reached 80,000 mentions per day by the end of 2010. The report also uses the data to reveal the varying temporal frequency of these mentions of HMU, with school holidays and weekends being the time when HMU was used to invite friends to ‘hang out’. This type of visibility enables the growth of such trends and allows their wider appropriation; it creates a scaled-up version of what used to be called ‘word-of-mouth’, and this snowballs phenomena into trends by revealing the patterns within archives of the everyday, which then get fed back as people follow the trend (or abandon it if it becomes ‘uncool’). Thus we are presented with a highly complex set of variegated cultural circulations. Indeed, we begin to see that popular culture is realized and performed through the social life of data and the infrastructural properties of various but closely aligned digital archives.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec8-0263276413476542"><title>Concluding Comments</title>
<p>We wanted to illustrate the centrality of popular culture within the crucial and pressing issues that face the social sciences. Here we have illustrated the part that popular culture plays in data accumulation, the recursivity of data in constituting everyday life, and we have begun to elaborate upon the possibilities of this for social research (for a parallel discussion of this in the area of political engagement see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0263276413476542">Ruppert and Savage, 2011</xref>). However, the article only touches the surface of what is possible, as our examples and discussion suggest we are only beginning to open up the neglected ‘migrations, translocations and twists in the technoscape’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0263276413476542">Mackenzie, 2005</xref>: 72). As we have described, data is archived in various ways, some more visible than others, and in a number of instances circulates back recursively into popular culture and into culture more generally. The outcome of this recombinant set of processes is that popular culture, and therefore the everyday experiences of myriad individuals, are being shaped and constituted by the social life of data. That is to say that this ‘performativity of circulation’, as Mackenzie helpfully puts it, is largely overlooked in work on culture but is actually coming to radically transform large sections of the cultural landscape. We need to look beyond a notion of transactional data, in its narrowest sense at least, to understand this new social data in its broadest forms; its form, content and organization. Not all of this by-product data can be thought of as being transactional, at least not in a narrow sense. We need to hone a much more nuanced understanding of these new forms of social data that includes the form of the data and how it folds back into everyday life. A more differentiated vision of the processes that underpin culture is required. We have opened up a typology here based upon what we have identified as the component features of these contemporary archives; this typology helps us to see the flow and circulation of data more clearly, but – in a context of variegated and mobile infrastructures creating a fixed set of socio-technical boundary conditions – inevitably creates problems.</p>
<p>We might reasonably conclude that routine everyday engagements with popular culture, facilitated by technological and cultural transformations, are responsible for affording the accumulation of vast by-product datasets that can be conceptualized through a notion of archives and archiving. Similarly, we might also reasonably conclude that this data has a life after its harvesting, it has a social life as it finds a new vitality through the play of individuals and through the excitement of participation, and that in some instances it feeds directly and indirectly back into the organization and relations of popular culture. These feedback loops can be knowing and active or unknowing and algorithmic. We might say that to a minimal degree this recursivity has always been there in the form of market research, reported sales figures, in music charts, in popular cultural journalism and in a number of other ways. We would respond by arguing that this has accelerated greatly and has been appended by new ways of seeing and engaging with popular culture that simply could not have existed before the conditions enabled this new type of social data to emerge and circulate. We might say that there has always been a performativity of circulation of data in popular culture but that this circulation has accelerated, the data has hyper-multiplied and the connections and linkages forged have been beyond any previous comprehension. There is also the added dimension that recombinant data forms mean that popular culture incorporates the data it creates while also then generating another set of by-product data: for example, visualizations, charts and so on which can shape understandings, actions and the like. Culture is now ‘code/space’ in that it, like many dimensions of the social world, relies on code to function; it ‘occurs when software and the spatiality of everyday life become mutually constituted, that is, produced through one another’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0263276413476542">Kitchin and Dodge, 2011</xref>: 16).</p>
<p>The use of this new social data in social research needs us first to understand and account for the manner in which that data is accumulated and the way in which the data itself is integrated back into everyday practices. We know little about how the performativity of data circulation, the social life of data, feeds into the performance of subjectivity and the constitution of everyday experiences. We know little of the affect of the social life of data. Popular culture provides one area in which we might develop just such an understanding, where we might elaborate the conceptual ideas of algorithmic power and the like, and by doing so further our prospects of both providing a valuable critical commentary on the role and use of by-product data, and the bigger and more difficult problem of how we might access and use such data. Popular culture would be a productive sphere for developing a more rounded understanding of the closely allied conceptual ideas that are circulating around the constitutive power of software, affect and enactment. Overall though, and in much broader terms, it has recently been argued that social researchers no longer engage with debates about the premises that ground our epistemological formations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0263276413476542">Hart and McKinnon, 2010</xref>). We agree that this is required, but, as we have shown here, we also need to consider that we might have to seriously reflect upon and rethink our ontological assumptions about our everyday engagements with culture. The relations between popular culture and the new social life of data provide us with an important focal point for developing the dual projects of critique and social analysis.</p>
