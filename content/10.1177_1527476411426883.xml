<p>Politics can be seen as a game in which the attainment and retention of power is the goal, or as a civic forum in which issues and policy proposals are debated and discussed on their merits. While political communication will always entail a balance between competitive and civic interests, it currently shows signs of radical imbalance: politics seems to have been absorbed into a sordid entanglement between governing and mediating elites; citizens seem to have been squeezed out of the political sphere.</p>
<p>There was a time when political leaders were largely in control of their own images. Journalists reported in tones of respectful deference on politicians’ speeches, meetings, and campaigns. This relationship was motivated more by fear than veneration; journalists knew that the political elite had the power to exclude them from events that mattered, undermine media funding, and stigmatize the unacceptably critical. Then the tables turned. As television became the dominant public arena and the press became adept at aggressive framing and populist agenda setting, politicians increasingly found themselves at the mercy of journalists who acted as if they could make or break them. Politicians had to learn fast how to appease the media beasts, sometimes by hiring them to advise on how best to keep on their right side. As both journalists and politicians fought it out to be seen as the most muscular in their bellicose assertiveness, a culture characterized by Machiavellian maneuvers and barely concealed threats of attack and retaliation emerged. Like most cultural pathologies, it came to feel very natural—as if there could be no other way to speak the language of politics.</p>
<p>Anyone who has spent time with politicians or political journalists in recent years will know what this menacing, cut-throat culture feels like. Its depiction in the BBC television series, <italic>The Thick Of It</italic>, is chillingly funny, but when the sordid reality of the politician–media relationship exceeds its satirical caricature, it is time to worry about the prospects for political democracy. To be sure, there are many politicians who have managed to resist this cultural malaise, often at the expense of being regarded as chronically unambitious or peripheral policy wonks; and there are still some talented political journalists who have built careers on the strength of their profound historical understanding, analytical acumen, and risky investigations. But these people are against the grain of a political culture that has come to value the kind of unscrupulous bruisers who came to the surface in the Murdochgate scandal. Too many politicians have come to believe that bullying one another, their staff, and anyone seeking to make visible what they hope to conceal is the politics of the “real world.” And too many journalists have convinced themselves that attacking, exposing, humiliating, and destroying are more important than listening, summarizing, investigating, and explaining.</p>
<p>Almost imperceptibly, a corrupted journalistic culture has emerged, normalizing a repertoire of routine practices that are wholly incompatible with the norms of democracy. The two most pervasive and pernicious of these are character attacks, in which politicians are targeted through a process of sustained negative characterization, often involving Stasi-like intrusions of privacy as a means of “getting the dirt” on targets; and attempts to intimidate policy makers, who are warned that the pursuit of policies they were elected to carry out will result in media campaigns of vilification intended to make them unelectable. Newspapers in Britain have pursued each of these practices for many years—and they are by no means confined to the Murdoch stable or the tabloids, although the latter are the most egregious offenders.</p>
<p>What can be done about this? The first thing to recognize is that we are now in a very opportune moment to redress and reshape some of the worst features of journalistic culture. Murdochgate has punctured the sublime arrogance of some of the key players, who only a few months ago considered themselves to be invulnerable to any form of effective accountability. The Leveson Inquiry,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1527476411426883">1</xref></sup> if it comes anywhere close to fulfilling its broad remit, must reflect carefully on the norms that connect journalism to the public interest. And it must set out in the clearest and most expansive possible terms what a democratic society should expect from its press. The second point to be made is that no single public inquiry, code of ethics, or regulatory mechanism can repair long-term cultural malaise. The first stage in eradicating toxic practices is to define them as being socially unacceptable; the second stage is to demonstrate forcefully that those pursuing such practices will not get away with it; but the much more complicated third stage is to counter the Machiavellian ethos that has become banefully entangled in the cultural relationships of political communication. This entanglement has many layers, from the frenetic atmosphere of newsrooms, in which editors pressurize journalists to produce certain kinds of story, regardless of firm (or any) evidence; to the legal system, which allows media organizations to gamble on the prohibitive costs of libel cases; to backroom meetings in government buildings, party conferences, and private clubs in which malicious rumor and menacing threat circulate as a form of noxious currency.</p>
<p>Critics of any attempt to reform the cultural pathology that lies at the heart of the media–politics relationship will claim that it amounts to either an attempt to weaken media freedom or an unworldly ambition to take the politics out of political communication. There are three good reasons for resisting such arguments. First, however much some journalists mutter disparagingly under their breath about “media ethics,” nearly all of them claim in public to be in favor of basic standards of fairness and opposed to the tactics of the street gang. If Rebekah Brookes (former editor of the <italic>News of the World</italic>) wants to argue in public that newspapers should be allowed to conduct character assassinations of politicians who irritate them or Rupert Murdoch wants to openly defend secret meetings with British Prime Ministers in which he lays down his terms regarding media policy or European integration, let them be encouraged to do so. If not, then editors and journalists should be held to the norms that they dare not repudiate in public. Second, arguments that regulation would destroy journalistic freedom fly in the face of the experience of public-service broadcasters, who are highly regulated yet manage to produce some of the best investigative journalism, not only on the BBC but Channel 4 as well. One is not suggesting here that the press should be regulated in the same way as broadcasters, but that it is simply untrue to claim that imposing nonnegotiable standards on journalists leads to an inevitable enfeeblement of the journalistic art. Third, and most important, the case for laissez-faire ignores the effects that the current political communication culture is having on the public sphere. While the shocking evidence of phone hacking was leaking out on a daily basis, teachers in schools across the country were trying to encourage their students to become active citizens, engaged in democratic politics. The crushing effect of the former on the latter cannot be overstated; who in their right mind would want to enter a political world that is so manifestly polluted by an unconscionable ethos? I have spent nearly two decades studying public disengagement from politics and it would be hard to exaggerate the disdain that most people have for the ethical and affective repertoire of Machiavellian politics. Without radical changes to the relationship between those who govern and those who are supposed to hold them to account, the atrophy of democratic citizenship will be simply unstoppable.</p>
<p>If doing nothing is not the answer, neither is doing <italic>anything</italic>—anything that shows the elite to be responding in a populist fashion to the worst excesses of media criminality, without attending to the culture that makes them possible. While Leveson must attend to other key systemic issues, such as the concentration of media ownership, relations between media organizations and the police, data protection, and the blurred lines now existing between mainstream and citizen-generated journalism, none of these discrete policy challenges should be seen as alternatives to the task of reconnecting journalism to its civic purpose. Taking on misuses of press power from the perspective of cultural and civic regeneration calls for four lines of action.</p>
<p>First, the absurd system of press self-regulation must be replaced by truly independent scrutiny. As the Media Standards Trust (MST) has shown in its 2009 review of press self-regulation, many services in the private and public sectors have introduced new forms of regulation in recent years as a way of restoring public confidence in them. The MST report quotes Professor Onora O’Neill’s Reith Lecture in which she observed how “the print media, while deeply preoccupied with others’ untrustworthiness, have escaped demands for accountability.” Newspaper owners and editors who are opposed to greater accountability say that they must be allowed to set the terms of reference and nominate most of the members of any press regulator; that judicial compulsion to give evidence to such a regulator would sound the death knell for press freedom. But there is clearly a difference between judges telling editors what they may or may not print and judges demanding that editors <italic>answer questions</italic> about their publications’ relationship to the public interest. Any system of accountability that allows those being held to account to (1) have control over the process and (2) decide when it suits them to answer questions is bound not to work. Invisibility and optional accountability are the principal strategies of corrupted power. A robust system of independent scrutiny would have a chilling effect upon some of the more reckless disregard for standards that we have seen in recent decades.</p>
<p>Second, a new press regulator should invest significantly in journalistic training and research. There is no single skill set or qualification for becoming a journalist (and nor should there be), but there are surely some basic standards that need to be at the core of the growing field of journalism training and education. Reviewing those standards and their competing articulations; comparing them with other cultures; exploring the barriers to their realization; collecting case studies of creative practice; and preparing journalistic culture to respond to new social trends and pressures should be part of the regulator’s remit, most probably in partnership with the now well established university media research departments, whose work has been so frequently neglected by media policy makers. (It is extraordinary that not a single media scholar has been invited to be part of Lord Justice Leveson’s inquiry team).</p>
<p>Third, a press regulator must be granted a budget that is sufficient for it to be able to publicize its most important findings across the media, including paid advertisements in newspapers. At the time of Murdochgate, News International paid for a series of unctuous full-page apologies in every daily newspaper in Britain. If, some weeks earlier, the press regulator had been in a position to set out <italic>its</italic> evidence in a similar fashion, this might have helped convince people that somebody in power was speaking for the public interest, at a time when both of the main parties were in support of Murdoch’s takeover of BskyB, and most politicians were too scared to confront the wrongdoing of News International.</p>
<p>A crucially important fourth principle challenges the exclusive elitism that is at the root of the rottenness of our failing political culture. The determination of what constitutes the public interest can no longer be left to the consensus of socially detached elites. The notion that the demos cannot be trusted to set standards for democracy is quite simply unsustainable. A new press regulator needs to establish mechanisms of democratic consultation and public deliberation that can inform and articulate the norms that constitute the public interest. Neal Lawson and Andrew Simms’ proposal to set up a People’s Jury made up of 1,000 citizens drawn at random from the electorate (<italic>Guardian</italic>, 1 August 2011) is one promising way of going about this. For too long the public has been glibly and ungenerously characterized as voracious consumers of lousy journalism, driving newspapers to ever-lower depths in their insatiable hunger for vulgar amusement. This attempt to blame the public for its own misinformation fails to take account of what we know usually happens when people are given an opportunity to reflect deliberatively on the values that matter to them and the policies that should be pursued in their name. Contrary to condescending caricature, when citizens are exposed to a broad range of information and to one another’s diverse experiences, they tend to deliberate in ways that result in the rejection of the crudest policy options and the adoption of thoughtful, nuanced, well-founded positions. For the media to serve the public interest, the public themselves must be at the centre of the debate about what that entails.</p>
