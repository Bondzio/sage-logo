<abstract>
<p>A conceptual study is described into the hybridization of Stirling engine-based residential cogeneration systems with solar thermal systems. Simulation results of four hybrid system configurations applied in various locations in Canada are presented and compared to Base Case systems without solar input. Additional optimization cases are discussed. Adding solar collectors to a residential cogeneration system has a clear potential to reduce natural gas consumption and greenhouse gas emissions. The simulated cases showed a 10%–15% decrease in the consumption of natural gas, which corresponds to a greenhouse gas emission reduction of approximately 700–1200 kg/house/year (depending on configuration and location). Hybrid systems are complex and highly integrated systems. A full system optimization was therefore not possible in this study. Recommendations are given for further optimization of this type of systems.</p>

<sec id="sec1-0957650912460182" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title>
<p>The Canadian government has set ambitious targets for the year 2020 that will ask 90% of the electric power to come from non-emitting sources with associated 17% greenhouse gas (GHG) emission reduction while compared to the values in 2005. These goals can only be achieved if all sectors (power, industrial, residential/commercial, transportation, etc.) significantly reduce their reliance on fossil fuels. The residential sector in Canada is one of Canada’s main contributors to both energy use and emission generation, accountable for 16.3% of secondary energy use and 14.8% of the national GHG emissions. The huge majority (close to 80%) of its energy use and emissions are due to the need of heating the building living spaces and domestic hot water (DHW). Recently, significant initiatives have been put in place to reduce both the energy consumption and to lower the emitted GHG emissions. The existing housing stock has been extensively renovated and the new buildings are built to a high standard using new advanced materials and building practices. This has opened a window of opportunities for modern advanced high-efficient residential systems to be deployed to be able to meet both the thermal and electric loads in a more efficient and environmental sounded way. However, with the new air tighter and better-insulated housing stock, a merge among these advanced cogeneration systems and a range of renewable technologies is possible, paving the way of novel hybrid multifunctional high-efficient systems to be deployed. This article will discuss the possible hybridization of Stirling engine (SE) with solar thermal system sized to meet the space and water heating loads of a typical Canadian family house.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec2-0957650912460182" sec-type="methods"><title>Method</title>
<p>This article presents the results of a simulation study on hybrid renewable energy – fossil fuel–based systems for supplying space heating (SH) and DHW for houses. The hybrid systems enhance the emission reduction potential of a SE-based residential cogeneration system by combining it with solar collectors.</p>
<p>The hybrid systems were simulated in the whole-building simulation program TRNSYS<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0957650912460182">1</xref></sup> and annual simulations were run for various locations in Canada using standard Canadian Weather for Energy Calculation data.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0957650912460182">2</xref></sup> Performance of the hybrid systems was compared to that of a reference system without renewable energy input.</p>
<p>The study focused at maximizing the usage of solar energy for standard-size solar collector systems by varying system configuration, collector area, heat storage capacity, and hybrid system control strategy. The results of a first round of simulations of base configurations and parameter variation were subsequently used in a second round of simulations aimed at further optimizing the system. Given the complexity of the integrated hybrid systems and their control, it was only possible to perform a limited optimization of the systems.</p>
<sec id="sec3-0957650912460182"><title>Assumptions</title>
<p>When evaluating new or advanced technologies, a researcher is frequently faced with the dilemma of which performance data to use. Often estimates of the <italic>expected</italic> future performance of the technology are available. These estimates, however, generally miss performance losses due to internal power consumption, reduced performance from cyclic operation, etc. Alternatively, <italic>measured</italic> data from non-optimized prototypes or first-generation products will include these real-life efficiency losses, but will clearly fall short of accurately presenting the technology’s potential to reduce energy consumption and mitigate emissions.</p>
<p>In this study, the latter approach was used. The model inputs for the performance of the residential cogeneration system were based on measured data of the real-life performance of a <italic>non-optimized</italic> early-generation system. The results of this study are therefore not suitable for evaluating the potential of the residential cogeneration technology and should only be used for a relative comparison of different configurations of the investigated hybrid systems.</p>

<sec id="sec5-0957650912460182"><title>Base Case</title>
<p>A SE-based micro-cogeneration system forms the heart of the Base Case system (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0957650912460182">Figure 1</xref>). The SE provides heat to a 284 L DHW storage tank through an immersed heat exchanger. A second heat exchanger in the tank allows heat to be extracted for SH through a hot-water-fed air handler. The storage tank is equipped with a back-up heater (‘Boiler’ in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0957650912460182">Figure 1</xref>) to provide additional heat in case the SE is not able to keep the DHW at the desired temperature level.

<sec id="sec6-0957650912460182"><title>Hybrid renewable–microgeneration energy systems</title>
<p>Solar heat is used in four variants of a hybrid renewable–microgeneration energy system to replace fossil energy for SH and DHW production. In Cases 1 and 2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0957650912460182">Figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0957650912460182">3</xref>), solar heat is only used to heat DHW; in Cases 3 and 4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0957650912460182">Figures 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0957650912460182">5</xref>), the output of the solar collectors is used for both DHW and SH. In the latter systems, SH is provided, similarly as in the Base Case system, through an air handler fed by water heated in a heat exchanger in the DHW tank.

</fig></p>
<p>In Cases 1 and 2, the SE provides heat either directly to the air handler coil or to the DHW tank. A back-up furnace is installed for additional heat supply in case the capacity of the SE is insufficient to meet the SH demand. A Stirling system design similar to Case 1, but with no solar input or back-up DHW heating, was recently installed and tested with acceptable performance at the Canadian Centre for Housing Technology.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0957650912460182">3</xref></sup> That study showed the configuration as a cost-effective integration pathway for micro-cogeneration in a Canadian home.</p>
<p>The DHW tank in all system variants is equipped with a back-up heater (‘Boiler’ in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0957650912460182">Figures 2</xref> to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0957650912460182">5</xref>). Cases 1 and 4 feature a preheat tank aimed at enhancing the solar yield. A low-flow pump will transport hot water from the preheat tank to the DHW tank when it is hotter than the water at the bottom of the DHW tank. In Case 3, the preheat tank is ‘integrated’ in the lower part of the storage tank, eliminating the need for the circulation pump. The back-up heater (‘Boiler’) has been moved toward the middle of the tank to not influence the temperature in the lower part of the storage tank.</p>

<p>These parameters are mainly (Cool-down duration was changed from 1200 s.) based on a calibration by Davis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0957650912460182">6</xref></sup> from an experimental testing of a modern SE. The model takes the differences in cooling water temperatures into account when calculating thermal and electrical efficiencies. The SE is operated in an on/off mode and produces around 7 kW of heat.</p>

<p>The furnaces and gas-fired back-up heaters (‘Boilers’) in the storage tanks in the different cases were all modeled as on/off devices with a capacity of 29.3 kW. The furnace has a 92% efficiency (HHV, higher heating value) and the back-up heater efficiency was 85% (HHV).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec11-0957650912460182"><title>Heat storages</title>
<p>Heat storage tanks were modeled as vertical storage tanks with immersed coiled tube heat exchangers and with flow streams passing in and out of it (TRNSYS Type 534). Each storage tank was divided into 10 isothermal temperature nodes to model stratification in the tank. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0957650912460182">Figures 1</xref> to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0957650912460182">5</xref> display the specific locations of the heat exchangers and in/out streams for the storage tanks in the different cases. No heat exchangers were placed in the top node of the tank in order to always have a buffer of around 60 L of hot water available for DHW draws. Heat losses to the environment were also considered in the model.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec12-0957650912460182"><title>Balance of plant</title>
<p>The remaining system components include the air handler, its fan, and pumps for the SE, solar collector, tank recirculation, and air handler liquid. A commercially available air handler from Nu-Air<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0957650912460182">8</xref></sup> was used to calibrate the air handler model in TRNSYS (TRNSYS Type 753a). This air handler model employs a bypass fraction approach and does not attempt to control the air and water temperatures. However, using a bypass fraction (fraction of air unaffected by the coil) of 0.215, the model correctly forecasts the performance of the Nu-Air EN500 unit. Power consumed by the SE and air handler pumps is 100 W each; tank recirculation and solar pumps consume 50 W each. Flow rates for the SE and air handler pumps are set at 957.6 and 907.2 kg/h, respectively. The solar and tank recirculation pumps have a flow rate of 70 kg/h for systems with two solar collector panels and the flow rate is scaled linearly for cases with more panels. For Cases 1 and 2, the SE pump also governs the air handler water loop.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec13-0957650912460182"><title>Control strategies</title>
<p>Maximizing cycle time of the SE benefits system efficiency by reducing the duty cycle losses. To achieve this, two separate temperature nodes in the DHW tank are used to control when the SE and auxiliary back-up heaters are turned on and off. The SE is activated when the temperature in the upper half of the tank is too low. The SE will continue to run until the temperature setpoint in the lower half of the tank is satisfied. The auxiliary heater is controlled using the same temperature nodes so that its operation can be anticipated relative to SE operation times and its use minimized.</p>
<p>When the air handler coil loops through the DHW tank directly, the SE turns on at a higher setpoint than when the air handler is heated from the SE. This keeps the section of the DHW tank in which the heat exchanger for the air handler is placed at a temperature high enough to meet the SH load (Preliminary studies showed that turning the SE on when T<sub>3</sub> ≤ 50 °C resulted in the main floor air temperatures falling unacceptably below the room setting during the coldest days of the year.). For Cases 1 and 2, the storage tank only serves the DHW load. In this case, only the top section of the tank needs a high temperature, and a somewhat lower temperature in lower parts of the tank is acceptable. Besides, when the SE supplies heat to the air handler for SH, somewhat lower water temperatures can be tolerated, because the back-up furnace can provide additional heat for SH.</p>

<sec id="sec14-0957650912460182"><title>House model</title>
<p>The house model used in this study is based upon the twin research houses of the CCHT in Ottawa.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0957650912460182">9</xref></sup> The model was first calibrated against the measured SH demand of one of the houses. Subsequently, the insulation thickness and air tightness in the model were decreased to the level at which the model would represent a house situated in Ottawa with a heat load equal to the SH demand of the average Canadian single detached house (77 GJ/year).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0957650912460182">10</xref></sup></p>
<p>The house model takes internal gains from non-HVAC (heating, ventilation, and air conditioning) electricity into account. Thermal losses from HVAC equipment were not included as additional source of heat (except fan power).</p>
<p>A daily schedule was applied of six DHW draws (ranging from 5 to 70 L), totalling 200 L of hot water from the top of the tank per day.</p>

<sec id="sec15-0957650912460182"><title>Basis for results comparison</title>
<p>In this study, the basis for comparing hybrid systems to the reference system is the potential to reduce natural gas (NG) consumption and associated GHG emissions. However, the systems investigated in this study not only use NG, but also produce and consume electricity. The net electricity consumed is considered as being supplied by a 51% (HHV) efficient NG fired combined cycle power plant. An 8% loss for transmission and distribution of grid electricity was taken into account. This assumption permits differences in the net electricity consumption to be attributed to NG consumption.</p>
<p>NG for heating and power production was assumed to have 3 emission intensity of 59.4 kgCO<sub>2</sub> eq/GJ.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0957650912460182">11</xref></sup> This value contains combustion emissions as well as upstream fuel cycle emissions for bringing the fuel from its source to its point of use.</p>

<sec id="sec17-0957650912460182"><title>Base Case system</title>
<p>The Base Case system has been simulated for four cities in Canada: Vancouver, Calgary, Ottawa, and Halifax. These cities represent different geographical areas and climates (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0957650912460182">Table 3</xref>), which results in a range of SH loads. The operational characteristics of the Base Case system are very similar for all locations. The SE supplies close to 90% of the total heat demand for SH and DHW, with the back-up heater providing the remainder. Electrical efficiency is highest when the heat demand is highest because the average cycle time is longer, reducing duty cycle losses in start-up and shut-down. Storage tank losses amount to around 2% of the heat output of the system.</p>

</sec>
<sec id="sec18-0957650912460182"><title>Cases 1 and 2</title>
<p>Cases 1 and 2 use solar heat for DHW production. A series configuration of two solar collector panels with a total surface area of 5.748 m<sup>2</sup> produces 7% and 10% of the total annual heat demand for Ottawa Cases 1 and 2, respectively. The solar heat primarily replaces the output of the back-up heater. Both systems benefit from the higher SE thermal efficiency, which is due to lower cooling water temperatures experienced when heat is supplied directly to the air handler. For Ottawa, the reductions in NG consumption and GHG emissions compared with the Base Case were 9.9% for Case 1 and 12.2% for Case 2. This was despite having lower SE net electrical output, higher HVAC electricity consumption, and higher tank heat losses than the Base Case. This clearly indicates that the design configurations are more energy efficient than the Base Case.</p>
<p>Additional simulations have been performed for Case 2 applied in Vancouver, Calgary and Halifax. Their performance is comparable to that for Ottawa.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec19-0957650912460182"><title>Cases 3 and 4</title>
<p>Solar heat is used in Cases 3 and 4 for both SH and DHW. The systems are equipped with four solar collector panels in series (11.496 m<sup>2</sup> total area), which together collect approximately 50% more heat from the sun than the two panels in Case 2. The solar heat replaces output from both the SE and the back-up heater and, when applied in Ottawa, it provides close to 15% of the required heat. Both cases have larger storage tanks and associated higher heat losses. The pump(s) in the solar system result in an increased HVAC power consumption. The reduction in NG consumption and GHG emissions is 11.2% for Case 3 and 10.4% for Case 4. This is slightly lower than for Case 2. The performance of Case 2, however, reflects the benefit of both the addition of solar heat and a significantly higher SE thermal efficiency compared to the Base Case. The SE thermal efficiency for Cases 3 and 4 is at the same level as for the Base Case.</p>
<p>Cases 3 and 4 do not differ much in performance. Case 4 has a slightly higher solar yield, but also higher heat losses. Case 3 was selected for further evaluation due to its superior performance and simpler configuration.</p>
<p>Case 3 was evaluated for Vancouver, Calgary, and Halifax. As for Case 2, the operation and performance of the hybrid systems are very similar over the range of heating conditions for these cities. The lower heating load for Vancouver results in a slightly higher relative reduction potential.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec20-0957650912460182"><title>Parameter variation cases</title>
<p>Parameter variation cases were run to investigate the effect of doubling the solar collector area, doubling the volume of the heat storage tanks, and removing the low-flow pump between the two heat storages.</p>
<p>Doubling the area of the solar panels for the hybrid systems results in a 49% increase in solar yield for Case 2 (four panels in series instead of two) and a 28% more solar heat collected for Case 3 (now eight panels – two parallel strings of four in panels in series). Adding solar collector panels clearly increased the solar yield, but with a fast decreasing marginal improvement. The additional solar heat captured mainly replaces the thermal output from the SE. The reduction in NG consumption and GHG emission increases to 13.5% for Case 2 and 13.7% for Case 3, respectively.</p>
<p>When simulating larger tank volumes, in some cases, the heat exchangers were connected to different tank nodes since the same heat exchange area is available in a smaller fraction of the tank. For the Base Case with doubled tank volume, the SE heat exchanger was connected to tank nodes 8–10 and the air handler heat exchanger to nodes 3–5. For Case 2 with doubled tank volume, the solar heat exchanger nodes are unchanged in the preheat tank and the SE heat exchanger is moved to nodes 8–10. Finally, for Case 3 with doubled volume, the heat exchanger nodes are unchanged.</p>
<p>Increasing the volume of the heat storage tank for the Base Case for Ottawa cuts back-up heater usage in half in favor of increased SE operation. The Base Case with double tank volume has a 14% higher SE power production; thanks to increased use of the SE and a higher electrical efficiency due to an almost doubling of the average cycle time. This improvement, however, is totally consumed by a higher demand for NG to overcome higher heat losses from the storage tank and efficiency differences between the SE and the back-up heater. Overall, the Base Case with a double tank size has the same NG use and GHG emissions as the original Base Case.</p>
<p>Case 2 with double heat storage volumes shows a small increase in solar yield. The operation of the hybrid systems is almost identical to that of the regular Case 2 and NG consumption and emissions decrease by 0.4%.</p>
<p>Case 3 experiences similar effects as the Base Case when doubling the heat storage volume. Thanks to a 6% higher solar input, a net reduction in NG consumption and GHG emissions of 0.8% is achieved in comparison with the standard Case 3 for Ottawa.</p>
<p>Turning off the low-flow pump in Case 2 has a net effect of −0.1% in NG saving and GHG emission reduction.</p>

<sec id="sec21-0957650912460182"><title>Analysis of results</title>
<p>One of the main differences between Cases 1 and 2 and Cases 3 and 4 is the number of solar collector panels applied. Cases 1 and 2 each have two panels, while four panels are used in Cases 3 and 4. Cases 1 and 2, however, achieve similar or even better emission reduction figures than Cases 3 and 4, despite having only 50% of their solar collector area.</p>
<p>This counterintuitive result is explained, as described before, by the difference in the way heat is provided for SH. In Cases 1 and 2, the air handler is directly fed with the heated cooling water of the SE. Hot water from the storage tank is used in Cases 3 and 4 to feed the air handler. The direct coupling of the SE to the air handler in Cases 1 and 2 results in lower heat exchange temperatures for the SE and an approximate 4 percentage point higher thermal efficiency.</p>
<p>To distinguish between the effect of the improved thermal efficiency of the SE and the benefit of the solar thermal system, Cases 1 and 2 are compared in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0957650912460182">Table 4</xref> to an Alternative Base Case that also utilizes a direct supply of Stirling heat to the air handler (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0957650912460182">Figure 7</xref>).

<p>In all cases described until now, the solar collector panels were assumed to be installed at the optimum angle for <italic>total annual solar heat production</italic>. For residential applications, the demand for heat is higher in winter than in summer. A solar panel angle favoring heat capture during the winter period could therefore potentially have an increased overall performance. A number of simulations were run for Case 3 (Ottawa) with a variation of solar panel angle to investigate what the optimum angle would be (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-0957650912460182">Table 5</xref>). A slightly higher angle than the 37° used in the first round of simulations is favorable toward optimum overall efficiency. The impact, however, is limited. Most Canadian houses have roof angles in the 20° to 30° range. It is questionable whether the small increase in performance will outweigh the costs and esthetical aspects of placing the solar panels on a titled rack instead of flush with the roof.

<sec id="sec24-0957650912460182"><title>Two routes for optimization</title>
<p>With the solar panel at the optimum angle of 50°, two routes for further optimization of the performance of the system were investigated. The first route aimed at maximizing the use and performance of the SE, while also trying to capture the greatest amount of solar heat. Similar to Case 1, the heated cooling water of the SE was lead to a three-way valve, allowing it to either warm up the storage vessel or to directly provide heat to the air handler. The system was equipped with a 500 L storage tank comparable to the one used in Case 3. In this new case, however, the heat exchanger and pump in the air handler loop were eliminated, as the air handler was directly fed through the three-way valve. The back-up heater had been moved from level 10 to level 3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-0957650912460182">Figure 8</xref>). Due to its similarities to Case 1, this case was called ‘Case 1_Optimized’. The control setpoints for the ‘Case 1_Optimized’ system are given in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table6-0957650912460182">Table 6</xref>.

</table-wrap-foot>
</table-wrap></p>
<p>The results of Case 1_Optimized show an almost exclusive use of the SE in providing heat for SH and DHW, next to the heat supplied by the solar panels. With a 13.7% reduction in NG use and associated emissions, this configuration has a better performance than both the original Case 1 and Case 3 with a solar panel angle of 50° (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table7-0957650912460182">Table 7</xref>). The solar efficiency of 20.5%, however, is lower than for other simulated cases and could likely be improved by further optimization of the control settings.</p>
<p>The second route for optimization was the application of the hybrid system with a low-temperature heating (LTH) system, representing the situation in which the hybrid system would be coupled to an in-floor heating system or an advanced forced air heating system that would allow the use of significantly lower air temperatures. Using a Case 3 type configuration, the LTH system would only require moderate temperatures in most of the storage tank. This could potentially improve the SE efficiencies and enhance the uptake of solar heat, because the heat from the solar panels would better match the temperature level of the LTH system, allowing a greater fraction of it to be used directly without the need for additional heating by SE of the back-up heater. As for all other cases, the top layers of the heat storage would be at a higher temperature to supply DHW at the appropriate temperature level.</p>
<p>This ‘Case 3_LTH’ system has small variations, compared to the Case 3 configuration with the solar panels at a 50° angle. In the 500 L storage tank, the SE heat exchanger was moved down to levels 6 and 7 and the heat exchanger for the LTH system to levels 3 and 4. The solar heat exchanger was kept at levels 9 and 10 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-0957650912460182">Figure 9</xref>). The auxiliary heater was placed at level 3, serving the demand for DHW as well as assisting the SE in providing heat to the LTH, if desired. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table6-0957650912460182">Table 6</xref> presents the control setpoints for Case 3_LTH.
<fig id="fig9-0957650912460182" position="float"><label>Figure 9.</label><caption><p>Configuration of Case 3_LTH.</p>
<p>LTH: low-temperature heating.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0957650912460182-fig9.tif"/>
</fig></p>
<p>The results for Case 3_LTH clearly show the positive effect of lower heat storage temperatures on the performances of the SE and the solar panels. The thermal efficiency of the SE increased to 73.6% compared to 70.5% for Case 3 with solar panels at an angle of 50°. The heat production by the solar panels increased by 6% from 4.2 to 4.5 MWh. Case 3_LTH has the highest percentage of reduction in NG use and associated GHG emissions of all the evaluated cases: 15.0%.</p>
<p>The power production efficiency of the SE, however, did not increase. It even slightly dropped due to the impact of an overall increased internal power consumption from more frequent cool-down periods and extended standby periods. The SE experienced an approximate 10% decrease in the operating time compared to Case 3 with the solar panel angle of 50°, because it now only heats the water in the tank to a maximum of 40 °C (the back-up heater supplying the additional heat for the DHW).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec25-0957650912460182"><title>Further optimization possible</title>
<p>The results of the limited optimization round have shown that the angle at which the solar panels are installed only has a limited impact on their overall performance. Providing low heat-exchange temperatures for both the SE and the solar thermal system, however, is crucial for high efficiency of the hybrid system. Three quite different system configurations, Case 1_Optimized, Case 2, and Case 3_LTH, all achieve a similar high NG reduction percentage compared to the Base Case, indicating that it is likely that further optimization to even larger GHG emission reductions is possible.</p>

<sec id="sec26-0957650912460182" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title>
<p>In this article, a study is presented into the hybridization of residential cogeneration systems and solar thermal technology for providing SH and DHW to a residence with an average heating load. Hybrid systems displaying various configurations and parameter settings were simulated in TRNSYS and their results compared to a Base Case without solar input. The results of a first round of parameter variation cases were used in a second round of simulations aimed at improved system design and performance. From this study, the following can be concluded.
<list id="list1-0957650912460182" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>Adding solar collectors to a residential cogeneration system has a clear potential to reduce NG consumptions and GHG emissions. Simulated cases showed a reduction in annual NG consumption of 10%–15%, which corresponds to a reduction of approximately 700–1200 kgGHG/house/year (depending on configuration and location).</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Providing low heat-exchange temperatures for both the SE and the solar thermal system is crucial for high system efficiencies. It is also important to provide sufficient storage capacity for the collected solar heat.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Parameter variation cases showed an increase in the system performance with solar collector area, but with a rapid decrease in marginal improvement.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The solar panel angle has a limited impact on the overall system performance.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The hybrid renewable–fossil energy systems are complex and highly integrated systems. Their performance has shown to be influenced by a large number of interrelated parameters, such as temperature-dependent efficiencies of SE and solar collectors, heat storage tanks that integrate multiple functions, control strategies that have a much larger influence on the operation of the system than on the controlled variable alone, and varying climatologic conditions that results in completely different operating conditions for various seasons of the year. In this study, only a limited optimization effort could therefore be performed, resulting in several quite different system configurations achieving a similar high NG reduction percentage compared to the Base Case. This indicates that further optimization to even larger GHG emission reductions is likely possible.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The hybrid systems show similar operation and performance when applied in four cities across Canada with a broad range of heat demands.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The simulated performance of the residential cogeneration system was based on the measured data from a non-optimized early generation unit. The results of this study are, therefore, not suitable for evaluating the potential of this technology.</p></list-item>
</list></p>

<sec id="sec27-0957650912460182"><title>Recommendations</title>
<p>It is recommended to continue the research into optimal configuration and operation of these hybrid renewable–fossil energy systems by:
<list id="list2-0957650912460182" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>pursuing optimal system efficiency through a configuration in which the SE is directly coupled to the air handler of the SH system or alternatively to the heat storage of an LTH system, and the solar heat capture is maximized by low heat storage temperatures that match the temperature requirements of the SH system;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>improving the overall control strategy by implementing seasonably adjusted heat storage temperatures to increase solar heat capture and reduce standby losses;</p></list-item>
