<p>In this poetic piece, we seek to represent our unfolding understandings, dilemmas, and epiphanies around working within, and at times against, practices that get named school discipline, classroom management, and the day-to-day realities of “dealing” with those “troubled kids.” We focus on the ways in which disciplinary practices are often racialized, as the bodies of already targeted children are “interpreted” through a lens of pathology and criminology. The poem is presented in four sections with each section representing various voices that we have encountered in our work in public schools in a district we name the White Mountain Assimilated School District in the state of Southland.</p>

<p>In the following poetic piece, we seek to represent our unfolding understandings, dilemmas, and epiphanies around working within, and at times against, practices that get named school discipline, classroom management, and the day-to-day realities of “dealing” with those “troubled kids.” We focus in particular on the ways in which the disciplinary practices of some U.S. public schools are racialized, as the bodies of already targeted children are “interpreted” through a lens of pathology and criminology, and we work to interrogate the technical and taken-for-granted practices of working with children named by whitestream professionals as “troubled Black boys” and “deviant.” As we do so, we share what we have come to name <italic>disturbing distractions</italic>—those interactions, professional trainings, and official practices we have stood witness to that have distracted us, stopped us, troubled us, and compelled us, at times, to respond. There are four sections of the poem, each told through different voices and with their own unique cadence. The first section represents those systemic expectations for students’ behaviors. The second represents students’ voices as they question their own schooling opportunities. The third represents teachers’ conversations, both overheard and while talking to us. The fourth represents those teachers, including ourselves, who are questioning these practices. While we wrote our way to a partial knowing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1532708612440255">Richardson, 1997</xref>), we acknowledge that there is much we cannot yet see or understand. Thus, as we share, we invite the reader to challenge our interpretation, showing us those things that we have not yet understood.</p>

<title>An Afterthought</title>
<p>Through this poetic representation, we sought to name those educational practices that perpetuate oppression in specific and concrete ways; however, we recognize that ultimately, policy needs to change. The injustices that we have encountered, those injustices that are experienced daily by students, teachers, and others, are systemic and endemic. For example, narrow emphasis on accountability often drives teachers to take up a defensive posture against those who would threaten their own job security, leaving little emotional energy for students who have very real challenges themselves. Other teachers are so quickly swept away by the focus on curriculum-driven classrooms, with the intent to perform the role of “good teacher” as illustrated by singular test scores, that there is very little time to focus on the creativity that students bring to their classrooms. Furthermore, the incessant need to standardize education, including assessments, curriculum, and behavior, harms both students and teachers: Students are deprived of the opportunity to be their unique selves and teachers are deprived of the rich diversity that students bring to their classrooms.</p>
<p>In the first section of the poem, we sought to represent those systemic expectations of students and teachers by writing about the pressures of learning to behave while standing and walking in line. A particularly pervasive practice in schools, especially at the elementary and middle school levels, we frequently observed students lined up with their hands neatly tucked behind their backs so they would not touch anyone or anything and being told that they needed to pretend they had a bubble in their mouth so that they would not talk. Some argue that these lines are intended to prepare students for the prison toward which they are headed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1532708612440255">Kupchik, 2010</xref>); but those lines also represent, in subtle ways, the act of conforming, particularly to whitestream culture that so often dominates the system of schooling. Students learn the White/dominant ways of sitting in their desks, White ways of dressing, and White ways of communicating. They learn that compliance to those in control may let them stay in school, stay out of jail, and keep their job, while objecting, resisting, or fighting back may land them in in-school suspension, unemployment lines, or prison, where there are more lines, lines of conformity, lines that further dismiss their individuality. These lines are ritualized moments that disrupt students’ imaginations. And yet, those imaginations persist; students remain creative, often in spite of our attempts to suppress their individuality, as we attempted to portray in the second section of the poem.</p>
<p>Undoubtedly, these rituals of conformity are applied disproportionately to non-White students who are more likely to be subjected to zero tolerance policies and strict behavioral codes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1532708612440255">Ferguson, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1532708612440255">Rausch &amp; Skiba, 2006</xref>). Urban schools are positioned as needing strictly enforced regimens to maintain order, while schools with primarily White students are often allowed much more leniency in their enforcement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1532708612440255">Kupchik, 2010</xref>). Urban schools are often provided with scripted curricula, “drill and kill” practices that construct learning as rote, structured, and militaristic; even within suburban schools, students of color are often tracked into underperforming classrooms and given scripted curricula to follow (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1532708612440255">Ferguson, 2000</xref>). The need for structure, order, and compliance by teachers who work with Black children is often positioned as a need for safety, security, and a well-managed classroom. Section III represents comments we have heard from teachers and other adults working in schools as they seek to name, explain, and predict the lives and futures of the students they teach.</p>
<p>Occasionally, a teacher will talk back to the types of statements seen in Section III; other teachers, who find such statements to be disturbing, choose not to engage, but rather to simply go about their business of doing the subversive work of educating all their children. For us, we sought to speak back to, even if only to recognize and name, those practices that we viewed as disturbing and distracting, recognizing that there are countless teachers who are also speaking back daily through their commitment to teaching all children. Yet we also are learning in our daily work to “accept the dilemmas of committed confrontation with evils we cannot end. We can go forth to serve, knowing that our failure to act will not change conditions and may very well worsen them” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1532708612440255">Bell, 1992</xref>, p. 198).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-1532708612440255">
<title>Addendum: Coming to the Work</title>
<p>This project began with a series of emails and phone calls, mostly expressions of frustration, disappointment, and concern with what we were witnessing as we walked the halls of schools within what we have named the White Mountain Assimilated School District where we worked as supervising teachers, school consultants, and learning “specialists.” Our poetic representation is based on our email correspondence and field notes from our everyday experiences working with children and teachers, both in and out of schools, as well as our reflective journals and many conversations around the intersections of discipline and race. As we shared our experiences with one another, we reflected on those things that disturbed us most: disciplinary disproportionality; conversations with teachers, some who acquiesce to and construct the institutional practices that lead to oppression and some who do not; those moments we have observed where violence and oppression are maintained through those systemic practices that are played out too often in the interactions between students and teachers; and our own complicity as we work within an inequitable educational system.</p>
<p>We orient to this project, and indeed our work in general, from a position of racial realism, taking up critical race theory (CRT) and recognizing that any work attempting to question racialized disciplinary practices and challenge the cradle to prison pipeline will be “a story less of success than of survival through an unremitting struggle that leaves no room for giving up. We are all part of that history, and it is still unfolding” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1532708612440255">Bell, 1992</xref>, p. 200). As a teacher educator and a former middle and high school teacher of students with labels such as emotionally disturbed and learning disabled, I (the first author) only recently came to a place of racial realism. After years of failing to acknowledge the systemic injustices discussed above, I write with regret, but with a desire to not wallow in that regret. I write with White guilt and yet with a desire to move beyond White guilt to a place of action (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1532708612440255">Thompson, 2003</xref>). I write with a deeply embedded sense of hope that tomorrow we might learn from our history that we cannot continue to treat one another with disrespect, violence, and oppression. Yet I am also aware that roots of oppression run deep and in their hiddenness, they are difficult, if not impossible, to uproot.</p>
<p>As a teacher educator and consultant for K-12 schools working to include children with developmental dis/ability labels, I (the second author) write with a commitment to the children whom I have taught and who have taught me. I write, remembering the many young Black boys and girls and families who fill my afternoons and evenings, thinking often of how their bodies have already been subjected to ridicule, tracking, and Whited judgment. Informed by CRT, I do not deny the racist “reality” of the world and share Bell’s position on the permanence of racism—seeing it played out again and again in the institutionalized practices named “necessary disciplinary actions.” I draw much from the words of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1532708612440255">Bell (1992)</xref>, recognizing that my “actions are not likely to lead to transcendent change and may indeed, despite our best efforts, be of more help to the system we despise than to the victims of that system whom we are trying to help” (pp. 198-199).</p>
<p>Although we struggled with how to write about these moments, knowing that what we write and share has consequences, we were drawn to write in an experimental form—a poetic form—recognizing that poetry can function to clarify and magnify human experiences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1532708612440255">Hirshfield, 1997</xref>). We came to this decision out of a need to share the ways in which we experienced those moments, for as we recounted these events to each other, each recounting was a sensory experience filled with emotions of anger, regret, sadness, and complicity. Poetry, then, provided us with a unique language that could be accessed when “other modes of representation [would] not capture” what we hoped to convey (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1532708612440255">Faulkner, 2009</xref>, p. 17).</p>
<p>While we give particular emphasis to the intersection of discipline and race, we recognize that a multitude of systemic inequalities perpetuate and reinforce injustices in educational contexts. Furthermore, this poem is not meant to represent or characterize all teachers, students, or schools. Instead, we present some of the lessons we have learned from the places we have stood, realizing that when there is an explicit goal to pursue social justice and invite others to join in such a pursuit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1532708612440255">Hartnett, 2003</xref>), poetry might offer one way to start such a conversation—a conversation that we hope leads to action. While we work toward systemic change, we wonder often if such change is possible; yet we continue to imagine new possibilities for ways of interacting with students. Like <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1532708612440255">Bell (1992)</xref>, we recognize that</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Black people will never gain full equality in this country. Even those herculean efforts we hail as successful will produce no more than temporary “peaks of progress,” short-lived victories that slide into irrelevance as racial patterns adapt in ways that maintain white dominance. This is a hard-to-accept fact that all history verifies. We must acknowledge it, not as a sign of submission, but as an act of ultimate defiance. (p. 12)</p>
