<p>From the 1880s to the 1910s, the Los Angeles city council actively regulated street activities and fulfilled requests for street improvements. These divergent but related public interventions were significant planning precursors. The city council categorized, delineated, and regulated street activities and helped to make the rapidly changing city legible. The city had limited interest in the specific activities however. In contrast, travel became the explicit purpose of municipal action, and municipal professionals, most notably engineers, took responsibility for the streets. This article examines the relationship between the efforts in Los Angeles, California to regulate street life and the ways that the streets were created as distinct spaces of mobility.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>In the last two decades of the nineteenth century, Los Angeles’s street life exploded. The city grew rapidly and the streets became congested and chaotic as diverse people and activities daily mixed. Living in close quarters with little refrigeration, Angelenos depended on the mobile fish mongers and vegetable vendors. Pedestrians weaved through trolleys and horse-drawn carriages as well as the stationary lunch wagons, popcorn stands, and merchant displays. The streets were minimally improved, and no one yet considered them spaces for travel alone. People expected to hear the news or proselytizing and purchase shoelaces or other sundry items. In the 1870s, the New York Commissioner of Public Works remarked that such activities and more took place on streets designed to “impede rather than facilitate travel,”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1538513211428275">1</xref></sup> and this could also describe Los Angeles.</p>
<p>Urban streets became sites of many controversies and subject to both public and private interventions in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. Rich scholarship that explains street life’s meaning and function—and how and why expanding street life was accompanied by efforts to domesticate and regulate it—has come from cities as diverse as London, Melbourne, Toronto, New York, Chicago, Hartford, and Atlanta.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-1538513211428275">2</xref></sup> By the 1880s, Los Angeles public officials were also called upon to address myriad concerns that ranged from paving and grading to flower girls and hawkers. When the Los Angeles city council confronted the seemingly endless petitions about street life, the most notable aspect might be how prolifically it enacted street use ordinances and how limited the impact was. The council enacted dozens of ordinances that prohibited activities, defined people’s conduct, and required licenses and permits, but the same issues nonetheless recurred repeatedly into the 1910s.</p>
<p>In contrast, however, Los Angeles’s process for providing street improvements became streamlined and standardized. Although the adjoining property owners paid for the improvements, the requests for grading and paving were made through the Los Angeles city council. The standardized process limited the property owners’ discretion and focused on a public circulation system. Legally, the streets were also separated from the adjoining property to become spaces for mobility.</p>
<p>These two distinct interventions—the efforts to manage activities other than travel and efforts to provide streets for travel—were related. To take any municipal action, council members, petitioners, and other participants drew upon notions of public interests. To do this, they had to define the public and the priorities. The streets as transportation corridors served public purposes, notably health and movement, but travel also became a priority activity around which to negotiate other interests. In the late nineteenth century, many native Anglo-Americans were seeking order, and Anglo-Angelenos were no different.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-1538513211428275">3</xref></sup> As an institution, the municipal government had an interest in organizing urban life and adopting ordinances was one mechanism to do this. The Los Angeles city council became a space where urban residents negotiated street activities and the process formalized street uses by defining the activities’ components and subjecting them to regulation.</p>
<p>James C. Scott has argued that “certain forms of knowledge and control require a narrowing of vision. The great advantage of such tunnel vision is that it brings into sharp focus certain limited aspects of an otherwise far more complex and unwieldy reality.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-1538513211428275">4</xref></sup> The state tends to be utilitarian in what it “sees” and identifies relevant components for its purposes. Selective observation therefore makes complex situations legible. Disparate mechanisms including property and jurisdictional boundaries, maps and street names, as well as easily overlooked decisions such as house numbering enable state action by creating spatial legibility.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-1538513211428275">5</xref></sup> With its state-centric perspective, the municipal process made it possible to tax, regulate, and police.</p>
<p>Despite its involvement in countless specific issues, the local state’s interests were narrow. Regulations allowed greater municipal control and licensing brought revenue. To exercise regulatory and police powers, however, street life had to be legible and this was the most significant outcome of the regulatory process. Through both the debates in the Los Angeles city council over street activities and the sidewalk provision, as Anastasia Loukaitou-Sideris and I have found, unimpeded travel became a distinct activity and the sidewalk’s primary purpose. The pedestrian became the public for which the sidewalks were planned.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-1538513211428275">6</xref></sup> To create both streets and sidewalks as spaces of travel, they had to be considered separate from the abutting properties and a space over which the municipality assumed responsibility. This laid the groundwork for transportation to become a core function for municipal planners.</p>
<p>In this article, I first examine how the regulation of street activities helped to make street life understandable for municipal purposes. The article then explains how the streets were conceptually separated from the abutting properties and shifted to municipal control. It concludes with a brief discussion about the late twentieth-century preoccupation with street life and renewed municipal regulation.</p>

<title>Making Street Life Legible</title>
<p>In the fifty years from California’s statehood in 1850 to the century’s end, Los Angeles was transformed from an agricultural village of 1,610 people to city of over 100,000. Its dirt roads were graded and graveled and sidewalks were laid. Increasing numbers of people filled the streets. The middle-class, native-born residents, the largest incoming group to Los Angeles, drew on notions of domesticity and separate spheres when envisioning a good life,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-1538513211428275">7</xref></sup> and the street’s mix stood in stark opposition.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-1538513211428275">8</xref></sup> The city followed the path of Eastern cities such as New York, where in the 1860s and 1870s street life was one of the three major areas—alongside building codes and public health interventions—subject to municipal environmental regulations.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-1538513211428275">9</xref></sup> The efforts to discipline or domesticate the street were steeped with class-based ideology and constructed in response ethnic and working-class traditions. Nevertheless, although Los Angeles business leaders and city boosters were active participants in the controversies over street activities, municipal actions were more varied and the municipal interests narrower than that would suggest. The incremental process instead was characterized by recurrent negotiations as different parties made claims and demanded action.</p>
<sec id="section3-1538513211428275">
<title>The Unruly Metropolis</title>
<p>Los Angeles experienced disorienting growth in the nineteenth-century’s final decades. The city’s modest 1880 population of 11,183 residents had quadrupled by 1890, doubled again by 1900, tripled in the 1900s, and again doubled in the following decade. Between 1890 and 1930, the city grew from approximately 50,000 to 1.2 million residents. By 1930, the county had 2.2 million people, and Los Angeles had become the largest urban area on the west coast.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-1538513211428275">10</xref></sup></p>
<p>The population growth outpaced the developed area and the central neighborhoods and streets became increasingly crowded. Most people walked from place to place, but some traveled by carriage and a few tracks for horse-operated street railways or horse cars had been laid. Although prior to 1885, the demand for rapid transportation was minimal, a few electric rail lines were built (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1538513211428275">Figure 1</xref>). Only a decade later, however, a dozen trolley lines entered the city’s central business district (CBD)<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-1538513211428275">11</xref></sup> and opened surrounding areas to residential settlement.</p>

</fig>
<p>Los Angeles had a higher percentage of native-born residents than other cities. In 1890, almost three quarters of the city was native born, mostly middle-class Anglos.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-1538513211428275">12</xref></sup> The orderly neighborhoods and detached residences they sought were increasingly found along the trolley lines. When they moved outside the central core, they created Los Angeles’s characteristic residential dispersal. By 1920s, auto travel accompanied the outward expansion. Although fewer than 20,000 cars were registered in Los Angeles County in 1910, the number had exceeded 100,000 by 1920 and increased eightfold in the next decade.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn14-1538513211428275">13</xref></sup> Nevertheless, Los Angeles’s “unprecedented business decentralization … was barely evident as late as 1920,” and as a result, the downtown district dominated employment and retail. A 1924 traffic study found that 1.2 million people—more than the population of the city—traveled into and out of downtown daily.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn15-1538513211428275">14</xref></sup></p>
<p>Street crowding alone does not explain the myriad ordinances the city enacted. The central neighborhoods were diverse and ethnically mixed.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn16-1538513211428275">15</xref></sup> African Americans increased from 1,250 in 1890 to 39,000 by 1930. In 1890, a quarter of the city’s population was foreign born, a percentage that remained relatively stable in the subsequent decades.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn17-1538513211428275">16</xref></sup> In 1890, the Chinese population reached 3.7 percent of the city’s total.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn18-1538513211428275">17</xref></sup> Italians and Mexican railroad workers also settled in Los Angeles along with Germans, Scots, Greeks, Jews, Japanese, and French newcomers.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn19-1538513211428275">18</xref></sup></p>
<p>Before 1877, the historian William J. Novak has argued that urbanites and town dwellers developed a common governance structure that he refers to as “the well-regulated society.” They adopted and enforced regulations to guide public safety, economy, spaces, and morals.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn20-1538513211428275">19</xref></sup> With the extraordinary changes, the late nineteenth-century city became anything but well regulated. The residents who were more likely to work or spend time on the streets had less money, faced discrimination in other forms of work, or had barriers such as age and ability that limited their work options. When in public, they worked and rested, threw dice, and ate at lunch wagons. The central neighborhoods were not only diverse but also the myriad activities mocked the separate spheres and orderly life that middle-class Angelenos were creating.</p>
<p>Street life had internal logic, however, but an informal and regularly negotiated one. In Los Angeles, hawkers and peddlers had hierarchies and claimed and negotiated space among themselves. News boys traversed downtown, hopping on and off trolleys, and entering establishments. They were sources of irritation and hang wringing, but they were also useful and mostly tolerated. Fruit and vegetable vendors traveled (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1538513211428275">Figure 2</xref>), while lunch wagons and tamale carts stayed put during the day or evening hours, sometimes with agreement from the abutting businesses and at other times despite their complaints. Shopkeepers stored furniture or displayed goods on the sidewalk and some businesses charged for the right to wait in front of their property.</p>

</fig>
<p>The controversies that the Los Angeles city council faced reflected both the local circumstances and the national trends. Many concerns about street use did not result in regulation. In 1901, for instance, the Los Angeles Young Women’s Christian Association (YWCA) began traveler’s aid work at the Southern Pacific Depot in order to intercept young women arriving to the city alone, fearing that they would fall prey to disreputable characters. The fact that many young women enjoyed their independence and were seeking fun in heterosocial public venues caused consternation and led organizations like the YWCA to offer supervised heterosocial recreation.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn21-1538513211428275">20</xref></sup> Such women who migrated alone and sought work and independence also raised concern in other cities including Chicago, New York, and Atlanta.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn22-1538513211428275">21</xref></sup></p>
<p>More often, however, street activities became a point to take action. In the 1870s and 1880s, Chinese exclusionists in Los Angeles attacked the visible mobile vegetable peddlers through exorbitant licensing fees in order to make life impossible for the Chinese men who conducted these businesses.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn23-1538513211428275">22</xref></sup> Organizations often led by women such as the Federated Improvement Association also pushed to eliminate “antiquated, cumbersome, and unsanitary” system of marketing occurring on the streets <sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn24-1538513211428275">23</xref></sup> in a manner similar to the antivending movements in New York. In New York, the figure of the pushcart peddler separated the burgeoning forms of middle-class commerce from the working class, ethnic traditions, and pushcart battles that occurred in the Lower East Side were attempts to modernize commercial culture.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn25-1538513211428275">24</xref></sup> And, as in New York and Hartford, Los Angeles city council regulated how and when the working children, the messengers, news boys, and flower girls, could operate.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn26-1538513211428275">25</xref></sup> As Los Angeles grew in size and complexity, the Los Angeles city council became a site where differences among groups and individuals played out.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1538513211428275">
<title>The Municipality’s Actions</title>
<p>The complex interactions that surrounded lunch wagons, street vending, advertising, and public processions exemplify how various forms of public engagement became distinct activities with unique regulations. The process of municipal regulation impacted most street users even though of the countless interactions on the street few were brought in front of the council. When petitions were submitted, they detailed particular problems. A business owner might object to a specific lunch wagon as did Frank Strong, a property owner at Seventh and Central whose tenant owned a restaurant. His tenant did not like the mess, noise, or competition.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn27-1538513211428275">26</xref></sup> At times, merchants in direct competition with the hawkers would oppose their presence, and they requested public action on behalf of a group. In 1897, meat sellers requested the Los Angeles city council enact a licensing fee for vendors selling meat from wagons. In 1908, when flower vendors refused to sign exclusive contracts that required guaranteed minimums, Signal Hill Florist with other florists approached council to prohibit all flower vending.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn28-1538513211428275">27</xref></sup></p>
<p>The Los Angeles city council or individual council member could investigate the situation, ignore it, or propose a solution, and the most common solution was an ordinance or resolution. The ordinances that the Los Angeles city council enacted were specific but decisions extended to similarly situated people. The city council denied Frank Strong’s request because in part I. J. Sullivan’s cart had been operating in the same location for four years. Strong then challenged the city’s decision and both sides elicited support from abutting businesses and local residents. The case went as far as the California Supreme Court which held that neither the abutting businesses nor other vendors could establish stationary structures.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn29-1538513211428275">28</xref></sup> In response to the meat sellers’ request, the council enacted a $50 licensing fee for all meat wagons, a fee that greatly exceeded other street peddling licenses that ranged from $1 to $5. It did not however prohibit flower vending. The hawkers also had their supporters, mostly the producers who supplied them, and the hawkers themselves who claimed their right to make a living.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn30-1538513211428275">29</xref></sup></p>
<p>In the debates, the council members and other participants made distinctions among similar features with the intent to allow some activities while preventing others. By articulating activities as a series of specific elements, advertising was distinguished from street vending as well as from parading and street speaking. In 1898, the Merchants and Manufacturers Association, a business association that opposed most street use, requested that the city council prohibit animals with advertisements on city streets. The council expanded the proposal to include ringing bells and other advertising. After responding to all issues raised, and incorporating existing ordinances, the city attorney observed that all advertising by any means would be prohibited. It was the Board of Public Works however that found it too restrictive and referred it back to the city attorney who then drafted an ordinance specifically prohibiting bugles and bells that subsequently passed.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn31-1538513211428275">30</xref></sup> Between 1893 and the 1900s, the city enacted more than ten ordinances and countless amendments that pertained to advertising, ranging from prohibitions on advertising wagons and street criers to posting handbills and ringing bells.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn32-1538513211428275">31</xref></sup> But as the Junk Peddlers Protective Association argued, “the only method they have of letting people know of their presence is by calling out their business,” and their business depended on it.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn33-1538513211428275">32</xref></sup></p>
<p>The Los Angeles city council enacted and amended dozens of ordinances that impacted street work. How peddlers did business—from calling out their wares, standing or moving, the hours they could vend, the length of time to make a sale, and licensing to food quality, preparation, and storage standards—were delineated and regulated. Cumulatively, street workers negotiated an environment where each aspect of their work was defined, and the regulations made street activities more precarious because complainants had additional tools through which to exercise control.</p>
<p>Given the frequency that the activities were revisited and the very few incidences when people were cited, little evidence suggests however the ordinances were followed.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn34-1538513211428275">33</xref></sup> This likely reflected both that newcomers would not know the regulations and that they were not legitimate in many people’s eyes. The streets had functioned as a commons that did not clearly separate public and private use.</p>
<p>The petitioners were no more law abiding than others. In 1890, after food merchants successfully petitioned for an ordinance that prohibited fruit vending on certain downtown streets, Mr. Cobb, an orange seller, filed a complaint against the same fruit stand operators because they displayed fruit on the sidewalks in violation of a sidewalk obstruction ordinance. The police subsequently fined the merchants $3.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn35-1538513211428275">34</xref></sup></p>
<p>No consensus developed about how the ordinances should be enforced. When Mr. Cobb approached the police commission in an attempt to prevent enforcement of the fruit peddling ordinance, the commissioners disagreed to what extent they should enforce ordinances against street commerce. In one meeting, a commissioner suggested that ordinances were intended to be flexible and used to resolve problems and not to be enforced in every case. The outcry to this comment however suggested that at the very least some commissioners were attempting to maintain an illusion of strict enforcement.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn36-1538513211428275">35</xref></sup> In the early decades of the twentieth century, very few peddling and virtually no advertising citations were issued. At times, the police would assert they enforced ordinances evenly and others times they requested flexibility.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn37-1538513211428275">36</xref></sup></p>
<p>The iterative process of responding to complaints—and the reactions to those complaints—divorced an issue from the specific situation that gave rise to it. It became a categorical concern. Although not everyone had equal standing, no one group always dominated the debates,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn38-1538513211428275">37</xref></sup> but the results nevertheless created a set of tools that could be deployed to restrict street use.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1538513211428275">
<title>The City’s Interests</title>
<p>The debates in the Los Angeles city council were highly contested and when they were enforced the ordinances had direct consequences. Nevertheless, it is important to distinguish the various purposes and the specific concerns articulated in a given discussion from the municipal government’s overriding interests. Commercial street uses had no explicit legal protection and could be curtailed by an act of the legislature.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn39-1538513211428275">38</xref></sup> As new street workers came to the city’s attention, the Los Angeles city council established a growing schedule of licensing requirements and fees.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn40-1538513211428275">39</xref></sup> Licenses had dual purposes. They made individuals known because the city required that any “runner, agent or solicitor, or any other person soliciting custom for any hotel, boarding house, inn” visibly wear a name badge with a number recorded by the police. Similar numbering requirements were placed on delivery and milk wagons.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn41-1538513211428275">40</xref></sup></p>
<p>As the municipal government grew rapidly and bureaucratized, financing was a priority and challenge. Licenses also generated city revenue and street vendors became a significant source of municipal income. In July 1908, vegetable vendors received 625 of the 1,064 monthly licenses issued for nonalcohol related businesses. These licenses brought in $10,149.50 monthly, approximately one third of the liquor total of $32,450 per month. Of the 4,157 quarterly licenses due in July 1908, 203 were milk wagons, a number ranking third after hotels and lodging houses and restaurants. They generated $22,158.16 in revenue quarterly.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn42-1538513211428275">41</xref></sup></p>
<p>Street workers however were not inherently useful or troublesome from the city’s perspective. Council members might agree at times that door-to-door vendors of tape, needles, and combs were “impertinent” and the newspaper subscription agents “disagreeable and persistent” as the <italic>Los Angeles Times</italic> repeatedly argued.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn43-1538513211428275">42</xref></sup> But they also realized that the peddlers and lunch wagon operators were dependent on the income and offered needed services.</p>
<p>The ordinances were also a form of claiming space and defining appropriate forms of public engagement. Permits gave municipal professionals the most discretion to deny or allow a specific occurrence of an activity. Parades and processions were common in Los Angeles and parades had similarities to hawking and advertising practices that were being restricted. They were loud, disrupted traffic, and they were ways to engage with others. In other North American cities including Toronto, New York, San Francisco, and New Orleans, middle-class residents inserted respectable ways of being in public by promenading and organizing public ceremonies.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn44-1538513211428275">43</xref></sup> To allow such activities, from 1890 onward, if anyone was going to play a “drum, gong, tambourine, triangle, or any wind or stringed instrument” in a parade, the parade needed a permit from the Chief of Police.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn45-1538513211428275">44</xref></sup> Parades were common and most received permits without trouble, and this allowed parades to continue but advertising to be restricted.</p>
<p>Within the rubric of the public interest, individuals had little claim, and people opposed new regulations by articulating distinct group rather than individual interests. At times, they exercised collective power, such as when, in response to exorbitant license fees, Chinese vegetables vendors went on strike. As the suppliers of 80 percent of local vegetables, they succeeded in lowering the fees. They also challenged the ordinances in court.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn46-1538513211428275">45</xref></sup> In other cases, respondents delineated alternative public purposes. When lunch carts were going to be prohibited, thirty-eight “poor peddlers,” operators of lunch wagons and root beer, popcorn, and peanut stands requested that they may be allowed to vend because they had no other income.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn47-1538513211428275">46</xref></sup> In response to an advertising ordinance, The Junk Peddlers Protective Association, composed of almost 200 members, explained that “It is necessary to the welfare of the city that junk collectors exist for the purpose of going from house to house collecting old rags, bottles, sacks, etc.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn48-1538513211428275">47</xref></sup></p>
<p>Although the municipal government had explicit interests in street activities, they were narrower than the debates that brought specific issues in front of the council. The Los Angeles city council classified activities, enacted ordinances that could be deployed when needed, and regulated how street activities were conducted. Changes in shopping patterns, not the regulations, reduced street vending and advertising. As the city developed its characteristic low-density settlement and retail moved into the neighborhoods, Los Angeles residents adopted new shopping practices. Street vending survived longer where it was needed, in the central neighborhoods where residents had lower incomes and acquired refrigeration later.</p>

<title>Constructing the Streets as Spaces for Travel</title>
<p>In the nineteenth century, in the words of historian William Novak, public officials replaced common law claims with public purposes and “they dissolved vested interests and private property rights and reinvented the roadway as a distinctly public phenomenon, and object of governance and police.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn49-1538513211428275">48</xref></sup> To construct the streets as spaces for travel, conceptually and legally, the street had to be separated from the adjoining properties and also oriented toward movement. In 1880s and 1890s, the majority of petitions to the Los Angeles city council dealt with the mundane aspects of city building such as grading and graveling streets and laying sidewalks and crosswalks. Constructing infrastructure explicitly defined the municipality’s role, and municipalities nationwide were increasingly responsible for keeping the street safe and clear for travel. Among the numerous interested parties, municipal professionals took over decision making about the street with their professional attention focused on building a circulation system.</p>
<sec id="section7-1538513211428275">
<title>The Public’s Spaces</title>
<p>Nineteenth-century public highways were assumed to be “free and open for subjects and foreigners” alike.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn50-1538513211428275">49</xref></sup> This limited abutters’ right to exclude others but did not restrict their right to use the sidewalks and streets. Throughout the nineteenth century, in cities across the United States, urban streets and sidewalks extended the adjoining businesses. Into the 1880s, such property claims were recognized in Los Angeles and adjoining property owners would charge for the sidewalk or gutter space outside their business and by ordinance street hawkers, lunch wagons or other street workers had to secure permission from the abutting property owner to set up outside.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn51-1538513211428275">50</xref></sup> Shops displayed their wares and stored goods outside. On some streets, the gutters were also used to store and repair buggies and property owners built semipermanent structures such as sheds.</p>
<p>By 1904, according to Ernst Freud, a foremost scholar on the law of municipal corporations, adjoining property became “subject to any restraint required by public street uses.” Customary encroachments—“signs, awnings, posts, porches, stands”—became nuisances if they “diminish the space available for walking, or impede traffic” but they were not held to be nuisances by matter of fact.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn52-1538513211428275">51</xref></sup> Between 1880 and 1910s, the Los Angeles city council enacted twenty increasingly restrictive sidewalk obstruction ordinances and additional amendments. The ordinances delineated different amounts of space and varying amounts of time which property owners could use the sidewalks or gutters.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn53-1538513211428275">52</xref></sup></p>
<p>Because California legally held that all street obstructions were nuisances, lunch wagons and merchandise displays by definition became injurious to others and subject to abatement. The Los Angeles city council could therefore no longer allow street or sidewalk use because it held property “in trust for the public, and has no inherent right to surrender or impair that trust.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn54-1538513211428275">53</xref></sup> In 1886, the Los Angeles city council tried to explicitly allow property owners to use two and a half feet of the sidewalk as a basement entrance. The city attorney called its attention “to the fact that such ordinance would be void” because “any obstruction of a public street is a public nuisance and may be abated by any one or the owner may be prosecuted for its maintenance. The Council … may permit temporary obstructions such as for building purposes, etc. but cannot legalize a permanent obstruction.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn55-1538513211428275">54</xref></sup></p>
<p>The specific circumstances on a given street or with a particular business became unimportant. In the 1890s, a petitioner complained that the Hooker Company blocked the adjoining sidewalks and streets. The discussion expanded to other streets that were blocked, and as a result, the city passed a resolution prohibiting street use by adjoining businesses across the entire city. In response to the order, a group of merchants approached the council to explain that such enforcement in the wholesale district would cripple business because adequate space was not available.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn56-1538513211428275">55</xref></sup> The superintendent of streets who was charged with the enforcement in the Hooker controversy asked the Los Angeles city council to interpret its blanket enforcement order because he found the streets integral to businesses in many cases and not occupied by heavy traffic. In another controversy, all council members agreed that the Llewellyn Iron Works had to tear down the sheds that it built in the streets, and remove piles of pig iron, scrap iron, pipe, and debris that were left in the gutters and sidewalks. But the street superintendent and even the <italic>Los Angeles Times,</italic> which generally advocated for unobstructed streets, noted that the streets adjacent to Llewellyn Iron Works were usually empty and pointed out that if this had not been the case the sheds never would have been constructed.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn57-1538513211428275">56</xref></sup></p>
<p>The streets were being provided for the traveling public, a distinctly mobile user that justified curtaining both use by abutting businesses and activities by other street users.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn58-1538513211428275">57</xref></sup> It was that public purpose, and not public ownership, that defined the street. In many cases, adjoining properties owned the land on which streets and sidewalks were built. Two conceptually different legal tools guaranteed public access. These were easements and fees. In the case of an easement, people were granted access to property for a given use. Along the streets, people had a right to travel, and therefore the abutting property owner could not stop them. In the case of a fee, the street would be dedicated to the municipal corporation that then held title to or owned that land.</p>
<p>In the nineteenth century, the rights of lot owners differed based on which mechanism had been employed, and lot owners that held the fee to the land were presumed to have more right to that space for personal use as well as to decide what else could be done there. As an example of the difference, in the mid-nineteenth century, municipalities freely issued franchises for horse cars when they owned the land. In the case of Chicago, however, where property owners held the fee, horse car operators had to get permission from the Common Council as well as agreement from two-thirds of the properties with frontage along the route.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn59-1538513211428275">58</xref></sup></p>
<p>The notion of the street as a public space, regardless of who owned the land replaced this distinction. By 1876, in the <italic>Barney v. Keokuk</italic> decision, the US Supreme Court held that “On the general question as to the rights of the public in a city street we cannot see any material difference in the principle with regard to the extent of those rights, whether the fee is in the public or in the adjacent land owner, or in some third person.” In 1904, almost thirty years later, Ernst Freud wrote “Where the fee remains in the adjoining owner, he may retain certain rights in the soil unaffected by street uses, and he may be entitled to additional compensation for an increase in the public easement by novel and burdensome public uses … [but] the difference between fee and easement has become more and more technical and insubstantial.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn60-1538513211428275">59</xref></sup> Abutting owners retained “a technical legal title to the soil” in many Western US cities.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn61-1538513211428275">60</xref></sup></p>
<p>In response their declining control, property owners who had previously exercised individual influence began to assert aggregate claims by requesting specific regulations across districts. In 1890, shopkeepers who sold fruit successfully petitioned to the Los Angeles city council to eliminate fruit peddlers from downtown streets. The council enacted an ordinance that prohibited peddler and huckster wagons from standing on streets within a defined downtown district; they had a three minute window to make a sale when hailed by a purchaser. In 1893, peddling fruit was forbidden outright along a seven-block length of Main, Spring, and Broadway.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn62-1538513211428275">61</xref></sup> Such proposals became common and in the subsequent decades lunch wagon and other street vending restricted-districts were proposed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1538513211428275">Figure 3</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn63-1538513211428275">62</xref></sup></p>

<p>Downtown streets were crowded, and venders and lunch wagons could impede traffic, but establishing districts were also tools to eliminate unwanted people. In 1900s, the Socialist Party began street speaking campaigns, and Los Angeles became embroiled in a series of street speaking controversies that continued throughout the next decade. The Los Angeles council used all their tools to eliminate street speaking—they established speaking spaces in order to restrict others, they regulated the time and manner of street speaking, and they required permits that the police chief could deny. The council faced strong opposition however from the Socialist Party, from others including the Salvation Army that proselytized regularly, and from many who agreed that the ordinances violated the speakers’ First Amendment rights, even if they did not agree with the speakers. The council therefore adopted a no speaking district in the name of the traveling public. Abutting business owners then successfully petitioned to have the no speaking zone extended repeatedly, even when no traffic impacts could be identified.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn64-1538513211428275">63</xref></sup></p>
<p>The question of who owned the street—or exercised most control—was nonetheless less settled than it might appear. As late as 1919, a <italic>Los Angeles Times</italic> cartoon captured three distinct relationships (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1538513211428275">Figure 4</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn65-1538513211428275"> In the first pane, the adjoining property owner’s entitlement is reflected in her decision to tell a vehicle to move. In the second, the officer telling a hobo where he cannot stand showed the street as a space of municipal control. In the third pane, an automobile dominates. Abutters often owned the land, but as the Los Angeles Times put it “Sure, You Own the Streets. However, You Needn’t Brag About it Unless You have Interest a Taxicab Company, for the Proprietorship Doesn’t mean Anything”.64</xref></sup> Adjoining property owners owned the land and paid for street improvements but they had little more to say.</p>

<title>The Municipality’s Responsibilities</title>
<p>Infrastructure provision became a proactive precursor to planning urban streets.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn66-1538513211428275">65</xref></sup> During the second half of the nineteenth century, the discovery that many diseases were waterborne accelerated campaigns for both pure water and sewer construction, and urbanites found municipal ownership of water and sewerage systems beneficial. By 1910, nearly every city had sewers and over 70 percent of US cities with 30,000 residents owned their waterworks.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn67-1538513211428275">66</xref></sup> The city of Los Angeles acquired its waterworks in 1902.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn68-1538513211428275">67</xref></sup> The historian Jon Teaford has called the late nineteenth-century city government’s growing competence in basic infrastructure and services an unheralded triumph.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn69-1538513211428275">68</xref></sup></p>
<p>The importance of the traveling public empowered the municipal engineers who increasingly controlled street provision. Professionals have distinct characteristics, including specialized knowledge and socially valued skills. Municipal engineers gained prominence in cities because their expertise made water and sewer systems work. In the emergent consensus that urban infrastructure was necessary, and where failures were visible, professionalism was valued.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn70-1538513211428275">69</xref></sup> Professionals also “see” the subject of their expertise, and like governmental entities, they have narrow vision. As municipal engineers laid claim to the streets through their everyday oversight over the improvements, they prioritized circulation and cleanliness. Durable paving did not always appeal to residents who valued local uses because it cost more and encouraged faster travel. As historian Clay McShane has shown, by the 1910s and 1920s, street paving materials became increasingly durable as municipal engineers perceived the streets as a circulation system.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn71-1538513211428275">70</xref></sup></p>
<p>Although street grading and improvements helped reduce standing water and prevent disease epidemics, the adjoining property owners were seen as the primary beneficiaries because street improvements increased the property’s exchange and use value.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn72-1538513211428275">71</xref></sup> In Los Angeles, when two-thirds of property owners along a given street requested street improvements, they were constructed to standards established by the municipal engineers, and the property owners paid. Because sidewalks were less costly and adequate for many businesses’ purposes, they were paved with durable materials faster than the roadbed.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn73-1538513211428275">72</xref></sup></p>
<p>In the early-twentieth century, Los Angeles gradually shifted the costs of street improvements for main streets and arterial highways from abutters to larger assessment districts and then to the general fund or other sources. In the 1880s, improvements were constructed “at the expense of the property holders.” Many improvements were considered “to be of more than local or ordinary public benefit” in the 1900s and therefore the work was frequently “assessed upon a district.” In 1908, “the whole of the cost and expenses of” work done on Main Street was “paid out of the Treasury.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn74-1538513211428275">73</xref></sup> Between 1904 and 1914, Los Angeles gained 500 miles of improved streets. By the mid 1920s, many landholders and developers saw the need for arterials and formed municipal improvement districts to tax themselves. During that decade, facing increased traffic and congestion, the electorate also approved a bond issue to implement the City Planning Commission’s Major Traffic Street Plan that constructed several major and secondary highways.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn75-1538513211428275">74</xref></sup> Nevertheless, abutting property owners still paid at least half the costs of most street improvements and usually the whole cost for sidewalk in cities nationwide.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn76-1538513211428275">75</xref></sup></p>
<p>Regardless of who paid for the improvements or whether they had been dedicated to the city, municipalities across the United States were being held responsible to ensure that streets and sidewalks were clear of permanent and temporary obstructions. Cities had to repair sidewalks and streets, clear them of ice and snow, and keep them free from hazards because they were held liable for pedestrian safety and for injuries sustained from accidents caused by sidewalk and street obstructions.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn77-1538513211428275">76</xref></sup> In 1903, the <italic>Los Angeles</italic>
<italic>Times</italic> noted that Chicago was paying interest on $4,000,000 in judgments against the city, the bulk of which were traced to defective sidewalks.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn78-1538513211428275">77</xref></sup></p>
<p>State courts differed to what extent adjacent property owners could be obligated to maintain streets and sidewalks, and often property owners were more responsible for the sidewalks than the roadbed.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn79-1538513211428275">78</xref></sup> The state of California enabled cities to require that property owners maintain the streets and sidewalks and Los Angeles held property owners responsible. In 1918, <italic>The American City</italic> trade journal reported that most states were upholding cities’ authority to require abutters to remove snow and ice although there were still exceptions. In Illinois and New Hampshire, the city could not direct that responsibility to property owners. In Illinois, the court reasoned that lot owners had no special duty because the lot owners’ interest in a clear sidewalk was the same as other members of the traveling public and all people with a reason could clear them.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn80-1538513211428275">79</xref></sup> Even when cities required that private persons take responsibility, they were still obligated to ensure that the sidewalks and streets were maintained and kept clear.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn81-1538513211428275">80</xref></sup></p>
<p>By the time transportation planners began to assert claims to the streets in the early-twentieth century, they were drawing on established concepts where the street was a public space for unobstructed travel and the traveling public was a distinct user. As planner Jeffrey Brown demonstrated, between 1910s and 1930s, transportation engineers used scientific methods to strengthen their authority. They drew upon statistics and scientific thinking, and they took for granted that their objective was facilitating automobile traffic in the CBD. Traffic data became the frame through which they viewed the streets’ functioning.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn82-1538513211428275">81</xref></sup></p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>In 1936, <italic>Los Angeles Times</italic> writer Arnold Jackson looked nostalgically back upon the time “when musical cries brought business.”<disp-quote>
<p>In weird chorus the tinker, the chimney sweep, the rat-trap vendor, the milkmaid, the knife-sharpener, the fruit peddler and the flower-seller joined the clamor. Their musical slogans were a characteristic sound in London 1750. The chanting voices were muffled only occasionally by the rumble of a carriage or the clatter of a gentleman on horseback. … Only in remote back streets of London and other great cities does one hear these ancient cries today.</p>
</disp-quote>For Jackson, the ditties of eighteenth-century London streets invoked a more personal urbanity, and in the “rush of civilization,” the “simplicity, the glamour and the intimacy of the street vendor” were lost. The “screech of automobile brakes, the wall of sirens,” and the modern advertising’s “mechanical voices” compared unfavorably with the melodic cries of yesteryear’s picturesque peddlers.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn83-1538513211428275">82</xref></sup> When he wrote, Jackson saw remnants of street vending traditions alive in Los Angeles—the newsboys worked sidewalk corners, the fruit truck traveled neighborhood to neighborhood, the fishmonger blew his tin horn.</p>
<p>Thirty years later, Jane Jacobs’ 1961 treatise against urban planning <italic>The Death and Life of Great American Cities</italic> celebrated the daily commotion of the street and its internal logic. She captured the divergence between what appeared to be planning’s domain and the expansive everyday life it devalued.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn84-1538513211428275">83</xref></sup> By the 1990s and 2000s, street life became desirable and, influenced by Jane Jacobs, city officials and planners attempted to attract visitors and urban residents by providing walkable urban experiences. Municipalities readily adapted their standards to provide street life infrastructure including pedestrian amenities, street trees, and destination districts.</p>
<p>In the 1990s and 2000s, cities nationwide also actively enacted and amended street regulations. The increased regulation led urban observers to argue that these ordinances privatized public spaces.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn85-1538513211428275">84</xref></sup> Street regulations were not new, however, but the current bout of regulation ran counter to a newer vision of inclusive public space. The expanded view of the public included individuals and groups considered undesirable—for instance, people who were homeless—by the “public” for whom the new street amenities were being provided. The regulations and surrounding controversies reflected a revived debate over diversity in urban life in another rapidly changing time.</p>
<p>Because transportation planning became a recognized state function, and cars became dominant, they also became an easy scapegoat for late twentieth-century reflections on the street’s purported demise. Los Angeles epitomizes the autocentric city. Prior to the auto’s assent, however, the streets had been envisioned as spaces for unimpeded travel, and this vision developed through incremental responses to disorienting street life in the rapidly changing city. Planning required the narrowing of vision that makes particular priorities clear. “Traffic logic” continues to dominate and is used to remove as diverse “obstructions” as people and news boxes.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn86-1538513211428275">85</xref></sup></p>
<p>The functions of other activities were many and varied but the municipality’s interests were narrow. In the late nineteenth- and early twentieth-century Los Angeles, street activities became increasingly legible because the regulatory process named and delineated the activities’ distinct components. For planners and public officials, planning for street life might be paradoxical because the street’s richness was its incremental adaptations and negotiations as people took space as needed and did what worked for them. Planning tools in contrast required legibility and hierarchical order that established priorities and formalized what occurred.</p>
