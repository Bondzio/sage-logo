<p>Maintenance of active research pursuits and publication in peer-reviewed journals are important, central components of academic medicine. As a surgical specialty, otolaryngology is a small but highly research-driven field and is no exception to this rule.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0194599812438171">1</xref></sup> In addition to the primary goals of expanding the knowledge base and educating colleagues, publication of original research also serves to establish recognition for the authors and helps further their academic career advancement.</p>
<p>The presence of women within medical practice is increasing. According to the American Association of Medical Colleges, the percentage of matriculating medical students who are female has increased every year since 1969 to the current level of 50%.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0194599812438171">2</xref></sup> Approximately 45% of residents in US training programs are female, and women have gained significant ground with regard to representation in nonsurgical specialties.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0194599812438171">3</xref></sup> The percentage of female physicians in otolaryngology has also grown, albeit more slowly. Although female residents are still in the minority for the specialty, representation has increased from 8% in 1980 to 21% in 2003.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0194599812438171">4</xref></sup> Figures from the American Association of Medical Colleges 2008 Physician Specialty Data show the percentage of female otolaryngology residents and fellows at 27%. The number of women in academic leadership positions in otolaryngology is also increasing. In 2011, of the 103 Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME)–accredited academic otolaryngology residency programs in the United States, 15 have female program directors, and 4 are headed by female department chairs.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0194599812438171">5</xref></sup></p>
<p>Concordant with the increased representation of women in academic otolaryngology, it would be expected that female authorship of publications within the specialty would rise as well. However, there are no contemporary data to confirm this expectation. In the field of general surgery, a study by Kurichi et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0194599812438171">6</xref></sup> examining female authorship in general surgery journals from 1985 to 2003 demonstrates that approximately 15% to 25% of the first authors were women and that these percentages were comparable to the percentage of women in academic general surgery. We have previously studied trends in female authorship in otolaryngology over 3 decades from 1978 to 1998 and found that the average percentage of female authorship increased from 4.1% in 1978 to 8.7% in 1988 and to 12.4% in 1998; each of these increases was statistically significant.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0194599812438171">7</xref></sup> First authorship by subspecialty was also evaluated, and women were found to be most represented in the pediatric otolaryngology literature at 14.7% and least in plastics and reconstructive surgery at 2.7%. The purpose of the current study is to extend our previous report with an additional decade of data for comparison and examination of trends. It is well documented that the gender gap within the practice of otolaryngology is narrowing. With this in mind, we find it essential to also document and follow gender representation in authorship within the otolaryngology literature. Such contemporary data are particularly important given the increased prevalence of female surgeons, many of whom elect a career in academic otolaryngology.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0194599812438171">8</xref></sup></p>
<sec id="section7-0194599812438171" sec-type="materials|methods">
<title>Materials and Methods</title>
<p>We performed a retrospective review for all articles published in the calendar year 2008 from 4 non-subspecialty otolaryngology journals: <italic>Annals of Otology, Rhinology and Laryngology</italic>, <italic>Archives of Otolaryngology–Head and Neck Surgery</italic>, <italic>Laryngoscope</italic>, and <italic>Otolaryngology–Head and Neck Surgery</italic>. All articles excluding editorials and review articles were surveyed, and the author panel was examined for number of authors, gender of each author, educational degree of each author, and subspecialty area of publication. This information was obtained by examining the title, author list, abstract, and manuscript text if no abstract was available. We excluded editorials and contemporary review articles in our analysis because, although these are significant bodies of work, they are not considered original research.</p>
<p>For each article, the presence of a female first author and the percentage of female authorship (total number of female authors divided by the total number of authors) were determined. When gender could not be determined for an author even after review of the author on targeted Internet searching, the article was excluded from further analysis. For initial data collection, all degrees of all authors were listed. Because the degrees of nonphysician first authors were divided widely among various degrees (ie, BS, MS, PhD, AuD, RN, etc) with small populations of subgroups, the degree status was placed into either physician or nonphysician groups for data analysis. Subspecialty area was placed into 1 of 5 categories: otology, general otolaryngology, pediatric otolaryngology, head and neck oncology, or plastic and reconstructive surgery.</p>
<p>Stepwise analysis of the data was performed using SPSS statistical system 17.0 (SPSS, Inc, an IBM Company, Chicago, Illinois). One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and post hoc testing with Dunnett’s T3 test were used to determine significant differences of female first authorship and percentage female authorship by year. Chi-square tests with exact statistics were computed for distribution of gender by subspecialty area of publication and author academic degree analysis.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-0194599812438171" sec-type="results">
<title>Results</title>
<p>A total of 3421 articles were examined, including 634 from 1978, 789 from 1988, 1040 from 1998 and 958 from 2008. Of the 3421 articles, 750 (90 from 1978, 160 from 1988, 327 from 1998, and 173 from 2008) had 1 or more authors for whom gender could not be determined and were therefore excluded from the analysis. The data for first author gender by publication year are tabulated in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0194599812438171"><bold>Table 1</bold></xref>. From 1998 to 2008, the percentage of articles with a female first author increased from 12.9% to 21.3%. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0194599812438171"><bold>Figure 1</bold></xref> presents the data for overall percentage of authors who were female (calculated as the number of female authors divided by the total number of authors for each article). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0194599812438171"><bold>Figure 1</bold></xref> also contains the corresponding percentage of graduating otolaryngology residents who were female for 1998 and 2008 (years for which data are available). The overall mean percentage of authors who were female increased from 14.5% to 22.5% for 1998 and 2008, respectively. Consistent with the increases from the previous 3 decades, these increases in female first authorship and overall female authorship from 1998 to 2008 were statistically significant (both <italic>P</italic> &lt; .001).</p>

<p>Whereas in previous years, there was a statistically significant difference in female first author percentage according to subspecialty, in 2008, female first author percentages were not significantly different among subspecialties (<italic>P</italic> = .885). This suggests that female first authorship has equilibrated across the otolaryngologic subspecialties. Over the past 10 years, the percentage of female first authors who are nonphysicians appears unchanged (19.2% vs 17.4%) but continues to be significantly higher than the percentage of male first authors who are also nonphysicians (9.2% in 2008, <italic>P</italic> &lt; .001).</p>

<sec id="section9-0194599812438171" sec-type="discussion">
<title>Discussion</title>
<p>As in other fields in surgery, the gender gap in otolaryngology has exhibited a slow but steady reduction over the past 2 decades. In 1998, women comprised just over 6% of all practicing otolaryngologists in the United States. By 2003, 21% of entering otolaryngology residents were female. Subsequently, in 2008, women comprised 27% of the otolaryngology resident and fellows contingent; of 257 otolaryngology residents graduating, 57 were female (22%).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0194599812438171">9</xref></sup> However, because of the lag time between residency training and clinical (and/or academic) practice, the total percentage of active female otolaryngologists has recently been estimated at 11% according to the American Association of Medical Colleges 2008 Physician Specialty Data.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0194599812438171">3</xref></sup> These practice and training data put our results in perspective.</p>
<p>First, our finding of a 21.3% prevalence of female first authorship and a 22.5% prevalence of female authorship altogether is very consistent with the proportion of women in the otolaryngology workforce. These results lie between the 27% figure for proportion of otolaryngology residents and the 11% estimate of proportion of practicing female otolaryngologists. We believe that these data clearly indicate that as female otolaryngologists become more prevalent, they are developing a consistent and proportionate academic output, arguing against any significant gender gaps in academic publication. Broadly put, female otolaryngologists are easily keeping pace with respect to academic publication as their numbers increase over time. This is particularly interesting because recent surveys of female surgeons have suggested that they are more likely to have competing interests that may limit time for academic pursuits, relative to similar male surgeon cohorts.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0194599812438171">10</xref></sup></p>
<p>An interesting finding from our previous analysis was the relative discrepancy in female authorship percentages among various otolaryngology subspecialties. In years past, pediatric otolaryngology was by far the dominant subspecialty in terms of female representation, whereas plastic and reconstructive surgery had the lowest percentage.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0194599812438171">7</xref></sup> This discrepancy among the subspecialties has significantly equilibrated in our analysis of the 2008 publication data. Pediatric otolaryngology is no longer the standout subspecialty for female authorship but remains stable at 19.4% female first authors. All other subspecialty areas have increased to greater than 18% female first authors in 2008. These increases may represent a larger percentage of women completing fellowship training in these areas, but this remains a topic for further study.</p>
<p>One consistent finding across all 4 decades is the statistically significant difference in the number of nonphysician female first authors when compared with nonphysician male first authors. In review of the degrees of nonphysician first authors, they were divided widely among various degrees (ie, BS, MS, PhD, AuD, RN, etc). The small sizes for the populations among these degree subgroups precluded specific statistical analysis by degree. It is important to recognize that many of the subgroups were female-dominated fields such as nursing, audiology, and speech language pathology. The American Speech-Language-Hearing Association reported that only 5.9% of its members in 2010 were male.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0194599812438171">11</xref></sup> The gender gap in these nonphysician careers closely involved with the field of otolaryngology and publishing within the otolaryngologic literature certainly affects the data for female authorship.</p>
<p>A few limitations of our study merit mention. First, we acknowledge that approximately 22% of the articles examined were excluded from the study because of an inability to determine author gender. The statistical analyses were also repeated including these articles assuming male authorship, and this did not significantly affect the results. Second, it is important to note that in this study, authors ranked beyond the sixth author were excluded from the statistical analysis. By eliminating these authors in publications with more than 6 authors, we may have introduced a bias against female principal investigators leading larger groups. Although the first author and his or her role is easily recognized, identifying the senior author can be fraught with difficulty as there is no specific standardization. For example, in committee-related publications, authorship order may be alphabetical. Furthermore, the relatively high prevalence of female first authors who are nonphysicians may be a reflection of the higher likelihood that a more junior trainee or student would be placed as first author on an academic project. In future studies, we do plan to assess for trends in female senior authorship. Finally, we restricted our analysis to 4 non-subspecialty otolaryngology journals with wide circulations. It is possible that there is additional, perhaps even higher female authorship prevalence in the subspecialty otolaryngology journals, some of which have higher impact factors than the journals studied herein. This would be an additional interesting area for further analysis.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>Success and advancement in academic medicine often depend heavily on the publication of peer-reviewed original research. As more female surgeons enter the field of otolaryngology, many of whom seek academic positions, we feel it is essential to maintain contemporary data for female publication rates within otolaryngology. Overall, this bibliometric analysis highlights a sustained trend over the decades toward increasing female authorship in the otolaryngologic literature and across the otolaryngologic subspecialties with equilibration. In the context of academic medicine, these data firmly suggest that female otolaryngologists continue to narrow the gender gap.</p>
