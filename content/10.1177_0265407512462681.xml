<abstract>
<p>Relationship satisfaction has been widely studied among biological parents; however, concomitant research on adoptive parents is relatively lacking. The current study reports on a survey completed by 251 mothers who had adopted a child in the past 24 months. Participants completed measures of several aspects of the vulnerability–stress–adaptation model of marital satisfaction. Results indicated that satisfaction, as measured by a short form of the Dyadic Adjustment Scale (DAS-7), was related to several enduring vulnerabilities, adaptive processes, and stressors. Significant individual predictors of relationship satisfaction included: socioeconomic status, partner support, enthusiasm of partner for being a parent, and feelings of rest. Findings suggest that the relationship satisfaction of adoptive mothers is not affected by infertility or factors related to the adoption process, but rather by aspects of mental health, well-being, and support that are common to the parenting experience.</p>

<p>The stress associated with the transition to parenthood has been extensively studied with regard to its effects on marital quality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0265407512462681">Cowan &amp; Cowan, 1995</xref>), although most of this research has focused on the marital functioning of biological parents. Parents report lower marital satisfaction than nonparents, and there is a significant, negative relationship between number of children and marital satisfaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0265407512462681">Twenge, Campbell, &amp; Foster, 2003</xref>). Research shows that the birth of the first child leads to sudden decreases in marital satisfaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0265407512462681">Cox, Paley, Burchinal, &amp; Payne, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0265407512462681">Crohan, 1996</xref>) beyond the normal decreases in marital satisfaction for childless couples (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0265407512462681">Doss, Rhoades, Stanley, &amp; Markman, 2009</xref>); this decrease continues for several years after the birth of the child, although planning for pregnancy and level of satisfaction before marriage moderate the level of decline (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0265407512462681">Doss et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0265407512462681">Lawrence, Rothman, Cobb, Rothman, &amp; Bradbury, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>Comparatively less is known about how adopting a child affects relationship satisfaction of the adopting parents. This is an important gap in the knowledge base, given that we know marital distress, marital conflict, and divorce in parents are associated with myriad negative outcomes in children (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0265407512462681">Cummings &amp; Davies, 2002</xref>). Furthermore, there has been an increase in the number of adoptions; in the US, approximately 1,782,000 children are adopted (i.e., living with neither biological parent; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0265407512462681">Vandivere, Malm, &amp; Radel, 2009</xref>). The factors that predict relationship satisfaction in biological parents, however, may not directly transfer to adoptive parents. There are several ways that adoptive parents can differ from biological parents, particularly in their route to becoming parents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19a-0265407512462681">Fontenot, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0265407512462681">Levy-Shiff, Goldshmidt, &amp; Har-Even, 1991</xref>). Some theorists suggested that the adoption may be particularly detrimental to marital satisfaction, as adoptive parents face unique challenges (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0265407512462681">Brodzinsky &amp; Huffman, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0265407512462681">Rosenberg, 1992</xref>). Adoptive parents, for instance, have a higher likelihood of a period of infertility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0265407512462681">Cudmore, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0265407512462681">Daniluk &amp; Hurtig-Mitchell, 2003</xref>), are more likely to parent a child with behavioral and/or emotional problems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0265407512462681">Glidden, 2000</xref>), and often have a child from a different racial/ethnic group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0265407512462681">Lazarus, Evans, Glidden, &amp; Flaherty, 2002</xref>). These life events (e.g., infertility) and child characteristics (e.g., behavior problems) are likely to be an additional source of stress for the adoptive couple. Couples without good adaptive processes and support networks might struggle to cope with these additional stressors, leading to a decrease in marital satisfaction. Adoptive parents, however, may have certain advantages over biological parents, including being older, married longer, more financially secure, and having a stable career (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0265407512462681">Brodzinsky &amp; Huffman, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0265407512462681">Levy-Shiff et al., 1991</xref>), which are all strong predictors of greater marital satisfaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0265407512462681">Karney &amp; Bradbury, 1995</xref>).</p>

<title>Relationship satisfaction in adoptive parents</title>
<p>To date, there have been only a handful of studies that report on the relationship satisfaction of adoptive parents. Research analyzing data from the first and second waves of the National Survey of Families and Households demonstrated that adoptive parents reported a nonsignificant increase in marital satisfaction over the transition to parenthood, while biological parents reported a significant decrease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0265407512462681">Ceballo, Lansford, Abbey, &amp; Stewart, 2004</xref>). Another study found relatively high mean levels of marital satisfaction in mothers and fathers assessed within the 5 year postadoption period (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0265407512462681">Leve, Scaramella, &amp; Fagot, 2001</xref>), although this was a cross-sectional study and used a one-item measure of marital satisfaction. Indeed, these studies are limited by small samples, a lack of reliable and valid measures, and retrospective reporting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0265407512462681">Ward, 1998</xref>).</p>
<p>In the largest and most comprehensive study to date, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0265407512462681">Goldberg, Smith, and Kashy (2010</xref>) examined the relationship satisfaction of heterosexual and gay and lesbian couples across the transition to adoptive parenthood. Using a longitudinal design, they studied how well various intrapersonal (e.g., depression), interpersonal (e.g., relationship maintenance), and social (e.g., aspects of the adoption agency) factors predicted change in relationship quality from pre- to postadoption. Decreases in love and increases in ambivalence and conflict across the transition to adoption were found for all types of couples, regardless of sexual orientation. Depression had consistent and negative implications for relationship quality, as it predicted love, ambivalence, and conflict at both time of adoption and across the first year of parenthood. Additionally, higher levels of relationship maintenance measured preadoption were related to greater love, less conflict, and less ambivalence at the time of adoption, while avoidant coping was significantly related to less love and more ambivalence at adoption.</p>

<title>VSA model of marital satisfaction: Application to adoptive parents</title>
<p>Our goal in the current study was to examine the marital satisfaction of adoptive parents using the theoretical framework of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0265407512462681">Karney and Bradbury’s (1995)</xref> vulnerability–stress–adaptation (VSA) model of marital satisfaction and stability. The VSA model posits that the level of satisfaction in a marriage, and ultimately the stability of that relationship, is a function of three interrelated domains: <italic>enduring</italic> <italic>vulnerabilities</italic>, the individual strengths and resources that each spouse brings to the marriage (e.g., education, mental health); the <italic>adaptive processes</italic> (e.g., communication and behaviors) exchanged between spouses; and the <italic>stressors</italic> that couples encounter together (e.g., financial difficulties and childrearing). It is the interplay among these three domains that ultimately predicts a couple’s satisfaction and stability. For instance, adaptive processes are a function of each individual partner’s enduring vulnerabilities, and in turn impact how each handles stressful events. In the current study, all participants had encountered the same stressful event, adoption, but their individual experience of that event is likely to have differed. We assessed important risk factors from each of the VSA domains, specifically focusing on variables relevant to the adoption process.</p>
<sec id="section3-0265407512462681">
<title>Enduring vulnerabilities</title>
<p>A multitude of studies have examined enduring vulnerabilities that are predictive of marital satisfaction, particularly in biological parents. Gender and race/ethnicity predict marital satisfaction, where whites and men report higher levels of marital satisfaction than blacks and women (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0265407512462681">Corra, Carter, Carter, &amp; Knox, 2009</xref>). Younger age at marriage has consistently been linked to greater likelihood of marital dissolution (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0265407512462681">South, 1995</xref>), although recent research suggests that older age at marriage may not be protective of marital satisfaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0265407512462681">Glenn, Uecker, &amp; Love, 2010</xref>). Relationship duration can be protective of marital satisfaction in biological parents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0265407512462681">Doss et al., 2009</xref>), although it was previously found to be unrelated to the aspects of marital functioning in adoptive parents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0265407512462681">Goldberg et al., 2010</xref>). Higher levels of socioeconomic status (SES), as measured by greater income and higher levels of education, are associated with greater marital satisfaction (for a recent review, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0265407512462681">Conger, Conger, &amp; Martin, 2010</xref>). Religiosity is positively related to relationship satisfaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0265407512462681">Wilcox &amp; Wolfinger, 2007</xref>), particularly in biological mothers after the transition to parenthood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38a-0265407512462681">Nock, Sanchez, &amp; Wright, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>One of the strongest and most consistent findings in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0265407512462681">Goldberg et al.’s (2010)</xref> study was the importance of depression in predicting poor relationship quality over the transition to parenthood for adoptive parents. This fits with abundant research demonstrating links between depression and marital distress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0265407512462681">South &amp; Krueger, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0265407512462681">Whisman &amp; Uebelacker, 2003</xref>), particularly postpartum depression and marital satisfaction in biological mothers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0265407512462681">Cox et al., 1999</xref>). Low levels of marital satisfaction have also been linked to excessive drinking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0265407512462681">Leonard &amp; Eiden, 2007</xref>) and alcohol problems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0265407512462681">Whisman, Uebelacker, &amp; Bruce, 2006</xref>), which in turn are also linked to the level of depression of self and the partner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0265407512462681">Homish, Leonard, &amp; Kearns-Bodkin, 2006</xref>). Indeed, a spouse’s mental illness is negatively related to his or her partner’s level of marital satisfaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0265407512462681">South, Krueger, &amp; Iacono, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0265407512462681">Whisman, Uebelacker, &amp; Weinstock, 2004</xref>). Finally, marital satisfaction has strong links with a variety of health-related variables (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0265407512462681">Kiecolt-Glaser &amp; Newton, 2001</xref>). In the current study, we examined the following vulnerability factors: demographic factors (age, ethnicity, religion, SES, income, education, and relationship duration); physical health (body mass index (BMI)); and mental health (depression, drinking, and history of mental illness) of the respondents and their partners, including the risk factors that form a commonly used inventory of postpartum depression, modified for adoptive mothers (e.g., self-esteem and family support).</p>

<sec id="section4-0265407512462681">
<title>Adaptive processes</title>
<p>Variables that are typically included in the adaptive processes domain include couple communication, behavioral interaction, commitment, and support (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0265407512462681">Karney &amp; Bradbury, 1995</xref>). Given the topic of the current study, we focused on aspects of the relationship that may be particularly important for adoptive couples. We examined the participant’s perception of her partner’s willingness to becoming a parent per se, as well as enthusiasm regarding becoming an adoptive parent, as measures of commitment and relationship expectations within the context of adoption. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0265407512462681">Goldberg et al. (2010</xref>) found no relationship between equal commitment to adoption and relationship satisfaction, although they acknowledged that the lack of a significant finding may have been a result of the way the question was operationalized and the fact that they failed to ask about commitment to parenting generally. It is also possible that one spouse’s commitment to adoption would have a main effect on his or her partner’s satisfaction. We also included level of support from one’s partner as a part of the adaptive process domain, as research has shown that the partner’s support is predictive of an easier transition to parenthood among adoptive parents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0265407512462681">Levy-Shiff et al., 1991</xref>). In summary, variables measured for the adaptive process domain included a measure of partner support, enthusiasm of partner to being a parent, and enthusiasm of partner to being an adoptive parent.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0265407512462681">
<title>Stressors</title>
<p>Our measures of the stressful context also centered largely on the adoption process. Clearly, the parenting role is an important stressor in any marriage, biological or adoptive; for adoptive parents, a history of infertility, previous failed attempts at adopting, and the intensive scrutiny of the adoption process may be additional stressors above and beyond those encountered by biological parents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0265407512462681">Brodzinsky &amp; Huffman, 1988</xref>). Type of adoption may also predict marital satisfaction, as previous research found that parents of international adoptees had more cohesive family relations and a higher degree of marital adjustment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0265407512462681">Levy-Shiff, Zoran, &amp; Shulman, 1997</xref>). Other adoption factors may include the total number of adopted children and the age of the child at adoption (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0265407512462681">Bird, Peterson, &amp; Miller, 2002</xref>). Finally, we included measures of expectations of themselves as parents, of their adopted child, of friends and family, and society, as the disconnect between expectations and reality may be particularly salient for adoptive parents and contribute to depressive symptoms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0265407512462681">Foli, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0265407512462681">Levy-Shiff et al., 1991</xref>). Our study collected the following measures of stress that were related to the specific parenting context of this sample: adoption-related (e.g., type of adoption, expectations), specific to the adopted child (e.g., special needs known or unknown, bonding), and parenting attempts (e.g., infertility). Finally, we included an item measuring amount of rest, as fatigue is common in new parents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0265407512462681">McQueen &amp; Mander, 2003</xref>) and has been linked to new mothers’ marital satisfaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0265407512462681">Elek, Hudson, &amp; Fleck, 2002</xref>), as well as an overall count of more general life stressors.</p>

<sec id="section6-0265407512462681">
<title>Current study</title>
<p>We examined predictors of relationship satisfaction among a sample of currently married and/or cohabitating mothers who had adopted a child within the past 2 years. There is a relative paucity of research on the experiences of adoptive parents in the postadoption period, particularly with regard to relationship functioning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0265407512462681">McKay, Ross, &amp; Goldberg, 2010</xref>). This is a significant gap in the literature, given the large number of children in the US now living with adoptive parents. The detrimental effects that marital distress and instability can have on both general parental well-being and children’s adjustment necessitate identifying the areas that prevention and intervention efforts should focus on in adoptive parents.</p>
<p>Our aim was to reach and sample as many adoptive parents as we could. To do this, we used a web-based survey design targeted at adoptive parents. Web surveys targeted at relevant populations are increasingly used to study specific populations and in psychological research more generally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0265407512462681">Gosling &amp; Johnson, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0265407512462681">Gosling, Vazire, Srivastava, &amp; John, 2004</xref>). Any limitations of this type of methodology are outweighed by the advantages of reaching populations that are often difficult to sample from. Survey measures included several variables that have not previously been tested together in one sample. This allowed for a broader analysis of relevant variables and the ability to test multivariate models to compare the relative value of these predictors. We expected that enduring vulnerabilities, particularly symptoms of depression, would be the strongest negative predictor of marital satisfaction in adoptive parents, followed by variables related to the stressful context of the adoption process.</p>

<sec id="section8-0265407512462681">
<title>Participants and procedure</title>
<p>Data for the current study were drawn from a larger project examining the epidemiology and predictors of mental health in adoptive parents. Participants were recruited for the larger study through a Web site of a nonprofit organization dedicated to education and resources for adoptive families. Individuals could access the study directly from a link on the organization’s home web page; additionally, a recruitment e-mail was sent to the organization’s membership list. From the e-mail or webpage, potential participants were directed to the information/informed consent page for the current study. All measures were completed through the Qualtrics survey software.</p>
<p>Inclusion criteria as listed on the study webpage included having internet access, being able to read, understand, and respond to questions in English, and having adopted a child in the last 12 months. A total of 263 respondents meeting these criteria enrolled in the study; however, many individuals who had adopted a child more than 12 months ago also enrolled in the study. Given that our initial criterion of 12 months was somewhat arbitrary, we broadened the time frame to include those who had adopted between 12 and 24 months (<italic>N</italic> = 75), for a total of 338 individuals. We limited the current analyses to individuals who reported that they were currently married or partnered (<italic>N</italic> = 287). The number of men completing the survey (<italic>N</italic> = 36) was small in proportion to the number of women; so for the purposes of the current article, we also limited analyses to 251 mothers who reported being married (<italic>N</italic> = 246) or in a committed romantic relationship (<italic>N</italic> = 5). The sample was predominantly Caucasian (90%), and financially comfortable, with almost half of the respondents reporting incomes of $75,000 or above. On average, participants were just over 40 years old (<italic>M</italic> = 40.3, <italic>SD</italic> = 6.7). Most participants had completed some college (57%) or postgraduate degrees (35%). Only 6% of the sample reported a history of a mental illness. All the participants received a $10 gift card as compensation for their participation. The study was approved by the University’s Institutional Review Board.</p>

Second, participants completed the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Screening Scale (EPDS; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0265407512462681">Cox, Holden, &amp; Sagovsky, 1987</xref>), a 10-item self-report inventory used to assess for postpartum depression, with total scores ranging from 0 to 30. The EPDS was adapted for the current study by adding the word “child” to the instructions. Alphas in the current sample were .94 for the CES-D and .88 for the EPDS. Third, the participant was queried as to history of mental illness (<italic>yes</italic>/<italic>no</italic>). Mental health of the participant’s partner was asked with a one-item measure of history of mental illness (<italic>yes</italic>/<italic>no</italic>). Finally, we used several items from the Postpartum Depression Predictors Inventory-Revised (PDPI-R; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0265407512462681">Beck, Records, &amp; Rice, 2006</xref>). The PDPI-R is an instrument designed to assess risk factors for postpartum depression; it has demonstrated adequate reliability and concurrent, construct, and predictive validity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0265407512462681">Records, Rice, &amp; Beck, 2007</xref>). The PDPI-R was adapted for this study in the following manner: (1) online self-report administration was used instead of a clinical interview, and (2) the wording of items was changed from “infant” to include “child” and from “pregnancy” to “adoption.” The PDPI-R consists of both single-item measures and multiple-item scales. Scale scores were created by summing the responses to the individual items. For instance, we scored the self-esteem scale (ranging from 0 to 3, with higher scores equaling greater self-esteem) by assigning a score of 1 to an answer of <italic>Yes</italic> to each of three items: <italic>Do you feel good about yourself? Do you feel worthwhile? Do you have good qualities?</italic> We used the single-item measures of depression, anxiety, history of depression, and postadoption blues and the scale scores for self-esteem, family support, and friend support, as measures of enduring vulnerabilities. More information on the PDPI-R can be found elsewhere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0265407512462681">Beck et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0265407512462681">Oppo et al., 2009</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section14-0265407512462681">
<title>Other health-related variables</title>
<p>Items were included to assess how much the participant currently drank (<italic>No drink</italic>, <italic>1</italic>–<italic>2 drinks per week</italic>, <italic>3</italic>–<italic>4 drinks per week</italic>, and <italic>more than 4 drinks per week</italic>) and current BMI (a composite created by querying <italic>height</italic> and <italic>weight</italic>).</p>
</sec>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section15-0265407512462681">
<title>Adaptive processes</title>
<p>The following adaptive process variables were assessed: partner’s enthusiasm about being a parent (coded as 1 = <italic>Very unenthusiastic</italic> and 5 = <italic>Very enthusiastic</italic>) and partner’s enthusiasm about being an adoptive parent (coded as 1 = <italic>Very unenthusiastic</italic> and 5 = <italic>Very enthusiastic</italic>). We also measured partner support using the Partner Support scale of the PDPI-R. This scale is a sum score of four items; for the current study, each item was scored <italic>Yes</italic> = 1/<italic>No</italic> = 0, such that higher scores reflected more support: <italic>Do you believe that you receive adequate emotional support from your partner? Do you believe that you can confide in your partner? Do you believe that you can rely on your partner? Do you believe that you receive adequate instrumental support from your partner?</italic>

<title>Stressful context</title>
<sec id="section17-0265407512462681">
<title>Aspects of adoption</title>
<p>We collected information on a number of aspects of the adoption process, including type of adoption (coded <italic>public domestic</italic>, <italic>private domestic</italic> and <italic>private/independent</italic>), birthplace/ethnicity of the adopted child, age of the adopted child, whether the adopted child had any special needs (either known or unknown before adoption), length of time adopted child had been in the home (in months), and length of time spent waiting for the adopted child. Also included was the PDPI-R scale of Unplanned Adoption, which consisted of two items: <italic>Was the adoption planned?</italic> (scored <italic>Yes</italic> = 0/<italic>No</italic> = 1) and <italic>Was the adoption unwanted?</italic> (scored <italic>Yes</italic> = 1/<italic>No</italic> = 0).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section18-0265407512462681">
<title>Parenting/parenting attempts</title>
<p>Participants reported on total number of children (adopted and biological) in the household, previous attempts to have a biological child (<italic>yes/no</italic>) or previous failed attempts to adopt a different child (<italic>yes/no</italic>), and history of fertility treatments (<italic>yes/no</italic>). The PDPI-R was used to measure Child Care Stress and Infant Temperament. Child Care Stress is a scale ranging from 0 to 3, as assessed by three items querying on health problems, feeding problems, and sleeping problems of the child. The Infant Temperament scale ranges from 0 to 3 and includes three items assessing whether the child is irritable, cries often, and/or is difficult to soothe. All items are scored as <italic>Yes</italic> = 1/<italic>No</italic> = 0, such that higher scores equaled greater child stress and worse temperament.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section19-0265407512462681">
<title>Bonding</title>
<p>Participants responded to the questions “My child is able to bond with me” and “My child is able to bond with my partner/spouse” (<italic>yes/no</italic>). Additionally, all participants completed the Mother-to-Infant Bonding Scale (MIB; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0265407512462681">Taylor, Atkins, Kumar, Adams, &amp; Glover, 2005</xref>), a self-report measure of mother-to-infant bonding that includes eight questions measured on a 4-point Likert scale: loving, resentful, neutral or felt nothing, joyful, dislike, protective, disappointed, and aggressive. The measure had acceptable internal reliability (Cronbach’s alpha of .90) in our sample. The wording of the scale was adapted to include “child” as well as “infant.”</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section20-0265407512462681">
<title>Expectations</title>
<p>Participants rated level of agreement to: “I was prepared to adopt this child” “I expected to be a better parent,” “I expected parenting this child would be easier,” “My family and friends have responded to my adopting a child in the way I expected them to,” “I received the information I needed about this child,” and “Society has accepted us as an adoptive family.” All questions were on a scale from 1 = <italic>Strongly Agree</italic> to 5 = <italic>Strongly Disagree</italic> scale. These items were drawn from Foli’s Mid-Range Theory of Parental Postadoption Depression and were found to be predictive of depressive symptoms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0265407512462681">Foli, South, &amp; Lim, 2012</xref>).</p>

<sec id="section21-0265407512462681">
<title>Other stressors</title>
<p>One item measured whether the participant felt rested upon waking (1 = <italic>Strongly Disagree to </italic> 5 = <italic>Strongly Agree</italic>). Occurrence of the following life stressors from the List of Threatening Experiences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0265407512462681">Brugha, Bebbington, Tennant, &amp; Hurry, 1985</xref>) in the past year was also measured: suffered a serious injury accident or illness; serious injury, accident or illness to a close friend; lost a close friend; serious problem with a close friend, relative, or neighbor; problems with police; and something valued was lost/stolen.</p>

<title>Analytic strategy</title>
<p>Our general analytic strategy was to use multiple regression to determine the strongest predictors of marital satisfaction. As a first step, descriptive statistics were conducted for all study variables, including means, <italic>SD</italic>s, and reliability coefficients. If a respondent completed at least 75% of items of the DAS-7, CES-D, EPDS, and MIB, the researchers substituted any missing item with item-mean value. Next, we conducted bivariate analyses using ordinary least-square (OLS) regressions or one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) between each independent predictor variable and marital satisfaction. The DAS-7 scores were transformed with a square transformation to satisfy model assumptions of univariate normality. All variables that were significantly associated with marital satisfaction at <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05 were utilized for the multiple regression analyses. Variables were entered into a series of regressions in order to identify the strongest predictors of marital satisfaction. Enduring vulnerabilities, adaptive process variables, and stress variables that demonstrated significant bivariate associations with relationship satisfaction were entered into three separate regressions, by domain, predicting DAS score. A final model included the significant predictors from the three separate domain regressions. A total of 10 subjects were not included in the final model due to missing data.<sup>

<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0265407512462681">Table 1</xref> presents the overall frequencies or means and <italic>SD</italic>s of the predictor variables as well as DAS-7 score. While the means for the CES-D (<italic>M</italic> = 11.1, <italic>SD</italic> = 10.5) and EPDS (<italic>M</italic> = 6.8, <italic>SD</italic> = 5.4) were relatively low, 26% (<italic>N</italic> = 66) of participants were classified as depressed according to the CES-D cut off of 16, and 19% (<italic>N</italic> = 48) were classified as depressed according to the EPDS cut-off of 12. The average length of marriage was 13.2 years (<italic>SD</italic> = 6.9) for the married couples; data on the length of current relationship for the five “partnered” subjects was missing. The average DAS-7 score for participants (<italic>M</italic> = 26.8, <italic>SD</italic> = 5.3) was comparable with means found in nondistressed, community samples of heterosexual couples (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0265407512462681">Hunsley et al., 2001</xref>). Most of the samples reported that their partner was enthusiastic (30%) or very enthusiastic (60%) about being an adoptive parent. More than half of the participants had adopted a child born outside the US (59%) through a private or independent adoption (55%). The ethnicity of the adopted child was fairly evenly split between Caucasian (28%), African/Black American (27%), Asian/Pacific Islander (26%), or other (20%). The adopted child was almost 5 years old, on average (<italic>M</italic> = 4.6, <italic>SD</italic> = 4.3), and had been in the home for an average of 9.5 months (<italic>SD</italic> = 5.4). Unsuccessful attempts to have a child birth were reported by 42% of the sample, and 36% of participants reported a history of infertility treatments.</p>

<title>Bivariate associations between predictors and relationship satisfaction</title>
<p>Associations between marital satisfaction and variables from the domains of enduring vulnerabilities, adaptive processes, and stressful events were explored with bivariate statistics. A series of regressions (for continuous predictors) and one-way ANOVAs (for categorical variables) were conducted (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0265407512462681">Table 1</xref>). As shown, several variables were significantly related to the DAS-7 score. Of the enduring vulnerabilities variables, SES was significantly related to DAS-7 (B = 106.41,<italic> F</italic> = 5.67, <italic>p</italic> = .02), with the highest DAS-7 scores found in those reporting high SES. The depression and depression risk items demonstrated the strongest bivariate associations with DAS-7 scores; CES-D (B = −10.69, <italic>F</italic> = 56.61, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .0001) and EPDS scores (B = −19.32, <italic>F</italic> = 47.07, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .0001) were significantly negatively related to marital satisfaction with lower marital satisfaction found in those at high levels of depression. All three of the adaptive process variables, enthusiasm of partner to be a parent (B = 147.39, <italic>F</italic> = 37.56, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .0001), enthusiasm to be an adoptive parent (B = 110.56, <italic>F</italic> = 30.86, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .0001), and PDPI-R Partner Support (B = 153.75, <italic>F</italic> = 125.82, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .0001), were significantly related to DAS-7 score, with greater enthusiasm and more support associated with higher levels of satisfaction. Several risk factors from the stress domain were related to marital satisfaction, including age of the adopted child, PDPI-R Unplanned Adoption, total number of adopted children in the house, PDPI-R Child Care Stress and Infant Temperament, perceptions of partner’s bonding, MIB scale score, almost all expectation items, and feeling of rest.</p>

<title>Regression analyses predicting relationship satisfaction</title>
<p>We used a series of multiple regressions to determine the strongest predictors of relationship satisfaction. Before conducting the regression analyses, we assessed for multicollinearity. There were no predictors with high multicollinearity. All bivariate correlations were less than or equal to 0.70. The 26 variables that demonstrated significant bivariate associations (at <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05) with the DAS-7 were used in four multivariate regressions. First, the ten enduring vulnerability variables that demonstrated significant bivariate relationships with satisfaction were entered into a regression predicting DAS score. Two variables, SES and PDPI-R anxiety, were significant and the model explained 23% of the variance. A regression including the three adaptive process variables explained 36% of the variance and resulted in two significant predictors—PDPI-R Partner Support and enthusiasm of partner to be an adoptive parent. Finally, a regression including the stress variables explained 24% of the variance and included two significant predictors, total number of adopted children and feelings of rest. A final model was run including all of the significant predictors from these three individual regressions. This final model explained 46% of the variance in marital satisfaction. In the final regression model, the following variables were significant individual predictors of relationship satisfaction: SES, PDPI-R Partner Support, enthusiasm of partner in being an adoptive parent, and feeling of rest (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0265407512462681">Table 2</xref>). Higher reported SES, more partner support, more partner enthusiasm, and higher levels of rest were all related to better relationship satisfaction.<sup>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>A large body of research has examined the marital satisfaction of biological parents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0265407512462681">Cowan &amp; Cowan, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0265407512462681">Cox et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0265407512462681">Doss et al., 2009</xref>), but there is a dearth of concomitant research into relationship satisfaction of adoptive parents. In the current study, we assessed relationship satisfaction in mothers who had adopted a child with their spouse or partner within the past 24 months. Following the VSA model of marital satisfaction and stability, we measured risk factors from the domains of enduring vulnerabilities, adaptive processes, and stressful contexts, focusing on variables specific to the adoption process. The final regression model explained 46% of the variance in relationship distress and included the following items (from the three VSA domains): SES (enduring vulnerabilities), partner support and enthusiasm of partner in being an adoptive parent (adaptive processes), and feelings of rest (stressful context).</p>
<p>In the final regression model, SES was the only significant predictor of satisfaction from the vulnerabilities domain. Two of the predictors in the domain of adaptive processes, enthusiasm of partner in being an adoptive parent and partner support, were significantly related to satisfaction. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0265407512462681">Goldberg et al. (2010</xref>) found that the discrepancies in commitment to adoptive parenting did not predict marital functioning. Our findings suggest that it is a wife’s overall perception of her partner’s enthusiasm in being an adoptive parent that matters for her own marital satisfaction. Certainly this finding will need to be replicated in future studies with adoptive parents, but we can draw parallels with research that finds planned pregnancies are associated with less decline in marital satisfaction in biological parents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0265407512462681">Doss et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0265407512462681">Lawrence et al., 2008</xref>). Just as planned birth pregnancies may represent a greater commitment and desire to parent at that time, this item in our study may have been tapping the perception that one’s partner was ready and enthusiastic about becoming an adoptive parent when it happened. Previous research has also shown that social support (broadly defined and including aspects of partner support) predicts a better transition to parenthood for adoptive parents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0265407512462681">Levy-Shiff et al., 1991</xref>), but to our knowledge this is the first time that partner support has been directly related to marital satisfaction in adoptive parents. Thus, marital interventions with adoptive parent couples will particularly want to focus on increasing husband support for mothers. One predictor from the stressful context domain was significantly associated with marital satisfaction—feelings of rest. Findings with regard to rest should not be surprising, given that the parents in this sample were frequently dealing with multiple children in the household. Previous research has linked fatigue and tiredness to relationship satisfaction in a sample of new postpartum mothers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0265407512462681">Elek et al., 2002</xref>). This association appears to generalize to new adoptive mothers as well.</p>
<p>What is particularly striking about our findings are the variables that were <italic>not</italic> significantly related to marital satisfaction in the final regression model. Even though depression was significantly, negatively related to marital satisfaction in the bivariate analyses, depression was not a significant predictor in the final regression model. It is possible that mental health is less important for relationship satisfaction of adoptive mothers than other factors; it is also possible that in this sample, the direction of effect may be from an unsupportive or distressed marital relationship to poor mental health (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0265407512462681">Semyr, Edhborg, Lundh, &amp; Sjogren, 2004</xref>). Type of adoption was unrelated to marital satisfaction, although it must be acknowledged that we failed to assess for the degree of openness of the adoption. Another notable aspect of the data was the lack of association between marital satisfaction and several hypothesized predictors unique to adoptive parents. Even though it is assumed that infertility, infertility treatment, and a history of failed adoptions may place adoptive parents at greater risk of marital distress, we found no evidence of associations between these variables and marital satisfaction. It is important to note that we did not assess the level of distress related to infertility; recent research suggests that it is not the time spent on infertility treatments but how much adoptive mothers are bothered by infertility that predicts depressive symptoms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0265407512462681">Mott, Schiller, Richards, O’Hara, &amp; Stuart, 2011</xref>), and it is possible that distress surrounding infertility might be a significant predictor of marital satisfaction. It is also possible that those individuals who were most distressed about infertility may be less likely to adopt, and therefore not represented in the current sample. In general, our findings suggest that marital satisfaction in adoptive mothers is relatively robust to these stressful risk factors.</p>
<p>There was considerable overlap in the factors that predict marital satisfaction in our sample of adoptive mothers and what has been found previously for biological mothers. Of the significant variables in the final regression model, one was SES, one was a measure of partner support and one measured feelings of rest. These are all risk factors seen in biological parents, suggesting more similarities than differences in the challenges faced by adoptive and biological mothers. There was, however, a variable unique to the adoption experience: enthusiasm of partner in being an adoptive parent. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0265407512462681">Levy-Shiff et al. (1991</xref>) found that social support was a significant predictor of the transition to parenting for adoptive, but not biological, parents. The adoptive mothers in our sample may have felt that they were not being supported by their partners. The most obvious implication from our findings would suggest that adoptive mothers need similar types of prevention and intervention efforts as biological mothers, particularly efforts that target partner support.</p>
<p>This study has some limitations. It relied on a sample obtained through an online adoption organization. The final sample was also predominantly Caucasian and consisted only of adoptive mothers. This may limit the generalizability of the findings to the broader population of adoptive parents in the US. Moreover, we relied on self-report data from one member of the couple; future research should endeavor to collect information from both members of the dyad, as well as more objective measures of mental health and well-being (e.g., structured interviews for symptoms of mental illness as well as general functioning). The current study did not collect information on the gender of the adopted child, which previous research has shown is related to relationship satisfaction at the transition to parenthood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0265407512462681">Cox et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0265407512462681">Elek, Hudson, &amp; Bouffard, 2003</xref>). Even though our study examined the influence of certain adaptive processes, including relationship expectations and mutual partner support, two of these variables were one-item measures and further research is needed, which utilizes more comprehensive measures (self-report and observational) of these adaptive processes as well as measures of couple communication and conflict. Finally, because all data collected for this study were measured at one point in time, we were unable to tease out the direction of effect (i.e., distressed marriages may have led to greater depression) or examine what types of preadoption factors predicted changes in marital satisfaction from pre- to postadoption. Future research should endeavor to measure changes in marital satisfaction of adoptive parents from pre- to postadoption and determine whether changes are the functions of pre- or post-adoption risk factors.</p>
<p>In summary, the current study provided important information on predictors of relationship satisfaction in a sample of adoptive mothers. To our knowledge, this study collected the largest sample to date of adoptive mothers reporting on relationship satisfaction. The strongest predictors included SES, partner’s support and willingness to be an adoptive parent, and feelings of rest. We hope that future research builds on our findings and continues to identify the most important risk factors for prevention and intervention efforts with maritally distressed adoptive parents.</p>

<p> We also reran the analysis using multiple imputation (MI) to estimate missing data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0265407512462681">Johnson et al., 2008</xref>). With MI, each missing value is replaced by a set of simulated values that incorporate the uncertainty about the correct value to impute. A total of five imputed data sets were generated and the results averaged. Results of the analyses using imputation were virtually identical (i.e., the final model included the same significant variables). Full results are available from the first author.</p>

<p> We also conducted a stepwise regression analyses in which all the 26 variables that demonstrated significant bivariate associations (at <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05) with the DAS-7 were entered into the model simultaneously. In the stepwise regression, variables are retained or removed from the final model in a step-by-step iterative process that involves automatic selection of independent variables; final variables in the model are selected based on the percentage of variance explained. The results of this analysis were almost identical. The final model explained 44% of the variance and included the following predictors: socioeconomic status, Postpartum Depression Predictors Inventory-Revised Partner Support, enthusiasm of partner in being an adoptive parent, acceptance of society, and feeling of rest.</p>
