<abstract>
<p>This study aimed at answering the question whether preferences for negative content and a tabloid production style in television news stories vary with different age groups and gender. An experiment with 288 participants was conducted. As expected, results showed that age and gender moderated the influence of negative content and tabloid packaging on the viewers’ preferences. Compared with middle-aged and older viewers, young viewers had a stronger preference for negative content rather than neutral content. Preferences for tabloid packaging rather than standard packaging were stronger for men than for women.</p>

<p>Over the past years, news reporting has been criticized in both the United States (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0093650211414559">Gore, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0093650211414559">Jones, 2009</xref>) and a number of Western European countries (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0093650211414559">Blair, 2007</xref>). According to the critics, news reporting has become increasingly aimed at catching the viewer’s attention, in particular by featuring more negative news and by applying a flashier production style. This criticism has mainly been investigated in the context of television news. Studies conducted in various countries have shown that over time, television news stories have been displaying more negative content and that they have more often become packaged in a tabloid style (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0093650211414559">Hendriks Vettehen, Nuijten, &amp; Beentjes, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0093650211414559">Hjarvard, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0093650211414559">Hvitfelt, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0093650211414559">Slattery, Doremus, &amp; Marcus, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0093650211414559">Slattery &amp; Hakanen, 1994</xref>). This may, at least in part, be due to economic pressures from cable news and deregulation in especially the United States (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0093650211414559">Bucy &amp; Grabe, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0093650211414559">Hallin, 1992</xref>) and the entrance of commercial channels in Europe (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0093650211414559">Hendriks Vettehen, et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0093650211414559">Hjarvard, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0093650211414559">Hvitfelt, 1994</xref>).</p>
<p>A variety of questions concerning the changes in content and form of television news have been studied (for an overview, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0093650211414559">Kleemans &amp; Hendriks Vettehen, 2009</xref>), but one issue has received very little attention. This is whether negative content in news stories and the packaging of these stories in a tabloid style are suitable means to gain or to maintain the television viewer’s favor, something that many news critics seem to assume. Answering this question is important for news producers as they want both frequent and potential viewers to choose their program over other news programs and to choose it again the next time. To reach this end, news producers might vary the amount of negative content and the number of tabloid features in their newscasts—if they knew it would work. Against this background, this study examines viewer preferences for content and form of television news stories. The term “preferences” refers to the type of news content and form that viewers would watch if they had a choice.</p>
<p>In particular, this study asks whether preferences for negative content and tabloid packaging are different for viewers varying in age and gender. In the United States, competition between the national network news programs, local news programs, and cable news has led to a considerable degree of product differentiation, thus reflecting differences in interests and tastes between specific audiences (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0093650211414559">Bae, 2000</xref>). Also, in Europe, the emergence of local news programs and the emergence of news programs aiming at specific age categories illustrate that targeting specific viewer categories has become a strategy that many news programs apply. Against this background, an important question is how specific viewer categories respond to negative content and a tabloid style of news packaging. This study will focus on age and gender as possible moderators, as in the Dutch context where this research was conducted, especially young viewers and women are less frequent news viewers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0093650211414559">Huysmans &amp; De Haan, 2010</xref>).</p>

<title>Negative Content, Tabloid Packaging, and Viewer Preferences</title>
<p>As the label “negative content” implies, the category comprises aspects of news content that have a negative valence. Examples include stories and pictures about crimes, violence, riots, fires, accidents, and disasters (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0093650211414559">Hendriks Vettehen, Nuijten, &amp; Peeters, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0093650211414559">Newhagen &amp; Reeves, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0093650211414559">Reeves, Newhagen, Maibach, Basil, &amp; Kurz, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0093650211414559">Slattery &amp; Hakanen, 1994</xref>). The label “tabloid packaging” refers to aspects of the form of the news. Pacing (i.e., number of camera shots) is the most studied tabloid feature. Other examples of tabloid packaging features are sound effects, rapid point-of-view movement camera techniques, and decorative editing techniques such as wipes, fades, and dissolves (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0093650211414559">Grabe, Lang, &amp; Zhao, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0093650211414559">Grabe, Zhou, Lang, &amp; Bolls, 2000b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0093650211414559">Hendriks Vettehen, et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0093650211414559">Lang, Bolls, Potter, &amp; Kawahara, 1999</xref>). The presence of some tabloid features may vary between countries. For instance, the obtrusiveness of the reporter’s voice tone is a tabloid feature in U.S. broadcast news (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0093650211414559">Grabe et al., 2003</xref>) that is virtually absent from newscasts in countries such as Germany and the Netherlands.</p>
<p>A number of studies have shown that negative content and tabloid packaging elicit attention and arousal responses in viewers (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0093650211414559">Grabe et al., 2000b</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0093650211414559">2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0093650211414559">Hendriks Vettehen, et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0093650211414559">Lang et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0093650211414559">Lang, Newhagen, &amp; Reeves, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0093650211414559">Reeves et al., 1991</xref>). Studies have also reported that negative content and tabloid features are related to concepts with a more evaluative character such as liking and enjoyment (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0093650211414559">Hendriks Vettehen, et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0093650211414559">Kamhawi &amp; Grabe, 2008</xref>). From these studies, one might be tempted to conclude that negative content and tabloid packaging are well-suited means to gain or to maintain the viewer’s favor. However, such a conclusion would be premature. Although attention, arousal, liking, and enjoyment may be related to preferences, they are conceptually different. The concepts of attention and arousal refer to viewer responses while watching a story (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0093650211414559">Lang, 1990</xref>), and the concepts of liking and enjoyment refer to viewer evaluations of the story or viewing experience (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0093650211414559">Nabi &amp; Krcmar, 2004</xref>). In contrast, viewing preferences refers to the viewer’s choice behavior, analogous to the conceptualization of preferences in theories of decision making (for instance, prospect theory, cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0093650211414559">Kahneman &amp; Tversky, 1979</xref>). Therefore, answering the question whether negative content in news stories and the packaging of these stories in a tabloid style are suitable means to gain or to maintain the television viewer’s favor involves a study of preferences.</p>

<title>Age-Related Preferences for Negative Content and Tabloid Packaging</title>
<p>Over the past few years, some European countries have witnessed the rise of news programs that specifically aim at young viewers. In Flanders (the Dutch-speaking part of Belgium), two news programs, <italic>Zoom</italic> and <italic>Jam</italic>, are aimed at adolescents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0093650211414559">Vandebosch, Dhoest, &amp; van den Bulck, 2009</xref>). In the Netherlands, the news program <italic>Journaal op 3</italic> is targeted at young adults (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0093650211414559">NOS, 2007</xref>). These programs have emerged in response to the lowered interest in traditional news among young people. They illustrate a belief among journalists that young people have different news preferences compared with older people.</p>
<p>A study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0093650211414559">Gauntlett and Hill (1999)</xref> provides some support for this belief. Gauntlett and Hill characterized the top 10 of programs for adults aged 55 and above as sharing a kind of gentleness. These programs did not tend to feature large amounts of violence, sex, or bad language, and they often had light, pleasant, nostalgic, and middle-class themes. More specifically, regarding news programs, a study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0093650211414559">The Pew Research Center for the People &amp; the Press (2008)</xref> showed that news about crimes drew more interest among people below 50 than among people above 50 years of age. In line with this, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0093650211414559">Klein (2003)</xref> found that senior citizens who were well in their 70s were less likely than middle school, high school, and college students to report that they watched the news because of their interest in stories with violent content. Furthermore, the seniors were more likely to report that they turned off the news because of violent content.</p>
<p>The <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0093650211414559">Gauntlett and Hill (1999)</xref> finding suggests that older viewers generally prefer positive content over negative content. However, the two studies regarding news preferences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0093650211414559">Klein, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0093650211414559">The Pew Research Center for the People &amp; the Press, 2008</xref>) merely showed that older viewers experience problems with content that is morally objective (i.e., violence and crime) and that consequently might evoke fear, anger, and disgust. They do not tell whether older viewers also tend to avoid other examples of negative news content (e.g., accidents, natural disasters), which may also evoke somewhat different emotions. Still, together the studies provide good reasons to expect the following:</p>
<list id="list1-0093650211414559" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p><italic>Hypothesis 1</italic>: Young people have a stronger preference for negative content over neutral content than older people.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>The European news programs that specifically aim at young viewers distinguish themselves from regular news programs not only in content but also regarding its form. To attract young viewers, news is packaged in a flashy, attractive, and contemporary fashion that is stylistically different from the adult news (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0093650211414559">NOS, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0093650211414559">Vandebosch et al., 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Theoretical support for these news programs’ strategies is offered by the activation model of information exposure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0093650211414559">Donohew, Lorch, &amp; Palmgreen, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0093650211414559">Donohew, Palmgreen, &amp; Duncan, 1980</xref>) and, in particular, by those elements of the model that are based on Zuckerman’s sensation-seeking theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0093650211414559">Zuckerman, 1994</xref>). According to the activation model, media consumers generally prefer a level of stimulation that provides them with a level of arousal that makes them feel comfortable. However, individuals differ in their need for arousal. In contrast to people low in need for arousal (the so-called low sensation seekers), people high in need for arousal (high sensation seekers) seek varied, novel, complex, and intense sensations and experiences and have the willingness to take risks for the sake of such experiences. Sensation seeking has been shown to peak in adolescence and to decline with age thereafter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0093650211414559">Zuckerman, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0093650211414559">Zuckerman, Eysenck, &amp; Eysenck, 1978</xref>), suggesting that younger viewers have higher needs for arousal. According to the activation model, structural features in media messages (i.e., fast action, novelty, and stimulus intensity) provide arousal. Moreover, structural features in news stories have been shown to generate arousal (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0093650211414559">Grabe et al., 2000b</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0093650211414559">2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0093650211414559">Lang et al., 1999</xref>). Consequently, it may be expected that younger viewers feel more attracted to the structural features that are included in tabloid-packaged news stories.</p>
<p>Two recent studies provide mixed support for the argument that younger viewers are attracted to a flashy style in news reporting. An online survey focusing on Flemish adolescent newscasts showed that young viewers (10 to 18 years) considered the form of these newscasts appropriate for a newscast aimed at young people (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0093650211414559">Vandebosch et al., 2009</xref>). In addition, a study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0093650211414559">Lang et al. (2005)</xref> showed that young adults (18 to 22 years) had more positive evaluations for fast-paced news stories compared with slow-paced news stories irrespective of the story length, whereas older participants (25 to 81 years) had more positive evaluations for fast production only when the stories were long. However, both findings only concerned evaluations of flashy news reporting that at best may be considered predictors of preferences. Moreover, the Lang et al. study also featured a measure of preference itself: the time participants spent with a news story before switching to another channel. Remarkably, fast pacing did not increase the younger viewers’ time spent with the news stories.</p>
<p>To summarize, available evidence is inconclusive regarding tabloid packaging as a means to attract younger viewers. However, as theory suggests that tabloid packaging may help to attract younger viewers, the following is expected:</p>
<list id="list2-0093650211414559" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p><italic>Hypothesis 2</italic>: Younger people have a stronger preference for tabloid-packaged news stories over standard-packaged news stories than older people.</p></list-item>
</list>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0093650211414559">
<title>Gender-Related Preferences for Negative Content and Tabloid Packaging</title>
<p>A number of studies have shown that women react differently to negative news than men do. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0093650211414559">Slone (2000)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0093650211414559">Klein (2003)</xref> noted that women reported greater anxiety and worry in response to negative news stories then men. Also, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0093650211414559">Kamhawi and Grabe (2008)</xref> found that women reported greater enjoyment of positively framed news than negatively framed news and that the enjoyment for positive stories was greater compared with men. Men, in contrast, reported greater enjoyment of negatively framed news compared with positively framed news, and they enjoyed these negative stories more than women. Moreover, in a previous study, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0093650211414559">Grabe and Kamhawi (2006)</xref> showed that men reported higher arousal for negatively than for positively framed news, whereas for women, the opposite held true. For positive news, men rated the arousal elicited by these stories lower compared with women. However, women were more aroused by the negative stories than men were. Recognition memory and comprehension scores showed that men had better scores on negatively than on positively framed news, and women had better scores on positively than on negatively framed news. Men’s recognition memory and comprehension was better for negative news when compared with women, whereas women’s comprehension scores for positive news were higher compared with men. Kamhawi and Grabe explained their findings by assuming that women’s nurturing role compared with men’s protective function induces women to avoid negative stimuli, whereas men tend to approach negative stimuli.</p>
<p>None of these studies included a measure of preference. However, their findings show that compared with women, men experience less anxiety but more arousal and enjoyment while watching negative news stories. Moreover, they also appear to have less problems with processing negative news. Together, these findings provide reasons to expect the following:</p>
<list id="list3-0093650211414559" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p><italic>Hypothesis 3</italic>: Men have a stronger preference for negative content over neutral content than women.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>In this study, tabloid packaging is suggested to attract especially men. Studies on sensation seeking have shown that men are higher sensation seekers compared with women (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0093650211414559">Joinson &amp; Nettle, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0093650211414559">Zuckerman et al., 1978</xref>). Following the activation model, this implies that men have a higher need for arousal, which may be provided by tabloid packaging features in news stories (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0093650211414559">Donohew et al., 1980</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0093650211414559">1998</xref>).</p>
<p>As far as we have been able to ascertain, there has been no empirical research on gendered responses to form characteristics in television news stories. However, one study that included a variety of other television genres (i.e., sports, documentary, and drama) provides some clues as to the responses. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0093650211414559">Lombard, Reich, Grabe, Bracken, and Ditton (2000)</xref> found that men enjoyed the sense of movement in scenes more than women. In their study, the latter was simulated by featuring rapid point-of-view movements in scenes, including riding a roller coaster, driving an all-terrain vehicle, and flying a fighter jet. As a rapid point-of-view movement is a tabloid feature, the findings from the study support the idea that tabloid features attract men more than women. This leads to the following expectation:</p>
<list id="list4-0093650211414559" list-type="simple">

<title>Design</title>
<p>An experiment was conducted, using a 2 (content) × 2 (form) × 4 (group) × 3 (age) × 2 (gender) mixed design. Content was a within-subjects factor and had two levels: neutral and negative. Form was also a within-subjects factor with two levels: standard and tabloid. Group was a between-subjects factor and represents the four groups of newscasts that were used as stimulus materials in the experiment. Age (young, middle, and old) and gender (male and female) were also between-subjects factors.</p>
<p>According to this design, four groups of news stories were created. Each of these groups consisted of four news stories: one for each possible combination of the two types of content and the two types of form. Each participant watched the news stories of one group, that is, four different types of news stories (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0093650211414559">Table 1</xref>). Four news stories may be presented in 24 different orders. To account for order effects, each group of stories was watched by exactly 24 participants within each age category. As four groups of stories were constructed, 96 participants were recruited for each of the three age categories, resulting in a total of 288 participants. Male and female participants were divided almost equally over the different groups of news stories.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0093650211414559">1</xref></sup></p>

<title>Stimulus Materials</title>
<p>Sixteen news stories were selected as stimulus materials. The stories had been broadcast between September 2007 and March 2008 in the evening news program <italic>NOS Journaal</italic>, which is the most popular television news program in the Netherlands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0093650211414559">Costera Meijer, 2007</xref>). Stories were selected from a single news program to minimize the variance due to television channels or programs (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0093650211414559">Leshner, Reeves, &amp; Nass, 1998</xref>). The selection process of the stimulus materials involved four steps.</p>
<p>In the first step, news stories that were broadcast in the selected period were content analyzed by one of the researchers and a number of students (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0093650211414559">Hendriks Vettehen, d’Haenens, &amp; Kleemans, 2009</xref>). The intercoder reliability of the variables was estimated using Krippendorff’s alpha (α). Regarding the content of the news stories, coders coded the presence of a negative topic (e.g., violence, fire, accident, crime, or riots; α = .78) in the news story. Moreover, the number of camera shots including negative pictures (e.g., pictures of a fire, blood, or accident; α = .91) was counted. Related to the form of the news stories, the number of camera shots per minute (α = .97), music onsets per minute (α = .82), and the number of wipes (α = .65), dissolves (α = .60), and fades (α = 1.00) per minute were counted. The reliability of most variables was well above the .67 criterion for acceptable reliability and even above the .80 criterion for good reliability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0093650211414559">Krippendorff, 2004</xref>). Two exceptions concern the variables wipes and dissolves whose reliability was slightly below the .67 criterion. However, these relatively low scores may be explained by the skewed distribution of the indicators in combination with the relatively small reliability sample. Out of the pool of content-analyzed news stories, only those stories were selected that included either a negative story topic and negative pictures or no negative story topic and pictures. In addition, we selected those stories that included either a very small or a very large number of tabloid features. The rationale behind this selection was that we aimed to maximize the difference between the two types of content and the two types of form in the stimulus materials.</p>
<p>In the second step, the number of potentially useful news stories for the experiment was reduced by applying additional criteria to the remaining pool of news stories. In particular, only those stories were selected that (a) contained local news events, (b) had little variation in story duration, measured in seconds (<italic>M</italic> = 95.31, <italic>SD</italic> = 10.78), (c) did not include a positive topic, (d) did not include an extremely controversial topic, (e) had not received extraordinary media attention, and (f) did not contain production errors or a slip of the tongue by the reporter. Finally, no topics were selected that might be particularly relevant to the participants. For instance, all participants in this study came from the southeastern part of the Netherlands. We included only stories that contained events that took place in other parts of the country. At the end of the second step, we selected 16 stories (four in each combination of content and form) that met all the criteria as described and that could be matched pairwise based on the story topic. For instance, a standard-packaged negative story about a fire in a house was matched with a tabloid-packaged negative story about a fire in a museum. The same was done for the topics of the neutral news story categories (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0093650211414559">Table 1</xref>).</p>
<p>To enlarge the differences between the two types of content and the two types of form in the stimulus material, a few of the stories were edited in the third step. Some sound effects (e.g., the sound of sirens) were included in the tabloid stories and we added or excluded some camera shots. As a result, the number of camera shots per minute for standard stories (<italic>M</italic> = 7.79; <italic>SD</italic> = 0.56) differed significantly, <italic>t</italic>(7) = 10.73, <italic>p</italic> = .001, from the number of camera shots in tabloid stories (<italic>M</italic> = 14.08; <italic>SD</italic> = 1.26). Moreover, potential effects resulting from the variety of anchormen and women were eliminated. This was accomplished by replacing the anchorman’s introduction to the news story by a screen with a short, written introduction to the news story.</p>
<p>In the final step, a pilot study was conducted on 51 participants, varying in age and gender. The aim of the pilot was to test the expected negative and neutral valence of the content of the news stories. Participants were asked to rate the valence of the news stories on a scale ranging from 1 (<italic>negative</italic>) to 7 (<italic>positive</italic>). The mean scores for the neutral stories (<italic>M</italic> = 4.41; <italic>SD</italic> = 0.95) and negative stories (<italic>M</italic> = 2.85; <italic>SD</italic> = 0.81), and the significant difference between them, <italic>F</italic>(1, 14) = 12.27; <italic>p</italic> = .004; η<sup>2</sup> = .47, indicated that the news stories were correctly assigned to the neutral and the negative content categories.</p>

<title>Participants</title>
<p>The 288 participants were recruited by letter, email, or personal contact. All had a high level of education. To motivate people to participate, a number of gift coupons were raffled among the participants. To represent young viewers, 96 students from a university in the Netherlands were asked to participate in the experiment. The mean age of the young participants was 21.70 (<italic>SD</italic> = 2.05), with a range of 18 to 26 years. Of these, 68 were female and 28 male. To represent the middle-aged people, academic employees of the same university were asked to participate. The mean age of the middle-aged participants was 41.91 (<italic>SD</italic> = 4.85), with a range of 30 to 50 years. Of these, 56 were male and 40 were female. The oldest participants, with an age range of 60 to 89 years, were 96 former academic employees of the university or other highly educated elderly people. The mean age of the oldest participants was 68.82 (<italic>SD</italic> = 6.98), 56 were male and 40 were female.</p>

<sec id="section8-0093650211414559">
<title>Dependent Variables</title>
<p>To measure preferences, two measures were used to indicate the type of news content and form participants would watch if they had a choice: staying tuned and choosing. We decided to include two indicators instead of one to improve the reliability of the study findings.</p>
<sec id="section9-0093650211414559">
<title>Staying tuned</title>
<p>Participants were asked to indicate the probability in percentages that they would switch to another channel, if they were given the opportunity. As this measure is a negative indicator of preference, the likelihood to zap in percentages was subtracted from 100%. This resulted in the creation of a positive indicator of preference: “staying tuned” (<italic>M</italic> = 74.28; <italic>SD</italic> = 28.19).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-0093650211414559">
<title>Choosing</title>
<p>After seeing the four stories, the introductory frames of two of the stories were shown and the participants were asked to imagine that they could watch one of these two stories again. The question was to pick out the story of their preference. Participants had to make this choice six times, that is, for all six pairs that could be created out of four stories. To construct a measure, it was calculated how many times a participant chose each story. The possible scores on each story ranged from 0 (<italic>never chose this story</italic>) to 3 (<italic>always chose this story</italic>).</p>
</sec>

<sec id="section11-0093650211414559">
<title>Procedure</title>
<p>The experiment was held from November 2009 to February 2010. Participants took part in the experiment individually. Most of them came to a room at the university, which was equipped with a laptop on a desk and an office chair. Participants who were unable to come to the experimental room were visited at home or at their work place. Each participant watched the news stories on a 15.4 inch screen. Sound volume, distance to the screen (about 24 inches), and viewing angle were the same for each participant, except for a few elderly participants who had difficulties with seeing or hearing. For them, minor accommodations were made. A short introduction to the experiment was given by the researcher. Participants were asked to watch four different news stories as they would do at home and to answer a few questions after each story. Participants first had to answer a few general questions, for instance, about their age and gender. Next, the first story was started. After watching the story, participants had to answer the question regarding the probability of switching to another channel (the “staying tuned” measure). In addition, they had to answer a few more questions concerning their emotional response to the story and their evaluation of the story (e.g., credibility), before the next story was started. This procedure was repeated until the end of the fourth news story. The questions related to the stories were the same for each story. At the end of the experiment, the questions that were used for the construction of the choosing variable were asked.</p>

<sec id="section12-0093650211414559" sec-type="results">
<title>Results</title>
<p>For each dependent variable, a full factorial 2 (content) × 2 (form) × 3 (age) × 2 (gender) repeated measures multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) was carried out with content (negative and neutral) and form (standard and tabloid) as within-subject factors and age (young, middle, old) and gender (male and female) as between-subject factors. The group variable was excluded from the analysis because a comparison of the <italic>F</italic> tests of all main and interaction effects between the model including the group variable and the model without the group variable showed that including the group variable did not substantially alter the effects of the other variables in the model. In other words, there is no reason to assume that the group variable influenced the results as presented here.</p>
<sec id="section13-0093650211414559">
<title>Staying Tuned</title>
<p>First, a main effect for content was found, <italic>F</italic>(1, 282) = 40.89; <italic>p</italic> = .001, η<sup>2</sup> = .13. In general, viewers indicated the likelihood to stay tuned higher in case of negative content compared with neutral content. Second, a main effect for age was found, <italic>F</italic>(2, 282) = 16.42; <italic>p</italic> = .001, η<sup>2</sup> = .10, indicating that viewers tend to stay tuned more often as they were older. Third, an interaction between age and content was observed, <italic>F</italic>(2, 282) = 6.98; <italic>p</italic> = .001, η<sup>2</sup> = .05, suggesting that compared with older viewers, the younger viewers indicated to stay tuned more often to negative content than to neutral content. To compare the three age groups regarding the impact of negative content on the likelihood to stay tuned, contrast analyses with Bonferroni adjustments were carried out. The analyses showed that negative content had a more positive impact on young viewers (<italic>M<sub>negative</sub></italic> = 76.07, <italic>SD</italic> = 2.29; <italic>M<sub>neutral</sub></italic> = 58.88, <italic>SD</italic> = 2.59) than it had on old viewers (<italic>M<sub>negative</sub></italic> = 85.25, <italic>SD</italic> = 2.11; <italic>M<sub>neutral</sub></italic> = 80.97, <italic>SD</italic> = 2.39). This difference in impact reached significance, <italic>F</italic>(1, 282) = 12.58; <italic>p</italic> = .001. Negative content also had a more positive impact on young viewers than it had on middle-aged viewers (<italic>M<sub>negative</sub></italic> = 76.72, <italic>SD</italic> = 2.11; <italic>M<sub>neutral</sub></italic> = 70.09, <italic>SD</italic> = 2.39). Again, this difference in impact was significant, <italic>F</italic>(1, 282) = 8.42; <italic>p</italic> = .012. Old and middle-aged viewers failed to differ as to the impact of negative content, <italic>F</italic>(1, 282) = 0.45; <italic>p</italic> = 1.00. In sum, younger viewers were more likely to stay tuned for negative content rather than neutral content when compared with middle-aged and old viewers.</p>
<p>The interaction between age and form did not reach significance, which indicated that there was no difference between viewers of different ages in the likelihood to stay tuned because of the form of news stories.</p>
<p>For gender, no interaction with the content of the news story was observed, implying that the likelihood to stay tuned in case of negative content and neutral content was not different for men and women. However, an interaction between gender and form was observed, <italic>F</italic>(1, 282) = 5.59; <italic>p</italic> = .019, η<sup>2</sup> = .02. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0093650211414559">Figure 2</xref>, men were more likely to stay tuned in case of tabloid-packaged stories (<italic>M<sub>standard</sub></italic> = 74.89, <italic>SD</italic> = 1.90; <italic>M<sub>tabloid</sub></italic> = 77.22, <italic>SD</italic> = 1.89) than women (<italic>M<sub>standard</sub></italic> = 75.29, <italic>SD</italic> = 1.80; <italic>M<sub>tabloid</sub></italic> = 71.26, <italic>SD</italic> = 1.80).</p>

<sec id="section14-0093650211414559">
<title>Choosing</title>
<p>Because of the nature of the choosing variable, no main effects of age and gender were calculated. All participants, whatever their age or gender, made six choices. This implies that there is no variation between age and gender in the number of decisions. However, interaction effects can be calculated because it is possible, and expected, that participants differ in the decisions they made.</p>
<p>The interaction between age and content, <italic>F</italic>(2, 282) = 14.54; <italic>p</italic> = .001, η<sup>2</sup> = .09, showed that younger viewers were more likely to choose negative content rather than neutral content. In particular, negative content had a positive impact on young viewers (<italic>M<sub>negative</sub></italic> = 1.85, <italic>SD</italic> = 0.07; <italic>M<sub>neutral</sub></italic> = 1.15, <italic>SD</italic> = .07) but a negative impact on middle-aged viewers (<italic>M<sub>negative</sub></italic> = 1.46, <italic>SD</italic> = 0.07; <italic>M<sub>neutral</sub></italic> = 1.54, <italic>SD</italic> = 0.07). This difference reached significance, <italic>F</italic>(1, 282) = 16.16; <italic>p</italic> = .001). The youngest viewers were also more likely to choose for negative content, whereas the oldest viewers were more likely to choose for neutral content (<italic>M<sub>negative</sub></italic> = 1.35, <italic>SD</italic> = 0.07; <italic>M<sub>neutral</sub></italic> = 1.65, <italic>SD</italic> = 0.07). This difference was also significant, <italic>F</italic>(1, 282) = 27.01; <italic>p</italic> = .001. Old and middle-aged viewers did not significantly differ as to their choice for negative and neutral content, <italic>F</italic>(1, 282) = 1.51; <italic>p</italic> = .660. In sum, young viewers were more likely to prefer negative content rather than neutral content, when compared with middle-aged and old viewers.</p>
<p>The interaction between age and form was not significant. This means that viewers of different ages did not differ in their choice for a particular form of the stories. However, a weak but unpredicted interaction between age, content, and form was found, <italic>F</italic>(2, 282) = 3.53; <italic>p</italic> = .031, η<sup>2</sup> = .02. To young viewers, form was only important in case of neutral content: they chose tabloid more than standard packaging. Among middle-aged viewers, tabloid packaging was chosen above standard packaging. For old viewers, it was found that they chose combinations of standard-packaged neutral stories and tabloid-packaged negative stories.</p>
<p>Similar to the findings on the “staying tuned” measure, no significant interaction between gender and content was found. However, the interaction between gender and form again turned out to be significant, <italic>F</italic>(1, 282) = 9.25; <italic>p</italic> = .003, η<sup>2</sup> = .03 (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0093650211414559">Figure 4</xref>). Men were more likely to choose for tabloid packaging (<italic>M<sub>standard</sub></italic> = 1.38, <italic>SD</italic> = 0.05; <italic>M<sub>tabloid</sub></italic> = 1.63, <italic>SD</italic> = 0.05) than women (<italic>M<sub>standard</sub></italic> = 1.58, <italic>SD</italic> = 0.05; <italic>M<sub>tabloid</sub></italic> = 1.42, <italic>SD</italic> = 0.05).</p>

<title>Evaluating the Hypotheses</title>
<p>To evaluate the hypotheses, the results of the staying tuned and choosing variables were compared. The results for both staying tuned and choosing appeared to be fairly similar, with the sole exception that for choosing, a weak three-way interaction between age, content, and form was found. Leaving this interaction out of consideration, results for age showed that younger viewers had a stronger preference for negative content over neutral content, when compared with middle-aged and old viewers. This provides support to the first hypothesis, although only a difference between the youngest age group and the two older age groups was observed. No differences in preference for tabloid packaging between the age groups were found, implying that the second hypothesis has to be rejected. Regarding gender differences, no differences between men and women in preferences for negative content were observed, which implies that the third hypothesis should also be rejected. The fourth hypothesis is supported as it was found that men, in comparison with women, had a stronger preference for tabloid-packaged news stories than for standard-packaged news stories.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section16-0093650211414559" sec-type="discussion">
<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Little research has been devoted to the question whether negative news and packaging news in a tabloid style might help to gain or to maintain the preferences of specific viewer categories. This study aimed at answering this question. The findings showed that, as predicted, younger viewers have a stronger preference for negative content in news stories than middle-aged and old viewers. Also, in line with the expectations, men have a stronger preference for tabloid packaging than women. Because of these findings, we may conclude that preferences for negative content and tabloid packaging are moderated by age and gender.</p>
<p>In contrast to our predictions, the study findings did not show gendered preferences for the content of news stories, nor did the study show age differences for the production style that was included in the news stories. Both findings may be explained by the European (Dutch) context in which this study was carried out.</p>
<p>Although no scientific research has been published on the subject, we dare to argue that a U.S. news watcher who watches a few Dutch news programs will probably conclude that even the most flashy produced Dutch television news story is relatively calm compared with U.S. standards. As a result, we had limited opportunities to make very strong distinctions between the standard- and tabloid-packaged stories without losing the realistic character of the stories. This relative lack of variance in the independent variable “form” might explain the small effect sizes for the interaction between gender and form as well as the absence of the expected interaction between age and form.</p>
<p>The absence of an interaction between gender and content may be explained by the ambiguous effect of eyewitnesses and victims on female viewers. Presenting ordinary citizens as eyewitnesses or victims in news stories has become a routine practice in many European television news programs over the past years (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0093650211414559">Hendriks Vettehen, et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0093650211414559">Hjarvard, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0093650211414559">Hvitfelt, 1994</xref>). Especially, negative stories lend themselves to the inclusion of eyewitnesses or victims. As a result, the negative news stories in this study also featured a number of eyewitnesses and victims. These eyewitnesses and victims may have affected female participants in two opposite ways. On the one hand, eyewitnesses and victims contribute to the negative valence of the news story because they often express negative emotions. Given that research has shown that women avoid negatively framed news (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0093650211414559">Grabe &amp; Kamhawi, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0093650211414559">Kamhawi &amp; Grabe, 2008</xref>), it can be assumed that the negative valence of these sound bites result in avoidance responses in women, just as the negative story topics and pictures were expected to do. On the other hand, however, it may be argued that women are attracted to sound bites by eyewitnesses and victims. Van Zoonen (1998) has argued that a less detached mode of reporting “feminizes” the news, which obviously would be preferred by women. In contrast to the general news facts that are usually provided by news anchors, sound bites by eyewitnesses and victims provide examples of such “feminized” news stories. Hence, it may be predicted that negative news stories featuring eyewitnesses and victims would be preferred particularly by women. The potentially double-barreled effect of eyewitnesses and victims might explain the zero finding regarding men and women’s appreciation of negative content. However, because this explanation is somewhat speculative, further research is needed to shed light on the precise role of eyewitnesses and victims.</p>
<p>The current study has some methodological limitations that have to be taken into account when interpreting the results. First, the fact that we used negative content stories and neutral stories somewhat limits a direct comparison between our findings and findings from other studies. For instance, the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0093650211414559">Gauntlett and Hill (1999)</xref> findings suggest that both the presence of positive aspects and the absence of negative aspects may induce older viewers to prefer certain programs. However, their results do not show whether older viewers’ preference is the result of the presence of positive aspects, the absence of negative aspects, or the combination of these reasons. Comparing the negative aspects in news stories with a neutral condition, as we did in the current study, enables us to disentangle whether or not the presence of negativity in news stories explains differences in preferences between viewers varying in age. However, the flipside of the decision to focus on the negative aspects only is that we are not able to answer the question whether positive news aspects might induce older viewers to prefer this kind of news stories. To answer this question, future studies should also include positive news stories in the study design.</p>
<p>Second, it needs to be mentioned that the dependent variables in this study, staying tuned and choosing, were self-reports rather than direct measures. A number of objections may be raised against self-reports, of which task difficulty (e.g., in answering questions about internal states) and social desirability are perhaps the most obvious. However, the questions referring to viewer preferences were relatively easy for participants to answer. Moreover, even the negative content stories were not extremely shocking, vulgar, or sexual, which makes socially desirable responding unlikely. There is therefore little reason to assume that these factors may have influenced the viewer responses in the current study.</p>
<p>Third, the external validity of the measures might be disputed as it may be expected that news producers are especially interested in how a certain news story captured viewers on the first exposure, not after already viewing the story. This criticism applies even more to the “choosing” measure because participants had watched four stories before they could indicate whether they would like to see a story again. However, this study is not about the viewers’ instant reactions to specific stories but about the question which <italic>types</italic> of content and form viewers would choose if they had a choice. As already indicated in the introduction to this study, knowledge of these preferences for certain types of content and form may be helpful to news producers both in gaining and maintaining the viewers’ favor.</p>
<p>Fourth, the sample of the study comprised highly educated participants. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0093650211414559">Grabe, Lang, Zhou, and Bolls (2000a)</xref> found that higher educated viewers enjoyed negative content in news stories more compared with lower educated viewers. For that reason, one should be cautious in generalizing the present study findings to other population groups. Further research on audience preferences should include lower education participants to find out whether level of education is another moderator of the relation we studied.</p>
<p>The results of the current study may be important to newsmakers. In particular, the old newsroom saying “if it bleeds, it leads” appears to apply most to young viewers. In addition, women seem to be less keen on flashy production features than men are. Elaborating on these practical implications, it is important to realize that most journalists not only aim at attracting viewers but also aim at informing them about current events. The question is whether these two goals may conflict with one another. To exemplify, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0093650211414559">Lang, Potter, and Grabe (2003)</xref> proposed a set of seven production rules that should make news stories easier to process. For instance, the rule “slow it down” suggests that “when stories are complex, the pace should be slow to moderate with a minimal use of attention eliciting structural features” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0093650211414559">Lang et al., 2003</xref>, p. 114). In contrast, the present study showed that in comparison with women, men prefer a flashy news production style. For men, reducing the number of tabloid features in the story potentially results in less attendance. In this example, the aims of informing and attracting viewers may conflict in the case of male viewers.</p>
<p>Future research may combine story preferences and story recognition and recall in one design, in order to study whether attracting and informing viewers at the same time may conflict. Similar to this study, it should preferably include participants of different age, gender, and level of education. Results of such a study could lend a hand to journalists in enhancing the informative function of television news. In combination with the knowledge about viewer preferences, guidelines for the development of television news programs aimed at specific target groups can be formulated. These guidelines might be helpful in finding a point of balance between optimally informing and attracting viewers, by using different contents and production styles in television news programs targeted at different audiences.</p>
