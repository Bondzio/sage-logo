<abstract>
<p>A longitudinal perspective on motherhood that spans the experience of gestation, birthing, the care of young children, and the mother’s relation to her grown children makes way for a conception of the mother as essentially plural. It shall be argued in this paper that maternity is necessarily tied to surrogacy, that it is divided into a multiplicity of tasks inevitably parceled out to multiple agents. In this essay, the analysis of maternal surrogacy is focused on the phenomenon of <italic>mothering from a distance</italic>, a maternal practice engendered by the feminization and globalization of labor markets. By both affirming the value of maternal surrogates and questioning the limits of surrogacy, this analysis of motherhood challenges both the economic exploitation that engenders and sustains distant mothering and the gendered division of care labor that supports the global economy of care.</p>

<body>
<p>What does motherhood mean? It is true that in asking such a question, a theorist runs the risk of oversimplifying the matter in question and granting her own perspective a paradigmatic status by privileging a particular conception of maternity based on class, culture, or race, and by subjecting variant experiences of it to a purportedly universal norm. Nevertheless, an attempt to articulate the meaning of motherhood – if done with an awareness of its risks and limitations – can serve an important critical purpose of allowing one to assess particular practices of maternity against a conceptual standard, no matter how provisional such a standard might be.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0725513612450503">1</xref>
</sup> In other words, the universalizing impulse, as long as it is brought to a dialectical encounter with diverse accounts of maternal practices, is necessary to counter the absolutizing tendency of particularism. One can just as easily fall into the trap of uncritically accepting existing practices of maternity and legitimizing unjust socio-political arrangements being masked by such practices by refusing to give a general account of one’s practice as by imposing one’s own practice to others, without regard to the specificities of their situations. In seeking to define what motherhood means, one is challenged to engage in a dialogical encounter with other experiences of motherhood and to cast a critical eye upon certain maternal practices that one may have taken for granted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0725513612450503">Keller 2010</xref>: 843–4).</p>
<p>A particular trend that merits critical attention is the phenomenon of mothering at a distance, which is a result of the increase in the feminization of migrant labor (both across and within national borders) and the globalization of the economy of care and domestic labor. In this essay, I shall frame my discussion of maternity within the broader intention of theorizing maternity in general. In this regard I shall claim that motherhood is essentially plural, that is to say, that the mother is <italic>essentially divided</italic> between herself and her surrogates.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0725513612450503">2</xref>
</sup> However, given the complexity of socio-historical determinants of motherhood in general and of the migrant mother phenomenon in particular, these reflections are to be anchored in and largely limited to studies on Filipino migrant mothers and their surrogates.</p>
<p>The dialectic relation between the general and the particular poles of analysis will allow us to ask whether there are limits to the elasticity of the mother-surrogate relation, whether, in other words, the requirements and the dynamics of the maternal relation demand that we resist and challenge current economic practices of exporting and importing domestic and care labor as well as social norms regarding the gendered division of care work. Rather than treating the contested nature of motherhood as being accidental to the meaning of motherhood, I argue that its contested nature is intrinsic to maternity itself, that its very concept gives rise to its own contestation.</p>
<p>This essay has three parts. In the first, I develop the idea of the contested nature of motherhood, arguing that the sites of its contestation correspond with the junctures in the course of the mother–child relation as this relation responds to shifts in socio-historical conditions. The first part yields the thesis that surrogacy is constitutive of maternity itself, thus leading to the second part of the essay, in which I clarify my notion of the ‘divided mother’ by contrasting it to two conceptions of the divided mother in the psychoanalytic tradition. Particular attention will be given to Kristeva on maternal consciousness, because the categories of separation and sacrificial love that surface in her analysis of the <italic>mater dolorosa</italic> seem to inform the popular discourse surrounding the migrant mother phenomenon, particularly in the Philippines. Finally, the last part focuses on the phenomenon of the missing mother, which contextualizes the notion of surrogacy at the intersection of gender and migration issues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0725513612450503">Parreñas 2006b</xref>: 52).</p>

<title>Motherhood as a contested concept</title>
<p>How would it be possible to conceptualize motherhood in a quasi-unified way that is able to account for its multiple and even incompatible manifestations? Rather than directly approaching the question of the meaning of motherhood, this essay will take the contested nature of the concept of motherhood as its starting point, and in so doing will shift the focus of inquiry from providing a definition of motherhood to the meta level task of providing a framework in which to map these points of contestation.</p>
<p>To say that motherhood is a contested concept is to say that there are competing answers to questions such as, who counts as a mother? What makes one a good or a bad mother? What opens up any concept to contestation are concrete social conditions. In examining motherhood as a contested concept, we are endeavoring to understand both the conditions which give rise to conflicting notions of motherhood as well as ways in which existing practices of mothering and normative expectations of motherhood serve to reinforce these conditions. This means that thinking about motherhood is not only a means of assessing the appropriateness of current notions of motherhood in light of the concrete conditions in which mothers and children exist, but that thinking about motherhood can also be a means of contesting social conditions that necessitate and give rise to unjust mothering practices.</p>
<p>To say that motherhood is a contested concept is not to say that the concept can merely be splintered into competing interpretations depending on external determinants, but that the concept itself contributes to the terms of its contestation. For instance, prior to <italic>in vitro </italic>fertilization, the idea of motherhood could be split between biological motherhood and adoptive motherhood, simply because the infant <italic>can</italic> be cared for or even adopted by someone other than the mother who bore her. But due to advances in reproductive technology, who the ‘biological mother’ is no longer remains uncontested. Now that ova can be harvested and fertilized outside the woman’s body, and the fertilized egg implanted in another woman’s uterus for the embryo’s gestation, is the biological mother the genetic or the gestational mother? Mediated by technological interventions in reproduction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0725513612450503">Briggs 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0725513612450503">Pande 2010</xref>) – not to mention delivery<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0725513612450503">3</xref>
</sup> – the notion of motherhood becomes a contested concept through the fragmentation of the <italic>process </italic>of reproduction and the ‘parceling out’ of its different stages to different agents.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0725513612450503">
<title>The divided mother</title>
<p>If we were to extend this sort of analysis beyond the stage of conception and gestation to the protracted relation between mother and child, we will see that a similar pattern of parceling out of the maternal role and duties occurs as children mature and take their place in society.</p>
<p>Just as the parceling out of motherhood to its component aspects is partly dictated by historical (social, cultural, technological, economic) conditions, so too the fusion<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0725513612450503">4</xref>
</sup> of such components into what we take to be unitary concepts of motherhood is a response to broader social conditions. Recent work on the conceptualization of motherhood has focused on ‘decomposing’ notions of motherhood. The project of giving multiple accounts of motherhood that recognize the multiplicity of cultural and historical perspectives serves the purpose of resisting ideological conceptions of motherhood, i.e., conceptions that serve the interests of a dominant class, gender, or race.</p>
<p>In Evelyn Nakano Glenn’s ‘Social Constructions of Mothering’, she argues that ‘[d]ecomposing mothering would broaden our field of vision to encompass the variety of actors who mother, the multiple identities/roles of women who mother, and the separate personhood and agency of mothers and children’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0725513612450503">Glenn 1994</xref>: 13).</p>
<p>These three axes of decomposition are interrelated and mutually implicating. For instance, if one is able to recognize motherhood in terms of <italic>activities</italic> that can be performed by a ‘variety of actors who mother’, one is disengaging maternal tasks from their strict identification with the mother, and one is thus enabled to recognize that women who are mothers have other roles, activities, and identities apart from being mothers. To recognize the various and multiple <italic>identities</italic> of mothers (besides motherhood) in turn goes hand in hand with a recognition that a mother’s <italic>personhood</italic> is not attained exclusively in her engagement with her children’s needs, desires, and goals, and that, conversely, the attainment of the children’s personhood is distinct from the mother’s activities and personhood. This requires a recognition that the demands of the child’s growth are not exclusively tied to the mother, that the child can be cared for by other adults besides her/his mother, and that, moreover, the child’s needs are not reducible to the need for care.</p>
<p>According to Glenn, decomposing mothering would dislodge an ‘undifferentiated’ and ‘monolith[ic]’ conception of mothering from its moorings in ‘the Western philosophical tradition, which rests on binary oppositions’:<disp-quote>
<p>Mothering in Western culture has been defined in terms of binary oppositions between male-female, mind-body, nature-culture, reason-emotion, public-private, and labor-love. Mothering has been assigned to the subordinate poles of these oppositions: thus it is viewed as flowing from ‘natural’ female attributes, located only in the private sphere of family and involving strong emotional attachment and altruistic motives. Critical analysis of mothering requires deconstructing these oppositions. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0725513612450503">Glenn 1994</xref>: 13)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>I suggest that one way of deconstructing these binary oppositions is to structure our analysis of motherhood longitudinally and see how motherhood is parceled out at different points of the individual mother’s history. By attending to the parceling out and differentiation of maternal activities – the structure of which is determined neither simply by biological determinants nor simply through external, social construction, but is rather a function of the dynamic interrelation of both<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0725513612450503">5</xref>
</sup> – we are able to see that the figure of the mother is essentially plural, and that this plurality is best understood in terms of maternity’s negotiation with surrogacy.</p>
<p>The notion of surrogacy is a necessary mediator of the relation between mother and child. At best, the presence of surrogates allows for both the separation of mother from child and the continued relation between the two. I say ‘at best’ because I do not wish to ignore the ambivalence intrinsic to the role and presence of surrogates. For instance, it is always possible that rather than mediating the mother–child relation, surrogates estrange the child from the mother, hence the need for ‘negotiation’.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0725513612450503">6</xref>
</sup> Nevertheless, this inevitable ambivalence in the mother–surrogate relation is not an argument against my thesis that surrogacy is essentially linked to maternity. To the contrary, this essential tension constitutive of the mother–surrogate relation signals the essential dividedness of the figure of the mother in itself – a <italic>différance</italic> at the heart of maternity. Despite the tensions surrounding surrogacy, in this essay, I wish to defend the idea that the mother’s negotiation with surrogates gives us something between crippling identification and abandonment. It allows the mother to be both there and not there, to be both a mother and a human being with an identity distinct from her maternal role, and the child to be both an offspring and an autonomous being.</p>

<title>Milk and tears: The maternal body as the privileged site of intimacy</title>
<p>This longitudinal approach to the decomposition of motherhood in terms of the parceling out of maternal tasks to surrogates needs to be distinguished from certain ways in which maternal dividedness has been conceived in the psychoanalytic tradition in terms of the infant’s relation to the maternal body.</p>
<sec id="section5-0725513612450503">
<title>Klein: the good and the bad mother</title>
<p>One way in which psychoanalysis has theorized the decomposition of the unitary figure of the mother is through the idea of the ambiguity of the maternal figure developed by Melanie Klein. The opposition between the good and the bad mother, between the good and the bad breast, mirrors and is a function of the child’s vacillation between love and hate. For Klein, the development of a moral consciousness results from the successful resolution of this ambivalence in the child’s struggle to make reparation for his or her guilt for (supposedly) having harmed the person he or she loves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0725513612450503">Klein 1975</xref>: 306–43).</p>
<p>This reflection on maternal ambivalence is from the perspective of the child’s desire and fundamentally ignores the perspective of the mother’s desire (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0725513612450503">Parker 1997</xref>: 19). Although, strictly speaking, Klein’s analysis of maternal ambivalence speaks of the child’s internal, psychological struggle and not the mother’s objective worth as a mother, the opposition between the good and the bad breast very easily maps onto – and possibly even relies on – existing normative notions of what constitutes the good and the bad mother. In Klein, the assessment of the mother’s goodness or badness is based on her being the source of care, attention, and love for the child. Her goodness is based on her availability; she is judged according to whether she gives or withholds herself from her child.</p>

<title>Kristeva: the split subjectivity of the mother</title>
<p>Although Kristeva’s notion of the mother’s <italic>split subjectivity</italic> introduces difference into maternal identity, there is a crucial difference between my notion of the parceling out of maternity and Kristeva’s split subject. In theorizing the maternal body, Kristeva does not take the parceling out far enough in the direction of the mother’s relation to her surrogates; rather, her theory remains bound to the paradigm of pregnancy and childbirth. In emphasizing this aspect of maternity, her conception of maternity runs the risk of being trapped in the symbiotic relation of narcissistic and melancholic identification.</p>
<p>In the following passage from ‘<italic>Stabat Mater</italic>’, Kristeva’s study of the cult of the Virgin Mary and the Catholic conception of maternity, Kristeva speaks of maternity as an experience of ‘separation’ and ‘division’ precisely because her analysis is anchored in the experience of pregnancy that culminates in the exit of the child from the mother’s body. In birthing, the mother experiences herself as exiled from her child, and therefore, implicitly, as a longing for an impossible recapitulation of a lost unity:<disp-quote>
<p>The immeasurable, unconfinable, maternal body.</p>
<p>First there is the separation, previous to pregnancy, but which pregnancy brings to light and imposes without remedy.</p>
<p>On the one hand – the pelvis: centre of gravity, unchanging ground, solid pedestal, heaviness and weight to which the thighs adhere, with no promise of agility on that score. On the other – the torso, arms, neck, head, face, calves, feet: unbounded liveliness, rhythm and mask, which furiously attempt to compensate for the immutability of the central tree. We live on that border, crossroads beings, crucified beings. … A mother is a continuous separation, a division of the very flesh. And consequently a division of language – and it has always been so.</p>
<p>Then there is this other abyss that opens up between the body and what had been its inside: there is the abyss between the mother and the child. What connection is there between myself, or even more unassumingly between my body and this internal graft and fold, which, once the umbilical cord has been severed, is an inaccessible other? My body and … him. No connection. Nothing to do with it. And this, as early as the first gestures, cries, steps, long before <italic>its</italic> personality has become my opponent. The child, whether <italic>he</italic> or <italic>she</italic> is irremediably an other. … I confront the abyss between what was mine and is henceforth but irreparably alien. Trying to think through that abyss: staggering vertigo. No identity holds up. A mother’s identity is maintained only through the well-known closure of consciousness within the indolence of habit, when a woman protects herself from the borderline that severs her body and expatriates it from her child. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0725513612450503">Kristeva 1986</xref>: 177–9)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Motherhood on this account is an experience of exile. Birthing her child wounds the mother, rendering her borders permanently porous and vulnerable, and delivers her into permanent exile from her child and her own sense of wholeness. Paradoxically, this pain of exile is eased precisely when her habitual sense of identity – tenuously maintained by the ‘closure of consciousness’ – is disturbed by the sense of connectedness she continues to feel from her alien child, as though through waves from distant shores:<disp-quote>
<p>… motherhood destines us to a demented <italic>jouissance</italic> that is answered, by chance, by the nursling’s laughter in the sunny waters of the ocean. What connection is there between it and myself? No connection, except for that overflowing laughter where one senses the collapse of some ringing, subtle, fluid identity or other, softly buoyed by the waves. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0725513612450503">Kristeva 1986</xref>: 179–80)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Kristeva sees in this experience of being adrift in the sea of separation the potentiality of recovering or cultivating a feminine, semiotic<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0725513612450503">7</xref>
</sup> discourse and communication, a way of being together that is resistant to ‘the war of individual singularities’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0725513612450503">Kristeva 1986</xref>: 182):<disp-quote>
<p>We are in it, set free of our identification papers and names, on an ocean of preciseness, a computerization of the unnameable. No communication between individuals but connections between atoms, molecules, wisps of words, droplets of sentences. The community of women is a community of dolphins. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0725513612450503">Kristeva 1986</xref>: 181)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>It appears then that the experience of birthing – of being torn from oneself and being set adrift – opens up for the woman a more visceral register of communication, a kind of being with the other that is perhaps more radical and more intimate than the conceptual. There is, however, nothing to stop this narrative of separation from moving in another direction – away from the liberating possibility of an alternative community with others (with other women, in particular) towards the isolation of the intimate relation between mother and child, and an interminable mourning for the lost proximity of intrauterine life.</p>
<p>Not surprisingly, therefore, Kristeva herself gives us an analysis of this other trajectory – that of melancholic identification – in her interpretation of the Virgin Mother. In the iconography of the Virgin Mother, the mother’s milk goes hand in hand with the mother’s tears. The image of the Mother carrying the infant Christ comes to be superimposed with the image of the <italic>Pieta</italic>.<disp-quote>
<p>Under a full blue dress, the maternal, virginal body allowed only the breast to show, while the face, with the stiffness of Byzantine icons gradually softened, was covered with tears. Milk and tears became the privileged signs of the Mater Dolorosa who invaded the west beginning with the eleventh century, reaching the peak of its influx in the fourteenth. But it never ceased to fill the Marian visions of those, men or women (often children), who were racked by the anguish of maternal frustration. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0725513612450503">Kristeva 1986</xref>: 173)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Kristeva interprets the tears of the Virgin Mother as the tears of one who – especially since she herself is spared from death – seeks to take into her own flesh the pain and death suffered by her son.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-0725513612450503">8</xref>
</sup>
<disp-quote>
<p>The ordering of the maternal libido reached its apotheosis when centred in the theme of death. The <italic>Mater Dolorosa</italic> knows no masculine body save that of her dead son, and her only pathos (which contrasts with the somewhat vacant, gentle serenity of the nursing Madonnas) is her shedding tears over a corpse. Since resurrection there is … nothing justifies Mary’s outburst of pain at the foot of the cross, unless it be the desire to experience within her own body the death of a human being, which her feminine fate of being the source of life spares her. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0725513612450503">Kristeva 1986</xref>: 175)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>We are not impugning the steadfastness of maternal love that remains constant and undiminished throughout the child’s life. The point is that just as the unity of the milk and tears is not accidental in the development of the iconography of the Virgin Mother, the metaphorics of separation and lost unity that organizes our understanding of maternity, as it focuses on the unique, irreplaceable relation between mother and child, is of a piece with the language of melancholic identification with the lost child. The longing ‘to experience within her own body the death’ of her son is but the inversion of the anguish of delivering her child into the world and cutting off her union with him.</p>
<p>The point is not to question whether the mother is right to mourn the loss of her child, but to ask whether the conception of maternal love as it is figured in the unity of milk and tears – the conception of maternal love as sacrificial love – is an idea that we as a society are putting to some ideological use. We have to endeavor to speak about the subjectivity of the mother and grant the mother her desire and sense of self in our theoretic constructions. In articulating maternity as a segmented reality, with a series of phases and with a multiplicity of roles, we come to see that the mother is granted her subjectivity only when her subjectivity is allowed to slip away from – to <italic>differ</italic> from – her maternity, and when <italic>maternity</italic> itself is conceived as differing from itself, and thus opening itself to being performed by multiple agents.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-0725513612450503">9</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>Similarly, we have to revise our understanding of the child’s subjectivity as defined exclusively by the child’s narcissistic needs. I suggest that in broadening our perspective of the maternal relation we could go beyond an understanding of intimacy, which is patterned after a narcissistic identification between mother and child, to a richer notion of it as a relation of mutual affection and responsibility.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-0725513612450503">
<title>Going beyond the maternal body</title>
<p>A corollary of conceiving maternity exclusively from the perspective of the child’s (narcissistic) needs is not just the denial of the needs of the mother but the circumscribing of maternal agency and of her role in the growth of the child’s personhood. Making pregnancy the paradigm of maternity reduces the mother to being the child’s life-support system, a role that easily extends to the traditional role, given by patriarchy to women, of providing the immediate material needs of the child. Breastfeeding easily extends to cooking. The enclosing space of her womb extends upon birth to the task of holding the baby in her arms, rocking her or him to sleep (the way the child was gently rocked in the womb), clothing and keeping the child safe in the enclosure of the home.</p>
<p>We need to think of the mother-child relation beyond the paradigm of intrauterine life, which is often conceived metaphorically as a fusion of identity between mother and child. In identifying the mother with the womb, the woman (conceived as ‘the maternal body’) is alternately figured as Mother Nature – a kind of infinite resource for the child’s need – or as the abject body – the body that is risked and sacrificed by and for the child it shelters from as well as delivers to the world.</p>
<p>In taking the longitudinal view that I am proposing, we allow ourselves a more complicated view of intimacy. What begins in physical proximity (even interiority) as a one-sided affection develops – gradually and throughout a lifetime – to a bilateral relation between independent and hopefully autonomous individuals.<sup>

<title>Mothering as a work of attention and attunement</title>
<p>The narrative of separation and abandonment often takes it for granted that the story begins with unity, with identity and sameness, which subsequently suffers separation. We have to recall, however, that pregnancy is for the woman an encounter with otherness. The attunement with children, the thorough-going investment of attention and mindfulness for the needs of children, which is often romantically thought to be instinctive, is better understood as the result of a long practice in coming to grips with and <italic>taking responsibility for </italic>the alienness that has come to inhabit one’s life and one’s body.</p>
<p>Rather than a seamless fusion between identities, pregnancy is a process of interpreting signals generated by an alien being through the very medium of one’s body. This is another way of saying that pregnancy alienates the woman from her own body at the very moment that it brings her to a more acute awareness of her own embodiment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0725513612450503">Young 1995</xref>). And rather than a being easily known and intimately familiar, the newborn child is rather like a cipher without a key. Mothering is an acquired skill, not an innate knowledge. Children who do not ‘know’ how to suckle and mothers who weep at their inability to tell what the crying infant wants attest to this. Mothering, right at the beginning, is a socially mediated practice. The mother learns mothering from her own mother, from midwives, doctors, nurses, books, classes, etc.</p>
<p>The task of attending to the child’s need for ‘protection’, ‘nurturance’ and ‘training’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0725513612450503">Ruddick 1989</xref>: 18–22, 59) is hard, unremitting work. The fact that adoptive parents – not just biological mothers and not even just mothers – also engage in this labor of attunement tells us that mothering is not solely determined by or tied to biological motherhood.</p>
<p>While I do not wish to disregard or understate the real continuity between the task of attunement during pregnancy and after birth, I would insist that emphasis be given to the discontinuity between the gestational and post-natal labor of maternity in conceptualizing motherhood,<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-0725513612450503">11</xref>
</sup> since it is the in-utero attunement (which perhaps psychologically disposes the mother to care for her child as if the child were an extension of herself) that patriarchal society exploits and uses to its advantage in assigning care work exclusively to women.</p>
<p>If we were to stop to think about it, we would perhaps be astonished that the task of caring for a child bears no semblance whatsoever to the task of caring for a child in the womb. In a sense, caring for one’s child during pregnancy is indistinguishable from taking care of oneself, though admittedly self-care in pregnancy is subject to very different and rather restrictive conditions.</p>
<p>Inside the womb, the child does not have physical independence. The child does not breathe; it is nourished without taking in its own food, without having to ask for anything. The child is in a real sense a part of the mother’s body, though one that is geared towards eventual independence. Once born, paradoxical as it may sound, the child’s relative independence from the maternal body delivers him or her to a wider sphere of dependence – that is to say, from the care of one to the care of many, from the womb of the mother to the arms of not just the mother but of her surrogates.</p>

<title>Carework and intimacy</title>
<p>Carework is inseparable from the growth of intimacy. Providing for the needs of another and being dependent upon the care of another foster intimacy on both sides, but intimacy is not reducible to the need for and provision of care. Children do not remain children, and to the extent that they grow, intimacy outstrips – or ought to outstrip – the limits of dependency. Furthermore, at some point, parents in turn become the recipients of care from their grown children. The reciprocity of the mother-child relation finds its terminus in the reversal of relations of dependence, responsibility, and care when the parent reaches the infirmity of old age.</p>
<p>Furthermore, affection goes beyond the bounds of the provision of needs. This is why, as tempting as it is to idealize the primordial unity between mother and child as the unparalleled paradigm of intimacy and to conceive maternity primarily as the source of constant care and the site of sacrificial love, we have to resist this temptation in order to avoid the trap of idealizing the child’s infantile, narcissistic dependency.</p>
<p>If we were to go beyond the stage of infant dependence, we would see that the intimacy between mother and child is complicated and enriched by issues of authority and reciprocal responsibility. To view motherhood only or primarily in terms of the provision of care neglects these crucial aspects of it: First, it neglects the mother’s taking of responsibility for the child’s life and welfare. In the Philippines and in most societies, the responsibility for the child’s well-being, the provision of physical needs and of education, is taken on primarily by the parents – and as far as the concrete day-to-day needs are concerned, more so by the mother – in an ultimate way. Care duties may be delegated to surrogates, but the surrogates, whether paid caregivers or family members like grandmothers, never entirely feel that they have the final responsibility or authority over their charges (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0725513612450503">Aguilar et al. 2009</xref>: 264).</p>
<p>Reducing the maternal relation to care also ignores the emotional bond shared by mother and child, which, from the side of the mother, is experienced as a claim to respect and an expectation of reciprocal affection. In construing the maternal bond as an intertwining of parental authority and intimacy, it becomes clear that this ‘claim’ that we speak of is not only upon the child’s respect and obedience but also affection. The expectation of future care – when the mother (as well as the father) reaches old age – is seen not as a transactional obligation but as an expectation of reciprocal love.</p>
<p>Note that in seeking to disengage the concept of maternity from its strict if not exclusive identification with childbearing, we are able to question the gendered nature of filial responsibility. In making the mother – by virtue of her capacity for childbearing – the primary agent of the intimate work of care, Philippine society ends up systematically relegating carework to women. Daughters, but not sons, are often expected to care for the old and the infirm. This gendered assignment of care labor, both within the family and in the sphere of paid labor, goes hand in hand with the sexist undervaluation of care work as unskilled domestic labor.</p>

<title>Mothering at a distance: Surrogacy and the OFW experience</title>
<p>In the section above, I spoke of motherhood (and parenthood in general) as a taking on of responsibility for the care and rearing of the child. In emphasizing the <italic>active</italic> nature of this responsibility, I wish to underscore the idea that maternity is essentially an adoptive relation. All children are in a sense adopted children, all mothers adoptive mothers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0725513612450503">Ruddick 1989</xref>: 51). If one takes this position, one would have to minimize the difference or blur the distinction between the mother and her surrogates – grandmothers, nannies, aunts, elder sisters, or fathers. Motherhood is essentially open to surrogates. Its very concept already includes within it that of surrogates who take on a measure of the responsibility for the care and rearing of children. The idea that motherhood is essentially parceled out among multiple agents of care and responsibility would argue for an acceptance of flexible arrangements of mothering and family life that would allow the mother to work outside the home, without being accused of (or at least feeling guilty of) abandoning her children.</p>
<p>So far, the argument seems to support the emerging practice of mothering at a distance, which is brought about by the global and internal migration of women and care labor. However, it is necessary to ask whether the phenomenon of transnational or migrant mothering poses a limit to surrogacy. Is there a limit to the elasticity of the parceling out of motherhood? To address this question, I now turn to the experience of the transnational or migrant mother, in particular, the OFW (Overseas Filipino Worker)<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-0725513612450503">12</xref>
</sup> mother.</p>
<p>The decision of mothers to leave their children behind is often a response to economic incentives.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-0725513612450503">13</xref>
</sup> The economic benefits of parent migration for the family, primarily in the form of education for the children, are perhaps incontestable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0725513612450503">Aguilar et al. 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0725513612450503">Arguillas and Williams 2010</xref>). I will focus my discussion on the strategies used by mothers to overcome the emotional and moral difficulties of their extended separation from their children.</p>
<p>Rhacel Salazar Parreñas identifies three ways by which migrant mothers cope with and compensate for their extended separation from their children. Mothers may repress or downplay the pain of separation, focusing instead on the economic benefits of working overseas. Another strategy identified by Parreñas is what she calls the ‘commodification of love’. This refers to the practice of periodically shipping goods and gifts home in ‘<italic>balikbayan</italic>
<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn14-0725513612450503">14</xref>
</sup> boxes’ or of sending especially large amounts in cash for special occasions (a child’s birthday or graduation, for instance) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0725513612450503">Fresnoza-Flot 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>The third mechanism – perhaps most significant in shaping and giving rise to a new dynamic in transnational family relations – is the process of ‘compressing time and space … via the telephone and letter writing’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0725513612450503">Parreñas 2001</xref>: 374). Since the tremendous growth in cellular telecommunication, a more recent trend in ‘compressing time and space’ is the practice of text messaging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0725513612450503">Aguilar et al. 2009</xref>: 362–4; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0725513612450503">Uy-Tioco 2007</xref>). Through text messaging, migrant mothers can engage in a form of intensive mothering from a distance.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn15-0725513612450503">15</xref>
</sup> In Uy-Tioco’s study on the effects of the widespread use of text messaging on migrant families, she writes:<disp-quote>
<p>Children of migrant parents need ‘concrete reinforcement of their parents’ love and that can be achieved by ‘creating ‘bridges’ of communication’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0725513612450503">Parreñas 2003</xref>: 141–2). Through text messaging, mothers in far-away countries are still able to ‘mother’ their kids by asking them how their day was and whether school went okay, reminding them to eat dinner and do their homework, and bidding them goodnight almost as if they were there. … Donna, a nanny in New York, has three sons in the Philippines. Although she has not seen them for almost two years, she keeps in constant contact – sending over 20 text messages daily. She says, ‘I’m able to find out what they are doing, how they are like. It’s like I am there.’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0725513612450503">Uy-Tioco 2007</xref>: 259)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>What is essentially being reproduced by this ‘absent presence’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0725513612450503">Uy-Tioco 2007</xref>, quoting <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0725513612450503">Pertierra et al. 2002</xref>) effected by the use of mobile phones is the constant ‘hovering, background attention that children desire from their adult caregivers’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0725513612450503">De Marneffe 2004</xref>: 40). It can be argued that this new technology, which allows for greater ease and frequency of communication as well as of remittances, is giving rise to a new type of family dynamics and potentially a new, progressive conception of motherhood.</p>
<p>Recent works on mothering from a distance and transnational families, notably the works of Parreñas, which focus on Filipino migrant workers, are intent on contesting traditional notions of motherhood by revealing and criticizing the gendered division of reproductive labor that sustains traditional norms of maternity despite the radical changes in the structure of the family, namely, the extended geographic separation of the mother from her children and the newly acquired breadwinning role of the migrant mother. A surprising finding of Parreñas’s studies of migrant mothers is that the changes in the nuclear family brought about by the migration of mothers do not necessarily transgress gender norms.</p>
<p>In what Parreñas calls the gender paradox, the transnational Filipino families’ ways of coping with their situation are both ‘reifying and transgressing gender boundaries’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0725513612450503">Parreñas 2006a</xref>: 6–7). Traditional parenting roles – the father as breadwinner<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn16-0725513612450503">16</xref>
</sup> and the mother as caregiver – remain and find new ways of reasserting themselves despite the reversal of economic provision and dependence between husband and wife.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn17-0725513612450503">17</xref>
</sup> Rather than the father taking over the traditional maternal role in the mother’s absence, the mother only finds ways of compensating for her physical absence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0725513612450503">Ukwatta 2010</xref>: 125) even as she now plays the traditional paternal role of being the primary economic provider:<disp-quote>
<p>By illustrating that actions in transnational households maintain ‘normative gender behavior,’ I establish that actions do not necessarily succumb to their situated context or give in to structural constraints and organizational pressures. The reenactment of conventional gender norms in the transnational families of migrant mothers and fathers in the Philippines is a testament to actions defying the potential subversions offered by the physical absence of mothers and fathers from home. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0725513612450503">Parreñas 2006a</xref>: 6)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>There are at least two reasons why Parreñas’s critique of traditional norms of motherhood and family life are important: (1) the lessening of the emotional strain on the migrating mother, who feels compelled to perform intensive mothering from a distance, even when she is already fulfilling the role of breadwinner and even if such expectations are extremely difficult – if not impossible – to fulfill (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0725513612450503">Parreñas 2001</xref>); and (2) the overcoming of the stigma attached to maternal migration, which systematically deprives the families of these mothers of much needed social and institutional support (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0725513612450503">Parreñas 2006a</xref>: 43–4).</p>
<p>Often, however, the effort to overcome the stigma attached to transnational families, in particular, to the emigrating mother, is characterized by an emphasis on the benefits of migration accrued by the children left behind and on the absence of harm suffered by the children, and silence about the costs of separation, particularly from the perspective of the mothers. In other words, in wanting to overcome the trope of abandonment, studies emphasize not only that the mothers, despite their distance, do not in fact abandon their children, but also that the children in fact do not suffer from their presumed abandonment. They are able to go to good schools and are able to have their medical needs met; they are cared for by their father and – mostly – by other female kin or by hired domestic help. Moreover, the problems of disciplining from a distance – though acknowledged (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0725513612450503">Aguilar et al. 2009</xref>) – do not seem to be insurmountable. Contrary to what common preconceptions about family dynamics might lead us to expect, there are no appalling statistics of drug addiction or truancy in transnational families; and, as Parreñas points out, while it is true that ‘incest is a social problem in the Philippines, its direct correlation to the emigration of mothers is an unproven speculation’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0725513612450503">Parreñas 2006a</xref>: 40).</p>
<p>Nevertheless, it is necessary to question the limits of surrogacy. Part of understanding the role that surrogacy plays in constituting motherhood is understanding the complexities and ambivalences that constitute this relation. From the standpoint of the mother who leaves her child to the care of a surrogate (whether to the care of a relative or a paid caregiver) for an extended time, there is the anxiety that her child may not be properly cared for or that the surrogate may displace her in the child’s affection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0725513612450503">Hondagneu-Sotelo and Avila 1997</xref>). From the caregiver’s standpoint, supposing that she forms an attachment to the child, especially if the absence of the mother is extended over a long period, there is frustration and possibly resentment that no matter how devoted she has been, in the final analysis, she has no claims upon the child’s love and loyalty.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn18-0725513612450503">18</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>Another aspect to consider is that the parental role of disciplining the child is compromised by the parents’ distance. Not only do the caregivers feel that they have no full or unquestioned authority to scold or punish the child; the parents, too, hesitate to be strict or harsh in disciplining the child for fear of losing the child’s affection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0725513612450503">Aguilar et al. 2009</xref>: 262–4; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0725513612450503">Schmalzbauer 2004</xref>: 1325).</p>
<p>We should also note that money sets limits to the affective ties between children and their caretakers. When OFW mothers send money to their children, they are sometimes said to be attempting to buy their children’s affection with money. There is another sense in which money buys love: in paying caregivers or providing financial support to relatives taking care of her children, the mother is simultaneously providing a surrogate for herself and guaranteeing her own irreplaceability. She leaves her children to someone she trusts (or is forced to trust); but by giving the caretaker a monetary incentive to care for her children, she is reducing the surrogate’s claim to her children’s affection and esteem by reducing the child-surrogate relation to an economic transaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0725513612450503">Anderson 2006</xref>: 235). Even in cases where there is no strict contractual relationship between the migrant parent and the caregiver, monetary arrangements can be a cause of strain between the mother and her surrogate caregiver. The caregiver has to take care that no doubts arise about the proper disbursement of remitted funds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0725513612450503">Aguilar et al. 2009</xref>: 322–4).</p>
<p>Finally, how are we to assess mothering from a distance from the perspective of the mother’s need for intimacy? Studies have generally acknowledged the loneliness experienced by migrant working mothers separated from their children, but Philippine society seems to have an ambivalent attitude towards this loneliness.</p>
<p>Judging from the official rhetoric regarding migrant laborers as our <italic>new heroes</italic> (<italic>mga bagong bayani</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0725513612450503">De Guzman 2008</xref>: 610; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0725513612450503">McKay 2007</xref>: 76–7), there seems to be a societal recognition of the sacrifices undergone by OFWs. There is an understanding that women leave their children in the care of others not for the sake of personal career advancement but for the sake of the family’s financial needs. Even if we acknowledge that there is a gain in independence and power for the migrant mother in being able to earn an income, in many cases this gain in power relative to one’s family comes at the cost of the woman’s underemployment and downward socio-economic mobility. Relegated mostly to domestic and care labor with low pay, no opportunity for shifting to better and higher paying jobs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0725513612450503">Abrego 2009</xref>: 31), and even risking bodily harm, while having little or no recourse to legal protection, particularly if the migrant worker does not have a legal status in the receiving country,<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn19-0725513612450503">19</xref>
</sup> it would be difficult to credit migration with the personal growth and professional advancement of poor migrant women workers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0725513612450503">Trask 2010</xref>: 55).</p>
<p>Unlike the conflict experienced by women of the upper classes (whether they be from rich or poor nations), the conflict experienced by migrant mothers is not between self-fulfillment (in pursuing a career) and the desire to spend time with her children caring for them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0725513612450503">Johnston and Swanson 2006</xref>), but between performing her maternal role directly by being present to her children or mediately through her financial support. In other words, by extolling the act of leaving children behind as the fulfillment of maternal duty, as an extreme and perhaps even the supreme expression of maternal sacrifice, Philippine society has found a way of justifying and capitalizing upon the separation of children from their mothers.</p>
<p>Our migrant mothers are the new figure of the <italic>mater dolorosa.</italic> By some sleight of hand, we have made it acceptable – even laudable – that for many of our countrywomen, the only way they can be good mothers is by leaving their children behind.</p>
<p>Despite its positive economic benefits to transnational (or transregional) families and its possibly liberating effect on women through an increase in their independence and influence within the family, the migration of women and mother laborers is conservative on two levels: it preserves both the economic order and the sexual economy. The migration of mothers is economically beneficial to the sending country because as long as their children are held hostage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0725513612450503">Smith 2003</xref>) in the home country, the mothers will assiduously send remittances – in some cases – in El Salvador, for instance – more reliably and with greater dedication than their male counterparts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0725513612450503">Abrego 2009</xref>: 31).<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn20-0725513612450503">20</xref>
</sup> Additionally, while this arrangement grants women more economic power in their own families, on the macro level, it in fact does not disturb the sexual order, since other women – poorer women – but not men, are then made or hired to take on the burden of care work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0725513612450503">Trask 2010</xref>: 55). These poorer women would in turn have to leave their own children behind<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn21-0725513612450503">21</xref>
</sup> in the care of others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0725513612450503">Parreñas 2006b</xref>: 60–1).</p>
<p>While we do not wish to fall prey to the simplistic assumption that transnational families inevitably fail, or that the migration of parents leads to the neglect of their children (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0725513612450503">Arguillas and Williams 2010</xref>), we must also take care not to lose sight of the exploitation that is masked by the rhetoric of sacrifice in the experience of parent migration. Nor should we lose sight of the fact that not only is this phenomenon of maternal migration brought about by the economic underdevelopment of the sending region, but that the practice of relying on the care of children by extended kin and hired caregivers depends on the existence of a large unemployed population.</p>
<p>We ought to ask the question: which mothers and children ultimately benefit from this global circulation of care labor?<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn22-0725513612450503">22</xref>
</sup> In the final analysis, it is the class of women and children – whether in the Philippines (or other sending countries) or in the wealthier receiving nations – who have the resources to hire nannies without having to leave their children behind. This arrangement allows them to pursue careers, earn a comfortable living, or even devote themselves to a life of leisure. It allows rich economies to benefit from the export of domestic and care labor from poor nations.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn23-0725513612450503">23</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>When we affirm the limits of surrogacy, that is to say, when we set limits to the elasticity of the bond between mother and child, we acknowledge the claims of the body, and in particular, the claims of the body of the poor. In honoring the ‘claims of the body’, I do not mean to re-assert reductionist constructions of gender roles based on biological determinations. I mean, rather, that we ought to acknowledge the importance of physical proximity for both care and the growth of intimacy and to resist the tendency to deny the very real absence of the mother by transforming the maternal body into a metaphorical presence extended across space and time through the mediations of money and communication technologies.</p>
<p>By transforming the maternal body into a metaphor, the traditional understanding of maternity is able to accommodate maternal separation. Because maternity is conceived primarily in terms of the provision of care – characterized by a hovering presence and attention – and of unconditional self-sacrifice, as long as children have access to the maternal body, Philippine society is able to avail itself of its ideological conception of the <italic>mater dolorosa</italic> in order to justify both the continuation of its traditional gendered division of reproductive labor and its continued reliance on migrant labor for its economic survival.</p>
<p>Technological and economic arrangements have managed to maintain access to the maternal body by reconfiguring it into the form of <italic>constant text messaging </italic>and <italic>unremitting remittances</italic>. It is perhaps not too big a leap of the imagination to suggest that these texts messages – across oceans, no less – are reminiscent of the semiotic communication, unleashed by maternal separation, described by Kristeva in ‘<italic>Stabat Mater</italic>’: ‘wisps of words, droplets of sentences’. One could say the growth in electronic and telecommunications technology – which has also become the medium of remittances – has managed to blanket us in a virtual intrauterine space in which the distant mother can take up her position as a constant hovering presence, nourishing those of us left behind with her blood, milk, and tears.</p>
<p>This convergence of maternal suffering with the globalized presence of the metaphorically transformed maternal body begs the question whether the <italic>mater dolorosa</italic> reinforces mothering from a distance in yet another way besides through extolling maternal suffering. Is it possible that the figure of the Virgin Mary, as spiritual mother, both intimate and distant, shores up the metaphorization of maternal presence? Might we not say that the Virgin Mother, coupled with and supported by the global presence of Mother Church, provides a paradigm of maternal presence as a kind of sublimated semiotic?</p>
<p>By making <italic>Stabat Mater</italic> the focal point of her essay on maternity, Kristeva offers us a fortuitous insight into the link between surrogacy and the sublimation of the maternal body. The traditional Latin hymn, with which Kristeva christens the English version of her ‘<italic>Hérethique de l’amour</italic>’, takes us to the image of Mary at the foot of the cross. Here, in the scene where Christ entrusts his mother to the disciple John, and John – and by extension the whole Church – to his mother (John 19:26–27), we find surrogacy inscribed in the Catholic imagination.</p>
<p>The present essay suggests that this inscription of maternal surrogacy in the religious imagination gives rise to an ambivalent legacy. While it could be liberating for mothers and their children in promoting a positive acceptance of motherhood as an essentially adoptive (rather than a primarily biological) relation, in this case regarding the phenomenon of transnational and trans-regional mothering, it could also provide maternal separation a remarkable but rather problematic elasticity. By sublimating maternal presence in the distant but constantly hovering love of the Virgin Mother and/or the Mother Church, it seems that religion provides a compromise between traditional gendered notions of maternity and the new constraints imposed upon maternity by global economic, political, and social pressures, thus enabling existing notions of maternity and care work to resist critique and transformation.</p>
<p>Thus, in order to avoid conservative idealizations of maternal sacrifice, we need to re-assert the materiality of maternal presence against its reduction to the metaphorical maternal body. Paradoxically, however, it is precisely by going beyond the maternal body in our understanding of motherhood – by exceeding the paradigms of pregnancy and childbirth in our conceptualization of maternity – that we are able to respect the claims of embodiment, this time, more broadly construed. Although the accessibility of cell phones has made it possible for families to maintain togetherness, there simply is no substitute to proximity in coming to know the constantly changing moods, thoughts, desires, needs, aspirations, fears, and concerns of a loved one. Furthermore, while text messaging may work between parents and older children, it would not work as well for sustaining the intimate relation between mothers and very young children. A familial relationship is constituted by so much more than words exchanged – they are formed in the repetition of habits, in patterns of being-together, in meals cooked and shared, in spontaneous conversations as well as in silences. Hence, though text messages, emails, and web cam communications help in maintaining a relationship, these mediations are still a thin substitute for the close, day-to-day, wordless interactions that constitute living together.</p>
<p>In affirming the limits of surrogacy vis-à-vis the phenomenon of the migrant mother, we are challenging both the economic exploitation that engenders and sustains distant mothering as well as the gendered division of care labor that supports the global economy of care. Furthermore, by utilizing a psychoanalytic perspective, this analysis suggests that the double critique above has to be supplemented by a critique of the dangers of the sublimation of the maternal body. In order to avoid the ideological use of maternal love, the affirmation of the intrinsic relation between maternity and surrogacy has to be coupled with a renewed insistence on the claims of embodiment and a reinterpretation of the mother-child relation as a mutual relation of responsible intimacy.</p>

<p>I use ‘surrogates’ here in the broad sense of persons – <italic>de facto</italic> mostly women – who take on the work and responsibility of caring for and rearing children in the absence of mothers, whether biological or adoptive, and not in the specific sense of gestational surrogates.</p>

<p>The cleavage between natural and surgically mediated childbirth is another site of contestation, involving issues such as the woman’s autonomy vis-à-vis the medical establishment and attitudes towards alleviating the pain suffered by women in childbirth.

<p>I have in mind here, for instance, the idea of intensive mothering (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0725513612450503">Hays 1996</xref>) which – rather than parceling out maternal tasks and roles to different agents – expects the mother to be constantly present to the child. This ideal of motherhood is related to the isolation of the nuclear family from broader kinship structures with the spread of urbanization.</p>

<p>Culture itself determines what is natural and grounds itself in what it takes to be natural, and nature projects itself in cultural practices and institutions in order precisely to recapitulate itself as natural. The other side of this coin, of course, is that not only are nature and culture mutually determining but also, necessarily, mutually contesting.</p>

<p>Negotiating surrogacy should not only be about the mother’s concern that she not be replaced by the surrogate. Particularly when the mother-surrogate relation is also one between employer and employee, questions of justice and of exploitation as well as the caregiver’s need for intimacy should also be addressed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0725513612450503">Tronto 2002</xref>).</p>

<p>The semiotic can be understood as a primal level of signification, more visceral and rhythmic than conceptual and theoretical. Andrew Cutrofello offers a succinct explanation of Kristeva’s semiotic: ‘Freud’s distinction between primary and secondary processes is said to correspond to the difference between the “semiotic” and “symbolic” levels of discourse. … Prior to the subject’s acquisition of the linguistic competence to make judgments … the pre-thetic subject is immersed in a semiotic “chora” or primal space in which the drives manifest themselves in a relatively free state. … The chora is characterized by the proto-syntactic processes of displacement (metonymy) and condensation (metaphor).’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0725513612450503">Cutrofello 2005</xref>: 196; cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0725513612450503">Kristeva 1984</xref>)</p>

<p>Although it could be granted that Kristeva’s semiotic offers a way of linking the maternal experience to signification, because of its association with the pre-symbolic, one runs the risk of relegating feminine discourse – and in particular, that of maternity – outside of signification. See Baraitser’s contention that Kristeva continues to link maternity with ineffability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0725513612450503">Baraitser, 2009</xref>: 5–7).</p>

<p>Sarah Kofman reverses this relation of melancholic identification in her reading of Oscar Wilde’s <italic>Dorian Gray</italic>, ‘The Imposture of Beauty’.

<p>It is perhaps not an accident that patriarchal views of women that reduce women to their maternal role – and in so doing, fixate the mother-child relation upon the paradigm of intrauterine identification – also tend to infantilize women.

<p>It is not only the mother’s need for intimacy that has to be acknowledged but also the surrogate’s need for reciprocity. As Aguilar notes, ‘For all their hardships and sacrifices in looking after the child, caregivers consciously do not want to entertain expectations about the future. Unlike parents who expect their children to look after them when they grow old … caregivers feel they have no right to such care in their old age’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0725513612450503">Aguilar et al. 2009</xref>: 324).</p>

<p>It should also be noted that the recipients of care from migrant mothers benefit from the workers’ separation from their own families in yet another way, namely, through what Parreñas calls displaced or diverted mothering or caretaking: ‘Unable to take care of their own families, migrant Filipina domestic workers, like the non-migrant domestics forced into “diverted mothering” in the United States, find themselves needing to “pour [their] love” onto their wards. As Vicky Diaz, a mother in Los Angeles who left five children between the ages of 2 and 10 years old in the Philippines 10 years ago, describes her relationship to her ward, ‘The only thing you can do is give all your love to the child. In my absence from my children, the most I could do with my situation is to give all my love to that child’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0725513612450503">Parreñas 2006b</xref>: 59).</p>
