<p>The aim of this study was to examine histological changes in bone morphology after surgical treatment of tibial plateau fractures using calcium phosphate cement as a substitute for autologous bone grafting. A total of 42 patients with tibial plateau fractures were treated with open reduction, internal fixation, and calcium phosphate cement. A further 34 control patients underwent open reduction and internal fixation. Bone samples for histology were obtained during the surgery. Bone healing and functional recovery were assessed. Bone cell counts were significantly higher in samples obtained during the second surgery (81.2) compared with the first surgery (45.4, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001). Bone healing scores significantly increased with time after surgery (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001). Mean Hospital for Special Surgery knee scores were rated “good” for both the calcium phosphate cement group (82.3) and control group (79.4) in 12 months, and were not significantly different between groups. Histological examination of samples obtained during the second surgery revealed well-arranged trabeculae, in addition to new bone and blood vessel formation. These histological, radiological, and functional findings suggest that calcium phosphate cement may be an effective substitute for autologous bone grafting to treat tibial plateau fractures.</p>

<sec id="sec1-0885328212443295" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title>
<p>Tibial plateau fractures are relatively common, particularly in the elderly. As the tibia is a weight-bearing bone, restoration of the tibial plateau is essential to ensure a return to normal functionality after fracture and to reduce the risk of later osteoarthritis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0885328212443295">1</xref></sup> Surgical treatment of tibial plateau fractures typically involves anatomical reduction of the fracture, placement of autogenous bone grafts into any cancellous bone defects, and internal fixation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0885328212443295">2</xref></sup> The filling of bone defects during tibial plateau fracture surgery is critical to ensure a satisfactory outcome.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0885328212443295">3</xref></sup> Although autologous bone grafting can be effective to this end,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0885328212443295">4</xref></sup> this approach is associated with several well-known problems, including donor site pain, infection, and morbidity. Hence, alternative materials have been investigated to fill bone defects in tibial plateau fracture repair. Alternatives include calcium sulfate, bone matrix gelatin, and hydroxyapatite, all of which differ in their size and morphology. Recently, a mixture of calcium sulfate hemihydrate and amorphous calcium phosphate has been shown to promote new bone formation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0885328212443295">5</xref></sup> Supplementing this material with collagen shows promise as well.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0885328212443295">6</xref></sup> Bone matrix gelatin has been successfully used as a bone repair material in animal studies, in vitro experiments, and clinical case studies.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0885328212443295">7</xref></sup></p>
<p>Calcium phosphate cement (CPC), which has favorable physical and structural characteristics for use as a bone graft alternative,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0885328212443295">8</xref></sup> has been effectively used as a synthetic bone void filler in dental and orthopedic procedures for many years.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0885328212443295">9</xref></sup> Over the last decade, a number of clinical and cadaveric studies have examined the use of CPC to treat tibial plateau fractures. Findings from these studies generally suggest that CPC is an effective, or superior, substitute for autologous bone to treat tibial plateau fractures.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0885328212443295">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0885328212443295"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0885328212443295">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0885328212443295">10</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0885328212443295"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0885328212443295"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0885328212443295"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0885328212443295">14</xref></sup></p>
<p>No clinical study to date, however, has examined histological changes in bone following the use of CPC to treat tibial plateau fractures. Hence, the aim of this study was to examine histological changes in bone morphology after tibial plateau fracture repair using CPC. Bone tissue sample were obtained from the fracture site at the time of fracture repair and thereafter at the same site during removal of the internal fixator. We also examined bone healing, through radiographic imaging, and functional recovery.</p>

<sec id="sec2-0885328212443295" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title>
<sec id="sec3-0885328212443295"><title>Study design and patients</title>
<p>This was a retrospective case analysis study involving 42 patients with tibial plateau fractures who were treated at Minhang Central Hospital (affiliated with Shanghai Jiao Tong University) between January 2006 and May 2010. Inclusion criteria for surgery were unstable fracture, poor joint alignment, and more than 5 mm of articular surface collapse. If there was a residual cavity remaining after articular surface collapse, tricalcium phosphate was applied as a bone graft substitute when appropriate. Treatment involved bone grafting with CPC and internal fixation for all 42 patients. A further 34 patients with tibial plateau fractures who received articular surface restoration and internal fixation only were included as a control group. The diagnosis of tibial plateau fracture was made with reference to plain radiographs of the knee. Because of the specificity of the orthopedic surgery, economic factors may also influence the selection of treatment methods besides the individual differences. Therefore, patients who agreed to undergo bone grafting were included in the experimental group, and those who rejected bone grafting were included in the control group. The study protocol was approved by the Ethics Committee of our hospital, and patients provided written, informed consent to participate. Bone tissue was harvested only from patients who agreed to histological examination.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec4-0885328212443295"><title>Surgical procedures</title>
<p>Knee joint X-rays were obtained before surgery to assess the degree of articular surface collapse. Additional computed tomographic scanning and subsequent 3-dimensional image reconstruction were performed to more precisely determine the severity of fracture comminution and articular collapse and to aid surgical planning.</p>
<p>A lateral parapatellar approach was used for surgery. An incision was made from a point 3 cm proximal to the distal end of the patella and distally extended over the inferior margin of the fracture site. A percutaneous insertion approach with a proximal incision was made superior to the lateral plateau and extended over the fracture site to expose the tibial plateau and the proximal part of the tibia. This facilitated convenient fracture reduction by leverage. A distal incision was made according to the length of the plate. A cortical bone window was made under the collapsed area and a periosteal elevator was inserted below the articular fracture fragment at the site of collapse. A few cancellous bone fragments were harvested for histological examination. The articular fracture fragment was elevated slowly and carefully and the cancellous bone was pressed together to form a large bone fragment. The bone fragment was further elevated to form a flat articular surface. At this point, the fracture fragment was temporarily fixed using K-wire or clamped. The cavity formed in the metaphysis was filled with porous CPC (Shanghai Bio-Lu Biomaterials Co. Ltd., Shanghai, China). A cancellous lag screw was then inserted for fixation of the reduced fragment and tibial plate(s) placed as necessary.</p>
<p>For patients with Schatzker type I to III fractures, plates were positioned on the lateral side of distal tibia, whereas plates were positioned on the medial side for patients with Schatzker type IV fractures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0885328212443295">Figure 1</xref>).

</fig></p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec5-0885328212443295"><title>Postoperative care</title>
<p>Antibiotics were routinely given for the first 24 h after surgery for closed fractures and for the first 48 to 72 h after surgery for open fractures. A plaster cast or brace was used for external fixation. Dressings were regularly changed and wound healing was monitored. If wound healing was satisfactory in 3 to 4 days after surgery, the external fixator was removed. During the secondary surgery to remove the internal fixator, a few cancellous bone fragments in the bone graft area were harvested for additional histological examination. The patient was instructed to begin quadriceps contraction and relaxation exercises and slight active motion. Early knee joint exercise was carried out using a continuous passive motion device. Weight-bearing activities were prohibited for the first 3 months after surgery. Patients were allowed to begin partial weight-bearing exercises, according to the state of bone healing, 12 to 16 weeks after surgery. Patients were instructed not to engage in heavy manual labour in full weight-bearing within the first 6 months of surgery.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec6-0885328212443295"><title>Outcome measures</title>
<p>Regular follow-up was carried out for patients to observe the postoperative clinical outcomes using X-ray, Hospital for Special Surgery (HSS) score, and SF-36 score.</p>
<sec id="sec7-0885328212443295"><title>Bone healing and functional recovery</title>
<p>Postoperative follow-up examinations were performed at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months after surgery to evaluate bone healing and functional recovery.</p>
<p>Bone healing was rated using the following criteria:
<list id="list1-0885328212443295" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p>+: Periosteal reaction is evident, with patchy callus.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>++: Callus is extended, forming a bridge with the connection between the new periosteal bone superior and inferior to the fracture line.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>+++: Callus is connected with the fracture site, the boundary is smooth, the density is high but uneven, and there is no bone lamella.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>++++: Periosteal reaction has subsided, the callus is small and absorbed, the density is even, and there are bone lamella and cortical bone connections.</p></list-item>
</list></p>
<p>Bone healing was not assessed for patients in the control group.</p>
<p>Functional recovery was evaluated by determining the HSS knee score 12 months after surgery.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0885328212443295">15</xref></sup> This score considers knee pain, function, activity, muscle power, flexion deformity, stability, brace usage, extension, and the presence of valgus and varus deformities. The maximum HSS knee score is 100 points, with a score of ≥85 indicating excellent function, a score of 70 to 84 points indicating good function, a score of 60 to 69 points indicating fair function, and a score of &lt;60 points indicating poor function.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec8-0885328212443295"><title>Histological changes in bone morphology</title>
<p>The clinical and histological differences for the group with bone grafting and the group without bone grafting were compared according to the results of histological examination of the bone tissue obtained during the initial surgery and during the surgery to remove the internal fixators. These samples were fixed in 10% formalin, decalcified, dehydrated, and embedded in paraffin. Longitudinal sections (0.1 µm) were cut and stained with hematoxylin and eosin. These sections were then examined using an optical microscope (model PMLS, Leica Microsystems GmbH, Wetzlar, Germany). A total of 10 fields were randomly selected and the number of inner bone cells in the bone matrix (850 µm × 850 µm area) was counted. Bone tissue samples were not obtained from patients in the control group due to the ethical consideration.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="sec9-0885328212443295"><title>Statistical analysis</title>
<p>Continuous data are presented as means ± standard deviation. Between-group comparisons were made using independent two sample t-tests. Assessments made at initial surgery and at follow-up surgery to remove internal fixators were compared. Categorical data are presented as counts and percentages. Between-group comparisons for nominal data were made using Fisher’s exact test, whereas ordinal data were compared using Mann-Whitney test. The repeated measures of bone healing after surgery were compared by using Friedman’s test and Wilcoxon Signed Rank test (post-hoc). Spearman correlation coefficients (ρ) were determined to evaluate the relationships between both Schatzker classification type and age and postoperative outcomes (ρ ≤ 0.3 indicated low correlation; 0.3 &lt; ρ ≤ 0.7 indicated moderate correlation; ρ ≥ 0.7 indicated high correlation). All statistical assessments were two-sided with a significance level of <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05. Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS 15.0 statistical software (SPSS Institute Inc., Chicago, IL).</p>

<p>Joint pain gradually decreased with time after surgery as determined during follow-up visits. Joint stability and activity levels gradually improved with time after surgery to normal levels. There were no instances of further collapse or infection in the CPC group. One patient in the CPC group experienced wound oozing on the second day after the first surgical procedure. Bacterial culture of the wound fluid was negative. This patient received local treatment and wound healing was apparent 1 week later. One patient in the control group experienced recurrent tibial plateau collapse after the first surgical procedure.</p>

<p>This is a clinical study to examine histological changes at the site of tibial plateau fracture after fracture repair involving open reduction and internal fixation, using CPC as a substitute for autologous bone to fill bone defects. We observed histological evidence of bone healing in patients who received CPC as indicated by well-arranged trabeculae, new bone and blood vessel formation, and significantly increased bone cell counts. Importantly, radiographic assessment indicated significantly improved bone healing with time after surgery and functional recovery was graded “good” in 12 months after surgery.</p>
<p>Although no previous clinical studies have been reported to examine histological changes following tibial plateau fracture repair involving the use of CPC, several comparable animal studies have been performed. Consistent with our findings in humans, Frankenburg and his colleagues observed new bone and small blood vessel formation in dogs in which CPC was placed in proximal tibial and femoral metaphyseal defects.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0885328212443295">8</xref></sup> Furthermore, CPC was found to exhibit properties comparable to normal cancellous bone. This vascularization in the area of CPC placement is particularly critical for osteogenesis and bone healing and is thus an important characteristic of CPC. Also consistent with our findings, Nandi and colleagues reported the presence of bone marrow material, lipid cells, and blood vessels in histological sections obtained from sites of radial diaphyseal bone defects filled with CPC in goats.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0885328212443295">16</xref></sup></p>
<p>In keeping with the histological evidence of bone healing, we also observed radiological evidence of bone healing after use of CPC to treat tibial plateau fractures, which increased with time after surgery. Specifically, bone healing was rated as ++++ (73.8%) or +++ (26.2%) in all patients 12 months after surgery. These findings are consistent with those reported in similar clinical studies examining the use of CPC to treat tibial plateau fractures, in which the majority (≥ 93%) of patients exhibited excellent to good Rasmussen radiological scores.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0885328212443295">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0885328212443295">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0885328212443295">13</xref></sup> Also consistent with these studies, we observed that resorption of CPC was complete within 9 to 12 months after surgery.</p>
<p>To our knowledge, only one study in the literature has examined functional outcomes by assessing HSS knee scores after the use of CPC to treat tibial plateau fractures. In our study, the mean HSS knee score 12 months after surgery was 82.3 (indicating “good” function), whereas the mean HSS knee scores were 91.8, 82.7, and 78.2 for Schatzker type II (<italic>n</italic> = 73), V (<italic>n</italic> = 34), and VI (<italic>n</italic> = 17) fractures in the study performed by Shen and colleagues.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0885328212443295">4</xref></sup> Hence, the mean overall score was higher in the study performed by Shen and colleagues,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0885328212443295">4</xref></sup> perhaps reflecting the slightly different distribution of fracture types between studies. Several other studies have examined knee function by assessing Lysholm knee scores after the use of CPC to treat tibial plateau fractures and reported good to excellent outcomes in the majority (≥81%) of patients.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0885328212443295">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0885328212443295">13</xref></sup></p>
<p>This study is limited by the lack of control data for the histological and radiological findings. Clearly, the optimal control for a study of this nature would have been patients undergoing the same procedures but having autologous bone grafting, rather than CPC, to fill bone defects. Hence, we cannot comment on the relative bone healing of autologous bone grafting. Nevertheless, we believe that our findings, which demonstrated definite histological evidence of bone healing following use of CPC in tibial plateau fracture repair, are relevant and of interest. Certainly, a direct histological comparison of outcomes between approaches (CPC vs autologous bone) would be of significant interest.</p>
<p>In conclusion, the histological, radiological, and functional findings suggest that CPC may be an effective substitute for autologous bone grafting to trea tibial plateau fractures.</p>
