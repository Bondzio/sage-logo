We searched the Pediatric Health Information Systems database to identify boys undergoing revision circumcision (RC), primary non-newborn circumcision (PC), or lysis of penile adhesions (LPA) from 2004 to 2009.

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Circumcision is the most common surgical procedure performed on boys worldwide.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0009922813492878">1</xref></sup> In the United States, the incidence of newborn circumcision (NC) has been estimated to be 57% to 61%.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0009922813492878">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0009922813492878">3</xref></sup> Although circumcision is an elective procedure often done for cultural or religious reasons, several health benefits are recognized<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0009922813492878">4</xref></sup> and are supported by recent large randomized trials.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0009922813492878">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0009922813492878"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0009922813492878">7</xref></sup> Although surgical complication rates are low (0.2% to 16%,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0009922813492878">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0009922813492878">9</xref></sup> with most estimates at 1% to 2%<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0009922813492878">9</xref></sup>) concerns about the cosmetic outcome (skin adhesions, hidden penis, redundant residual tissue) may prompt revision circumcision (RC) in up to 10% of cases.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0009922813492878">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0009922813492878">11</xref></sup> There are few data available regarding either family satisfaction with NC outcomes or rates of RC.

<title>Patients and Methods</title>
<sec id="section3-0009922813492878">
<title>Data Source</title>
<p>We queried the Pediatric Health Information System (PHIS), a national administrative and billing database from freestanding children’s hospitals affiliated with the Child Health Corporation of America (Shawnee Mission, KS). PHIS is composed of more than 1 000 000 pediatric patient encounters annually, including data from inpatient admissions, ambulatory medical and/or surgical short-stay areas, and emergency department visits. PHIS data accuracy is jointly screened on a quarterly basis by the Child Health Corporation of America, an independent data manager (Thomson Healthcare, Durham, NC), and by each participating hospital. Data are accepted into PHIS only when classified errors occur in less than 2% of a hospital’s quarterly data. For this study, we included data only from those hospitals that contributed data on all inpatient, ambulatory surgery, and short-stay visits for a given quarter; hospitals that contributed only partial data (eg, inpatient visits only) were excluded during that period. Data from 28 hospitals were included in this study, including 13 hospitals contributing data for the entire study period.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0009922813492878">
<title>Patient Population</title>
<p>We identified all hospital encounters occurring between January 2004 and December 2009 for patients 18 years old or younger with Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) procedure code 54163 (revision of incomplete circumcision). For comparison purposes, we also identified all patients undergoing non-newborn surgical primary circumcision (PC, CPT 54161), and lysis of postcircumcision penile adhesions (LPA, CPT 54162). We excluded those patients with 2 or more of the above codes and also patients undergoing RC, PC, or LPA as part of a more complex penile procedure, including hypospadias/urethral repair, chordee correction, or other penile procedures (biopsies, plastic procedures, and removal of penile lesions). Boys undergoing concurrent frenulotomy were included (n = 19).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0009922813492878">
<title>Variable Selection</title>
<p>The primary outcome was the hospital-specific incidence of RC, defined as the ratio of the number of RC to the total male ambulatory surgical volume at that hospital, assessed quarterly, from 2004 through 2009. Because the CPT code for RC was introduced in 2002,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0009922813492878">14</xref></sup> increases in usage of this code in subsequent years may have been due, in part, to the adoption of a new code. We therefore specifically included LPA (the CPT code for which was also introduced in 2002) as a control for incremental adoption of a new code.</p>
<p>We identified other (nonpenile) surgical procedures performed concomitantly to examine for convenience as an explanatory factor. These other procedures were grouped into the following categories: hernia/hydrocele, orchidopexy, varicocele, other scrotal surgery, genitourinary (GU) endoscopy, other GU procedures, umbilical hernia, tympanostomy, and other non-GU procedures. Insurance status was defined as public or private payer. Demographic data were collected, including self-reported race/ethnicity (white, black, Latino, or other), and these were compared with the entire cohort of male ambulatory surgery patients at the included PHIS hospitals.</p>
<p>Approximate resource costs were derived from hospital billing records, adjusted by the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services’ wage/price index for the hospital’s location and the ratio of charge to cost. These adjusted cost estimates closely approximate the hospital level resource consumption for these services (as opposed to hospital charges, which do not).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0009922813492878">15</xref></sup> Mean and median costs for RC were determined from encounters where RC was the only procedure performed. PHIS data include hospital charges only; physician reimbursements are not captured.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0009922813492878">
<title>Statistical Methods</title>
<p>We compared the change in incidence of RC with that of PC and LPA over time using Poisson regression. RC incidence rate was defined as the number of cases of a given procedure during a given quarter, divided by the total male ambulatory surgery volume for that quarter. General linear mixed models with hospital as a repeated subject and the study quarter as a random effect variable were used to account for hospital-level clustering. In addition, demographic trends were tested using Mantel–Haenszel χ<sup>2</sup> trend or analysis of variance based on data characteristics. All analyses were performed using SAS version 9.2 (SAS Institute, Inc, Cary, NC). All tests were 2-sided and <italic>P</italic> values of less than 0.05 were considered significant.</p>
<p>Institutional review board approval was obtained from Children’s Hospital Boston and administrative approval was obtained from the PHIS administrator prior to data collection and analysis.</p>

<title>Study Population</title>
<p>We identified 39 813 male surgeries at PHIS hospitals with CPT codes for RC, PC, or LPA between January 2004 and December 2009. We excluded 13% of the sample (5245/39 813 for simultaneous penile procedures as described above) leaving 34 568 for analysis, of whom 5632 underwent RC, 25 768 underwent PC, and 3168 underwent LPA. During the same period, there were a total of 676 369 male ambulatory surgical procedures at the included hospitals.</p>
<p>The mean (±standard deviation) age of boys undergoing RC was 2.5 (±2.8) years (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0009922813492878">Table 1</xref>) and did not significantly change from year to year (<italic>P</italic> = .35). Boys undergoing RC were predominantly white (60%) and publicly insured (62%). The race and insurance status of boys undergoing RC did not show any significant trends over the course of the study period (χ<sup>2</sup> trend <italic>P</italic> = .72 and <italic>P</italic> = .13, respectively). Of all male ambulatory surgeries, 67% were white and 59% had public insurance (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .01).</p>

<title>Trends in Revision Circumcision</title>
<p>The total number of RC procedures in 2004 was 413 and increased annually to a total of 1436 in 2009. The ratio of RC to total male ambulatory surgical procedures increased by 119% from 2004 to 2009 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0009922813492878">Figure 1</xref>). The change in relative rate over time was significantly higher than increases in PC (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .001) or LPA (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .001) over the same time period. Rate increases were seen in all geographic regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0009922813492878">Figure 2</xref>). After using a mixed-effects model to account for hospital-level clustering, the differential rate increase for RC remained significantly higher than PC or LPA (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .001 for each). This suggests that the increases we report were not driven solely by a small subset of hospitals.</p>

Since the CPT code for LPA was released in 2002 along with the code for RC, the increases in LPA may be because of the effect of new code usage.

<title>Simultaneous Additional Procedures</title>
<p>Revision circumcision was performed concurrently with other procedures 24% of the time, and half of these were other GU procedures. The most common genitourinary procedure performed concurrently with RC was hernia/hydrocele repair, followed by orchidopexy, although non-GU procedures were the most common overall (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0009922813492878">Table 2</xref>). Urologists were more likely than pediatric surgeons to perform RC or PC as stand-alone procedures (RC, 77% vs 73%, <italic>P</italic> &lt; .01; PC, 81% vs 73%, <italic>P</italic> &lt; .01).

<p>The median adjusted hospital cost for boys that underwent RC as a solitary procedure was $1554 (interquartile range = $1156-$1944). The average annual cost at a given hospital for RC performed as a solitary procedure was $57 854 for a total of $6 884 631 from 2004 to 2009 at the 28 PHIS hospitals. These figures do not include time costs for families or physician costs.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In this study, we found that the rate of RC at PHIS hospitals, as a function of total surgical volume, increased by 119% from 2004 to 2009. There are several possible explanations for a rise in the incidence of RC: (<italic>a</italic>) increased RC may be due to a rise in the number of NC and PC (with resulting increases in absolute number of patients needing revision, even if the proportion needing revision remains constant); (<italic>b</italic>) an increase in the number of unsatisfactory outcomes after NC and PC (with resulting increases in the number needing revision); or (<italic>c</italic>) changing standards of satisfaction after NC and PC (with resulting increases in number of families desiring revision) despite a relatively stable number of typical-quality PCs.</p>
<p>The first possibility is that more NCs or PCs are being performed. Only boys who have had a prior circumcision are candidates for RC, so if the source population has grown, this could explain the increased rate of RC. Although some studies using national data have demonstrated an increase in newborn circumcision rates in recent years,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0009922813492878">2</xref></sup> other data have shown that the rate is largely flat (55% to 65% nationally) or even decreasing.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0009922813492878">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0009922813492878">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0009922813492878">17</xref></sup> The estimated number of live births in the United States increased 3% from 4 054 623 in 2004 to 4 186 618 in 2009.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0009922813492878">18</xref></sup> In light of these figures, it is highly improbable that an increase in RC of the magnitude we observed (&gt;100%) could be due entirely to increases in the total number of boys being circumcised.</p>
<p>Another explanation for increasing RC is that there has been a change in the quality of PCs, with the result that a higher proportion of individuals have unsatisfactory outcomes requiring revision. There is wide variation in the credentials, training, and experience of clinicians who perform NC; the procedure can be technically challenging and there is a natural tendency to err on the side of caution to minimize risk of penile injury. One study suggested that training in neonatal circumcision during general pediatric residency training was insufficient.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0009922813492878">19</xref></sup> Another study found significant variation in NC training among residency programs and whereas most family practice and obstetric programs teach NC, a majority of surveyed pediatric programs do not.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0009922813492878">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0009922813492878">21</xref></sup> Trainee experience with NC varies by institution and region, along with varying community practices and customs. Pediatric residents who train in a community where the obstetricians perform most newborn circumcisions may not be exposed to these procedures, and vice versa. All this variability in the practice of newborn circumcision could be associated with variations in quality that lead to an increase in need for revision. However, we are unaware of any empiric data that suggest that NC outcomes have changed significantly (for better or worse) over the past 20 years.</p>
<p>Finally, it may be that parental or clinician standards for penile appearance postcircumcision have evolved. Community standards regarding what a “properly” circumcised penis looks like may be changing, with families less likely to accept any redundant tissue and more motivated to pursue revision. Such trends would be difficult to measure and impossible to detect in our data.</p>
<p>We considered the possibility that RC is being performed more frequently as an adjunct procedure when a boy is already in the operating room for something else. In such circumstances, families might be willing to consider a penile “touch-up” for a problem that they might not otherwise be interested in pursuing as a stand-alone procedure. However, most RC procedures (76%) are not being performed concurrently with other procedures. Furthermore, we found no change in the proportion of RC performed with other procedures over time.</p>
<p>A majority of boys undergoing RC in our sample were publicly insured (62%), which was similar to proportion observed in the total ambulatory surgical cohort. Interestingly, insurance status is an important determinant of NC; newborns with private insurance are more likely to undergo neonatal circumcision than those with public or no insurance (64% vs 41% to 43%, respectively)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0009922813492878">2</xref></sup> and boys born in states where NC is not covered by Medicaid are less likely to be circumcised than those born in states where the procedure is covered.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0009922813492878">22</xref></sup> However, this does little to explain the rise in RC in our data since the public/private insurance mix did not change from 2004 to 2009 among those undergoing RC or those in the ambulatory surgery cohort.</p>
<p>The increasing trends in RC are not unique to a single geographic region. Although there is some variation in the increase of RC across geographic regions, this may reflect local differences such as varied adoption of the new CPT code, or local quality factors leading to different baseline 2004 numbers. A large proportion of our sample was derived from the South and Midwest regions where the baseline (2004) rates of RC were higher than average (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0009922813492878">Figure 2</xref>). However, the fact that increasing rates of RC are found in all regions suggests that causative factors could be present at a national level.</p>
<p>Revision circumcision is expensive relative to NC because of the need for general anesthesia and an operative suite. The cost of primary circumcision in older boys is higher than in newborns by a factor of 10.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0009922813492878">23</xref></sup> The median cost of an operative RC at the 28 children’s hospitals in our sample was $1554, similar to those reported by others.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0009922813492878">10</xref></sup> The total cost attributed to RC at PHIS hospitals during the study period was between $7 million and $9 million. These costs do not include surgeon reimbursement or any productivity losses for parents/caregivers during their child’s recovery. Furthermore, since these costs are estimated based on resource use, the “price tag” for third-party payers can be twice as much.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0009922813492878">15</xref></sup></p>
<p>This study’s results should be interpreted in light of its limitations. The PHIS database is derived from tertiary-care, freestanding children’s hospitals, and our patient population may not be typical of patients or treatment patterns seen at other hospital types. As such, it is unclear whether our results are generalizable to the wider community. Furthermore, we cannot determine the true denominator: the underlying number of boys who are “at risk” for undergoing revision circumcision. We worked around this limitation by comparing the number of RCs with the total number of ambulatory cases; if RC is stable as a proportion of total surgical volume, this implies that the relative rate of RC is largely unchanged over time. Also, because it is not possible to determine how many boys undergo neonatal circumcision in the community, we cannot be certain that the relatively stable rate of PC seen in our data correlates with the actual number of circumcisions performed in the region serviced by the corresponding hospitals. In addition, there could be shifts in local treatment patterns such that more RC are being performed in tertiary centers than in the past, with resulting increases in RC rates. However, we believe that it is unlikely that such shifts in market share would lead to the dramatic increases seen in our sample, in all regions of the country. Last, our analysis relies on the accuracy of the diagnostic and procedure codes included in PHIS; although the accuracy level of PHIS is high for an administrative database, it is possible at least some portion or our cohort may be incorrectly coded. This is especially true since the code for RC was not available until 2002. It could also be possible that trends in the choice of codes used may have affected our results. We have attempted to mitigate these effects by selecting 2004 as the starting year and concurrently examined LPA rates as a measure of new code usage; however, this adjustment may not fully account for the effects of the coding changes.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>The number of RCs performed at children’s hospitals increased from 2004 to 2009, more than doubling as a proportion of total ambulatory surgical volume. The reasons for this trend are uncertain, but possible explanations include decreased quality of newborn circumcision, increases in the total number of circumcisions being performed, or changing expectations regarding “normal” penile appearance after circumcision.</p>
