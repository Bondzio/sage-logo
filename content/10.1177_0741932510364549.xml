<abstract>
<p>Although mentoring programs for novice special education teachers have been highly touted, there is scant research describing either novice needs or mentor roles. This study is based on a sample of 66 randomly selected national board certified teachers (NBCTs) in special education in an effort to determine the nature and extent of their involvement in mentoring junior colleagues, both formally and informally. A previously published instrument was modified to determine the frequency of their engagement in various mentoring roles. Results indicated that formal mentoring involved more of the 19 identified mentor activities than did informal mentoring. Implications include a need for mentor training for NBCTs and for further exploration of mentoring roles in the professional literature.</p>

<p>In an effort to increase teacher quality and decrease turnover, teacher mentoring has been mandated for years in most states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0741932510364549">Rockoff, 2008</xref>). Because of the widespread teacher shortages and concerns about conditions of teaching in the field, the perceived need for mentoring of novice teachers in special education has never been greater (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0741932510364549">Coleman, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0741932510364549">Griffin, Winn, Otis-Wilborn, &amp; Kilgore, 2003</xref>). Novice special education teachers themselves appear to value informal mentoring (support from colleagues not tied to an assigned mentor) more highly than formal mentoring (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0741932510364549">Littrell, Billingsley, &amp; Cross, 1994</xref>). It is important to define these mentoring roles and to identify new professional development models that will encompass both wants and needs of novice teachers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0741932510364549">Griffin et al., 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>In the teaching profession, mentoring is defined as “a formalized relationship between a beginning teacher and a master teacher that provides support and assesses teaching skills” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0741932510364549">Education Commission of the States, 1999</xref>). Mentoring has long been considered a crucial part of novice teacher induction. In fact, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0741932510364549">Serpell (2000)</xref> states that mentoring “is identified by researchers as the most critical component of induction programs and by teachers as the most helpful” (p. 14). Despite its history, though, what is referred to as “mentoring” in the field of general education still varies widely, and there remains a lack of strong empirical evidence on teacher mentoring (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0741932510364549">Ingersoll &amp; Kralik, 2004</xref>). Even well-designed studies show conflicting evidence regarding the effects of teacher mentoring (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0741932510364549">Glazerman et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0741932510364549">Rockoff, 2008</xref>). Although knowledge of “what works” in mentoring is nearly nonexistent, more mentoring does appear to be better, in that more time spent with a mentor appears to have a positive impact on teaching skills and may contribute to teacher retention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0741932510364549">Rockoff, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>However, it could be argued that mentoring of novice teachers is even more important in special education than it is in general education. Common issues reported among novice special educators include a sense of isolation, lack of support, confusion over job responsibilities, and serious attrition rates that often surpass those in general education (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0741932510364549">Gehrke &amp; Murri, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0741932510364549">Kaff, 2004</xref>). It is clear that mentoring also plays a large role in teacher induction in the field of special education. For example, in 2003, Billingsley reported that 65% of novice special educators had a formal mentoring program available to them. Research has shown that mentoring in special education has the potential to improve teacher quality, prevent attrition, and boost job satisfaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0741932510364549">Griffin et al., 2003</xref>). In her comprehensive review of the literature on teacher attrition and retention in special education, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0741932510364549">Billingsley (2003)</xref> urges a focus on special educators’ early careers to ameliorate attrition, as that is when most teachers leave the field. However, the research in this area remains quite thin.</p>
<p>A comprehensive review of the literature on new teacher induction in special education found only 11 studies conducted between 1991 and 2001 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0741932510364549">Boyer, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0741932510364549">Boyer &amp; Lee, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0741932510364549">Cheney, Krajewski, &amp; Combs, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0741932510364549">Cooley &amp; Yavanoff, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0741932510364549">Hopkins, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0741932510364549">Kueker &amp; Haensly, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0741932510364549">Lane &amp; Canosa, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0741932510364549">Maddex, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0741932510364549">Tucker, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0741932510364549">Whitaker, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0741932510364549">White, 1996</xref>) that met the criteria of “systematically documenting and analyzing (programmatic) features and outcomes” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0741932510364549">Griffin et al., 2003</xref>, p. 21). These studies suggest that effective components of teacher mentoring programs include (a) frequent face-to-face contact between mentor and mentee, (b) similar positions of mentor and mentee, (c) a nonevaluative role of the mentor, (d) an understanding of the mentoring process on the part of both parties, and (e) a type of support that matches the novices’ needs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0741932510364549">Griffin et al., 2003</xref>). In particular, novice teachers in special education appear to find “emotional, procedural, curricular, and instructional information” from a teacher with a similar assignment to be most beneficial (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0741932510364549">Gehrke &amp; McCoy, 2007</xref>, p. 497).</p>
<p>Unfortunately, little is known about types of support either needed by novices or provided by mentors. Although novice special education teachers rate informal support from colleagues higher than other forms of support (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0741932510364549">Billingsley, Carlson, &amp; Klein, 2004</xref>), research has continued to focus on the formal mentorship arrangement, in which a mentor is assigned to a novice for purposes of professional development for the novice. Furthermore, the roles of neither formal nor informal mentoring are well defined in the professional literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0741932510364549">Griffin et al., 2003</xref>). Mentoring involves a complex set of responsibilities. Those who act as mentors tend to be influenced in their role performance by the kind and quality of the mentoring they themselves received (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0741932510364549">Hall, Draper, Smith, &amp; Bullough, 2008</xref>). The lack of both data on who becomes a mentor and reporting on those mentors’ voices is another weakness in the literature in both general and special education. For example, although the latest Schools and Staffing Survey tells us the percentage of new teachers nationally (nearly 70%) who report having a mentor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0741932510364549">Rockoff, 2008</xref>) and those who report being engaged in mentoring, there is no way to separate mentors from mentees or to compare the mentoring of general and special education teachers (K. Gruber, personal communication, September 30, 2009). An extensive review of this literature uncovered only two studies of mentoring in special education that included the mentors themselves as study participants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0741932510364549">Griffin et al., 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>The present study begins to address some of the gaps in the literature base on teacher mentoring in special education. These gaps include a lack of focus on informal as well as formal mentoring, the lack of role definition, and the lack of knowledge from the perspective of mentors themselves. The research examines both formal and informal mentoring in special education. Participants were a group of national board certified teachers (NBCTs) in special education who were thought to be likely mentors to answer the following questions:</p>
<list id="list1-0741932510364549" list-type="order">
<list-item>
<p>Are NBCT special education teachers actually participating in such mentoring?</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>What is the extent of both formal and informal mentoring roles?</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>What are the teachers’ perceptions of these roles?</p>
</list-item>
</list>
<p>National board certification was created in 1987 as a way for teachers to achieve an advanced credential and recognition of their teaching effectiveness. Nearly 74,000 teachers have earned this title. To achieve this recognition, teachers must complete an extensive application, which includes creating portfolios and videotapes of teaching and documenting how their accomplishments outside the classroom affect their teaching. Several research studies have documented these teachers’ positive impact on student learning (National Board for Professional Teaching Standards <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0741932510364549">[NBPTS], 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>Although these claims of the increased effectiveness of NBCTs have been challenged, this study makes use of the population of NBCTs for several reasons. First, research indicates that these individuals are statistically more likely to assist colleagues with instructional matters than their peers without NBCT status (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0741932510364549">Frank et al., 2008</xref>). Second, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0741932510364549">Frank et al. (2008)</xref> identify the need for more detail to understand the nature of this particular “helping” relationship, including “the actual content of the exchanges of help” (p. 24). Finally, because of the particular emphasis in the literature on informal versus formal mentoring of novice special educators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0741932510364549">Griffin et al., 2003</xref>), this study seeks to document the frequency and nature of these two types of mentoring. In sum, the present study seeks to broaden our understanding of these teachers’ roles as mentors.</p>

<title>Participants</title>
<p>Of the 646 NBCTs in the exceptional needs specialist/early childhood through young adulthood category who were certified in 2006 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0741932510364549">NBPTS, 2007</xref>), 100 were randomly selected for inclusion in the study. The current study was conducted in 2007, so 1 year had elapsed between the time of participants’ certification and their participation in the current study. Out of the total sample of 100 NBCTs, 66 individuals responded to the survey, constituting a 66% return rate. Participants’ mean age was 44, with a standard deviation of 8. Their mean number of years teaching experience was 17, with a standard deviation of 7. Of the participants 94% were female. Nearly all (92%) identified themselves as Caucasian, 3% were African American, 3% were Other, and 2% were Asian. These demographics compare to a population of NBCT teachers in special education that is 95% female and 89% Caucasian, with an average age of 41 and 12 years of teaching experience (S. Fox, personal communication, January 10, 2008).</p>

<sec id="section3-0741932510364549">
<title>Instrumentation</title>
<p>The survey instrument used in this study was adapted from the <italic>Mentors’ Survey</italic> created by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0741932510364549">Maddex (1994)</xref>, which was developed by the author to assess participation in mentoring programs in general and special education in Virginia in particular. It was designed to measure mentoring roles and activities gleaned from the professional literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0741932510364549">Maddex, 1994</xref>). Maddex’s instrument identified eight mentor roles: observation, consultant, evaluation, sharing teaching techniques, learning school culture, learning school curriculum, collegial support, and community assistance. Within each of these roles, 1 to 5 activities were identified, resulting in 24 activities. For each of the 24 activities, participants were asked whether they did or did not participate in each (yes or no) and then were asked to comment on benefits and concerns regarding that role (open-ended response). <italic>Mentors’ Survey</italic> was developed in two stages: oral interviews with experienced teachers and field tests with both experienced and novice teachers.</p>
<p>The instrument used in the current study is a modification of Maddex’s instrument. First, some mentoring activities were combined, resulting in 19 activities. Second, rather than requiring a forced-choice (yes or no) response as well as an open-ended response to each activity, a 4-point scale (<italic>daily, weekly, monthly, never</italic>) was used to indicate the frequency of the activities. This modification was intended to provide ease of completion and facilitate quantitative data analysis.</p>
<p>Because of the importance of understanding both formal and informal mentoring, participants were asked this set of questions twice, once referring to their most recent formal mentoring relationship (defined in the instrument as “one set up by the school or district”) and once referring to their most recent informal mentoring relationship. They were specifically asked to refer to other special educators they had mentored. At the end of each set of questions, participants were asked one open-ended question about the relationship they had just quantified: “Please describe the nature of your relationship with your mentor/mentee and give an example that illustrates your response.” Reliability among the 19 frequency questions was calculated at alpha = .94.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0741932510364549">
<title>Procedures</title>
<p>Potential participants were identified through the NBPTS Web site (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.nbpts.org">http://www.nbpts.org</ext-link>). The 100 individuals were contacted first via email and asked to complete a Web-based survey. A total of 32 responded via email. The remaining 68 nonrespondents were contacted 2 weeks later and sent a paper-and-pencil copy of the survey.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0741932510364549">
<title>Data Analysis</title>
<p>Simple descriptive statistics were used to summarize quantitative data. Chi-square tests (for nominal data) were used to compare the amount of time spent in formal versus informal mentoring on the following five selected questions:</p>
<list id="list2-0741932510364549" list-type="order">
<list-item>
<p>How often did you observe the mentee?</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>How often did you offer constructive feedback after the observation?</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>How often did you share classroom management techniques with the mentee?</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>How often did you give guidance to the mentee on implementation of curriculum?</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>How often did you give emotional support to the mentee?</p>
</list-item>
</list>
<p>These five questions were determined to be the most critical of the 19 mentor roles identified by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0741932510364549">Maddex (1994)</xref>. Selection of these questions was based on a thorough literature review in new teacher mentoring in special education. Selected questions cover (a) what new teachers say they need most, based on the professional literature (behavior management, emotional support) and (b) what experts in the field believe new teachers need the most (observation, constructive feedback, guidance on curriculum implementation; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0741932510364549">Ball &amp; Cohen, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0741932510364549">Feiman-Nemser, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0741932510364549">Griffin et al., 2003</xref>). As cut scores for statistical significance, <italic>p</italic> values of .01 were used. This conservative approach to determining significance was used to account for the multiple comparison error incurred when five separate comparisons are made.</p>
<p>Finally, data from the open-ended questions describing the mentor–mentee relationship were analyzed. Three readers coded the data using the following categories, based on the percentage of each response that was positive, negative, or neutral: negative, qualified negative, neutral, qualified positive, and positive. Points were then assigned to responses (negative = 1, qualified negative = 2, etc.). A fuller explanation and an example of coding categories are reported in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0741932510364549">Table 1</xref>. Interrater reliability for qualitative data coding was established at 91.2%. A paired samples <italic>t</italic> test was then used to compare means of participants’ description of formal and informal mentoring experiences.</p>

<p>Data in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0741932510364549">Table 2</xref> indicate the most common mentoring roles and how frequently NBCTs noted performing each of these roles. There were seven roles when describing their formal mentoring relationships that appeared to be common to mentors (as evidenced by a mean frequency between “daily” and weekly”). These seven roles included sharing instructional techniques, sharing classroom management techniques, giving guidance on implementation of curriculum, giving professional advice, providing emotional support, giving encouragement, and building mentee confidence. By contrast, there were four roles that were common to mentors in informal mentoring, in that they reported fulfilling each role on at least a weekly basis. These roles included providing emotional support, providing professional advice, providing encouragement, and building confidence.</p>
<p>Least common roles were those in which participants indicated fulfilling that role less than “monthly.” Two such uncommon roles were identified in formal mentoring: release time to consult with the mentee and participating in the mentee’s evaluation. Five such roles were identified in informal mentoring relationships. In addition to the two listed above, informal mentors also appeared to be least likely to have formal conferences after observations, conduct demonstration lessons, and plan lessons with the mentee.</p>
<p>Statistical analysis of the five selected comparisons showed a statistically significant difference between amount of time spent in formal versus informal mentoring in two of the five questions. First, mentors were more likely to observe the novices in formal than informal mentoring, χ<sup>2</sup>(3) = 13.213, <italic>p</italic> = .004. Second, mentors were more likely to provide guidance on implementation of curriculum in formal mentoring relationships, χ<sup>2</sup>(3) = 13.043, <italic>p</italic> = .005. No differences were found between formal and informal mentoring in terms of amount of time spent in offering constructive feedback after observations, sharing classroom management techniques, or providing emotional support.</p>
<p>Out of the 40 respondents who indicated they participated in formal mentoring, 37 (92.5%) commented on the nature of their formal mentoring relationships, and out of the 50 who participated in informal mentoring, 43 (86.0%) commented on the nature of these relationships. As shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0741932510364549">Table 3</xref>, participants’ comments concerning both formal and informal mentoring were quite positive. For example, 91.9% of comments regarding formal mentoring were coded as positive or qualified positive, as were 76.7% of comments regarding informal mentoring.</p>

<p>As for the informal mentoring relationships, the majority of participants (65.1% were coded as positive) described positive, close relationships. For example,</p>
<p>
<disp-quote>
<p>My relationship with this mentee was a perfect match. We sought each other out at the beginning of the year and I offered to help her in any way possible. She was eager to reach out and ask for help when needed. We actually were able to team teach science together several times each month. That was helpful for both of us because we learned from each other and grew together.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Some commented on the differences between mentor and mentee as a positive: “Opposite, but also a perfect match—easy to work with and thrived on learning new techniques and strategies.” Other positive responses appeared to stress the emotional aspect of the relationship: “It was a nurturing relationship. The mentee was very needy and was very unsure of herself. I played more of a role of giving emotional support than anything else.”</p>
<p>Most participants involved in a formal mentoring relationship also appeared extremely positive about the experience (83.8% of comments were coded as “positive”): “Very comfortable with fairly high trust. My mentee was willing to take risks in front of me and share frustrations openly.” Others mentioned learning from each other:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>It was a good match. We collaborated on a few projects as we shared children and we were able to make a lot of gains in our professional development. (I learned a great deal more about picture communication systems, for example, and she learned a great deal about classroom management.)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Some mentioned that the relationship had continued beyond the mentoring period:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>A perfect match. The teacher I mentored was new to our school but a 2nd year teacher and she is a VERY good teacher. We both teach SpEd Preschool and work VERY well together. Even though she has now been at our school 3 years, we still meet often to share ideas and talk.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Only a few participants’ comments were coded as negative or qualified negative (2.7% for formal mentoring, 4.6% for informal mentoring). One participant in an informal mentoring relationship summed up the relationship as “nonexistent.” The others expressed frustration that the novice teacher either did not ask for advice or did not implement the suggestions of the mentor.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-0741932510364549" sec-type="discussion">
<title>Discussion and Implications</title>
<p>The results of this study indicate that NBCTs in special education did appear to be involved in mentoring their novice teacher counterparts. Only about 10% did not report having engaged in either formal or informal mentoring. It is possible that some of these teachers may have been employed in states or districts that did not have formal mentoring programs or that they held positions (e.g., transition supervisor) or taught in isolated areas that may have made mentoring difficult. In sum, mentoring does appear to be a common role of NBCTs.</p>
<p>Formal mentoring of novice teachers appeared relatively similar to informal mentoring in terms of the most and least common roles. Contrary to previous research, though, the results of this study did not show informal support as providing more of any specific activity than formal support. In fact, formal mentoring appeared to encompass just as much emotional support, encouragement, and confidence building as informal mentoring; furthermore, these were among the most common activities reported by mentors. These formal mentoring roles encompassed both what teachers say they want (e.g., assistance with classroom management, emotional support) and what researchers believe they need to improve their practice (e.g., curriculum implementation; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0741932510364549">Ball &amp; Cohen, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0741932510364549">Feiman-Nemser, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0741932510364549">Griffin et al., 2003</xref>). Also, mentors appeared to hold positive views of both formal and informal mentoring experiences.</p>
<p>These findings are important because novice teachers place a great deal of emphasis on informal mentoring, indicating that this type of relationship offers them what they need: emotional support and encouragement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0741932510364549">Billingsley et al., 2004</xref>). Informal relationships may be valued by novice teachers, but the results of this study did not show that they provided any more of this type of support, or any other type of support, than did formal relationships. Furthermore, outcomes research does show a preference for formal mentoring over informal mentoring (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0741932510364549">Rockoff, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>Formal mentoring structures set up by the school or district did appear to take up more time than informal mentoring, and in terms of time spent in mentoring activities, more appears to be better (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0741932510364549">Rockoff, 2008</xref>). Furthermore, a limitation of informal mentoring is that there is no guarantee that each novice teacher will, in fact, be mentored. Only by assigning a mentor to each novice teacher can we be certain that all teachers who need mentoring will receive it. How then can we then ensure that “mentoring,” either formal or informal, encompasses both what novices want and what they need?</p>
<p>The results of this study indicated that NBCTs could be seen as a population that is heavily involved in mentoring and particularly in informal mentoring. As teacher leaders, NBCTs will need training (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0741932510364549">Ball &amp; Cohen, 1999</xref>). Such training should encompass their roles as both formal and informal mentors, emphasizing roles that have been shown to assist novice teachers in improving their practice (e.g., observation, feedback, and discussion) as well as those that are valued by novice special educators (e.g., emotional support; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0741932510364549">Ball &amp; Cohen, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0741932510364549">Griffin et al., 2003</xref>). The results of this study indicate that informal mentors were less likely to provide crucial interventions such as observing the novice and providing guidance on curriculum implication. Thus, mentor training for all of these teachers would not be amiss, particularly as they may not receive any training for the informal mentoring they are already engaged in with novice teachers. One of the purposes of such training could be raising awareness about the importance of their role as an informal mentor and the goals of this particular type of mentoring (e.g., improving teaching practice, providing emotional support).</p>
<p>Remaining questions include those regarding relating these activities to outcomes. That is, does more time spent on any one mentoring activity or group of activities translate into increasing student achievement or decreased teacher attrition? Are the most common mentoring activities identified by this and other studies also the most important? What role does teacher philosophy and type of licensure play in mentoring effectiveness? Further research should be conducted on teacher mentors to determine how they are drawn into mentoring, both formally and informally, and how both types of mentoring may affect their own teaching practices. Also of great importance is the effectiveness of difficult types of mentor training. All of these questions remain unexplored in the professional literature.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-0741932510364549" sec-type="conclusions">
<title>Limitations and Conclusion</title>
<p>There were three major limitations to this study. First, although the researchers examined a large sample in comparison to the population, many participants were unable to respond to some of the questions, as they did not have experience as formal and/or informal mentors. Furthermore, the research instrument did not measure when the mentoring took place, so some experience reported by the participants may have taken place some time ago and/or prior to national board certification.</p>
<p>Second, the study relied on teacher self-report. It did not directly measure the actions of the mentor, determine whether there was a good match, or assess the mentor–mentee relationship. Finally, the survey instrument was adapted from a previous instrument developed to describe and assess teacher mentoring roles and relationships. The instrument did not collect data regarding specific licenses held by the mentor or mentee (e.g., disability category) or ask about philosophical differences. In general, research in this field is limited by the dearth of instruments that have been empirically validated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0741932510364549">Griffin et al., 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>The results of this study indicate that the great majority of NBCTs did appear to be participating in mentoring their novice colleagues. Informal mentoring was reported more often than formal mentoring. Although formal mentoring appeared to involve mentors in more roles, more often than did informal mentoring, participants reported equally high satisfaction with both types of relationships. Of particular interest was that formal mentoring appeared to encompass the types of support most valued by novice teachers and recommended by researchers to improve practice. Increasing formal mentoring opportunities is recommended. In addition, recognition of the apparently high participation of NBCTs in both formal and informal mentoring is needed. Mentor training could potentially improve the quality of both types of mentoring and raise awareness of the importance of informal mentoring in the lives of teachers. More research is needed surrounding which specific mentoring activities increase teacher quality and decrease attrition.</p>
