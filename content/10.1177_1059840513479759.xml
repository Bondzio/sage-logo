<p>The tragedy at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Connecticut has left all of us desperate to address the problem of violence in schools. We all know, however, there is no quick fix in our culture. In the face of the tragedy, I went to <italic>The Journal of School Nursing (JOSN) </italic>search feature to see what authors have said about school safety. Using a single term, <italic>violence</italic>, 152 articles were identified. Combing through those articles identified in the past 5 years, there were nine that painted a telling picture of violence in schools as seen in the <italic>JOSN </italic>publications and insight on where our practice lies as well as a base for additional recommendations.</p>
<p>A review of relevant literature and a case example published in 2008 was particularly important for inclusion in this review (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1059840513479759">Reuter-Rice, 2008</xref>). The purpose of the review was to identify peer-bullying literature, explore the relationship between peer-bullied teens and the school shooter by gender, family, school and community factors. The review findings showed that victimization leads to self-blame, loneliness, anxiety, and low self-esteem. Victims regularly report somatic symptoms and males experience physical bullying more than females. School shooters in the literature are male, are socially isolated, and often abused and bullied. Family factors include turbulent parent–child relationships, loss of a parent, violence at home, and lack of intimacy in parent–child relationships. An important family factor identified in this review is the acceptance of pathological behavior at home.</p>
<p>The case example illuminated an adolescent school shooter’s history that was elicited from him where he was imprisoned for life for a school shooting. The youth and his family moved to a new community where he became the victim of violence. Once at the new school, he reported daily violence such as pushing, punching, and burning and also having his possessions regularly stolen. He said that there was always retribution if he reported the violence at school. While the shooter had been a good student, he began to abuse substances and became truant. He began to associate with boys demonstrating high-risk behavior.</p>
<p>The youth expected that teachers or other adults would protect him. No one seemed to notice changes in his behavior or demand he be accountable. He used the health office regularly for somatic complaints with little help delivered. Readers should note that there was no report of what he expected the help to be. He finally decided to kill himself, leaving a suicide note and took a gun to school. A friend knew that he brought the gun to school but failed to inform anyone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1059840513479759">Reuter-Rice, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>The review of the literature in this article contributes to a significant picture of predictors of violence that are familiar, with an important addition which was the acceptance of pathological behavior at home. While the literature review did not identify acceptance of pathological behavior at school, there is a concern that school personnel may be too cautious in labeling children and letting pathological behavior go untreated. The case study identifies important information not typically revealed. The shooter expected protection or notice that his behavior was changing. The lack of attention surely contributed to his poor self-esteem and isolation.</p>
<p>Increased youth violence gave rise to an intervention study in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1059840513479759">Regan, 2009</xref>) further adding to the discussion on programs addressing the pattern of violence in schools. The program focus was on gang violence, dating violence, and anger/conflict management. Student participants reported increased knowledge about pro-social behavior and heightened awareness of positive behavior in themselves and others. It is important, however, to be aware that student knowledge and skill assessment is not the ultimate outcome of an intervention. Objective assessment of youth violence needs to be the evaluation goal. Further, strategies to be adopted by youth must be adopted by the entire school community to create a positive environment. Theoretically based programs, as recommended by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1059840513479759">Dresler-Hawke and Whitehead (2009)</xref> clearly posit prevention programs in a framework that shows the interplay between students, school, family, community, and the social–cultural level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1059840513479759">Dresler-Hawke &amp; Whitehead, 2009</xref>). The social–cultural level in recent times reflects complexity of American people’s attitudes toward gun control as well as the concern about labeling individuals with mental health problems. Additionally, the fragmented mental health system reflects the lack of value placed on mental health services.</p>
<p>Yet another contribution to the field is an oft-cited integrated review of literature on somatic complaints of children that outlined factors associated with somatic symptoms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1059840513479759">Shannon, Bergren, &amp; Matthews, 2010</xref>). Shannon and colleagues categorized four areas that contribute to somatization: psychological comorbidities, childhood adversity, school stress, and functional impairment. School nurses and other team members are in a key position to be aware of these factors because somatization has consistently been associated with youth who are victimized and have a potential to display violent behavior.</p>
<p>School safety is another revealing part of the discussion in the <italic>JOSN </italic>literature and it is well known that feeling safe in school is not limited to high-risk communities. For example, nearly 24% of middle class, fifth-grade children participating in a communication training program with parents reported that they did not feel safe in school (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1059840513479759">Jacobson, Riesch, Temkin, Kedrowski, &amp; Kluba, 2011</xref>). These feelings of not being safe were related to teasing, bullying, and other threats that usually occurred when adults were not present. While poverty is a strong predictor for factors leading to violence, this study and recent events confirm that aggressive and violent behavior occurs in schools across all socioeconomic levels in American society. The fact that the children in this study experienced threats or attacks mostly when adults were not present emphasizes the need for supervision and protection of children while in school.</p>
<p>Another aspect of the picture of violence in schools involves a concern for the safety of students with disabilities. A proactive intervention designed to foster self-confidence in children with disabilities had positive results in making them feel less bothered by teasing and demonstrating increased self-concept (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1059840513479759">Vessey &amp; O'Neill, 2011</xref>). The power of the students feeling less bothered by teasing and bullying and having increased self-concept needs to be measured against their behaviors in the long term. Further, we do not know if the confident responses of victims of bullying will change or diffuse the bullying behavior of aggressors. Unfortunately, much of our research is only testing outcomes in the near term.</p>
<p>Another relevant manuscript described the skills necessary for group interventions. The integrated literature review highlighted the skills needed to lead different types of group interventions and included activity therapy, coaching, counseling interventions, psychotherapy, support, and therapy work task (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1059840513479759">Garcia, Lingren, &amp; Pintor, 2011</xref>). School nurses can and do participate across a wide variety of group interventions. Knowledge to support group leadership must include age appropriate development, principles of group process and management, expertise in the content of the program, and available outside resources. The skills that are necessary include good preparation, maintenance of a safe environment, putting boundaries in place for the group, conflict management, and good communication as well as respectfulness, patience, and belief in the participants. While Garcia and colleagues focused their review on group leadership for girls, the principles cross both genders. School nurses skilled in group leadership can contribute to school wide efforts in violence prevention and safety promotion.</p>
<p>Ethnicity and race are often perceived to be predictors in mental health problems that can lead to violence. A secondary analysis of the Youth Risk Behavior Survey (YRBS) revealed that Asian high school students did have a higher prevalence of depression symptoms than Caucasian students, but comparable risk factors for depression. The major difference in predictors was being foreign-born or having work-related injuries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1059840513479759">Song, Ziegler, Arsenault, Fried, &amp; Hacker, 2011</xref>). School nurses and the school health team need to know the risk factors associated with depression symptoms across groups of students and recognize the specific differences related to unique characteristics such as immigration. Knowing about risk, however, is just a start and programming needs to be in place to maximize the use of the data. The use of mental health risk data can protect against the acceptance of pathological behavior in schools.</p>
<p>Violence and victimization in schools is a global concern. A survey in Turkey was designed to identify types and rates of aggressive behavior and contributing factors among a sample of 805 high school students (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1059840513479759">Kaya, Bilgin, &amp; Singer, 2012</xref>). Beating was the most common aggression and past experience with violence as a witness or aggressor was the most common contributing factor to violent behavior. In the sample, 7.1% of students reported being shot at or shooting at someone. The study was important because it illustrated a global problem with violence and also reported on measures of violent behavior as aggressor or victim that schools could adopt globally. The importance of perfecting youths skills in problem solving, conflict resolution, and anger management are emphasized in this epidemiologic report of violent behavior among high school students.</p>
<p>This review of 5 years of <italic>JOSN articles</italic> shows that most research is descriptive and the interventions reported do not show the behavioral effects in the long term. It also shows that school nurses alone do not have the solutions to eliminate violence in schools. The review reveals a concern that pathological behavior is accepted rather than addressed and shows the urgency needed to address school safety from multiple perspectives. The problems contributing to school safety are a reflection of the complex sociocultural values of people in the United States. School nurses can and must join the force of professionals, parents, and community members who are concerned and committed to address the problem of safety in American schools.</p>
<p>Recently, the National Association of School Nurses (NASN) released an Issue Brief entitled <italic>School Violence; Role of the School Nurse in Prevention </italic>which came to all members of NASN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1059840513479759">Blout, Rose, &amp; Suessman, 2013</xref>). The Brief outlines factors that contribute to violent behavior from both the aggressor and the victim perspectives while outlining recommendations for school nurses’ interventions that may prevent violence and crisis intervention steps when violence does occur. The document can be a useful tool in the short term but school nurse clinicians, administrators, and scholars need to join the national effort to make American children safe.</p>
