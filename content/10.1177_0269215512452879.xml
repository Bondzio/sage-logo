<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Clinicians lack a standardized tool with robust psychometric properties and good clinical utility for comprehensively measuring sitting balance in older adults with a variety of conditions and low-level balance abilities across healthcare settings.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0269215512452879">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0269215512452879">2</xref></sup> Global descriptors such as poor, fair and good are often used to describe sitting balance abilities yet no psychometric properties are reported for these descriptors.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0269215512452879">3</xref></sup> Alternatively, clinicians may use standing balance instruments such as the Berg Balance Scale.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0269215512452879">4</xref></sup> Although standing balance measures contain items related to sitting balance, floor effects have been reported for individuals demonstrating lower level balance abilities.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0269215512452879">5</xref></sup> Similarly, other clinicians may use single balance item tools that either stand alone (e.g. sitting forward reach test)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0269215512452879">6</xref></sup> or exist as a subscale of a larger, more comprehensive tool (e.g. Fugl-Meyer Assessment).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0269215512452879">7</xref></sup> Setting-specific instruments such as the Outcome and Assessment Information Set (OASIS-C)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0269215512452879">8</xref></sup> used in home settings or the Minimum Data Set (MDS) 2.0<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0269215512452879">9</xref></sup> used in skilled nursing facilities likewise contain only one item as part of a larger assessment tool. These setting-specific measures rate patient transfer ability and reflect only a small portion of the content domain belonging to the construct of sitting balance.</p>
<p>In response to these problems, Verheyden and associates developed the Trunk Impairment Scale<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0269215512452879">10</xref></sup> for people following stroke. While the Trunk Impairment Scale is accepted as a measure of balance for people with neurologic conditions,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0269215512452879">2</xref></sup> the scoring system measures trunk motor control rather than sitting balance.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0269215512452879">10</xref></sup></p>
<p>In the last year, researchers disseminated results on three more sitting balance tools.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0269215512452879">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0269215512452879">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0269215512452879">12</xref></sup> The Function in Sitting Test<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0269215512452879">11</xref></sup> assesses assistance needed to perform different sitting activities but has only been studied in individuals in the acute phase of recovery (&lt;3 months). The Ottawa Sitting Scale,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0269215512452879">12</xref></sup> was developed to assess sitting balance in patients who were ‘slow to recover’ in hospitals. Lastly, Medley and Thompson<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0269215512452879">3</xref></sup> developed the Sitting Balance Scale to measure other aspects of sitting balance in individuals who are primarily non-ambulatory, stemming from various acute and chronic neuromusculoskeletal conditions. Preliminary concurrent validity has been established but needs to be confirmed in other samples. Discriminative validity is needed to establish the tool’s clinical usefulness among people of differing balance ability, diagnoses and across settings.</p>
<p>The purpose of this prospective methodological study was to investigate criterion-related and discriminative validity of the Sitting Balance Scale in older adults who are non-ambulatory or have limited functional mobility. Specifically for criterion-related validity, we wanted to determine whether the Sitting Balance Scale is a valid and acceptable alternative to the Trunk Impairment Scale for measuring the construct of sitting balance. Second, we examined the relationships between Sitting Balance Scale performance and setting-specific measures of sitting balance ability and length of stay. Related to discriminative validity, we sought to establish whether the Sitting Balance Scale could discriminate between ambulators and non-ambulators, among diagnostic categories and between individuals receiving care in different treatment settings.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-0269215512452879" sec-type="methods">
<title>Methods</title>
<p>A consecutive sample was recruited from four different settings: acute care, inpatient rehabilitation facility, skilled nursing facility or home. Participants were included if they were over 64 years of age, and unable to walk or had limited walking abilities. Limited walking ability was defined as a Timed Up and Go score of ≥20 seconds.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0269215512452879">13</xref></sup> Participants were excluded if they were unable to attain 120° shoulder flexion and abduction in at least one upper extremity, unable to follow Timed Up and Go commands, or answer intake form questions. Furthermore, individuals with a history of a total hip replacement in the last six months, or any current acute medical condition that limited their ability to participate in the testing protocol were excluded. The Institutional Review Board at Texas Woman’s University, Dallas, Texas approved the study and participants provided informed consent. All additional requirements of the clinical settings were met.</p>
<p>One physical therapist from each setting screened patients to identify those that met the inclusion criteria. The test administrator reviewed medical records for exclusion criteria. Data collected from medical records included age, gender, practice patterns/diagnosis, setting-specific measures of sitting balance (OASIS-C M1850 or MDS G-3b items), subjective fall history, glenohumeral active range of motion, and length of stay. To determine if ambulatory volunteers qualified for inclusion, the Timed Up and Go<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0269215512452879">13</xref></sup> was administered. Volunteers with Timed Up and Go scores ≥20 seconds, those who required assistance with ambulation or those who were non-ambulatory qualified as study participants and performed the sitting balance tests.</p>
<p>The sitting balance tests included the Trunk Impairment Scale and Sitting Balance Scale.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0269215512452879">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0269215512452879">10</xref></sup> The Trunk Impairment Scale contains 17 tasks measuring static and dynamic sitting postural control, and trunk coordination. The total score ranges from 0 to 23. The Sitting Balance Scale is an 11-item scale that quantifies different functional abilities of sitting balance.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0269215512452879">3</xref></sup> Items include static sitting and activities with trunk or limb displacement with a total score ranging from 0 to 44.</p>
<p>Both the Trunk Impairment Scale and Sitting Balance Scale were administered on the same day according to published methods.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0269215512452879">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0269215512452879">10</xref></sup> Testing order was alternated among participants with a rest period of 30–60 minutes between tests. The sitting surface was held constant for each participant. The test administrator stood at arm’s length to ensure participants’ safety.</p>
<p>Chi-square analyses of goodness of fit were conducted to determine whether the proportion of participants was equal among settings for selected participant characteristics: ambulatory status and diagnostic category. Performance means and standard deviations were calculated by ambulatory status and setting. To establish concurrent validity, correlational analyses between the Sitting Balance Scale, Trunk Impairment Scale, setting-specific measures of balance, and length of stay were performed using Pearson and Spearman correlation coefficients.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0269215512452879">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0269215512452879">15</xref></sup> Linear regression was performed to determine the amount of variance in setting-specific outcome measures explained by the Sitting Balance Scale and Trunk Impairment Scale. Lastly, multivariate analyses of between-subject effects and appropriate follow-up tests were performed in the discriminative analysis between ambulators and non-ambulators, among diagnostic categories and between participants receiving care in different settings (α = 0.05). Statistical analysis was conducted with SPSS 15.0 for Windows (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL. USA).</p>

<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0269215512452879">Table 1</xref> presents participant characteristics for the total sample of 98 patients and for each of the four settings. The number of participants who were non-ambulatory differed by setting with the greatest number in the skilled nursing facility, χ<sup>2</sup> = 8.35, <italic>P</italic> = 0.039. Differences were also noted among settings for diagnostic category, χ<sup>2</sup> = 24.28, <italic>P</italic> = 0.001. Participants in acute care had either cardiopulmonary or musculoskeletal problems while inpatient rehabilitation participants had primarily neuromuscular diagnoses. In contrast, participants in the skilled nursing facility were almost equally distributed among diagnostic categories with slightly more having a musculoskeletal diagnosis. Lastly, most home health participants had either neuromuscular or musculoskeletal problems.</p>

<p>For the correlations, parametric and non-parametric analyses yielded the same results, therefore, only Pearson correlation coefficients are reported. A moderate association was found between ambulatory status and the two sitting balance measures (Sitting Balance Scale <italic>r</italic> = 0.67, Trunk Impairment Scale <italic>r</italic> = 0.61; <italic>P</italic> = 0.0001).

<p>MANOVA results revealed significant differences in test scores between ambulators and non-ambulators and by diagnostic category for both instruments (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0269215512452879">Table 3</xref>). Performance was not different across settings (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0269215512452879">Table 2</xref>). Because sample sizes were different, participants were matched on age and diagnosis, to determine if ambulation status differences were true differences and not due to sample characteristics. A one-way ANOVA confirmed the discriminative abilities of the Sitting Balance Scale and Trunk Impairment Scale (Trunk Impairment Scale <italic>F</italic>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In this study, we established the Sitting Balance Scale’s concurrent validity by comparing it to another measure of static and dynamic sitting balance, the Trunk Impairment Scale, as well as setting-specific outcomes (transfer ability as defined by OASIS and MDS assessments and length of stay). As expected, strong relationships between the Sitting Balance Scale and Trunk Impairment Scale were demonstrated (<italic>r &gt;</italic> 0.87) in three of the four settings (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0269215512452879">Table 4</xref>), thereby establishing concurrent validity. The Sitting Balance Scale is comparable to the Trunk Impairment Scale for measuring the construct of sitting balance in older adults who are non-ambulatory or have limited functional mobility.</p>
<p>The Sitting Balance Scale provides the clinician with an objective measure of sitting balance ability that addresses more aspects of balance than trunk control, the focus of the Trunk Impairment Scale. In addition to effects of trunk movements on balance, the Sitting Balance Scale items centre on the anticipatory demands of upper or lower extremity movement (e.g. pick up an object from floor). In earlier work by Medley and Thompson,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0269215512452879">3</xref></sup> discriminative analysis revealed three factors which accounted for 72.7% of the variance. The authors labelled these factors as sitting balance during trunk displacement, sitting balance during upper extremity displacement and static sitting balance. Although the Trunk Impairment Scale and Sitting Balance Scale have a similar number of items and seem to measure the same construct, the Sitting Balance Scale appears to be a more comprehensive measure of sitting balance ability.</p>
<p>Concurrent validity of the Sitting Balance Scale is demonstrated by the relationships between Sitting Balance Scale test scores and other clinical outcomes (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0269215512452879">Table 4</xref>). Moderate to strong relationships varied by setting (<italic>r</italic>-values ranged from 0.6 to 0.8). In the home setting, Sitting Balance Scale scores accounted for 59% of the variance in the OASIS-C M1850 item, versus only 20% by the Trunk Impairment Scale. The OASIS-C M1850 attempts to identify the patient’s ability to safely transfer from bed to chair and return. The Sitting Balance Scale does not have the same item, however, the tool does include a sit-to-stand element, while the Trunk Impairment Scale does not. Both types of transfers involve large trunk displacements that are necessary for many functional activities, which further supports the use of the Sitting Balance Scale over other sitting balance measures. The MDS 2.0 G-3b attempts to rate the general ability of a resident to transfer and may include a sit-to-stand transfer in the skilled nursing facility setting. Sixty-two per cent of the variance in the MDS 2.0 G-3b item was explained by the Sitting Balance Scale versus 50% by the Trunk Impairment Scale. Based on these additional findings, the Sitting Balance Scale provides the clinician with a better measure of the patient’s sitting balance abilities than the Trunk Impairment Scale in the home and skilled nursing facility settings.</p>
<p>In addition, we sought to establish whether the Sitting Balance Scale can discriminate between ambulators and non-ambulators, among diagnostic categories, and between individuals receiving care in different settings. The Sitting Balance Scale discriminates between ambulators and non-ambulators, and among individuals with different diagnoses equally as well as the Trunk Impairment Scale (<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001).</p>
<p>The ability of the Sitting Balance Scale to discriminate between persons with different ambulation status, as reflected in Timed Up and Go scores, may allow clinicians to measure changes, both positive and negative, in lower functioning individuals. For example, clinicians might use the Sitting Balance Scale to quantify observed improvement in sitting balance ability that might otherwise go undetected with traditional standing balance measures. The opposite is also true. If therapists can objectively measure negative changes in ability, alterations in the treatment plan can be made in a timely manner. While we are unsure of the tool’s responsiveness, the Sitting Balance Scale discriminates between individuals of different mobility levels.</p>
<p>Both the Sitting Balance Scale and the Trunk Impairment Scale discriminated between individuals with various diagnoses. Published results for the Trunk Impairment Scale have been limited to people with neurologic diagnoses.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0269215512452879">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0269215512452879">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0269215512452879">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0269215512452879">17</xref></sup> In contrast, the Sitting Balance Scale was designed to address frail individuals regardless of diagnosis with the exception of individuals who are unable to use both lower extremities (i.e. people with complete spinal cord injury or bilateral amputation).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0269215512452879">3</xref></sup> Our sample included people with neuromuscular, musculoskeletal or cardiopulmonary diagnoses across four practice settings (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0269215512452879">Table 1</xref>) and the results suggest broader application of the Sitting Balance Scale than the Trunk Impairment Scale. However, sample sizes were too small to determine differences among diagnostic categories by setting. Nevertheless, preliminary work on the Sitting Balance Scale showed that the scale discriminated between different balance abilities of people with pathology and apparently healthy participants.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0269215512452879">3</xref></sup> In Medley and Thompson’s study, participants with pathology scored lower on the Sitting Balance Scale than people without pathology. The results suggest that the Sitting Balance Scale may be more clinically useful than other measures of sitting balance which have been validated only in individuals with neurologic dysfunction.</p>
<p>Neither the Sitting Balance Scale nor the Trunk Impairment Scale discriminated between participants in different practice settings. A possible explanation for the blurring of setting differences observed in this study is increased acuity levels across post-acute care settings in the USA due to shortened acute care length of stay.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0269215512452879">18</xref></sup> The shift of care from the acute care setting to post acute care may also contribute to this finding.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0269215512452879">19</xref></sup> Today’s US healthcare delivery system is not only characterized by decreased length of stay across settings, but also by increased levels of acute care at home.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0269215512452879">19</xref></sup> Our finding of weak or no relationships between the two sitting balance measures and length of stay in any setting (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0269215512452879">Table 4</xref>) is further evidence of this blurring of settings.</p>
<p>In healthcare delivery systems concerned with cost controls, length of stay is an important outcome variable in all settings but is difficult to determine in the skilled nursing facility and home settings. For example, in the skilled nursing facility, some participants were recently discharged from an acute hospital and expected a short-term stay for rehabilitation. Other participants were long-term skilled nursing facility residents currently receiving therapy services. These two patient groups represent two distinct populations. In the home setting, length of stay can be determined by the number of visits, number of days receiving care or total number of days on service. Therefore, we only report data regarding length of stay for the acute care and inpatient rehabilitation settings. In these settings, there was no relationship between the two sitting balance tools and length of stay. We expected to see a relationship between sitting balance scores and longer time in rehabilitation because generally sicker or frailer individuals have less balance abilities and longer length of stay. On reflection, two possible explanations for this finding exist. Higher acuity levels across settings result in blurring of patient characteristics across settings. In addition, sitting balance ability is a small determinant for appropriate rehabilitation placement and length of stay. Buntin argues that both clinical and non-clinical factors contribute to discharge decisions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0269215512452879">20</xref></sup> Clinical factors may include diagnosis, functional limitations and family support.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0269215512452879">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0269215512452879">22</xref></sup> Non-clinical factors such as patient income, provider supply, local market conditions among healthcare facilities, Medicare policy, financing and payment methods influence discharge placement.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0269215512452879">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0269215512452879">22</xref></sup> Further, several studies note the impact of the Medicare Prospective Payment Systems on discharge decisions post-acute care.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0269215512452879">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0269215512452879">24</xref></sup> Thus, length of stay was likely a poor outcome given the complex nature of this variable in the US healthcare system.</p>
<p>Although the Sitting Balance Scale appears to be a valid, objective and comprehensive measure of a patient’s sitting balance abilities, a few limitations should be noted. Subgroup analyses by setting and diagnostic categories could not be determined secondary to small samples within settings. Power analysis indicates that future studies would need 12 participants in each cell to detect differences by diagnostic category across settings. In addition, predictive validity was not addressed in this study and was hampered by the lack of a definition and data on falls from the seated position. To establish predictive validity, a clear construct is needed. While the construct of sitting balance ability has been studied to a limited degree, no research has investigated falls and what constitutes a faller from a seated position, or established the magnitude of the problem. Future studies need to address these issues before meaningful predictive validity can be established for any sitting balance assessment. Lastly, future studies should investigate sensitivity, establish minimal detectable change, and determine a cut-off score for available sitting balance measures that might provide insight into an individual’s potential for progressing to ambulatory status.</p>
