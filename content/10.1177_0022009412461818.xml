<abstract>
<p>Between summer 1937 and autumn 1938, the time of the ‘Great Terror’, numerous so-called ‘National Operations’ targeting ethnic minorities were carried out in the USSR. The largest was the ‘Polish Operation’. Starting in August 1937 and ending in October 1938, NKVD units arrested over 150,000 people, 111,000 of whom were soon shot. The ‘Polish Operation’ marked the zenith of the persecution of Poles in the Soviet Union, which had begun in the early 1930s when the party leadership embarked on systematic mass terror against the Polish minority. Between 1930 and 1936 Stalin ordered the Belorussian and Ukrainian Soviet Republics to be purged of Poles, resulting in thousands of deaths and many more deportations. It is estimated that Polish losses in the Ukrainian SSR were about 30 per cent, while in the Belorussian SSR, where some 300,000 persons declared themselves as Poles in the 1920s, the Polish minority was almost completely annihilated or deported. The available sources clearly imply that it was ethnic-defined terror and that the ‘Polish Operation’ was merely a peak in the persecution.</p>

<body>
<p>Between summer 1937 and autumn 1938, the time of the Great Terror, numerous so-called national operations targeting ethnic minorities were carried out in the USSR. The largest was the ‘Polish Operation’. Starting in August 1937 and ending in November 1938, the NKVD arrested over 140,000 people, 111,000 of whom were soon shot. Stalin even dissolved the Communist Party of Poland, ordering most of the arrested leaders to be executed. The Polish Operation marks the climax of the ethnic terror against the Polish minority in the Soviet Union, which had started in early 1930.</p>
<p>The following analysis will examine the persecution of the Polish minority in the context of the mass terror of the 1930s, ‘in the transition from a primary focus on class-based terror to a preponderant emphasis on ethnic-based terror, which would continue until Stalin’s death.’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0022009412461818">1</xref></sup> This includes first and foremost the mass terror against the peasants during the collectivization (‘the war against the peasantry’) and the Great Terror (1937–8).</p>
<p>However, the mass terror directed against Poles in the Soviet Union cannot be adequately explained without regard to the Polish complex of the Bolsheviks which came into existence after the defeat of the Red Army outside Warsaw in the summer of 1920. The aftermath was disastrous in both military and political terms, especially the latter, and influenced the Soviet foreign and interior policies, as well as the plans for world revolution for the next 20 years.</p>
<p>The core of the Bolsheviks’ Poland-complex was the belief that the newly restored Polish state acted as a bulwark against Bolshevism, thus being a pivotal point of the imperialist world order, which had to be eliminated in order to gain free access to Germany, the heart of Europe. Repeatedly, Lenin, Stalin and other leading Bolsheviks formulated this thesis.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0022009412461818">2</xref></sup> According to them, Poland had stalled the spread of Soviet communism by force for years, and the Bolshevik revolution had to go on a more defensive stance. As early as November 21, 1920, Lenin talked about the ‘slowing down of the socialist world revolution’, which was caused by the defeat at Warsaw that year.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0022009412461818">3</xref></sup> Stalin came to the same conclusion, stating at the 12th Party Congress of the RCP(b) (Russian Communist Party [Bolsheviks]) on 23 April 1923: ‘Since that point of time [the defeat at Warsaw] we no longer pursue an offensive, but a defensive policy.’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0022009412461818">4</xref></sup></p>
<p>An important part of the Bolsheviks’ Poland-complex or even trauma was the belief that a communist revolution and a direct sovietization of Poland was not possible in the near future, because Polish ‘nationalism’ was deemed too strong, even amongst peasants and workers.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0022009412461818">5</xref></sup></p>
<p>The Poland-complex hurt Soviet relations with Poland after 1920, as well as the Bolsheviks’ approach to the Polish minority, which quickly became a hostage of the Soviets’ policy towards Poland. In fact, Poles in the RCP(b) numbered about 18,000 in 1920.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0022009412461818">6</xref></sup> They took part on the Bolshevik side during the Russian Civil War. Many were in high positions in the Bolshevik terror, Party and economic apparatus, examples being Felix Dzerzhinsky (Feliks Dzerzhinskii, Feliks Dzierżyński), founder and leader of the Cheka, his second-in-command and eventual successor Viacheslav Menzhinskii, as well as the brothers Stanislav and Iosif Kosior.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0022009412461818">7</xref></sup></p>
<p>Nevertheless, the Bolsheviks distrusted the Polish minority as a whole and thought them to be especially ‘reactionary and anti-Soviet’. In October 1920, Stefan Geltman, the Secretary of the politburo, wrote:<disp-quote>
<p>Especially complicated is the policy towards the Polish minority in the Republics, because they are politically extremely hostile and reactionary, while being on a relatively high cultural level. Those difficulties enhance the existence of the bourgeois Poland and the deeply rooted influence of Polish Catholicism and nationalism.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-0022009412461818">8</xref></sup></p></disp-quote></p>
<p>In later years, the Bolsheviks did not change their views towards the Polish minority.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-0022009412461818">9</xref></sup> During the 1920s, the situation of the Polish minority in the Soviet Union remained dire<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-0022009412461818">10</xref></sup>, but the worst was yet to come.</p>
<p>In later 1929 and early 1930, Stalin and his comrades decided to accelerate the Collectivization (begun in 1928) and to break growing peasant resistance against it. The foundations of this policy were laid by the Politburo in December 1929 and January 1930, while the party apparatus and OGPU (Obiedinennoye Gosudartsvennoye Politicheskoye Upravlenie = United State Political Administration) executed it.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-0022009412461818">11</xref></sup></p>
<p>Collectivization meant the expropriation of the peasantry and its transformation into a class of forced workers for the communist bureaucracy. By doing so, Stalin and his comrades attempted to finance the massive expansion of heavy and armament industries.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-0022009412461818">12</xref></sup> In 1986, Alexander Yakovlev, a close associate of Mikhail Gorbachev and a chief architect of the perestroika, admitted that the Collectivization was a return to serfdom, a variant of slavery. In the gulags, however, the inmates, usually peasants, were subjected to pure slavery. Yakovlev called this policy ‘Social Cannibalism’ and ‘Kainism’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-0022009412461818">13</xref></sup></p>
<p>The thinking of the peasants was often along the same lines. As Lynne Viola observes, ‘Some [peasants] said Communists were bringing back serfdom. Some said the collective farm signalled the reign of Antichrist on earth. Others said collectivization was simply pillage and ruin.’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn14-0022009412461818">14</xref></sup></p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, most peasants were rather reluctant to join collectives of their own volition. Many engaged in active and passive resistance and the government decided to crush this opposition. The Bolsheviks saw the class of relatively wealthy peasants, whom they called kulaks, to be the decisive factor in the peasant resistance and thus decided to destroy them as a social class. On 11 January 1930, Genrikh Yagoda, then the vice-chairman of the OGPU, declared to his comrade that: ‘The kulaks must be destroyed as a class. … By March–April [1930], we must deal with the kulak, <italic>breaking his back</italic> once and for all.’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn15-0022009412461818">15</xref></sup></p>
<p>On 30 January 1930, the Politburo passed a decree ‘On Measures for the Liquidation of Kulak Farms in Raions of Wholesale Collectivization’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn16-0022009412461818">16</xref></sup> It divided the kulaks into three categories. The kulaks of the first group – the ‘the counterrevolutionary kulak <italic>aktiv</italic> elements’ – were to be sent to ‘concentration camps’. Those who resisted were liable to capital punishment. The second category comprised the ‘remaining elements of kulak <italic>activ</italic>‘: together with their families and the wives and children of the of the first category kulaks they were to be resettled in the distant regions of the USSR. The last category, the ‘less dangerous’ kulaks were resettled within their respective districts, along with their families.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn17-0022009412461818">17</xref></sup></p>
<p>The number of the affected kulak farms varied according to the total number of kulak farms in the individual districts. The Politburo recommended 3 per cent to 5 per cent of all farms as a referential number.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn18-0022009412461818">18</xref></sup></p>
<p>The orders to the regional OGPU-units conducting the operation imply that not only kulaks were targeted, but also real and imagined anti-Soviet elements in the countryside, including church activists, members of religious sects, former landowners, former White officers and their families.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn19-0022009412461818">19</xref></sup></p>
<p>The first deportations occurred between February and April 1930. OGPU and Party-organs deported 501,290 people (98,000 families) to the inhospitable Northern regions of the USSR. This operation continued and by late 1930, the number of deported had risen to 550,558 people (112,828 families). Additionally, 44,990 families (about 220,000 individuals) were resettled within their districts.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn20-0022009412461818">20</xref></sup></p>
<p>The resettled were forced to work – most were engaged in forestry, while others were occupied in animal herding, fishing or mining iron, coal or gold.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn21-0022009412461818">21</xref></sup> As most men were imprisoned in concentration camps or executed, most of the deported were women and children. They lived in abject conditions in barracks or earthen huts and suffered from hunger. Diseases quickly spread and death rates rose, especially among younger children.</p>
<p>At the same time, a wave of arrests hit the ‘dangerous’ kulaks and other anti-Soviet elements. Between January and 1 October 1930, 283,717 people, 44.2 per cent of them kulaks, were arrested by OGPU units in the course of the ‘Kulak Operation’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn22-0022009412461818">22</xref></sup> They were either imprisoned in concentration camps or executed (20,000).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn23-0022009412461818">23</xref></sup> Thus the ‘Kulak Operation’ of 1930 directly affected at least 1.05 million people.</p>
<p>However, the mass terror of 1930 was not enough to break peasant resistance, and the terror resumed in 1931. Between January and late September 1931, the number of deported reached 265,795 families or 1,243,860 people.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn24-0022009412461818">24</xref></sup></p>
<p>After 1932, the deportations subsided: While 33,785 families (147,785 people) were deported between October 1932 and May 1933,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn25-0022009412461818">25</xref></sup> their number decreased to 8766 families (41,875 people) in the first half of 1933.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn26-0022009412461818">26</xref></sup> In the first half of 1935, OGPU and Party deported 24,541 families (about 115,000 people).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn27-0022009412461818">27</xref></sup></p>
<p>Following 1930, Soviet authorities massively relied upon arrests. On 1 January 1934, 510,309 people were in Soviet gulags. There were also prisoners in reeducation camps (with sentences under three years) and ordinary prisons. In 1935, the Soviet Union was officially home to 1,222,675 prisoners in concentration and reeducation camps, most of them peasants.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn28-0022009412461818">28</xref></sup></p>
<p>Another consequence of the Bolshevik anti-peasant campaign was the Great Hunger. In order to acquire the capital needed for buying Western machinery and plants, Soviet authorities took away the peasants’ grain (including the seeds) and exported it to the West on such a scale that the second largest famine in human history hit the Soviet Union. In 1932–3, about 10 million people, most of them in the Ukraine, died of hunger and related causes.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn29-0022009412461818">29</xref></sup></p>
<p>While millions of people starved in the Soviet Union, the regime exported over 3.5 million tons of grain in 1932 and 1933. This alone would have been more than enough to prevent this famine from happening. In addition, many other foodstuffs were also exported: flour (63,000 tons), eggs, oil plants, legumes and others.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn30-0022009412461818">30</xref></sup></p>
<p>In the end, the mass terror and the Great Hunger broke the resistance of the peasants against the Collectivization. While only 23.6 per cent of all farms were collectivized in 1930, their share rose to 65 per cent (1933) and 93 per cent (1937).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn31-0022009412461818">31</xref></sup></p>
<p>In 1933, the focus of the terror in the countryside shifted towards the persecution of ‘former kulaks’, ‘saboteurs’, ‘wreckers’, ‘thieves’, etc., who were supposedly undermining the kolkhozes from within. Under this pretext, thousands of kolkhoz workers along with their families were deported, imprisoned or executed. The terror increased after 1933 and reached its peak in the years 1937–8, the Great Terror (see below).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn32-0022009412461818">32</xref></sup></p>
<p>The mass terror of the 1930s also had a clear ethnic component from the outset. The beginning of the attempt of elimination of the free peasantry marks the beginning of the ethnic persecution of the Polish minority.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn33-0022009412461818">33</xref></sup> Already in 1927, Lazar Kaganovich suggested the deportation of the Polish population living near the Ukrainian–Polish border. He believed them to be ‘anti-Soviet’ and ‘defeatist’. ‘Kaganovich did not say it directly. But his report left no choice that he liked the idea of deporting the Poles from the border region.’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn34-0022009412461818">34</xref></sup></p>
<p>What Kaganovich had suggested in 1927 was implemented by Stalin and his comrades, including Kaganovich, from March 1930. They ordered the Polish population of the Ukrainian–Polish border regions to be deported or executed. Not social status, but nationality was the key. On 5 March 1930, the Politburo decided to depolonize the Soviet-Polish border regions (of the Ukrainian SSR [Soviet Socialist Republic] and Belorussian SSR), that is, to purge it of Poles. Also to be removed were those families and individuals who had been found guilty of ‘banditry’, espionage, as well as counterrevolutionary activities and professional smuggling.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn35-0022009412461818">35</xref></sup></p>
<p>The Politburo set quotas: 3000–3500 families in the BSSR (Belorussian Soviet Socialist Republic) and 10,000–15,000 families in the Ukrainian SSR were to be deported as first or second category. The first category meant detention in concentration camps or simply execution; the second category meant the deportation into the depths of the USSR. Furthermore, there were those families who were deported within the borders of the BSSR or the Ukrainian SSR, regardless of social status. For that, the Politburo set no quotas, but left the decision to local Party and OGPU offices. The local state apparatus was also to be purged of Polish anti-Soviet elements.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn36-0022009412461818">36</xref></sup> The arrests and deportations were to be carried out as quickly and ‘quietly’ as possible. Furthermore, the directives were to be held in secrecy.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn37-0022009412461818">37</xref></sup></p>
<p>The decision of the Politburo of 5 March 1930 was actually carried out. On 6 May, the operative group of the OGPU reported the fulfillment of the order: In the Ukraine, 14,894 individuals with ‘special purpose’ (‘osobogo naznacheniia’, the name for deported Poles in OGPU reports) were ‘resettled’, including 32 families, and in the BSSR 3589 individuals, including 183 families. The Poles from the Ukrainian SSR were deported to the Siberian region, while the Poles from the BSSR were deported to the Soviet Far East.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn38-0022009412461818">38</xref></sup> How many families were deported within the borders of the Ukrainian SSR and the BSSR could not be determined.</p>
<p>The deportations in early 1930 were ‘the first case of Soviet ethnic cleansing’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn39-0022009412461818">39</xref></sup> Furthermore, during the deportations directed against the ‘kulaks’, Polish peasants were preferentially chosen for persecution. They were openly told that: ‘You are dekulakized not because you are a kulak, but because you are a Pole.’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn40-0022009412461818">40</xref></sup></p>
<p>The operation of early 1930 marks the start of the systematic mass terror against the Polish minority. On 30 October 1930, the Politburo ordered the purge of Poles and anti-Soviet elements from the institutions of the railroad and road system in the Western border regions. This operation, too, was to be secret.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn41-0022009412461818">41</xref></sup></p>
<p>By late 1931, the Politburo complained, however, that the measures for the consolidation of the regions bordering Poland did not yield the right results and that those regions were not consolidated politically. Because of that, on 1 December 1931, the Politburo ordered the purge of kulaks, anti-soviet elements and Polish saboteurs and spies from the border regions during the next six months. They were to be especially removed from the Soviet, cooperative and kolkhoz apparatuses, and replaced by politically more reliable individuals.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn42-0022009412461818">42</xref></sup></p>
<p>A year later, in March 1933, the OGPU orchestrated another massive crack-down in the Western border regions, the Ukrainian SSR, the BSSR and the Leningrad oblast. In the course of this operation, the OGPU imprisoned 18,802 people, 14,391 as alleged members of rebellious and sabotage organizations, as well as 4441 as alleged spies and their contacts. In most cases, those who came from the ‘Polish minor nobility’ or were said to be kulaks were deemed to be Polish spies, saboteurs and rebels. The BSSR and the Ukrainian SSR were especially considered to be infiltrated by spies, saboteurs and rebels. In 1933, the OGPU also reported on the Polish Military Organization (Polska Organizacja Wojskowa, the PMO), whose task it was allegedly to conduct espionage and sabotage in the Soviet Union. The OGPU reported numerous arrests for this reason.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn43-0022009412461818">43</xref></sup></p>
<p>In 1934, Soviet authorities continued the purges in the regions bordering Poland. On 23 December 1934, Stanislav Kosior, the First Party Secretary in the Ukraine, reported to Stalin that 10,000–11,000 families (around 50,000 people) from anti-Soviet elements were deported from the border regions of the Ukrainian SSR. Two thousand families were deported to the North and 8000–9000 families to the Eastern regions of the USSR. Those targeted were independent and kolkhoz peasants, most of them Poles, but also a considerable number of Germans. At the same time, the Party dissolved Polish village councils and replaced them with Ukrainian ones. The same happened with Polish schools in the Ukraine.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn44-0022009412461818">44</xref></sup></p>
<p>In the first half of 1935, the state security and the Party conducted another massive purge, this time in all border regions of the USSR. From the Ukrainian border regions, the communist terror organizations (Party and NKVD) deported 2000 families from anti-Soviet elements (8678 people) between 1–9 February 1935. Of the deported families there were 615 of German, 681 of Polish, 589 of Ukrainian and 115 of other (Czech, Moldovan, Bulgarian, Jewish) nationalities. In the BSSR, 2000 families were to be deported between 1–7 August 1935, most of them were likely to be Poles. In the Leningrad oblast, 5100 families (22,511 people) were deported between 6 April and 1 May 1935. A further 1553 families (7857 people) were deported from the Northern Caucasus.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn45-0022009412461818">45</xref></sup></p>
<p>After 1934, the German minority became the target not only of social and political, but also of ethnic terror. The reason for this was the change in the political climate in Europe after Hitler’s rise to power, when Germany changed from an ally against the Polish archenemy to a possible enemy. Thus, the German minority in the USSR became a hostage of Soviet foreign policy after 1933, just like the Polish minority before.</p>
<p>Another great deportation emphasized the new joint fate of the German and Polish minorities. On 24 April 1936, the Politburo ordered the deportation of 15,000 Polish and German families from the Ukraine to Kazakhstan.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn46-0022009412461818">46</xref></sup> Up until September 1936, the Soviet government deported, according to the Ukrainian NKVD, 69,997 people (15,000 families), including 29,731 children. Of the 15,000 deported families, 11,494 were Polish (around 50,000 persons) and 3506 German.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn47-0022009412461818">47</xref></sup></p>
<p>Besides the deportations, Poles were also arrested under the accusation of espionage. In 1935, Soviet intelligence services arrested 6409 persons as actual or alleged spies, including 2253 Poles, and a year later, 3669 were arrested, 1275 of them Poles.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn48-0022009412461818">48</xref></sup> Even political emigrants from Poland came under suspicion of working for the Polish intelligence services during the mid-1930s. Their names were recorded by NKVD offices in 1936 (by June 1936, 1189 people were recorded); the first arrests were soon to follow.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn49-0022009412461818">49</xref></sup></p>
<p>In July 1937, Stalin and his comrades decided to purge the USSR from ‘enemy kulaks’ and ‘anti-Soviet elements’ once and for all. On 2 July 1937, the Politburo ordered local party-organs to form troikas, to set the contingents of “former kulaks” and inform the Politburo of their work. The troikas were left to decide whether the “kulaks and criminals” were to be “resettled” or executed.</p>
<p>In the following weeks, the Politburo approved of the troikas and contingents for the individual regions, the numbers of deported and the numbers of executed.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn50-0022009412461818">50</xref></sup> The NKVD developed a detailed plan (the Operative Order No. 00447) in which not only alleged kulaks, but also all other ‘anti-Soviet elements’ were included.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn51-0022009412461818">51</xref></sup> On 31 July, the Politburo passed the Operative Order No. 00447 and put the mass murder in motion. The mass terror quickly expanded in scope as Stalin and his comrades constantly reissued the victim contingents and included new victim groups, especially members of ethnic minorities.</p>
<p>In January 1938, the NKVD reported on the progress of the Operative Order No. 00447:<disp-quote>
<p>As of the 1st of January 1938, 555,641 persons have been arrested. Of those arrested under the Operative Order No. 00447 are 248,271 former kulaks, 116,506 criminals, 102,594 other counterrevolutionary elements, there is no information on 28,270 persons. As of the 1st of January 1938, 555,362 persons have received their sentence. Of those sentenced under the Operative Order No. 00447, following sentences were given: a) First category [execution]: 239,352 persons, including former kulaks −195,124, criminals −75,930, other counterrevolutionary elements −78,237, no information −19,828.b) Second category [5 to 10 years of gulag]: 314,110, including former kulaks −138,588, criminals −75,930, other counterrevolutionary elements −83,591, no information −16,001.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn52-0022009412461818">52</xref></sup></p></disp-quote></p>
<p>The Kulak Operation continued into 1938 and the Politburo decided on further contingents of kulaks and other anti-Soviet elements to be executed or imprisoned. Only in November 1938, did Stalin halt the mass-murders. The results were appalling: the Kulak Operation alone was responsible for 378,326 executed and 389,070 sent to the gulag.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn53-0022009412461818">53</xref></sup></p>
<p>In total, from 1 October 1936 to 1 November 1938, the NKVD arrested 1,565,041 people on political charges. 85.4 per cent (1,345,000) of those arrested were condemned and more than half of them executed (681,692, or 51 per cent).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn54-0022009412461818">54</xref></sup> About half of the deaths (55 per cent) were the result of the ‘Kulak Operation’ and more than a third (36.3 per cent) were members of various ethnic minorities. The Polish were especially targeted: they accounted for 17 per cent of those executed during the Great Terror, despite being only 0.4 per cent of the total population.</p>
<p>The persecution of the Polish minority reached its peak in the so-called Polish Operation of 1937–8, the bloodiest of all National Operations and the second most bloody mass operation at that time. Only the ‘Kulak Operation’ was bloodier. In early August 1937, Nikolai Iezhov, People's Commissar for the Interior, devised the operative order for the Polish Operation and presented it to the Politburo. On 9 August 1937, the Politburo confirmed ‘the order of the People's Commissar for the Interior of the USSR concerning the liquidation of the Polish sabotage and espionage groups, as well as the PMO<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn55-0022009412461818">55</xref></sup> organization.’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn56-0022009412461818">56</xref></sup></p>
<p>Three days later, on 11 August 1937, Iezhov issued Operative Order No. 00485, which is regarded as the beginning of the Polish Operation. He ordered the initiation of a massive operation to ‘completely annihilate the local organizations of the PMO, especially the sabotaging, spying and rebellious cadres,’ starting on 20 August 1937. The operation was to end within three months. Subjected to arrest were following groups:<disp-quote>
<p>a) activists of the PMO, who have already been detected, but not found yet;</p>
<p>b) all POWs from the Polish Army, who had remained in the Soviet Union;</p>
<p>c) all refugees from Poland;</p>
<p>d) political emigrants from Poland and persons who came to the USSR through prisoner exchanges;</p>
<p>e) former members of the Polish Socialist Party and other anti-Soviet parties;</p>
<p>f) the most active part of the local anti-Soviet, nationalistic elements in the Polish national districts.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn57-0022009412461818">57</xref></sup></p></disp-quote></p>
<p>To Operative Order No. 00485 Iezhov added a secret and extensive accompanying letter about the supposed fascist-rebellious, spying, sabotaging, subversive and terrorist activities of the Polish intelligence services in the USSR. Iezhov claimed that Polish spies and saboteurs had infiltrated all sections of Soviet Party, Soviet, economic and military apparatuses, and even the intelligence services. All those elements were supposed to belong to the PMO and caused the USSR great harm, such as sabotaging the Soviet advance on Warsaw in 1920. This accusation again shows the strength of the Bolshevik anti-Polish complex.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn58-0022009412461818">58</xref></sup></p>
<p>The Polish Operation had, however, already begun before 11 August 1937, at least in the Ukraine, where about two thirds of the Polish population in the Soviet Union resided. Operative Order No. 00485 served to intensify the anti-Polish mass terror in the Ukraine, set the timeframe and expanded it to cover the entire Soviet Union (see below). Stalin personally as well as the Politburo oversaw the mass terror against the Poles and decided how it was to proceed. On 5 September 1937, for example, the Politburo decided that all Polish defectors, former members of the PPS (Polska Partia Socjalistyczna), etc., were to be sentenced by a special committee (<italic>osoboie soveshchanie</italic>) of the NKVD to ten years in prison.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn59-0022009412461818">59</xref></sup> Usually, though, most prisoners of the Polish Operation were shot.</p>
<p>On 14 September 1937, Iezhov reported to Stalin about the ongoing Polish Operation. Iezhov informed Stalin that already 23,216 Poles had been arrested in the course of the Polish Operation, including 7651 in the Ukraine, 4124 in the BSSR, 1872 in Leningrad, 1070 in the Moscow oblast, 837 in the Western oblast, 1325 in Western Siberia, and 2943 in the railway system. Of those, 1251 had been tried and executed. On the margins of the report, Stalin wrote: ‘To Comrade Iezhov. Very good! Kick and exterminate the Polish spy-filth! Annihilate it in the interest of the USSR. J. Stalin. 14 Sept. 37.’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn60-0022009412461818">60</xref></sup> The Polish Operation of course continued, stopping only in mid-November 1938, thus running a year longer than originally planned (20 November 1937).</p>
<p>Today, the course of the Polish Operation in the Soviet Ukraine is relatively well documented. According to the census in early 1937, 636,220 Poles lived in the Soviet Union, nearly two thirds of them in the Soviet Ukraine (417,613 people, or 65 per cent).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn61-0022009412461818">61</xref></sup> In 2010, Poland’s Institute of National Remembrance and the Archive of the State Security of Ukraine co-published a bilingual collection of documents (orders, reports, etc.) concerning the Polish Operation in the Ukraine.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn62-0022009412461818">62</xref></sup></p>
<p>These documents show that the Polish Operation in the Ukraine had already started months before Operative Order No. 00485, and that the order intensified the operation. On 27 February 1937, Vsevolod Balitskii, People's Commissar for the Interior of the Ukrainian SSR, devised guidelines for the detection and liquidation of alleged Polish agents (PMO) and local anti-Soviet Polish nationalist formations. Special attention was to be given to political emigrants from Poland (former members of CPP, CPZU and CPZB<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn63-0022009412461818">63</xref></sup>), persons who appeared in the investigation files on the PMO for the years 1934 and 1936, former Polish nationalist cadres, Poles with connections to Polish diplomatic embassies and leading activists of the ‘Polish clerical circles’. In the industrial regions, everything had to be done to uncover Polish sabotage, and in the border regions, Polish sabotage-cells and cross-border relations across the border regions to the industrial regions.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn64-0022009412461818">64</xref></sup></p>
<p>Those were the same groups that were targeted by Operative Order No. 00485. The operation in the Ukraine, however, progressed too slowly, according to the communists. On 2 August 1937, the Ukrainian NKVD reported the following to headquarters: Up until 1 August 1937, communist security in the Ukraine has arrested 870 people in the course of the Polish Operation, including 572 saboteurs and spies of the PMO, as well as 298 nationalist and clerical Polish ‘activists’. The arrests of another 240 people, who appeared in the investigation files for the PMO, was to get underway, and further arrests were expected. ‘We are currently working on the detection of political emigrants and refugees.’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn65-0022009412461818">65</xref></sup></p>
<p>By the end of July, or early August, the new People's Commissar for the Interior of the Ukrainian SSR, Israil Leplevskiy, who was appointed on 14 June 1937, ordered the intensification of the anti-Polish terror. Just in the Kiev oblast, the NKVD arrested 1296 people between 5–7 August, including 701 on account of sabotage and espionage, 180 PMO members and 417 Polish nationalist and clerical activists.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn66-0022009412461818">66</xref></sup></p>
<p>However, not all regional NKVD offices could show similar results. On 8 August 1937, Leplevskii criticized his subordinates in a telegraph in which he complained that only a ‘few’ arrests had been made in the Vinnitsa oblast in the course of the Polish Operation, and that the same could be said of other oblasts. Therefore, Leplevskii ordered the chiefs of the regional organs to investigate whether this was a criminal violation of the operative tasks set by comrade Iezhov. Those responsible were to be discovered. Furthermore, Leplevskii ordered his subordinates to do everything to intensify their attempts to discover and crush espionage and counterrevolutionary rebellion.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn67-0022009412461818">67</xref></sup></p>
<p>From this telegraph it becomes clear that those were the operative orders of Iezhov, People's Commissar for the Interior of the USSR. Thus it is likely that similar orders were issued towards the other Soviet Republics. This means that, although Operative Order No. 00485 intensified and extended the operation decisively, it did not initiate the mass terror against Poles.</p>
<p>These new measures quickly brought about the results anticipated in headquarters. By 15 August 1937, the state security in the Ukraine had arrested 3283 people in the course of the Polish Operation.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn68-0022009412461818">68</xref></sup> In the next days and weeks, the NKVD in the Ukraine arrested hundreds of people. On 4 September 1937, the number of those arrested reached 6414, an average of 160 arrests a day beginning on 1 August. In the first place was the Kiev oblast with 1769 arrests, followed by Vinnitsa with 1417, Kharkov with 880, Odessa with 716, Dnepropetrovsk with 574, Donetsk with 446, Chernigov with 110, and Moldova with 100. Border troops made 294 arrests and the 3<sup>rd</sup> department of the administration of the NKVD took 109 prisoners.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn69-0022009412461818">69</xref></sup> This was, however, only the beginning.

<p>The wave of arrests in the course of the Polish Operation reached its peak in the Ukraine by late 1937. Between November 1937 and 10 January 1938, the NKVD took over 24,000 prisoners, an average of 243 arrests a day. By early January 1938, the Polish Operation slowly lost momentum. From 15 January to 26 February, the NKVD arrested 4529 people in the course of this operation,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn71-0022009412461818">71</xref></sup> on average 107 arrests a day, and from 26 February to 1 June, a further 6000 were arrested, an average of 50 per day.</p>
<p>The actual start and the peak of the Polish Operation in the Ukraine is closely related to Israil Leplevskii, a confidant of Iezhov, who was appointed People's Commissar for the Interior of the Ukrainian SSR.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn72-0022009412461818">72</xref></sup> There, Leplevskii showed astounding initiative: he coordinated and organized this crime, similar to others like it at the time. He dispatched orders from headquarters to his subordinates and gave his own instructions on how to carry out those orders. Leplevskii criticized the local NKVD chiefs because of insufficient results (that is, too few casualties) and repeatedly encouraged them to intensify the mass terror. He also ordered the arrest of certain individuals.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn73-0022009412461818">73</xref></sup></p>
<p>On 1 October 1937, Leplevskii ordered the chiefs of the NKVD in the various oblasts to accelerate the operative work within the next days so that decisive breakthroughs on all fronts could be achieved within the next 30 to 45 days. The preparation of the strike in the newly formed oblasts was to be directed principally at Poles and Germans, and in the Kamenets-Podolskii oblast (bordering Romania) also against Romanians.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn74-0022009412461818">74</xref></sup></p>
<p>A month later, on 1 November, Leplevskii informed Iezhov on the state of the Polish Operation: Up until 1 November, 19,030 people had been arrested, but the arrests were continuing. During the investigations, it was revealed that Polish spy networks and sabotage organizations allegedly had been active in the Ukraine for years. In the last days alone, 2000 people were arrested in the new oblasts (Zhitomir, Kamenets-Podolskii, Nikolaiev, Poltava), up to 600 in Kiev, 450 in Vinnitsa, and 400 in Dnepropetrovsk. Leplevskii reported: ‘Because of that, it is absolutely clear that we are unable to bring the operation to an end by November 1<sup>st</sup> [1937]. In order to bring the Polish Operation to a successful end, I plead for an extension of the operation and the realization of this matter until December 15<sup>th</sup>, 1937.’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn75-0022009412461818">75</xref></sup></p>
<p>Headquarters accepted this plea, and on 3 November sent a ciphered telegraph to the republic and regional NKVD offices, in which they were ordered to accelerate the Polish Operation and finish it on 10 December. This date was not adhered to either and headquarters extended the Polish Operation again on 11 December, this time to 1 January 1938.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn76-0022009412461818">76</xref></sup> In January 1938, the operation still continued and on 31 January 1938, the Politburo ordered to extend the national operations, including the Polish Operation, until 15 April.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn77-0022009412461818">77</xref></sup></p>
<p>On 26 March, the Politburo once again extended the national operations, this time to 1 August 1938. In the protocol of the Politburo meeting it is written: “Extend until the 1<sup>st</sup> of August 1938 the simplified processes against people of Polish, German, Latvian, Estonian, Finnish, Bulgarian, Macedonian, Greek, Romanian, Iranian, Afghan, and Chinese nationalities, and against Harbinians, who were found guilty of espionage, terrorism or other anti-Soviet activities.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn78-0022009412461818">78</xref></sup></p>
<p>As already mentioned, the number of arrests linked to the Polish Operation in the Ukraine decreased after January 1938. This decrease was caused by measures taken in headquarters. On 25 January 1938, Iezhov, in a speech at the Party Congress, showed his support for the national operations, especially the persecution of Poles and refugees from Poland.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn79-0022009412461818">79</xref></sup> The day before, however, he criticized the course of the mass operations in the USSR, including the Polish Operation, in front of an assembly of leading NKVD functionaries: ‘It is enough to say that we had only 15,000 recorded defectors from Poland,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn80-0022009412461818">80</xref></sup> until now 60,000 were shot, and it is still believed that not all of them were eradicated. And officially recorded were only 15,000, this is our record – an arbitrary record [эto потолочный учет].’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn81-0022009412461818">81</xref></sup></p>
<p>Iezhov hinted in his speech at many flaws in the work of the security agencies, the greatest, however, he detected in the Ukraine. On 12 February 1938, he and a few of his subordinates visited Kiev in order to investigate the problems there hands-on. On 17 February 1938, he called for an assembly of the leading NKVD functionaries in the Ukraine, where Nikita Khrushchev, First Party Secretary of the Ukraine, also participated. In his speech, Iezhov criticized the current state in the Ukrainian intelligence services, as well as the poor performance of Chekists during the mass operations. Their performance was the worst in the entire Soviet Union, concluded Iezhov: In the Ukraine,<disp-quote>
<p>the quotas were numerically achieved and even over-achieved, not a few were arrested and shot. And as a whole, it [the ‘Kulak Operation’] was very beneficial. When we consider quality, however, and examine, whether the strike was well-aimed, whether we crushed the counterrevolution – I have to say that this has not been the case.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn82-0022009412461818">82</xref></sup></p></disp-quote></p>
<p>Iezhov instructed his subordinates in the Ukraine to make efficient strikes in the future in order to remove the leading heads of the counterrevolution. Iezhov then mentioned the national operations:<disp-quote>
<p>For you, operations such as the Polish, German, Romanian, have to be of the highest priority. Of course, the other operations are important, too. I mean the Bulgarians and Macedonians, Harbinians and all others, but the first three have to be of the highest priority. And how were those operations – the Polish, German and Romanian – conducted. I must say that neither better nor worse than the Kulak Operation. Also, one has to say that.. the quality of the operation is rather low. I must say that you were surprised by the operation as a whole, … otherwise there would not be such results. You have neither officially recorded the Poles, nor the Romanians, nor the Germans, nor the Harbinians … Many believed that those things were already concluded. The Poles would have been purged in such a way, that nothing had to be done anymore. Truly all, so much for that … The same deficiencies.. also apply to the Romanian, German and all other operations. Therefore these operations have to be continued, however well advised, and eradicate that which is most important.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn83-0022009412461818">83</xref></sup></p></disp-quote></p>
<p>Israil Leplevskii, who was responsible for the mass operations in the Ukraine, had to leave his post on 25 January 1938 and was soon arrested (24 April 1938), sentenced to death (on 28 July 1938) and shot.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn84-0022009412461818">84</xref></sup> His successor Aleksandr Uspenskii continued the mass terror in the Ukraine, including the Polish Operation, according to the instructions from Moscow.</p>
<p>Only on 17 November 1938 did Stalin stop (through a Politburo decision) the Great Purge and with it the Polish Operation. Nine days later, on 26 November, Lavrentii Beria, annulled Operative Order No. 00485 and other similar orders.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn85-0022009412461818">85</xref></sup></p>
<p>Two days earlier, on 24 November, the Politburo decided to replace Iezhov, who had conducted the Great Purge according to Stalin's will, with Beria as the People's Commissar for the Interior. A few months later, on 10 April 1939, Iezhov was arrested, ‘sentenced’ to death on 4 February 1940 and shot two days later.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn86-0022009412461818">86</xref></sup></p>
<p>Aleksandr Uspenskii, who coordinated the mass terror in the Ukraine after Leplevskii, had already fled the Ukraine on 14 November 1938. In his office he left a note with the instructions ‘to look for my body in the Dnepr’, trying to feign suicide, and went into hiding in the vicinity of Moscow. Nevertheless, his comrades searched for him and finally arrested him on 15 April 1939. On 27 January 1940, he was sentenced to death and shot.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn87-0022009412461818">87</xref></sup></p>
<p>The outcome of the Polish Operation in the Ukraine was horrifying.

<p>An arrest made during the Polish Operation did not necessarily mean that the victim was of Polish nationality. From June to September 1937, the NKVD arrested 3003 people in the Kiev oblast in the course of the Polish Operation, including 1713 Poles (57 per cent), 791 Ukrainians, 237 Galicians, 114 Jews and 148 others.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn93-0022009412461818">93</xref></sup></p>
<p>On the other hand, Poles were also arrested during the ‘Kulak Operation’ and other national operations. On 15 December 1937, Leplevskii reported to Iezhov that, in the course of the ‘Kulak Operation’ (Operative Order No. 00447) in the Ukraine, 26,429 persons were put into the first category (execution) and 49,511 into the second category (Gulag). Included was a great number of alleged members of nationalist, rebellious, harmful and sabotaging organizations, as well as members of the ‘nationalist Polish and German counterrevolution’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn94-0022009412461818">94</xref></sup> In the Vinnitsa oblast, the NKVD ‘sentenced’ in the course of the ‘Kulak Operation’ 7600 people, 593 (7.8 per cent) of them being Poles, up until 6 December 1937.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn95-0022009412461818">95</xref></sup></p>
<p>The Polish minority in the Ukraine was the population that was comparatively the worst hit.

<p>The victims of the Polish Operation in the Soviet Union (and in the Ukraine) were in the ‘overwhelming majority simply peasants from the border regions, industrial workers and workers in the railway system who had nothing to do with politics.’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn97-0022009412461818">97</xref></sup> The ‘political emigrants’, that is, members of the Communist Party, etc., who came to the Soviet Union because of their ideological beliefs, formed only a small minority of the victims: Between June 1937 and 25 February 1938, the NKVD of the Ukrainian SSR ‘dealt with’ 2294 cases of Polish defectors.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn98-0022009412461818">98</xref></sup> Until the end of the Polish Operation, their number had not likely increased by much.</p>
<p>Members of the Party and state apparatus of the USSR or the army accounted for only a relatively small minority of the victims of the Polish Operation. Often they had even been the persecutors themselves, an example being Stanislav Kosior, who was responsible for carrying out the communist crimes in the Ukraine, including the Polish Operation during the first months. Kosior had to resign from his office as First Secretary of the Communist Party of the Ukraine on 19 January 1938 and became Vice-Chairman of the Council of People's Commissars. On 3 May 1938, he was arrested by the NKVD for allegedly leading the PMO in the Ukraine. On 26 February 1939, he was sentenced to death and shot.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn99-0022009412461818">99</xref></sup></p>
<p>The security services also purged their own ranks<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn100-0022009412461818">100</xref></sup> as well as the Red Army from Polish officers. By 23 June 1938, 304 people in the military district of Kiev and 84 people in the military district of Kharkov were arrested under the charges of being members of the PMO and therefore Polish spies and saboteurs.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn101-0022009412461818">101</xref></sup></p>
<p>The Polish Operation in the rest of the Soviet Union was more or less just as bloody as in the Ukraine. In the BSSR, the NKVD ‘found guilty’ 19,931 people, 17,772 of whom were sentenced to death (around 90 per cent); in the RFSR 47,799 persons, including 7404 in the Leningrad oblast, of whom 6597 were executed; in the Novosibirsk oblast 7444, of whom 7012 were shot (94 per cent); in the Sverdlovsk oblast 5988, of whom 3794 were executed (63 per cent). In the railway system, other Soviet republics and autonomous regions, a total of 10,657 people were sentenced, 6219 of them to death (53 per cent).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn102-0022009412461818">102</xref></sup></p>
<p>All in all, the NKVD arrested 143,870 people throughout the entire USSR in the course of the Polish Operation and, between 25 August 1937 and 15 November 1938, sentenced 139,825 to either death (111,091 or around 80 per cent) or prison (28,744). In 2776 cases, further investigations were initiated, of which, 219 were forwarded to the judicial system (1075 to military courts). Only 40 people were released.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn103-0022009412461818">103</xref></sup></p>
<p>Most victims of the Polish Operation were Poles: estimates vary from 96,000 to 99,000. Furthermore, about 20,000 Poles fell victim to the Great Purge in the course of the ‘Kulak Operation’ and various other national operations. In total, the NKVD arrested over 1.6 million people during the Great Purge, about 118,000 to 123,000 of them Poles.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn104-0022009412461818">104</xref></sup> That means that 18.5 per cent to 19.3 per cent of the Polish minority was arrested during the Great Purge. However, when only adults are considered (with an estimated average family size of five people, thus meaning that 40 per cent were adults), the percentage increases to somewhere between 46 per cent and 48 per cent. Because mostly men were targeted<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn105-0022009412461818">105</xref></sup>, this means that most Polish men in the Soviet Union were arrested by the NKVD and that most of them were shot.</p>
<p>Stalin even ordered the Communist Party of Poland to be dissolved and the majority of its leaders to be executed. Of the 63 members of the Central Committee of the CPP, 46 were liquidated together with 26 of the 37 candidates for the Central Committee of the CPP.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn106-0022009412461818">106</xref></sup> It is estimated that 3000 members of the CPP fell victim to the Great Purge.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn107-0022009412461818">107</xref></sup> Strangely enough, the CPP was an organization which greeted and supported the Soviet terror, as well as trying hard to undermine Poland.</p>
<p>Because of all of this, it is understandable that the Polish minority decreased according to Soviet statistics from 792,000 persons in December 1926 to 627,000 in 1939.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn108-0022009412461818">108</xref></sup> With an estimated average growth rate of 2 per cent per year, the Polish minority should have counted about a million members by 1937.</p>
<p>The Polish minority in the BSSR and the Ukrainian SSR suffered from especially high casualities. Their losses are estimated to amount up to 30 per cent, compared to their numbers in the late 1920s. In the Ukrainian SSR, Soviet sources spoke of 476,000 Poles in 1926, in reality their numbers were higher.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn109-0022009412461818">109</xref></sup> Just in the course of the Polish Operation the Polish population in the Ukrainian SSR decreased at least by 15 per cent.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn110-0022009412461818">110</xref></sup></p>
<p>In the BSSR, however, the Polish minority was nearly completely annihilated. In the 1920s, 300,000 persons in the BSSR claimed to be Poles.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn111-0022009412461818">111</xref></sup> In early 1937, only 119,881 Poles lived in the BSSR according to Soviet records.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn112-0022009412461818">112</xref></sup> Even on 4 August 1938, when the mass terror slowly subsided, Panteleimon Ponomarenko, Secretary of the Central Committee of the CP(b)B, proposed to Stalin to deport ‘from the borders of the BSSR the families of the repressed, counterrevolutionary and rebellious elements, as well as persons who have close family ties to Poland and Latvia.’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn113-0022009412461818">113</xref></sup> Stalin generally went along and two weeks later, on 18 August 1938, Soviet officials in the BSSR specified in a letter to Molotov that the deportation was to include 11,732 families, or 50,019 people, including 25,000 children. In their stead, demobilized border guards and Red Army soldiers were to be settled.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn114-0022009412461818">114</xref></sup></p>
<p>It was not possible to find out whether the operation was actually carried out or how many people were affected. But when German troops reached Eastern Belarus in the summer 1941, they only occasionally met Poles. The 221st Sicherungsdivision, which ‘pacified’ the south-eastern regions of Belarus in September 1941, reported on 17 September 1941: ‘The Poles are a nearly undetectable minority in the area controlled by the division … Also, Poles made only very few appearances during the time of the report.’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn115-0022009412461818">115</xref></sup> In order to hide their crimes in the BSSR, Soviet authorities even declared Belarussians and Russians as Poles in statistics.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn116-0022009412461818">116</xref></sup></p>
<p>What were the reasons that the Polish minority was subjected to this exceptional persecution which resulted in the death of most Polish men in the Soviet Union? It has been argued that the strained Polish–Soviet relations were the main reason for this. The Soviet regime supposedly feared Polish aggression. Especially the Polish–German Non-Aggression Declaration of 1934 was to have raised suspicions on the Soviet side.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn117-0022009412461818">117</xref></sup></p>
<p>This, however, does not stand up to critical analysis. The ethnic terror against the Polish minority had already begun in early 1930. At this point of time, the German–Soviet Friendship Treaty (Berlin Treaty, 1926) was still in effect and aimed against Poland. The treaty was to last for five years and in June 1931, both sides decided to extend it for three more years, but it was only on 5 May 1933, when Hitler’s Germany ratified this extension in Moscow.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn118-0022009412461818">118</xref></sup></p>
<p>On 25 July 1932, Poland and the Soviet Union signed a Non-Aggression Treaty (effective for a three-year period) too – the initiative came from the Polish government.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn119-0022009412461818">119</xref></sup> After Hitler’s rise to power, Poland initiated a new round of secret talks with the Soviet Union, in which Karl Radek, an old Bolshevik, on behalf of Stalin represented Soviet interests. Poland even explored the possibility of a defensive alliance with the Soviet Union in the case of a German attack. Although no alliance was concluded, it came to increased cooperation between the two states, in particular on economic and cultural levels. And in February 1934, Poland and the Soviet Union extended the Non-Aggression Treaty from 1932 for another 10 years to 1945.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn120-0022009412461818">120</xref></sup></p>
<p>The thaw in Polish–Soviet relations did not result in better treatment of the Polish minority in Poland, though. Hiroaki Kuromiya states: ‘In 1933, at a time when Polish observers believed that “we now have the most desirable type of Bolshevik Government that we could have”, Stalin began to attack ethnic Poles in the Soviet Union.’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn121-0022009412461818">121</xref></sup> Karl Radek, who had been assigned to the Polish-Soviet talks, reported to Stalin on their progress on 3 December 1933: ‘The arrests [of Poles] in the Ukraine: Publishing of materials on that will be useful not only for the elimination of agents of the Defensywa [Polish secret service], but it also shows to the Poles that no thaw compromises our vigilance.’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn122-0022009412461818">122</xref></sup></p>
<p>On the other hand, negotiations over a Polish–German Non-Aggression Declaration only began in autumn 1933, when the anti-Polish terror had already been raging. Furthermore, the Soviets knew about the nature of the Polish–German Non-Aggression Declaration and that it did not include secret protocols directed against the Soviet Union or other states. Karl Radek reported to Stalin: ‘The question of a Polish–German alliance against us was not discussed, indeed, it never surfaced.’ On the alleged Polish war preparations, Radek commented: ‘We do not detect any Polish war preparations against us (information of one of our services indicating the opposite a few months ago were proven wrong by our military secret services).’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn123-0022009412461818">123</xref></sup></p>
<p>This perception was not changed later, as Soviet secret services had placed high-ranking informers in both Polish and German governments. They reported on all negotiations and plans of their respective governments. Those reports landed on Stalin’s desk and were always avidly read by him, as his numerous remarks and comments indicate.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn124-0022009412461818">124</xref></sup></p>
<p>Nevertheless, Soviet propaganda regularly warned of foreign, often Polish, invasions.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn125-0022009412461818">125</xref></sup> Although Stalin felt relatively safe throughout the decade, he geared up for war, not a defensive, but an offensive one. The war scares gave him ample opportunity to conduct a massive military build-up and hunt down any domestic ‘enemies’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn126-0022009412461818">126</xref></sup></p>
<p>The rationale for ethnic cleansing against the Polish minority lay mainly in their role in the resistance to Collectivization and anti-Polish prejudice. In the Western Soviet border regions, the Polish minority amounted officially up to 15 per cent to 20 per cent of the population (in fact, it was significantly higher). There, the Polish minority was regarded as staunchly anti-Soviet and the OGPU reported on strong ‘counterrevolutionary influences’ among Poles, in particular among Polish peasants in the Belorussian SSR and the Ukrainian SSR.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn127-0022009412461818">127</xref></sup></p>
<p>The collectivization radicalized anti-Soviet sentiments and rural resistance. In early 1930, resistance had spread over the entire Soviet Union and erupted even in numerous local uprisings. ‘The worst peasant uprising of the collectivization era broke out along the Polish–Ukrainian border in late February 1930.’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn128-0022009412461818">128</xref></sup></p>
<p>In the western border regions, Poles were identified with kulaks anyway. ‘The popular identification of Pole and kulak was summed up in the rhyme: “raz Poliak–znachit kulak”’. Thus it is unsurprising that Poles were ‘subjected to the greatest degree of popular and local Communist hostility during collectivization’. This in turn, helped galvanize resistance which took several forms, including illegal flight across the western border, in which ‘the most active were the Poles,’ states Terry Martin.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn129-0022009412461818">129</xref></sup> Between 22 February and 3 March 1930, Polish authorities registered as many as 300 refugees from the Soviet Union.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn130-0022009412461818">130</xref></sup> ‘Other Poles engaged in mass demonstrative marches to the border, in crowds of up to 2000, to publicize their demand to be allowed to emigrate.’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn131-0022009412461818">131</xref></sup></p>
<p>Therefore, Stalin and his comrades decided to rid the Western border regions of ‘Polish-Kulaks’ on 5 March 5 1930. They even feared a possible Polish intervention in case of a large uprising in order to save the Polish minority. Thus the Politburo ordered: ‘Carry out the operation of deporting kulak-Polish elements with maximum organization and without fanfare.’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn132-0022009412461818">132</xref></sup></p>
<p>In the light of the above Terry Martin notes that: ‘Collectivization, dekulakization, the Polish emigration movement, and intense Soviet concern over the security of their border regions, then, led to the first case of Soviet ethnic cleansing.’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn133-0022009412461818">133</xref></sup></p>
<p>However, it was the Great Hunger which marked the advent of ethnic cleansing of other nationalities in the Soviet Union. In early 1934, Soviet authorities deported about 60,000 Kuban Cossacks who were labelled as Ukrainian nationalists …, on the pretext of ‘the sabotage of grain delivery’. Martin states: ‘The Kuban Cossack deportation, in fact, marked a transition from class-based deportations, which predominated prior to 1933, to the ethnic deportations that predominated from 1933 to 1953.’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn134-0022009412461818">134</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>The Great Hunger also resulted in a radicalization of mass terror against the Polish minority, which was already hit hard by the artificially caused famine. In 1933 alone, at least 60,000 Poles starved in the Ukraine.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn135-0022009412461818">135</xref></sup> Between 1934 and 1936, numerous deportation campaigns targeted the Polish minority and to a lesser extent the German. In the case of the Germans, their pleas for help raised Soviet suspicion and German willingness to provide food and money for the starving Germans in the Soviet Union. The Soviets deemed this help ‘fascist’ and the pleas of the starving Germans ‘fascist propaganda’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn136-0022009412461818">136</xref></sup> The radicalization of terror against the Polish minority at this time can be explained in a similar way.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn137-0022009412461818">137</xref></sup></p>
<p>The transition of the mass deportations from 1930 to 1936 to the Great Terror of 1937–8 went about without a break. The victims remained the same: ‘former kulaks’ and national minorities. In addition, there were purges in the Party, state and military, but they accounted for only a relatively small minority of the victims. The decree of the Politburo on 2 July 1937, which started the Great Terror, stated:<disp-quote>
<p>It has been experienced that most of the former kulaks and criminals who had been deported to Siberia and the North and since returned, are the main instigators of anti-Soviet and sabotage crimes of all kinds, whether in kolkhozes or sovkhozes, transport and some sectors of industry.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn138-0022009412461818">138</xref></sup></p></disp-quote></p>
<p>It is understandable that those groups were unimpressed and often hostile towards the Bolshevik regime. In 1937, however, they were only scapegoats for the massive and obvious deficiencies in all areas of the Soviet economy.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn139-0022009412461818">139</xref></sup> Foreign relations only played a role in so far that many victims were accused of crimes (such as sabotage and espionage) in the name of foreign powers.</p>
<p>The confluence of general mass terror in the entire Soviet Union and anti-Polish prejudices, which was also shared by Stalin, was than the reason that the Polish minority was especially affected.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn140-0022009412461818">140</xref></sup> These are the reasons, in my opinion, why the Polish minority was the first ethnic group to be persecuted due to their ethnicity by the Soviet communists. Later, their fate was shared by the Germans, Koreans, Crimean Tartars, Chechnyans and many others. Nevertheless in the second half of the 1930s, as pointed out by Timothy Snyder, ‘the most persecuted European national minority … was … the six hundred thousand or so Soviet Poles.’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn141-0022009412461818">141</xref></sup></p>
