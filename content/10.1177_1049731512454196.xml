<p>Objectives: Advancing human rights is a core competency of U.S. social work education; yet, human rights attitudes and behaviors have never been measured in the social work literature. Thus, this article describes the development and initial validation of two scales, Human Rights Engagement in Social Work (HRESW) and Human Rights Exposure in Social Work (HRXSW). Method: The scales were validated using a purposive sample of 287 social work students. Results: Factor analysis supported a 25-item HRESW and an independent 11-item HRXSW. Reliability was assessed: HRESW (α = .894) and HRXSW (α = .734). Conclusions: The HRESW and the HRXSW have direct applicability to social work education. Through measuring exposure and engagement, we can begin assessing the quality of human rights education in social work.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Human rights have become part of the social work mission. In 2008, the Council on Social Work Education (CSWE) brought human rights into a central position within the U.S. social work curriculum when it introduced “advancing human rights” as a core competency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1049731512454196">CSWE, 2009</xref>). The International Federation of Social Workers (IFSW) and the International Association of Schools of Social Work (IASSW) include human rights in their joint definition of social work: “Principles of human rights and social justice are fundamental to social work” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1049731512454196">IFSW &amp; IASSW, 2004</xref>, p. 1). The National Association of Social Workers (NASW) echoes this idea declaring that “human rights and social work are natural allies” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1049731512454196">NASW, 2009</xref>). Beyond the world of professional social work, the United Nations (UN) has identified social work as a “crucial profession” in the promotion and protection of human rights (UN, Center for Human <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1049731512454196">Rights, 1994</xref>, p. iii), even going so far as to publish a manual on human rights and social work intended for practitioners and educators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1049731512454196">UN, Center for Human Rights, 1994</xref>).</p>
<p>Certainly, then, social workers are engaged in the promotion of human rights. Still, questions remain: Does U.S. social work education prepare students to participate in human rights work? Do U.S. social workers believe that human rights are relevant to their work? Are U.S. social workers engaged in human rights practice? As human rights attitudes and behaviors have not been adequately measured in the social work literature, these questions remain unanswered. In an effort to fill this gap, our article describes the development and initial validation of a pair of scales, Human Rights Engagement in Social Work (HRESW; 25 items) and Human Rights Exposure in Social Work (HRXSW; 11 items).</p>
<sec id="section2-1049731512454196">
<title>Literature Review</title>
<p>Academics recognize social work’s role in the advancement of human rights. Articles in social work journals locate human rights in our professional history and place social workers in position to be human rights leaders in the future (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1049731512454196">Healy, 2008a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1049731512454196">Ife, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1049731512454196">Witkin, 1998</xref>). Also, several textbooks have appeared in recent years with both “human rights” and “social work” in their titles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1049731512454196">Healy &amp; Link, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1049731512454196">Ife, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1049731512454196">Mapp, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1049731512454196">Reichert, 2003</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1049731512454196">2007</xref>), while others emphasize a human rights approach to social work in their content (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1049731512454196">Healy, 2008b</xref>). These books tend to draw attention to international areas of practice, such as working with victims of human trafficking or with impoverished populations outside the United States (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1049731512454196">Healy, 2008b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1049731512454196">Mapp, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>This focus is consonant with the U.S. tendency to view human rights concerns as problems located beyond our national borders. Writing in <italic>Social Work</italic>, NASW’s flagship journal, Stanley Witkin spoke directly to the U.S. preference for imagining human rights issues to be other countries’ problems:</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>In the United States, these commitments to human rights appear less visible and integrated with social work practice and research. In my view, this is the result of our emphases on individual change, psychological explanation, and conventional science. Our human rights stance also is influenced by our (that is, Western) view of ourselves as the center of the universe and the representation of good. This perspective is reinforced by a capitalist political economy whose myths tend to obscure rights issues while claiming to champion them. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1049731512454196">Witkin, 1998</xref>, pp. 197–198)</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Witkin’s analysis suggests both profession-specific and larger sociopolitical explanations for why U.S. social workers might not identify themselves as human rights workers. Lena Dominelli has an alternate explanation. She blames social work education, writing, “Despite the relevance of human rights to all countries, social work educators have failed to make this issue an explicit and central part of the social work curriculum” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1049731512454196">Dominelli, 2007</xref>, p. 21). If social work students are not educated about our professional commitments to human rights, how will they learn to identify as human rights workers?</p>
<p>Human rights attitudes and behaviors have never been measured in the social work literature, but scholars in other fields have made efforts in this direction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1049731512454196">Cohrs, Maes, Moschner, &amp; Kielman, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1049731512454196">Harff, 1987</xref>; McFarland &amp; Mathews, 2005; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1049731512454196">Stellmacher, Sommer, &amp; Brahler, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1049731512454196">Torney-Purta, Wilkenfeld, &amp; Barber, 2008</xref>). Perhaps, the most significant effort to measure support of human rights has been the development of the Human Rights Questionnaire (HRQ) by Diaz-Veizades, Widaman, Little, and Gibbs. The HRQ measures endorsement of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR) principles in a general audience (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1049731512454196">Diaz-Veizades Widaman, Little, &amp; Gibbs, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1049731512454196">McFarland &amp; Mathews, 2005</xref>). In the HRQ, human rights endorsement is defined as agreement with or endorsement of principles associated with the UDHR.</p>
<p>Scholars have hypothesized that human rights attitudes are multidimensional in nature and cannot be captured with a unidimensional instrument (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1049731512454196">Crowson, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1049731512454196">Diaz-Veizades et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1049731512454196">Hertel, Scruggs, &amp; Heidkamp, 2009</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1049731512454196">McFarland and Mathews (2005)</xref> suggested three components: (1) endorsement, (2) commitment, and (3) restriction. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1049731512454196">DeMaio (1984)</xref> expressed concern that measures focused only on self-reported attitudes might be inflated due to social desirability. One proposed solution has been the introduction of behavior-related questions to partially control for the expected overreport of supportive attitudes regarding human rights (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1049731512454196">Diaz-Veizades et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1049731512454196">Hertel et al., 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>We believe the significance of human rights to the social work profession is clear. What is not clear is whether U.S. social workers believe that their U.S.-based work in violence, poverty, corrections, education, and health is an opportunity to advocate for the human rights of their clients. The development of scales to measure human rights engagement and exposure among social workers can provide initial evidence supporting the tools for assessing existing tendencies and for evaluating training designed to develop relevant awareness and skills.</p>

<title>Instrument Development</title>
<p>As stated in the introduction, this article describes the development and initial validation of a pair of unidimensional scales, HRESW and HRXSW. As initially proposed, however, the HRESW was a single multidimensional scale that included exposure as well as three additional domains; ultimately, as we will explain here, this measure was partitioned and validated as two distinct measures.</p>
<p>As originally conceived, the HRESW was designed to measure human rights engagement among social workers using four domains: (1) Exposure, (2) Endorsement, (3) Relevance, and (4) Practice. For the purposes of the HRESW, <italic>Exposure</italic> was defined as reported experience and education related to human rights principles; <italic>Endorsement</italic> was defined as expressed agreement with human rights principles as articulated in the UDHR; <italic>Relevance</italic> was defined as the expressed belief that it is appropriate for social workers to focus on clients’ access to human rights; and <italic>Practice</italic> was defined as the personal deployment (past, present, and future) of human rights principles in social work assessment and practice. To capture the Exposure domain, items were developed to address social workers’ familiarity with and ongoing exposure to human right issues, for example, “I have read the UDHR,” “My coursework covered international human rights issues,” and “Social work has been a good way for me to learn about human rights.” For the Endorsement, Relevance, and Practices domains, items were developed by sampling the UDHR for content and tone, as well as for related ideas from the NASW Code of Ethics. Some example items included: for Endorsement, “Everyone has the right to reasonable working hours and periodic holidays with pay;” for Relevance, “It is unethical for social workers to ignore violations of their clients’ human rights;” and for Practice, “I advocate for my clients’ right to high-quality, accessible healthcare.” The initial item pool was made up of 48 items. The study was approved by the Institutional Review Board (IRB) at Florida State University.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1049731512454196">
<title>Content Validation</title>
<p>Evidence of content validity for the HRESW was established through the use of an eight-member panel of experts and practitioners in the fields of social work and human rights. The panel evaluated each scale item for its conceptual goodness of fit to one of the four HRESW domain definitions. The potential range of responses was from 1 (<italic>not at all</italic>) to 5 (<italic>well</italic>). Mean panelist ratings for items ranged from 3.25 to 4.88 on this 5-point scale evaluating how well each item matched the target definition. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1049731512454196">Table 1</xref> reports the mean panelist rating by domain. Overall, 6 of the 48 items (12.5%) received a mean rating under 4; four of those items were discarded and two were thoroughly revised according to experts’ written suggestions. Thus, the HRESW item pool was made up of 44 items, comprising the four hypothesized subscales, each with 11 items.</p>

<title>Sampling Method</title>
<p>The target population for this validation study was students in social work classes aged 18 years and older. Students were accessed through a purposive, nonprobability sampling method at a major public university in the southeastern United States during spring semester 2011. The researcher contacted all social work faculty members with course enrollments of 20 students or more and explained the survey instrument in a form letter via e-mail. With faculty permission, the point-in-time survey was administered in the classroom setting, and a sample of 287 students was obtained.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-1049731512454196">
<title>Instrumentation</title>
<p>The HRESW was validated using an 85-item, pen-and-paper survey instrument containing the HRESW (44 items), questions related to demographics and social work experience (8 items), and additional scales and items for testing construct validation hypotheses (33 items). Item responses were indicated on a 7-point Likert-type scale ranging from <italic>strongly disagree</italic> (1) to <italic>strongly agree</italic> (7). Prior to survey administration, students were read an IRB-approved script with instructions for completing the scale. Emphasis was placed on the voluntary and anonymous nature of participation. The survey was administered only once to eligible individuals. Written instructions for completing the scale were included in the instrument (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table7-1049731512454196">Table 7</xref>) and a consent letter with a description of the project and the investigators’ contact information was given to the students to keep. All students present in the classroom were given refreshments, regardless of their participation in the survey.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-1049731512454196">
<title>Additional Measures</title>
<p>Two additional scales were included in the instrument to test convergent construct validity hypotheses, the Social Dominance Orientation (SDO) scale, which measures expressed belief in inequality, and the HRQ–Equality subscale (HRQE), which measures endorsement of equal rights (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1049731512454196">Diaz-Veizades et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1049731512454196">Pratto, Sidanius, Stallworth, &amp; Malle, 1994</xref>). The SDO measures one’s degree of preference for social inequality, and a high SDO score has been negatively correlated with empathy, tolerance, communality, and altruism in previous research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1049731512454196">Pratto et al., 1994</xref>). For this study, high scores on the global HRESW (indicating greater engagement with human rights) were hypothesized to correlate negatively with SDO scores, and high scores on the HRESW Endorsement subscale were hypothesized to positively correlate with scores on the HRQ–Equality subscale.</p>
<p>To address the potential for the inflated self-reports of attitudes favoring human rights that have been found in the literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1049731512454196">Diaz-Viezades et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1049731512454196">Hertel et al., 2009</xref>), three dichotomous, behavioral items were included in the questionnaire: “I donate money to human rights organizations,” “I sign petitions to protest human rights violations,” and “I encourage my friends to get involved in human rights activities.” These 3 items were scored to create a Human Rights Behavior Index (HRBI) that could be used to examine evidence of construct validity of the HRESW (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1049731512454196">Table 2</xref>). Though the internal consistency obtained here (α  = .591) was marginal, we accepted it with caution for use in this pilot validation with a reasonably large sample (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1049731512454196">Pedhazur &amp; Schmelkin, 1991</xref>). High scores on the HRBI (representing greater behavioral endorsement) were hypothesized to positively correlate with high scores on the HRESW Practice subscale. Item validity indicators were also employed for all four proposed subscales of the HRESW: “I feel that I have been exposed to and educated about human rights principles and issues” (Exposure); “I agree with the human rights principles articulated in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights” (Endorsement); “Working for human rights is an important part of what social workers do” (Relevance); and “I apply (or plan to apply) human rights principles in my own social work practice” (Practice). The Endorsement validity indicator purposefully echoed the Endorsement construct definition of the HRQ. No significant correlations were expected between the global score on the HRESW and respondents’ age or education.</p>

<title>Analytic Strategy</title>
<p>Survey data (<italic>N</italic> = 287) were entered into Predictive Analytics Software, version 18.0, for analysis. Descriptive statistics were run on all 85 survey items to test distributions and to analyze demographic survey items. Four surveys were removed from the sample due to high proportion of missing data (&gt;10%), yielding a final sample of 283 usable cases; also, five kurtotic (kurtosis &gt; 10.0) items were removed from the HRESW item pool. Missing values analyses on the remaining 39-scale items showed that less than 1% of the HRESW data were missing. Missingness on 6 items exceeded 1%, and no item had more than 2.1% missing. Little’s missing completely at random (MCAR) was insignificant (χ<sup>2</sup> = 870.026, degrees of freedom [<italic>df</italic>] = 927, <italic>p</italic> = .909) indicating that any missing data were MCAR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1049731512454196">SPSS, 2007</xref>). Therefore, HRESW missing values were replaced using the estimation maximization algorithm (EM) method in order to maximize sample size (Dempster, Laird, &amp; Rubin, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1049731512454196">1977</xref>).</p>
<p>As will be detailed further in the results section, the hypothesized scales were evaluated for reliability, factor structure, and construct validity. Internal consistency was assessed using Cronbach’s coefficient α (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1049731512454196">Cronbach &amp; Meehl, 1955</xref>) and standard error of measurement (SEM) was also calculated. Factor structure was established using confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) and exploratory factor analysis (EFA). Finally, construct validity was assessed using Pearson’s correlations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1049731512454196">Abell, Springer, &amp; Kamata, 2009</xref>).</p>

<p>Educationally, 26.9% of the sample was composed of BSW students, 33.6% were MSW students, and 36% were undergraduates taking introductory social work classes (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1049731512454196">Table 3</xref>). Respondents were asked whether they had experience in social work as volunteers, in academic placements, or in the workforce: 69.3% of the sample reported experience in at least one of these three areas; 30.4% of respondents reported no experience in the field (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1049731512454196">Table 3</xref>).</p>

<title>Initial Reliability</title>
<p>Cronbach’s α coefficients were calculated for each proposed subscale and for the 39-item global scale to test for internal scale consistency. Alpha-if-item-deleted indices were examined to determine whether deletion of particular items would increase the internal consistency of a scale. One item each in the Endorsement, Relevance, and Practice subscales was removed for this purpose. Final αs for each of the proposed subscales exceeded .70: Exposure (α = .734), Endorsement (α = .765), Relevance (α = .723), and Practice (α = .793). SEM statistics were also calculated for each subscale and all values were less than or equal to the critical value of 5% of the possible range of scores (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1049731512454196">Abell et al., 2009</xref>). As Cronbach’s α may underestimate the reliability of a multidimensional scale, a global, stratified α was computed for the 36 HRESW items (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1049731512454196">Abell et al., 2009</xref>). As expected, the stratified α (.884) was slightly higher than Cronbach’s α (.870).</p>

<title>CFA</title>
<p>The predicted measurement model for HRESW with 36 observed and 4 latent variables was entered into LISREL 8.8. CFA revealed a significant χ<sup>2</sup> value of 1461.07 (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .01) that rejected the hypothesis that the model was correct. However, the ratio of χ<sup>2</sup> to <italic>df</italic> (χ<sup>2</sup>/<italic>df</italic> = 2.48) was below 3.0. Other indices were examined for evidence of model fit, including the Comparative Fit Index (CFI), the Tucker–Lewis Index (TLI), the root mean square of approximation (RMSEA), and the standardized root mean square residual (SRMR; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1049731512454196">Abell et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1049731512454196">Hu &amp; Bentler, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1049731512454196">Kline, 2005</xref>). In order to provide evidence of good model fit, the fit indices were expected to be at or to exceed their critical values: for the CFI and TLI, a value of .90 is acceptable with higher values being preferred; the RMSEA must be at or below .08 to be reasonable; and for the SRMR, a value of less than .10 is acceptable. For the initial 36-item/4-subscale model of the HRESW, only the TLI was outside the critical value threshold while the other indices suggested a reasonable model fit. Along with these encouraging fit indices, however, LISREL generated a warning on this model, “not positive definite,” due to high interfactor correlations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1049731512454196">Wothke, 1993</xref>). When the subscale correlation matrix was examined, it showed nearly identity-level correlations between Relevance and Practice (.94) and also between Relevance and Endorsement (.97). These high correlations called the initial factor structure into question (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-1049731512454196">Table 4</xref>).</p>

<title>EFA</title>
<p>To further explore the factor structure, an EFA was conducted using the same HRESW data. The Kaiser–Myer–Olkin Measure of Sampling Adequacy (KMO) was used to determine whether the data were likely to factor well. The KMO statistic must be .60 or higher to proceed with factor analysis; in this case, the KMO was .86 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1049731512454196">Kaiser, 1974</xref>). The initial principal component analysis yielded nine factors with eigenvalues greater than 1 and accounted for over 58% of the variance. Examination of the rotated factor loadings showed that items from the hypothesized Endorsement, Relevance, and Practice subscales—the same hypothesized subscales that had been flagged for high correlations in CFA—all loaded on to five subscales with multiple cross-loadings, accounting for 45.05% of the variance. The 11 items in the proposed Exposure subscale loaded onto four factors and accounted for 13.41% of the variance. There were no cross-loaded items between the hypothesized Exposure items and any of the three other hypothesized subscales.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section15-1049731512454196">
<title>Revised Factor Structure</title>
<p>Based on the results from the CFA and EFA, and after reappraising the initial HRESW model, a new factor structure for the HRESW was hypothesized. Both the CFA and EFA indicated that there was considerable overlap among item responses originally intended to reflect the Endorsement, Relevance, and Practice (ERP) domains. Factor analyses also indicated that the Exposure domain stood distinct from the other three. Together, these analyses suggested combining the ERP domains into one combined new domain, and retaining Exposure as a second domain. In addition, we considered whether, from an applied perspective, the resulting scale structure would be best represented as a single instrument with two subscales, or as two free-standing but substantially related instruments. This led to a reevaluation of the original theoretical basis of the construction of the HRESW.</p>
<p>Looking back at the domain definitions and examples, we observed that the ERP items had been similarly sampled, tapping the content of the UDHR to probe individuals’ beliefs and practices in relation to specific rights and issues, while the Exposure items avoided individual beliefs and practices and emphasized education, experience, and familiarity with the human rights documents and topics.</p>
<p>Thus, a new model was hypothesized that divided the initial HRESW into two discrete unidimensional scales. The HRESW was modeled as a 25-item measure of human rights Engagement, now defined as a construct comprised of the endorsement of human rights principles, a belief that those principles are relevant to social work, and a commitment to putting those principles into social work practice. The HRXSW was modeled as an 11-item scale measuring Exposure, defined as reported experience and education related to human rights principles. To test these new hypotheses, two additional CFAs were run on these unidimensional scales (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-1049731512454196">Table 5</xref>). In the initial CFA model for the unidimensional HRESW, the χ<sup>2</sup> to <italic>df</italic> ratio (χ<sup>2</sup>/<italic>df</italic> = 3.12) and the RMSEA (.097) were too high. After adopting modification indices allowing the errors of 9 item pairs to correlate in the respecified model, the CFI, the TLI, RMSEA, SRMR, and the χ<sup>2</sup> to <italic>df</italic> ratio all provided evidence that the 25-item, unidimensional HRESW was a good fit. In the initial CFA for the HRXSW, the χ<sup>2</sup> to <italic>df</italic> ratio (χ<sup>2</sup>/<italic>df</italic> = 4.91) and the RMSEA (.12) were too high; also, the CFI and TLI were out of range. After allowing the errors of 7 item pairs to correlate in the respecified model, the CFI, the TLI, RMSEA, SRMR, and the χ<sup>2</sup> to <italic>df</italic> ratio all gave evidence that the 11-item, unidimensional HRXSW was an acceptable fit.</p>

<title>Final HRESW and HRXSW Models</title>
<p>Evidence from factor analysis supported a unidimensional 25-item HRESW, as well as an independent 11-item HRXSW. Reliability was assessed on both models. Cronbach’s α coefficient for the unidimensional HRESW was strong (α = .894). Results for the HRXSW were identical to those for the original Exposure subscale (α = .734), and fell within the acceptable range. Scale SEMs provided additional evidence of acceptable reliability (SEM<sub>HRESW</sub> = 1.71; SEM<sub>HRXSW</sub> = 2.65). Given the strong evidence for these new scale structures, scale means and standard deviations were calculated: HRESW (25 items; <italic>M</italic> = 6.02; <italic>SD =</italic> .644) and HRXSW (11 items; <italic>M</italic> = 4.46; <italic>SD =</italic> .905).</p>

<title>Construct Validity Evidence</title>
<p>Construct validity was assessed by hypothesizing and then testing relationships between the two new scales, HRESW and HRXSW, and other constructs and measures that had been established in the literature. Indicators that had been hypothesized to correlate individually with the Endorsement, Relevance, or Practice subscales were evaluated against the HRESW, while indicators hypothesized to correlate with the Exposure subscale were evaluated against the HRXSW (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table6-1049731512454196">Table 6</xref>). Evidence of construct validity was found based on the significance and magnitude of those hypothesized relationships as expressed in bivariate correlations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1049731512454196">Springer, Abell, &amp; Nugent, 2002</xref>).</p>

<p>Two previously validated instruments were included in the survey instrument for use in construct validity, the SDO scale, which measures expressed belief in social inequalities, and the Equality subscale of the Human Rights Questionnaire (HRQE), which measures endorsement of “equal access to basic rights” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1049731512454196">Diaz-Veizades et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1049731512454196">Pratto et al., 1994</xref>). The SDO performed well in this sample (α = .878) and, as hypothesized, a significant negative relationship emerged between the SDO and the HRESW (<italic>r</italic>
<sub>HRESW</sub> = −.645; <italic>r</italic>
<sup>2</sup> = .416). In this sample, the HRQE (<italic>M</italic> = 6.26, <italic>SD</italic> = .42) had a Cronbach’s α of .679, an acceptable level of reliability for a construct validity indicator (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1049731512454196">Nunnally &amp; Bernstein, 1994</xref>); also, it demonstrated a significant, positive relationship with the HRESW (<italic>r</italic> = .483; <italic>r</italic>

<p>Each subscale was hypothesized to correlate significantly with a single-item validity indicator (SVI) restating its construct definition; all SVIs were normally distributed. As expected, the indicator for Exposure correlated moderately with the HRXSW (<italic>r</italic> = .563; <italic>r</italic>

This indicator reads, “I agree with the human right principles articulated in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.” This survey item had significant missingness (5.3% missing; <italic>N</italic> = 268), and multiple respondents noted on the survey that they were unfamiliar with the UDHR. These issues may account for the low performance of the item.</p>
<p>A final convergent validity indicator was constructed from the data. The HRBI is a measure constructed from three survey questions asking respondents about their participation in human rights activities (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1049731512454196">Table 2</xref>). Three dichotomous items were summed to create the HRBI (<italic>M</italic> = 1.23; <italic>SD</italic> = 1.07; α = .591), which correlated significantly with the HRESW (<italic>r</italic> = .474; <italic>r</italic>
<sup>2</sup> = .225). To sum up, all hypothesized convergent relationships were tested by computing correlation coefficients and were found to be statistically significant, and with the exception of the Endorsement validity indicator, they were of reasonably large magnitude, with mean convergent indicator effect sizes exceeding .30.</p>
<p>Discriminant hypotheses stated that there would be no significant relationships between age or education and the global HRESW; in this sample, small significant relationships emerged in both cases: age was weakly related to the HRESW (<italic>r</italic>
<sub>HRESW</sub> = .129, <italic>r</italic>
<sup>2</sup> = .017; <italic>r</italic>
<sub>HRXSW</sub> = .170, <italic>r</italic>
<sup>2</sup> = .029), as was education (<italic>r</italic>
<sub>HRESW</sub> = .127, <italic>r</italic>
<sup>2</sup> = .016; <italic>r</italic>
<sub>HRXSW</sub> = .103<sub>NS</sub>). Though these relationships were significant, their magnitude was small: age explained less than 3% of the variance in human rights engagement, while education explained less than 2%.</p>

<title>HRESW and HRXSW</title>
<p>Factor analysis, reliability analysis, and the construct validity hypotheses all provide initial evidence for the validation of a pair of related scales, the HRESW and the HRXSW. HRESW is a construct comprised of an endorsement of human rights principles, a belief that those principles are relevant to social work, and a commitment to putting those principles into social work practice. Exposure, as measured by the HRXSW, is a related construct. Exploring the relationship between Human Rights Engagement (HRESW) and Exposure (HRXSW) further, the bivariate correlation between the two scales is significant at .294. When the HRESW is regressed on Exposure, the model is significant (<italic>F</italic> = 26.488, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01), and Exposure predicts less than 9% of Human Rights Engagement.</p>

<xref ref-type="table" rid="table7-1049731512454196">Table 7</xref> provides the full 25-item, HRESW scale with instructions for its completion. Flesch–Kincaid readability analysis rated the scale at the 9.7 level, confirming that it can be used appropriately with a college and graduate population. The HRESW is scored by computing a mean of all item responses after reversing responses for Items 4 and 8. This results in a score ranging from 1 to 7, where higher scores reflect greater engagement with human rights.</p>

<title>Discussion and Applications to Social Work</title>
<p>This article presents the initial validation of a pair of scales to measure human rights engagement and exposure in social workers. The evidence indicates the HRESW and the HRXSW are reliable and valid tools that can be used to measure human rights engagement and exposure. The HRESW has good content validity, strong reliability, acceptable model fit, and solid preliminary evidence of construct validity. The HRXSW has good content validity, adequate reliability, and preliminary evidence of construct validity. Both scales are easy to administer and pose little burden on respondents.</p>
<p>The HRESW and the HRXSW—used individually or as two related measures—have direct applicability to social work education. The HRXSW can measure students’ exposure to human rights principles, especially, as that exposure relates to social work education, for example, “My social work curriculum covered the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR)” and “Social work has been a good way for me to learn about human rights.” The HRESW can measure students’ engagement with human rights, or we could say, their passion for human rights and social work. In this preliminary study, students had higher levels of engagement with human rights than exposure to its principles. In fact, exposure predicted less than 9% of students’ human rights engagement, and the level of social work education was not a significant predictor of human rights exposure in this student sample.</p>
<p>CSWE’s 2008 Educational Policy and Accreditation Standards require social work educators to teach their students to “advance human rights” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1049731512454196">CSWE, 2009</xref>). Given the importance of this mandate and its challenge to social work educators, these two scales may be used by social work educators to measure exposure and engagement in their students. Scores from classroom samples could provide a springboard for discussion of the importance of human rights and its role in social work practice. By employing the scales as a pretest, teachers or administrators could use these scales to measure the effect of a certain course or teaching module on students’ overall levels of exposure and engagement. Teachers may also find the HRBI useful in the classroom setting.</p>
<p>Beyond the classroom, these measures may have broader relevance to U.S. social work practice. Future research should include a validation study of these scales in a population of practicing social work professionals. If indeed the measures prove valid in other samples, researchers may be able to use them to find out whether U.S. social workers see themselves as human rights professionals. If social workers are found to have high levels of human rights engagement, then data collected using these measures might be used to market social work as a human rights profession and thereby draw individuals with a human rights focus into the field. If U.S. social workers have low levels of human rights engagement, then the results are a challenge to social work educators to increase or improve the human rights content of the social work curriculum.</p>
<p>As originally hypothesized, human rights engagement was composed of four subscales; in the final version, human rights engagement is a unidimensional scale made up of items from the original endorsement, relevance, and practice subscales. The originally hypothesized exposure subscale was separated from engagement and became a free-standing unidimensional scale. While the evidence from reliability, factor analysis, and construct validity support these reconceptualizations, further evidence from additional studies deploying the HRESW and HRXSW is needed.</p>
<p>This study was validated in a diverse student sample of 287 students taking social work classes, and the sample included freshmen taking their first social work classes as well as master’s level students. The student sample is a strength of this study, as social work students are a primary focus for this research. Further studies should test these measures on separate student samples of BSW and MSW students, as well as on social workers in the field. These instruments might be further utilized to compare U.S.-based social work students with students in other countries.</p>
