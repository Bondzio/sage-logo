<abstract>
<p>The purpose of this study was to examine six early numeracy measures used to monitor the mathematics progress of kindergarten and first-grade students. Seventy-one kindergarten students and 75 first-grade students were administered the measures each week. Delayed-alternate form reliability was adequate for instructional decision making on some measures, and low reliability was reported for quantity discrimination, as well as for the next number and number facts measures. Concurrent criterion validity coefficients comparing the measures with student performance on the <italic>Woodcock-Johnson Tests of Achievement–Third Edition</italic> (WJ III) resulted in weaker coefficients as compared to previous studies that have compared similar measures with the WJ III. Hierarchical linear modeling was used at each grade level to ascertain the ability of the six measures to model weekly growth trajectories over 13 weeks. All measures produced growth rates that were significant across time, for both kindergarten and first grade, with linear growth observed for all measures.</p>

<p>Researchers and educators have become increasingly alarmed about low mathematics proficiency among American students when comparing achievement both nationally and internationally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1534508411414151">National Research Council, 2001</xref>). The <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1534508411414151">National Assessment of Educational Progress (2007)</xref> indicates that mathematics achievement has improved only slightly in fourth and eighth grades over the last 10 years, and that a troubling gap remains for students from lower-income and minority backgrounds, as well as for those with disabilities. Knowledge of mathematics is necessary in order to attain skills needed to succeed in today’s technologically driven environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1534508411414151">Minskoff &amp; Allsopp, 2003</xref>). In addition, mathematics is often used as the primary language through which other subjects such as chemistry, physics, and economics explain their content (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1534508411414151">Minskoff &amp; Allsopp, 2003</xref>). Finally, proficiency in mathematics is often used as a benchmark that determines advancement to the next grade level.</p>
<p>To focus attention on low mathematics proficiency, the U.S. Department of Education formed a panel of experts tasked with examining the current status of mathematics education and recommending solutions to improve mathematics performance among American students (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1534508411414151">National Mathematics Advisory Panel, 2008</xref>). Among the goals listed in the panel’s mission statement, two are intended to increase teacher instructional effectiveness: Inform instruction through high-quality research and improve assessments that are used to monitor student progress and guide instruction. One particular method used for determining instructional effectiveness and indicating student progress is curriculum-based measurement (CBM; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1534508411414151">Deno, 1985</xref>). CBM is a technically adequate method that is used to facilitate accurate and timely instructional decisions based on student data.</p>
<sec id="section1-1534508411414151">
<title>Previous CBM Early Mathematics Progress Monitoring Studies</title>
<p>CBM provides teachers with an efficient progress monitoring system that produces reliable, meaningful information for monitoring student proficiency while giving teachers the ability to gauge the effectiveness of their instruction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1534508411414151">Deno, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1534508411414151">Deno &amp; Fuchs, 1987</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1534508411414151">Fuchs (2004)</xref> describes CBM research as progressing in three stages. Stage 1 research has focused on examining measures at a static point in time, such as universal screening. In early mathematics, there is empirical support for using CBM for universal screening (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1534508411414151">Baker et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1534508411414151">Chard et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1534508411414151">Lembke &amp; Foegen, 2009</xref>). Stage 2 research examines a measure’s ability to capture the presence of growth or slope (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1534508411414151">Chard et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1534508411414151">Clarke &amp; Shinn, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1534508411414151">Fuchs, Fuchs, Compton, Hamlett, &amp; Seethaler, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1534508411414151">Lembke, Foegen, Whittaker, &amp; Hampton, 2008</xref>), and Stage 3 research examines teacher implementation and use of CBM data in classrooms.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1534508411414151">Clarke and Shinn (2004)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1534508411414151">Chard et al. (2005)</xref> sought to identify potential screening and progress monitoring measures for students in first grade and kindergarten, respectively. In both studies, measures included Oral Counting (OC), Number Identification (NI), Quantity Discrimination (QD), and Missing Number (MN). In kindergarten, each measure demonstrated adequate alternate form and criterion validity (range: .50–.69) with the Number Knowledge Test (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1534508411414151">Okamoto &amp; Case, 1996</xref>). In first grade, the measures demonstrated moderate to strong reliability and criterion validity coefficients (range: .60–.79) with criterion measures.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1534508411414151">Clarke and Shinn (2004)</xref> also examined sensitivity to growth. They reported that OC appeared to be the most sensitive, although it also demonstrated the lowest reliability and validity of the four measures. Despite stronger correlation coefficients, the other measures were less sensitive to growth. Although high sensitivity to growth is desirable, one potential concern is that great change in growth scores may be associated with higher levels of measurement error. Assuming that a measure has potential utility for monitoring progress may not be appropriate; concerns about reliability and measurement error make it less likely that a test is not a “true” estimate of growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1534508411414151">Harvel, 2000</xref>). In addition, in the Clarke and Shinn study, growth was determined from analyzing differences between three data points (fall, winter, and spring). Although three data points are the minimum number required to establish growth, multiple data points are needed to establish mean growth rates with adequate precision (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1534508411414151">Raudenbush &amp; Bryk, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1534508411414151">Singer &amp; Willett, 2003</xref>). In the present study, we examined growth rates for each measure across 13 weeks to create actual indices of weekly growth and more closely examine measurement error.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1534508411414151">Fuchs et al. (2007)</xref> examined mathematics CBM with 667 first-grade students who demonstrated mathematics difficulties. The students were then followed through the end of second grade. Five screening measures were administered on entry into first grade: fact retrieval, CBM computation, number identification, concepts, and a multiskill measure. Results of logistic regression analysis indicated that three measures, concepts, computation, and multiskill, yielded a strong model fit, suggesting that results from these measures may identify students who may be struggling with early mathematics in first grade. Further study is needed to determine if the measures can be used for students in kindergarten and if the measures can be used weekly to monitor students’ progress. Both of these issues are addressed in the present study.</p>
<p>In <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1534508411414151">Lembke et al. (2008)</xref>, three early numeracy measures that had previously demonstrated moderate to strong reliability and validity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1534508411414151">Lembke &amp; Foegen, 2009</xref>) were examined as measures of weekly progress. NI, QD, and MN measures produced growth rates that were significant across time, yet linear growth was indicated for NI only. This suggests that either student growth was nonlinear due to the nature of skill acquisition during early mathematics instruction, or that MN and QD measures were not as effective as other measures of progress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1534508411414151">Lembke et al., 2008</xref>). This issue of nonlinearity is important when examining the practicality of using certain measures for weekly monitoring and for teachers to make accurate instructional decisions for their students. One important objective of the analyses of growth trajectories lies in the establishment of stability of slope over time. Once stability of the slope is established, instructional effectiveness can be assessed. If further studies confirm the nonlinear nature of student performance on some of the early numeracy measures, educators may need to extend data collection and modify decision-making rules to allow additional time for students to attain skills (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1534508411414151">Lembke et al., 2008</xref>). The present study continues to examine whether early numeracy measures provide linear growth data for kindergarten and first-grade students.</p>

<title>Purpose and Goals</title>
<p>The primary goal of this study was to extend the current knowledge base on using early mathematics CBM for progress monitoring with kindergarten and first-grade students. Our hypotheses were that (a) the early numeracy measures would have moderate to strong delayed alternate form reliability, concurrent criterion validity, and predictive validity and (b) all measures would demonstrate significant growth and that students would grow the most on number identification and quantity discrimination (based on the findings of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1534508411414151">Lembke, Foegen, Whitaker, &amp; Hampton, 2008</xref>). In addition, if statistically significant growth was evident, we wanted to determine which measures exhibit the greatest weekly growth.</p>

<title>Early numeracy measures</title>
<p>The measures used for the study were from the mClass mathematics system (available through <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.wirelessgeneration.com">http://www.wirelessgeneration.com</ext-link>). Each participant completed an alternative form of four (kindergarten) or six (first-grade) measures each week for 13 weeks, and each measure was scored by counting total items correct. The order in which the measures were presented to students was counterbalanced each week to reduce the potential for fatigue effects systematically affecting the results. For kindergarten students, the measures consisted of Counting, NI, MN, and QD, whereas first-grade students also completed Next Number (NN) and Number Facts (NF). Descriptions of each measure are presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1534508411414151">Table 1</xref>.</p>

<title>Criterion measure</title>
<p>The measure used in determining concurrent criterion validity was the Broad Math Score of the <italic>Woodcock Johnson Battery of Achievement–III</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1534508411414151">Woodcock, McGrew, &amp; Mather, 2001</xref>). Broad Math is a combination of the Calculation, Mathematics Fluency, and Applied Problems subtests. The calculation subtest is composed of progressively complex whole, mixed, and rational numbers using all mathematics operations. The fluency subtest is a 3-min, timed worksheet with single-digit addition, subtraction, and multiplication problems. The applied problems subtest is composed of both word and picture problems with narrative provided by an examiner. In some cases, the students can use paper and pencil to solve the problems. The WJ III Broad Mathematics battery was selected because of its strong reliability for the mathematics cluster (.95 for ages 5–19), and moderate criterion validity with the Kauffman Test of Education Achievement (.52) and the Wechsler Individual Achievement Test (.70).</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-1534508411414151">
<title>Procedure</title>
<p>All data were collected and scored by examiners who participated in a 3-hour training session. Training consisted of explicit instruction, modeling, guided, and independent practice of skills required to administer the measures. At the end of the training session, they administered each measure to a peer while the trainer observed and completed a 13-item fidelity checklist. Accuracy of implementation for all data collectors was greater than 95% for the training. To determine interrater reliability, the PI simultaneously scored each test protocol after the examiner gave directions to the students. Data were collected on at least 25% (range: 25%–27%) of administrations each week. Scoring accuracy for all measures was higher than 96% each week, and was determined by a common percent agreement index.</p>
<p>Alternate forms of each progress monitoring measure were individually administered each week for 13 weeks, in a quiet setting outside of the classroom. Stimulus items for three of the measures, MN, NI, and QD, were presented to the student using a printed paper booklet. Items for counting, NN, and NF were presented orally to each student. More detail about measure construction can be found in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1534508411414151">Table 1</xref>. Student responses were recorded, scored, and displayed using handheld-to-web technology on a personal digital assistant. After the completion of the 13 forms of each measure over 13 weeks, the WJ III Broad Math subtests were administered to all participants. In the event of student absence, make-up assessments were generally administered within that same week.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-1534508411414151">
<title>Data Analysis</title>
<p>Pearson product–moment correlation analysis was used to determine delayed alternate-form reliability, concurrent criterion validity, and predictive validity for each measure. Standards to determine reliability vary depending on the nature of the test and its purpose. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1534508411414151">Salvia, Ysseldyke, and Bolt (2007)</xref> recommend a standard of .90 for tests that are used for important decisions such as eligibility and identification, .80 for tests that are used for screening, and .60 for group tests. The rationale and procedures for determining criterion validity and predictive validity are derived from the standards for educational and psychological testing (American Education Research Association, American Psychological Association, &amp; National Council on Measurement in Education [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1534508411414151">AERA, APA, &amp; NCME], 1999</xref>), and the importance of establishing these psychometric qualities is highlighted in this text.</p>
<p>Two-Level Hierarchical Linear Modeling (HLM) was used to examine if kindergarten and first-grade students made significant improvement on the early numeracy measures. HLM software 7.0 Beta (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1534508411414151">Raudenbush &amp; Bryk, 2010</xref>) with full information likelihood estimation was used when the analyses were conducted. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1534508411414151">Shin, Espin, Deno, and McConnell (2004)</xref> demonstrated how to apply HLM to repeated measures of CBM in order to model student growth. The authors demonstrated that HLM has advantages over other statistical models such as logistic regression, analysis of variance (ANOVA) and structural equation modeling (SEM). The reported advantages included flexibility in research design and estimating growth rates and their relations to correlates with superior reliability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1534508411414151">Shin et al, 2004</xref>). CBM was also reported to lend itself well to HLM due to the ability to provide multiple data points within a relatively short time frame, superior validity and reliability, and proven sensitivity to detecting small levels of change over time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1534508411414151">Shin et al., 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>The use of HLM allows for statistical examination of potentially nonlinear growth, and because nonlinear growth was observed in this study, polynomial models were fit to represent the appropriate growth pattern. The polynomial model tested was of second-order polynomials. After examining both the linear and the second-order polynomial models, it was established that a linear growth model fit the growth pattern best for both kindergarten and first-grade participants for all early numeracy measures. Therefore, the following two-level model was used to examine student scores on each measure across time:</p>

<p>where Yti is the observed outcome score for student <italic>i</italic> at time <italic>t; Time</italic> is the measurement time minus 13, so that π0i is the intercept or the expected outcome score for student <italic>i</italic> at the final measurement time (the 13th time point); π1i is the slope or the average growth rate in the outcome measure between each measurement time for student <italic>i</italic>; eti is the error for student <italic>i</italic>; β00 is the average intercept or average outcome score for the group of students at the final measurement time; β10 is the average slope or average growth rate between each measurement time for the group of students; and u0i and u1i are the random errors for the average intercept and slope, respectively. It must be noted that because of the possible dependency among students within the five different kindergarten classrooms, a conditional model was also fit. The conditional model included five Level 2 effects-coded predictor variables (representing the difference between five kindergarten teachers and the grand mean). The coefficients of interest in the respective unconditional and conditional kindergarten models did not differ substantially. Consequently, the unconditional models were interpreted for the kindergarten students as well.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>Descriptive statistics were calculated for scores on each of the early numeracy measures at each grade. Descriptive statistics are reported in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1534508411414151">Tables 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1534508411414151">3</xref>. For kindergarten students, mean scores were highest on the Counting measure, with score ranges from 54.2 to 72.4, followed by NI (19.2–29.5), and QD (16.1–24.6). Similar results are reported for first-grade students: Counting (78.1–91.5), NI (38.1–45.4), QD (30.0–36.3), NN (15.8–19.7), and NF (5.1–8.2). One first-grade student achieved a ceiling on five forms of the QD measure, while floor effects were minimal across students.</p>

<title>Reliability</title>
<p>Delayed alternate-form reliability for both kindergarten and first grade was determined by comparing each form to an adjacent week’s form. Kindergarten coefficients were generally strong, with scores ranging from .85 to .90 for Counting and from .87 to .94 for the NI measure. The weakest coefficients were reported on the MN and QD measures (.72 and .69, respectively). All correlation coefficients were found to be statistically significant at an alpha level of <italic>p</italic> &lt;.001. First-grade delayed alternate-form reliability coefficients were moderate to strong for each measure: Counting (.83–.91), NI (.84–.91), QD (.63–.84), NN (.52–.80), and NF (.63–.81).

<title>Concurrent and Predictive Criterion Validity</title>
<p>Concurrent correlation coefficients were calculated between mean scores from Week 12 and the WJ III Broad Math standard score. For kindergarten students, criterion validity coefficients ranged from weak to low-moderate, with Counting yielding the strongest coefficient of .45, and QD demonstrating the lowest at .26. For first-grade students, coefficients ranged from low to moderate in strength, with NF receiving the strongest correlation coefficient, reported at .52, and MN the weakest correlation at .39. To determine predictive validity, correlations were calculated between the mean of the first two weekly forms and the WJ III Broad Math standard score. For kindergarten students, all coefficients revealed moderate correlations with the Counting (.56) and QD measures (.40). For first-graders, the coefficient for NF was strongest at .67 and Counting weakest at .44. Coefficients are reported in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-1534508411414151">Table 4</xref>.</p>

<p>The results for kindergarten students indicated a significant increase in average weekly growth across time (1.54 units of growth per week) on Counting, MN (.31), NI (.73), and QD (.60). For all measures, the average intercepts were significant and there was significant variation among kindergarten participants in terms of the final scores and growth rates. Results for first-grade students indicated a significant increase in average weekly growth across time on the Counting measure (1.16), the MN measure (.10), NN (.27), NF (.18), NI (.53), and QD (.48). The average intercepts were statistically significant and there was significant variation among first-grade participants on the final scores and growth rates, with the exception of NF, which did not demonstrate significant variation among students.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The purpose of this study was to extend the current knowledge base in early numeracy assessment by (a) increasing the length of time where progress monitoring effects for kindergarten and first-grade students in early numeracy were examined, (b) examining two measures that have not received prior analysis for progress monitoring, and (c) applying advanced statistical analysis (HLM) of growth models for the measures.</p>
<p>We administered four early numeracy measures (Counting, NI, MN, and QD) to kindergarten students, with the addition of the NN and NF measures for first-grade students. First-grade delayed alternate-form reliability provided the opportunity to test two new types of measures (NN and NF). Prior to this study, these two measures had not been examined for technical adequacy in progress monitoring. For kindergarten and first-grade measures, the strongest reliability coefficients were found in NI and Counting, similar to previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1534508411414151">Lembke et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1534508411414151">Lembke &amp; Foegen, 2008</xref>). QD revealed unexpected results for both kindergarten and first grade by demonstrating lower reliability coefficients than reported in other studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1534508411414151">Fuchs et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1534508411414151">Lembke et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1534508411414151">Lembke &amp; Foegen, 2009</xref>). We believe that the random placement of problems and numbers within problems could have negatively affected reliability of some of the measures, as opposed to conducting an item analysis and strategically selecting items. In addition, the oral presentation of the measures by the examiner may be a potential source of the lower reliability coefficients, as total correct is directly dependent on the pace and rate of presentation of items by the examiner.</p>
<p>Concurrent criterion validity is another important analysis for determining the technical adequacy of screening and progress monitoring measures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1534508411414151">AERA, APA, &amp; NCME, 1999</xref>). For the present study, the mathematics subtest of the WJ III was used as the criterion measure. For kindergarten measures, the validity coefficients were similar to previous studies and performed as expected with the WJ III Broad Math score. First-grade measures provided unexpected results as the two new measures revealed stronger coefficients than previously studied measures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1534508411414151">Lembke et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1534508411414151">Lembke &amp; Foegen, 2009</xref>).This may be due to the similarities in the format of the two measures with the mathematics subtests of the WJ III. Each of the subtests of the WJ III contains items pertaining to addition facts and next number problems. The weaker results for kindergarten students may be due to the nature of the WJ III and its practicality for use with young students versus other standardized mathematics batteries. The results were similar to previous studies that used the WJ III, but it is important to note that most previous studies have used other criterion measures, such as the Number Knowledge Test (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1534508411414151">Okamoto &amp; Case, 1996</xref>) and the Test of Early Mathematics Ability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1534508411414151">Ginsburg &amp; Baroody, 2003</xref>) for their analyses.</p>
<p>Concurrent criterion and predictive validity results revealed that the strongest coefficients are present for first-grade participants, and are generally similar to previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1534508411414151">Lembke et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1534508411414151">Lembke &amp; Foegen, 2009</xref>). The validity results suggest that the measures may be more effective predictors of student performance in first grade. Results of the two-level HLM analysis indicated that both kindergarten and first-grade students demonstrated significant linear growth on the Counting measure. Although Counting yielded the largest average weekly growth rate in the present study, it is unclear if the measure is an appropriate indicator of early numeracy proficiency. Our QD measure was weaker in terms of technical adequacy as compared to previous studies, yet the measure did demonstrate significant weekly growth with kindergarten and first grade. This measure also demonstrated greater weekly growth rates than observed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1534508411414151">Lembke and Foegen (2009)</xref> for kindergarten (.49), and first grade (.12), and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1534508411414151">Lembke et al. (2008)</xref> for kindergarten (.27) and first grade (.12). These findings support previous findings that suggested considerable weekly growth and support the use of this measure for progress monitoring. While all the measures demonstrated significant mean weekly growth rates, in order to be practical for teacher use, data would have to be interpreted across weeks because of the low weekly rate of growth. For example, it would take 10 weeks for first-grade students to grow one unit of growth on the MN measure. Similar rates occurred with the NF and NN measures.</p>
<p>The various analyses employed in the current study provided mixed results. Consistent with previous research, the Counting and NI measures performed to a level that suggest they have the potential to be considered for progress monitoring. The QD measure did not meet recommended technical adequacy thresholds for making educational decisions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1534508411414151">Salvia et al., 2007</xref>), which is contrary to previous research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1534508411414151">Chard et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1534508411414151">Clark &amp; Shinn, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1534508411414151">Fuchs et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1534508411414151">Lembke et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1534508411414151">Lembke &amp; Foegen, 2009</xref>; ). The NN and NF measures did not meet standards set by previous research because of weak delayed alternate-form reliability, but did outperform all other measures in concurrent criterion and predictive validity. Future research that seeks to determine the diagnostic accuracy of the measure’s ability to monitor kindergarten and first-grade students’ progress would provide a stronger case for the utility of the measures’ use by teachers.</p>
<p>As readers interpret findings, some important limitations in the present study should be considered. First, the participants were selected from one school district in a rural town in a Midwestern state. The homogeneous convenience sample of participants used in the study limits the generalizability of the findings to other school environments with diverse student populations. The decision to use the WJ III Broad Math score was an additional limitation for our study. While the WJ III has strong reliability and validity to support its use as a criterion measure, the lowest coefficients are present for those in early elementary grades, particularly in the mathematics subtests. The use of a standardized mathematics battery designed for and validated for use specifically for children in early elementary grades might have improved the validity results in our study. In addition, the use of a strict randomized construction rule in terms of numeral placement and item placement may have limited the alternate-form reliability results. The possibility of having the most difficult numerals and items at the beginning of a measure and disproportionately included on any particular page, may have inhibited the rate of responses for younger students from one week to the next.</p>

<title>Implications for Practice</title>
<p>The overall findings suggest that some measures can potentially be used for monitoring growth in early numeracy proficiency. For example, the NI and Counting measures demonstrated acceptable technical adequacy and mean growth rates that would be useful for weekly progress monitoring for both kindergarten and first-grade students. This study serves as a base from which examination into applications of CBM progress monitoring research can continue in multiple areas and contexts, including teacher implementation. Proficiency in early mathematics is a foundation for future success during a child’s educational career. Developing effective measures that can accurately gauge student progress over time holds tremendous promise for students who may be struggling with mathematical concepts. The findings of this study provide teachers with information to assist in choosing the best measures to monitor the progress of their students. Providing teachers with a technically adequate measure from which they can make data-based decisions to determine student response to particular instructional interventions is a goal that has been promoted by researchers and professional organizations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1534508411414151">National Council of Teachers of Mathematics, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1534508411414151">National Mathematics Advisory Panel, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1534508411414151">National Research Council, 2001</xref>). Developing and validating assessments that serve to inform instructional practice thereby enhancing teacher decision making are of great importance to teachers, schools, and districts alike. As schools continue to implement comprehensive reform efforts like Response to Intervention (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.rti4success.org">www.rti4success.org</ext-link>), progress monitoring measures remain a critical element in determining success of core instruction and intervention efforts.</p>
