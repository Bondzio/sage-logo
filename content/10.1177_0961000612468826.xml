<p>This volume is a collection of articles which discuss the issue of the impact of digital collections. Introduced by Lorna Hughes, author of an earlier volume <italic>Digitising Collections: Strategic Issues for the Information Manager</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0961000612468826">Hughes, 2003</xref>), it is in three parts – Part 1 describing the digital transformation in libraries, museums and archives, Part 2 on understanding and measuring the use, impact and value of digital collections, and Part 3 on enhancing the future impact and value of digital collections.</p>
<p>It was only in the mid-1990s, as part of a programme of funding for research libraries, that the Higher Education Funding Committee for England (HEFCE) made funds available for the first time for the digitization of collections in university libraries. This was to ‘test the technology’ and was carried out by the Higher Education Digitisation Service at the University of Hertfordshire (HEDS). A number of collections in UK university libraries were selected for this digitization project, and I was fortunate to be able to oversee the digitization of one of these collections – the selective digitization of pamphlets on social policy and transport in the London School of Economics (LSE) Library (for details see <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www2.lse.ac.uk/library/collections/pamphlets/Home.aspx">http://www2.lse.ac.uk/library/collections/pamphlets/Home.aspx</ext-link>).</p>
<p>Over the last decade digitization has proceeded apace in UK libraries and museums, with JISC (Joint Information Systems Committee) funding projects on a large scale. For librarians and archivists who have learnt much ‘on the hoof’ there have been many discussions on what to digitize, and when to digitize. Institutions have put in place digitization strategies. There have been (unrealistic) expectations by academic staff that all library content can now be digitized. But at the centre of all this has been the funding issue – who will fund future programmes and how. This has determined more or less what we have digitized. These decisions have not been entirely in the hands of librarians, archivists and curators. Our role has been an advisory one.</p>
<p>In the present economic climate, future funding involves assessing the impact of what has already been digitized. Lorna Hughes introduces the volume by stressing that the case for increased funding will be dependent on visibility and impact of previous projects. Visibility includes the effective presentation and preservation of digital resources. Access is also important – open access will mean higher use, including by communities outside of the academic world. There has therefore to be a mechanism for assessing use both in terms of statistics for increased usage of collections, and evidence of how the use of collections has enhanced the nature of research. Potential users have to be surveyed in the identification of collections for digitization.</p>
<p>This is not entirely new – the projects which were selected for university libraries in the 1990s were selected on the grounds of their interest to the academic community, as well as preservation needs. The JISC bids for the 2006 projects were dependent on references and endorsements by academic staff – not just the enthusiasm of librarians and archivists, who could identify collections which it ‘would be good to digitize’. But what was not anticipated was the extent to which this material would be used by groups outside the university. Within a few years the LSE social policy pamphlets were getting large numbers of website hits way beyond the possible use by academic staff. However, we could not find out who these people were, probably school students but we did not know. In the case of the JSTOR 19th century pamphlets project a website (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.britishpamphlets.org.uk/">http://www.britishpamphlets.org.uk/</ext-link>) has been created with advice for academic researchers and school teachers on how its content can be used.</p>
<p>Part 1 of the book has three chapters on the extent of digitization in libraries, museums and archives. Andrew Prescott describes the digital library and how it has changed research. He points to the example of historical newspapers on the Internet and how this has opened up access for the convenience of those who would otherwise have trekked up to the British Library newspaper library at Colindale to read UK newspapers, and overseas newspapers for which a trip abroad would have been necessary. The automation of library catalogues had previously opened up library collections to a wider audience. This opened up print collections as in the British Library, with a massive increase in the use of its website. So he believes that the growth of electronic resources during the first decade of the 21st century has not meant the demise of the book. One million new titles are published every year. Nor has it led to the demise of the library as a traditional space, although in many cases the use of this space has changed to accommodate e-resources, and activities such as group study. Andrew uses the example of the National Library of Wales to show how resources divided geographically and split between different institutions can be brought together in a digitization programme, to present a whole picture such as the cultural history of Wales. Other themed projects, for instance on slavery, have united library collections by digitisation. The benefits of this for the researcher are enormous.</p>
<p>This vision of bringing together collections is also taken up by Claire Hudson in her chapter on digital museums. The vision in 1999 of a ‘Network of jewels’ for British museums was a bold idea. Unlike university libraries the audience for museums is mainly the general public who are going to find collections through search engines such as Google. Digitizing museum objects is inevitably more complex than printed publications but their visual impact is greater. Giving access to collections online enhances the reputation of museums such as the Victoria and Albert where 20% of catalogued items now have a digital image.</p>
<p>Lastly Gillian Oliver writes about the situation in archives where digitization has brought in a new type of user. Traditionally archives have been the preserve of the academic researcher and difficult to find. Digitization has introduced the public to primary source material such as the 1901 census, whose website crashed within days of its opening due to the number of hits. This has furthered the popularity of family history. Has access protected the originals? It seems that this is not always the case – as increasing awareness of their existence has actually created a demand to see the originals.</p>
<p>In Part 2 of the book Ben Showers writes on the strategic approach to the understanding and evaluation of impact. JISC has funded over 60 projects over the last 10 years, the latest on how to evaluate projects. Are the days of mass digitization are over? Do we have to move on? The ‘build it and they will come approach’ was probably never the reality – most projects have attempted to evaluate the potential use of material. However, methods for doing this now have to be more focused. The other problem he deals with is the fragmentation of projects, with institutions bidding for funds for their collections without taking into account the extent of other libraries holdings (and limits of their own). But this is being overcome with successful joint projects. In some cases, for example newspapers, the British Library was the sole provider of content, but for other types of material the content can be diverse and ownership shared between different institutions. Digitization has served to unite these collections. Also portals such as Connected Histories have linked different projects together allowing searching across newspapers, ephemera and archives such as the Old Bailey Online. This cross-searching has enhanced research allowing a different perspective.</p>
<p>What about methods of assessment? Apart from counting website visits methods of assessment include citations which is mainly for the academic world, or feedback forms as supplied for example by the National Library of Australia and the National Library of Wales. User surveys are increasingly important in the assessment of digitization and selection for future projects.</p>
<p>Simon Tanner in his chapter on ‘The value and impact of digitized resources for learning, teaching, research and enjoyment’ looks at the transformation of research by such projects as Early English Books Online (EEBO) and Eighteenth Century Collections Online (ECCO). He also looks at other forms of social impact of digitization such as improving skills, aiding recovery and connecting individuals who for reasons of illness, old age or disability are socially isolated. However, measurement of these is mainly based on narrative.</p>
<p>Part 3 of the book is about enhancing the future impact and value of digital collections. Lorna Hughes writes about centralized support for arts and humanities digital scholarship in the UK and the role of organizations such as the Arts and Humanities Research Council (AHRC). This has helped to change the objectives of research in these subject areas. David Robey’s chapter is about the research projects which have been funded by AHRC. He also introduces a discussion on the sustainability of these projects. He concludes with some suggestions as to how better sustainability and quality could be achieved in the future. This would include peer review evaluation.</p>
<p>In conclusion, assessing the impact of digitization is more complex than originally envisaged. That is in part because its impact has extended beyond the academic world, and can be seen as a problem of success. This book is important for all those involved in digitization programmes. Its main strength is that it covers libraries, archives and museums to give an overall perspective.</p>
