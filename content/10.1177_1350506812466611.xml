<abstract>
<p>The article analyses the process of transformation and reinvention of patriarchal gender order at times of radical changes caused by violent conflict and life in emigration. The case study draws a comparison between younger and older generations of Chechen women in Austria, Poland and Germany and their radically different gender practices. The analysis shows that the turn towards more conservative gender relations, which can be observed among the younger generation, cannot be explained by a reference to the Chechen culture as inherently patriarchal. Nor can it be ascribed solely to the insufficient reception and the lack of recognition experienced by refugees in the receiving countries. Rather, it is an outcome of women’s different conditions of socialization that have affected their hierarchy of values and continue to exert significant influence on their adaptation strategies in exile; most notably, on how the women perceive and make use of the opportunity structures in the receiving contexts.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Much has been written about the dangers of revival of traditional patriarchal practices among migrant, especially Muslim, populations in Europe (for a critical analysis, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1350506812466611">Lutz, 1997</xref>). This article aims to provide a more nuanced account of the process of transformation and reinvention of patriarchal gender order at times of radical changes caused by violent conflict, displacement and life in a transnational space. It does so by explaining intergenerational differences in gender practices of Chechen refugee women in Austria, Germany and Poland. In all three countries, a similar trend can be observed. The older generation women in their late forties to early sixties often become the main breadwinners. They also act as mediators between their families or even their community and the institutions of the receiving societies. In this way, they are undermining patriarchal gender norms that define women’s and men’s roles in Chechen society. In contrast, young women in their teens often decide on an early marriage and an early start of family life. This typically leads to dropping out of education and decreases their prospects of future employment. Thus, they are adopting significantly more conservative gender practices than the older generation women. This trend goes against a common expectation that younger migrants tend to be more flexible and adaptable than their parents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1350506812466611">Suárez-Orozco and Qin, 2006</xref>). It also indicates that widened opportunities for education and employment in the destination countries do not necessarily lead to migrant women’s empowerment and greater independence. In this article, young women’s choices are understood not as a return to some previously existing traditions but rather as an invention of new patterns of behaviour in the post-conflict and transnational contexts.</p>
<p>It has been well documented in the literature that life in a transnational space provides new constraints as well as opportunities for ‘doing gender’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1350506812466611">Al-Ali, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1350506812466611">Fouron and Glick Schiller, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1350506812466611">Gammage, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1350506812466611">Mahler and Pessar, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1350506812466611">Pessar and Mahler, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1350506812466611">West and Zimmerman, 1987</xref>). In this article, I contribute to the existing scholarship on gender and transnationalism in two ways. First, I explore the importance of intergenerational differences in how gender identities are being reconstituted in the aftermath of forced migration. While there are numerous studies of gendered impacts of transnational migration on migrants of different age groups, studies comparing simultaneous experiences of different generational cohorts are relatively rare (for an exception, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1350506812466611">Fouron and Glick Schiller, 2001</xref>). Second, in order to explain these intergenerational differences, I adopt a transnational perspective that takes the long-term view. I show that the conditions in which the two generations of Chechen women were socialized back home continue to shape their gendered practices in exile.</p>
<p>The article proceeds as follows: I first outline the driving forces of Chechen migration to Europe and briefly describe specific conditions in the three countries. The next section introduces the case study and backgrounds of the research participants. I then discuss possible explanations of gender practices in immigrant communities and propose the long-term transnational perspective. The following two sections explain intergenerational differences in gender practices by examining the relationship between the conditions of women’s socialization in Chechnya and their perception and use of the opportunity structures in the receiving countries.</p>

<title>Chechen migration to Europe</title>
<p>Chechen migration to Europe is an ongoing process. The small North Caucasian republic of the Russian Federation has experienced two brutal wars with Russia that caused massive devastation of civilian lives, infrastructure and environment and led to a large-scale displacement of the population. The first war (1994–1996) was a war for independence that followed the dissolution of the Soviet Union. It was ended by a peace agreement in 1996 that left Chechnya’s future status open to further negotiations (for an authoritative account of the first war, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1350506812466611">Gall and De Waal, 1998</xref>). It has prompted large emigration from Chechnya to other parts of the Russian Federation but less so refugee movements to Central or Western Europe. The war was followed by a brief period of de facto independence. Reconstruction efforts on the part of the state were minimal, insecurity and lawlessness flourished and so did religious radicalization of some elements of the population and with it the divisions in the Chechen society (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1350506812466611">Sakwa, 2005</xref>). The second war (1999–unclear), was reframed as a counter-terrorist operation by the Russian government and it differed in many respects from the first conflict. It is argued that it claimed fewer lives but employed yet more brutal methods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1350506812466611">Cherkasov and Grushkin, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1350506812466611">Gilligan, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1350506812466611">Politkovskaya et al., 2003</xref>). Despite being proclaimed over in 2002, this war lacks a clear end and a resolution of the conflict. From mid-2000, Moscow applied a strategy of ‘Chechenization’ of the conflict. Hand-picked pro-Russian Chechens were handed down the task of conducting the ‘anti-terrorist’ campaign while being given control over their share of the illicit economy and impunity that flourishes in Chechnya (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1350506812466611">Russell, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>Although the wide-scale armed conflict has ended and massive reconstruction efforts have been undertaken, human rights violations continue to take place in Chechnya (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1350506812466611">Human Rights Watch, 2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1350506812466611">2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1350506812466611">Memorial, 2010</xref>). Economic deprivation of large parts of the population persists and the society’s institutions are mired in corruption and nepotism. Residents of Chechnya continue to have reasons to leave their country, many having lost faith in a better future. In 2003 and 2004, Russian citizens, most of them coming from Chechnya, constituted the largest group of asylum-seekers in Europe (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1350506812466611">UNHCR, 2007</xref>). Russia remains among the top three source countries of asylum-seekers in the European Union (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1350506812466611">UNHCR, 2011</xref>). Austria, Germany and Poland have been among the main receiving countries for Chechens in Europe alongside France and Belgium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1350506812466611">Schahbasi, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>The conditions for Chechen asylum-seekers in Europe have changed dramatically over the past decade. Various developments in asylum policies of individual countries as well as at the level of the European Union have made access to the asylum procedure, let alone to the refugee status, more difficult for Chechens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1350506812466611">ECRE, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1350506812466611">Gesellschaft für bedrohte Völker, 2011</xref>). Instances of detention and forcible deportation have become widespread all over the European Union (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1350506812466611">Schuster, 2011</xref>). The increasingly difficult conditions of Chechen refugees in Europe have strengthened the importance of transnational support networks. Given the typically large size of Chechen families, most have relatives back home and/or in other European countries. Maintaining these transnational kinship networks has become an inseparable part of refugees’ daily lives. Without the help of family members many would not be able to leave Chechnya in the first place, to reach their preferred destination or to survive at the margins of the European Union.</p>
<p>The situation of Chechen refugees in Austria, Germany and Poland differs significantly. Austria has the largest and most concentrated Chechen community in Europe. It hosts around 20,000 refugees from the Russian Federation; most of them are thought to be Chechens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1350506812466611">UNHCR, 2011</xref>). Poland also has a sizeable Chechen community among its 14,000 refugees from Russia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1350506812466611">UNHCR, 2011</xref>). Ethnic origins of Russian citizens residing as refugees in Germany are more diverse than in Austria and Poland. It is therefore more difficult to assess how many Chechens are among its almost 40,000 strong refugee population from the Russian Federation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1350506812466611">UNHCR, 2011</xref>). The estimates of NGO representatives indicate that it is around 10,000. The chances of being recognized as a refugee and standards of living are significantly higher in both Austria and in Germany than in Poland. With the implementation of the Dublin II Regulation that identifies the country responsible for examining asylum claims and enables transfer of asylum-seekers to this country, it has been increasingly difficult for Chechens to reach their desired destinations in Europe. Many have become stuck in Poland where there is insufficient institutional and material support for asylum-seekers and recognized refugees. Despite differences in the size and concentration of Chechen communities on the one hand and in levels of institutional support on the other, the intergenerational differences in Chechen women’s gender practices show remarkable similarities in all the three countries.</p>

<sec id="section3-1350506812466611">
<title>The study: Chechen women in Austria, Germany and Poland</title>
<p>The study is based on biographical interviews with 35 Chechen women living in Austria, Germany and Poland. The larger part of the data was collected in 2010. A second wave of interviews with some of the original interview partners was carried out about a year and a half later in 2011 in order to capture some of the ongoing changes and developments in the women’s lives. Interviewees were recruited by using a snowball method. I started off from my personal contacts obtained during previous research among refugees in the Czech Republic. This proved to be a successful strategy thanks to Chechen refugees’ transnational family networks. Moreover, once introduced by a person respected in the community, it was usually not difficult to recruit further interviewees. My other points of access were non-governmental organizations (NGOs) assisting Chechens in the three countries, where I got further contacts to potential interview partners.</p>
<p>The selection of interview partners was guided by striving for the greatest possible diversity in terms of age, education, family status, region of origin in Chechnya and length of stay in Europe. The final group comprised of women aged between 18 and 59 at the time of the first interview. Their education levels ranged from an unfinished elementary school to a doctoral degree. Three-quarters of the interviewees either had a university degree or had completed some kind of vocational training following eight to 10 years of education. Slightly over half of the women were married with children. The rest were widows or separated from their husbands. Only two of the women were single. Eight out of 11 regions in Chechnya were represented as places of origin of the interviewees. Almost half of the women either came from or spent most of their life in the Groznensky region surrounding the capital. The length of stay in the country where they were interviewed ranged from a couple of months to 10 years. Over half of interviewees have been living in Europe for four to eight years. Most were already recognized as refugees or were granted other forms of protection or temporary resident status. The majority of interviews were conducted in the capitals. Chechens in Austria and Germany tend to concentrate in Vienna and Berlin. The situation in Poland is different. It is difficult for recognized refugees or people with subsidiary protection to find accommodation in Warsaw. Therefore, many remain living in areas where they had previously lived in accommodation centres. Five out of 12 interviews in Poland were therefore conducted in Łomża, a city in northeastern Poland with a sizeable Chechen population.</p>
<p>The interviews took place in women’s homes or cafes and lasted between one and six hours. They were held in Russian, which was and still is the language of education in Chechnya. All interviews were carried out without the use of interpreters. They were audio-recorded and fully transcribed. In addition, I draw on informal conversations with 11 more women who did not want to produce a biographical narrative or did not want to be recorded. Moreover, 15 semi-structured interviews were conducted with social workers, lawyers and academics working with Chechens in Vienna, Berlin and Warsaw (11 women and four men).</p>

<title>Explanations of gender practices in immigrant communities</title>
<p>The comparison of younger and older Chechen women’s adaptation strategies provides an interesting case for the study of transformation of gender relations in a transnational context for two main reasons. First, it refutes an interpretation of young women’s turn to stricter and less egalitarian gender roles as a sign that Chechen culture is inherently patriarchal and oppressive. The construction of migrant women as victims of their culture is commonly used to depict migrants as inherently different and less civilized in contrast to more liberal receiving societies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1350506812466611">Razack, 1995</xref>). However, as this case shows, although both generations of women are equally constrained by Chechen patriarchal norms,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1350506812466611">1</xref></sup> they adopt very different gender practices.</p>
<p>Second, women’s actions cannot be fully explained as a reaction to the conditions they face in the receiving contexts. This argument is often made by pro-migrant advocates who argue that rejection and marginalization experienced by migrants in host societies push them towards embracing more traditional values. Conditions in the receiving context play an important role in structuring refugee women’s adaptation strategies. However, relying solely on such an explanation risks overlooking the internal differences within the community and leaves little space for migrants’ agency. The shift towards more conservative gender practices among young Chechen women can be observed both in Austria that offers advanced services for refugees and relatively high standards of living and in Poland where social support is limited and the fall into poverty is often imminent.</p>
<p>Therefore, I suggest that a transnational perspective that takes the long-term view is a more promising way to go. It recognizes that migrants’ ongoing social ties to their country of origin play a role in the adaptation process. Moreover, their pre-migration experiences serve as important reference points for devising strategies of adaptation in the new environment. In the following two sections, I will explain intergenerational differences in women’s gender practices by examining the relationship between the conditions of women’s socialization in Chechnya and the way they perceive and make use of the opportunity structures in the receiving countries.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1350506812466611">
<title>The relevance of pre-migration experiences: Soviet versus War generation</title>
<p>The same historical events are experienced differently by people in different life-stages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1350506812466611">Kertzer, 1983</xref>). In this study, women’s birth dates are used as approximate indicators of points in the life-course when they lived through the wars and displacement. The women are divided into two generational cohorts based on different historical periods which are considered of key importance for understanding their adaptation strategies. What unites the women born between 1950 and 1965 is that they had an opportunity to obtain their education and employment experience during the relatively peaceful period in the history of Soviet Checheno-Ingushetia.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1350506812466611">2</xref></sup> They will therefore be called the Soviet generation. In contrast, women born between 1982 and 1992 had their educational experience repeatedly interrupted and have spent more time living in war conditions, on the run and in emigration than in peaceful Chechnya. They will be referred to as the War generation.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-1350506812466611">3</xref></sup></p>
<sec id="section6-1350506812466611">
<title>Soviet generation: Living in a ‘golden era’</title>
<p>The pre-war lives of the Soviet generation women were framed by two crucial factors: Soviet modernization policies that legitimized the women’s place in the public sphere and social structures of Chechen patriarchal society. Two aspects of their socialization appear to have most significance for their adaptation in exile: first, the importance of education, which was seen as a way towards social mobility and professional success, and second, the ability to navigate between Soviet and Chechen social orders with their different gender expectations.</p>
<p>The Soviet generation women lived a larger part of their lives under the rule of Leonid Brezhnev (1964–1982). This period is commonly described as that of political and economic stagnation. In the context of the recent Chechen history, it marked the period of peace and stability that was fondly remembered by the interviewees; some even called it a ‘golden era’. It followed the traumatic experience of the deportation to Kazakhstan, Kirgizstan and Siberia (1944–1957) organized by Stalin, in which over 30% of the population perished (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1350506812466611">Pohl, 2000</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1350506812466611">2002</xref>), and preceded the time of political and economic instability, war, destruction and brutal authoritarianism (1991–today). The stability and predictability of the Brezhnev times constitute the backbone of Chechen women’s experience of normality. Fatima, now in her late forties, described the climate in which she was brought up as follows:
<disp-quote>
<p>It was a stable time and our parents, after all they had lived through, they, for the first time, calmed down a bit. And their peace of mind was passed on to us. There was confidence in the future: we will go to school, tomorrow we’ll go to the university and then we’ll search for work. That is why we see this time as such a happy period today.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The importance of education instilled in these women affected their marriage choices. Many stressed that their parents did not allow them to marry before the completion of their higher education and that it was normal for women to get married in their early to mid-twenties rather than earlier. The experience of upward social mobility is evident from these women’s biographies. Many university graduates with professional careers had virtually illiterate mothers.</p>
<p>In Chechnya, as in other Soviet Muslim societies, the traditional social structures have been transformed but not necessarily weakened by the Soviet measures for the protection and emancipation of women. As demonstrated by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1350506812466611">Kandiyoti (2008)</xref>, such policies existed next to economic, nationality, demographic and anti-religious policies that stimulated rather than undermined traditionalism. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1350506812466611">Kandiyoti (2008)</xref> calls this the ‘Soviet paradox’. It resulted in relatively high rates of literacy and labour force participation among women that nonetheless coincided with high fertility and the persistence of traditional gender division of labour in households (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1350506812466611">Kandiyoti, 2008</xref>: 607). For example, until the late 1980s, Checheno-Ingushetia had one of the highest birth rates in the Soviet Union (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1350506812466611">Derluguian, 2005</xref>: 244–245).</p>
<p>For the Soviet generation, living the ‘Soviet paradox’ involved mediating between two radically different social and gender orders. Women studied and worked in ethnically and gender-mixed environments.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-1350506812466611">4</xref></sup> They felt confident in the predominantly Russian environment of the city of Grozny with its modern social and cultural facilities. They were fluent in Russian and knowledgeable about Russian culture, literature in particular. In their homes, they internalized their traditions, religion and a set of virtues that all define what it means to be a Chechen (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1350506812466611">Raubisko, 2011</xref>). It was obvious to them from an early age that it is very different from being a Russian. Some women talked about the Russian and the Chechen social systems as if they were parallel social structures. As Fatima explained:
<disp-quote>
<p>There existed some kind of a parallel system. Not only for the Chechens and Ingushes who have always lived according to their own inner laws and norms, but I think it was the case for all people from the Caucasus. Whenever you left the Republic and met other Caucasians, at some level, you always found you had a lot in common.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Larisa, a woman in her early fifties, described how some of the expressions of the Soviet power were perceived by her and her relatives:
<disp-quote>
<p>And these communist rituals, we considered them somewhat artificial, we lived our own life, the real life, which was determined by our traditions and culture, the way we were brought up in our homes.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The persistence of the Chechen cultural practices is illustrated by the fact that, according to Soviet estimates of 1970, about 90% of the Chechens married according to Muslim rituals, 99% of the dead were given religious funerals and 98% circumcized their sons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1350506812466611">Ro’i, 2000</xref>: 81–82).</p>
<p>However, the situation of women was not without tensions. Many faced conflicts when, for example, particular interpretations of traditional societal norms prevented them from fulfilling their aspirations. For example, six of my interview partners became victims of non-consensual bride-kidnapping and were effectively forced into marriage. Girls faced more limitations in choosing the place and subject of their studies than their brothers. Notwithstanding the Soviet and today’s Russian law, women in Chechnya have remained effectively excluded from the inheritance of land. They are expected to marry and their well-being becomes the responsibility of their husband’s family. They are more likely than men to suffer the social stigma of being a divorcee and can be separated from their children if they remarry.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-1350506812466611">5</xref></sup></p>
<p>Nonetheless, most women of the Soviet generation seem to have been able to navigate between the Soviet and the Chechen social systems. They were making strategic uses of opportunities provided by the former while relying on support structures of the latter. It could be said that they became Russified without ceasing to be Chechen. This experience has proved crucial in the emigration. Here again, the success of their settlement and their engagement in transnational social networks largely depend on their ability to navigate between different expectations of the societies they inhabit.</p>

<title>War generation: Survival and the importance of the family</title>
<p>For the War generation, war, disruption and displacement were the main forces in their socialization that have influenced their system of values and continue to shape their adaptation to the new environments. As opposed to the Soviet generation, they could not refer to other, peaceful times when trying to make sense of the shattered world around them. Madina, now 22, was 14 when she arrived in Poland with her parents and five siblings. When asked what she remembers from home, she replied:
<disp-quote>
<p>War, nothing else, war, bodies, bombs, explosions, everywhere.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>She was four when the first war started and seven when the second war began. She got married at the age of 18 and already has one child.</p> <p>War experiences have made young people aware of the fragility of social institutions. School attendance in Chechnya was often interrupted when parents feared sending their children out of home due to bombing or the so called mop-up operations carried out by the Russian army against the civilian population. In the early 2000s, schools lacked both basic equipment and qualified teaching personnel. Survival and basic safety became more pressing than education.</p>
<p>Since the mid-1990s there has been a revival of Islam in Chechnya. For the insurgents, religion was a new means of mobilization and a source of justification for their struggle. For the civilian population, who experienced tremendous losses, including that of control over their own life, turning to God was often seen as the only way to cope with events that surpassed the limits of logic (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1350506812466611">Tishkov, 2004</xref>). Conditions of prolonged instability produce a tendency to cling to institutions that are most resilient at times of crisis. Together with faith, the extended family was a crucial source of support during the wars (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1350506812466611">Sokirianskaia, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1350506812466611">Tishkov, 2004</xref>). It was and still is vitally important for both women and men, younger and older, to remain embedded in their extended family networks. Patriarchal family norms are closely linked to the importance of the preservation of the ethnic group. It figures prominently in the dominant discourse of the Chechen nation being under threat due to its centuries-long struggle against assimilation and annihilation by the Russian colonizer and aggressor. It is therefore not surprising that establishing a family and being a bearer of the biological reproduction of the nation carry a high moral value also in the migratory context.</p>
<p>The young women opt for a strong identification with Islam and family life because they do not have other resources to draw on. It is this identification that provides them with a source of stability and recognition. As opposed to the Soviet generation, who managed to combine the benefits of Chechen traditional social structures with the opportunities offered by the Soviet system, the War generation is less able to navigate between different gender orders.</p>

<title>Differential perception of opportunity structures in the receiving contexts and its gender consequences</title>
<p>Different conditions of socialization of the two generations of Chechen women directly influence the way they see and make use of the opportunity structures in the receiving societies. The quality and availability of educational and employment opportunities in the countries of asylum also affect their adaptation strategies, but they are not their sole determinants. Gender practices, particularly the position in the family, reflect women’s hierarchies of values and strategic choices they make to fulfil these values.</p>
<sec id="section9-1350506812466611">
<title>Soviet generation: Gender order unsettled</title>
<p>The Soviet generation women tend to see chances for further education and employment in the receiving contexts in terms of immediate opportunities to secure the well-being of their families. Those who already had employment experiences from home were more likely to take up jobs as soon as possible. Many have become the main breadwinners in their families. This has required careful balancing between the expectations of their families and the community and the demands of everyday life in exile.</p>
<p>Already during the wars, women played a crucial role in securing their families’ survival when their husbands joined the fighters, were killed, injured, detained, on the run or were simply afraid to leave their homes<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-1350506812466611">6</xref></sup> (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1350506812466611">Politkovskaya et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1350506812466611">Procházková, 2003</xref>). In exile, many have to fend for themselves and their children. However, even married women with husbands often act as the main breadwinners. The older men who used to have professional careers back in Chechnya find it difficult to cope with the fall in their social status and to accept menial types of jobs. Even if they are willing to do so, their health often does not allow them to perform hard physical labour typically available to migrant men with limited language skills. This often leads to tensions. On the one hand, women gain more space to renegotiate their roles in the domestic sphere. In the transnational context, their position as breadwinners also gives them more leeway in deciding about the financial support that will be sent to the relatives back home and thus potentially also affects their social standing back home. On the other hand, many Chechen men find it difficult to reconcile with their new position and to discover new sources of self-esteem (for accounts of similar dynamics in refugee families, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1350506812466611">Al-Ali, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1350506812466611">Kibria, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1350506812466611">Ong, 2003</xref>). This is how Satsyta, a woman in her early fifties, described her husband’s way of coping with being economically dependent on her:
<disp-quote>
<p>He locked himself away from us [herself and their 11-year-old son]. He built some kind of a shell around himself; he sits in front of his computer all day. He doesn’t prevent me from doing what I do but he doesn’t support me either. It gets very hard like this.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>At the same time, the older women often act as mediators between their families and the state and non-governmental institutions in the receiving countries. Many Chechen men consider it undignified to go and ask for help from these institutions and thus acknowledge their own position of weakness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1350506812466611">Szczepanikova, 2010</xref>). Women’s greater institutional exposure increases their contacts with the majority society and they tend to learn the language more quickly. Many also play an active role in their social networks, helping their compatriots, including those back in Chechnya and in other European countries. This brings them a sense of purpose and respect in the community.</p>
<p>Their experiences have prompted reconsideration of the Chechen patriarchal gender order but have not necessarily resulted in its rejection. The women of the Soviet generation are clearly aware of women’s potential to cope in difficult situations and of increased opportunities for women’s advancement in Europe. At the same time, they are also critical of some aspects of the western-liberal gender norms which they associate with too much individualism and egoism on the part of women. In their interpretation, Islam and the Chechen customary law renders women and men unequal in some respects, but this inequality is legitimized by differences in obligations and responsibilities. As Fatima put it:
<disp-quote>
<p>A man is the head but a woman is the neck. If everything goes right, they are in harmony; there is a balance of power and a division of labour.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>However, maintaining this balance of power often requires an extra effort on the part of the women. I was told a number of times that ‘a wise woman needs a strong man’. Indeed, many women in exile are trying hard to prevent their unemployed husbands from feeling powerless and useless. For the time being, the women are not willing to openly challenge the Chechen patriarchal gender order due to the lack of more promising alternatives. However, the fact that it increasingly depends on their active support makes it more susceptible to gradual transformation.</p>

<sec id="section10-1350506812466611">
<title>War generation: Reversal to the more conservative gender order</title>
<p>In contrast to the Soviet generation women, the choices of the War generation women signal a reversal to more conservative visions of gender relations. On the one hand, they have widened opportunities for education in the receiving contexts. On the other hand, accessing these opportunities requires a lot of extra effort. The women are disadvantaged by insufficient language skills and by gaps in their previous education which took place in the war conditions. This undermines their confidence and motivation to continue with their studies. Those who arrive already beyond the age of legally compulsory schooling need even more determination and self-discipline to pursue further education which is not always freely accessible (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1350506812466611">Vasilyev, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>Younger women’s investment in education offers remote rather than immediate rewards in the sense of better employment prospects in the future. In contrast, early marriage<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-1350506812466611">7</xref></sup> promises more immediate rewards in the sense of material security and recognition in their community which attaches high moral value to having a family. Compared to the older Chechen men, their prospective husbands are better positioned to succeed in the labour market thanks to better language skills and the capacity to perform hard physical labour. They typically work at construction sites or as security guards. Thus, they are often able to provide for their families. Although there are some instances of Chechen women being forced into marriage, the majority of these early marriages are concluded out of free will; sometimes even against the will of the girls’ parents. Early start of a family life leads to women dropping out of school. The imperative to have more children increases the time in which they cannot work on improving their language skills and pursue further education.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-1350506812466611">8</xref></sup></p>
<p>Another reason why many young women get married early is to escape the excessive control of their families (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1350506812466611">Suárez-Orozco and Qin, 2006</xref>). In the migratory context, parents experience a loss of control over their children’s environment. They lack the support of the neighbourhood and extended family on which they could rely back in Chechnya. They fear the influence of sexualized imagery of the European youth culture on their daughters. This fear often leads to restrictions on their behaviour. In contrast to young Chechen men, who can often be seen hanging out in groups in public spaces and who often excel in sport activities, the young girls’ daily routine is more monotonous: they go to school or attend integration courses, come home, do their homework, help around the household or take care of their younger siblings. Traditional occasions to socialize with peers (both female and male) such as weddings and other family celebrations or religious festivities are limited. Thus, by establishing their own families, they hope to gain more bargaining power for themselves.</p>
<p>The already mentioned revival of Islam in Chechnya has had a particularly strong impact on the younger generation. Many of the young Chechen women in Europe espouse purist, Salafist Islam (sometimes pejoratively labelled as Wahhabism). They demonstrate this by wearing headscarves fully covering their hair and neck and loose dresses. Religion for them is associated with a set of strict rules and has led some to see the withdrawal to the domestic sphere as their religious duty. Such practices are often met with disapproval by the older Chechen women. They argue that this kind of attire has never been part of Chechen traditions and that it is something imported and alien and therefore not appropriate for Chechen women. In contrast to the Soviet generation, who mostly obtained religious education as part of their socialization in the family and for whom religious rules are inextricably linked to Chechen traditions, the War generation women often draw on the Internet and other external sources to find their own way to Islam. Iman, a woman in her early twenties now living in Vienna, appreciated the possibility to express her religiousness through her dress as an example of new freedoms which she acquired after fleeing to Austria. In Chechnya, she experienced harassment from the authorities after she decided to swap her symbolic headband for the headscarf that fully covered her hair and neck. Her appearance was considered a sign of Wahhabism which created a dangerous association with insurgency. At the same time, she seems to accept that in Austria, her outfit can make it difficult for her to succeed in finding paid employment in many sectors of the labour market. She pointed out, matter-of-factly:
<disp-quote>
<p>People here don’t like women in headscarves.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Young women’s socialization in the war-torn Chechnya has shaped their hierarchy of values and continues to impact their adaptation strategies in European exile. Due to the lack of resources on which they can draw, they tend to privilege the value of family and religion over education and professional career. This has made them appreciate the immediate rewards connected with marriage rather than remote prospects of social mobility associated with an investment in education. Such a strategy is reinforced but not entirely determined by the difficulties the young women face when accessing education and employment in the receiving societies.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>In this article, I have adopted the long-term transnational perspective to explain the intergenerational differences in gender practices among Chechen refugee women in Austria, Poland and Germany. I have argued that radically different conditions of socialization that have affected women’s hierarchy of values continue to exert significant influence on their adaptation strategies in exile.</p>
<p>Rather than making use of widened possibilities of education and employment as the older generation of Chechen women does, the younger women tend to marry in their teens and withdraw into the domestic sphere for extended periods of time. This seriously affects their future education and employment prospects and increases their dependency on patriarchal family structures of Chechen society. I have shown that the young women are making strategic choices in the context of multiple constraints rather than falling prey to some inherent tendency towards traditional patriarchy typical for Chechens. The relative success in adaptation of the Soviet generation women contradicts such a simplifying explanation. Also, their actions cannot be fully explained by the lack of reception and recognition in the receiving contexts. Although more substantial institutional support could help to promote young women’s further education and employment, the comparison of the three receiving countries shows that the shift towards more conservative gender roles is present both in Poland and in Austria, which are countries with very different levels of refugee support.</p>
<p>What does this case study tell us about the nature of patriarchal gender order and its capacity for transformation and reinvention? Despite dramatic social changes experienced during the past decades, Chechens remain a traditional patriarchal society. However, it is not a static and immutable social system. As this study has shown, it can accommodate rather diverse gender practices. It is also a system that is constantly being negotiated. There is an ongoing debate among Chechen women about what is appropriate for a Chechen woman – whether it is an investment in education and professional career or a pursuit of religious modesty and domesticity, and how the two roles can possibly be combined. Older women’s empowerment and their capacity to succeed in fulfilling roles that are traditionally considered to be masculine have opened space for further renegotiation of the gender order. Nonetheless, this opportunity has so far not been taken up by the younger generation women, who lack resources in terms of education and the ability to navigate between different social systems.</p>

<p>Patriarchal norms that regulate women’s and men’s position in Chechen society are not immutable and have undergone some level of transformation especially under the influence of the Soviet regime and the recent armed conflicts. However, basic rules assigning men and women different roles in the family, household and in the public sphere have remained relatively persistent. Besides, gender intersects with age in important ways. As in other classical patriarchies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1350506812466611">Kandiyoti, 1988</xref>), Chechen women’s status grows with their age and the number of children (especially sons) they have.</p></fn>

<p>Checheno-Ingushetia, formally called the Chechen–Ingush Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic, ceased to exist after the National Congress of the Chechen People declared independence both from the Soviet Union and from Russia in 1991.

<p>In between these two cohorts are the women born between the late 1960s and early 1980s. In contrast to the War and Soviet generations, who are remarkable in sharing a lot of common features, this group of women is more diverse. Many managed to obtain education before the war but their employment experiences were often short and sketchy if any. The formative period of their lives was that of change and transition: the time of <italic>perestroika</italic> and independent Chechnya.</p></fn>

<p>There are no available statistical data to document the occurrence of early marriages among Chechens in Europe. These marriages are often concluded in a religious ceremony and not officially registered with the state authorities. I draw on the observations of my interview partners, most of whom mentioned the issue and gave examples of early marriages in their social surrounding. Also NGO social workers in all three countries described early marriages as an increasing trend among Chechen youth.</p></fn>

<p>In Chechnya, it is easier for young mothers to leave their children with relatives and continue in education or carry on working. In exile, their mothers and mothers-in-law often work or live far away and other relatives are not readily available to help out with childcare.</p></fn>
