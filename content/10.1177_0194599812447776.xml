<body>
<p>Tonsillectomy is a common surgical procedure, with the majority of patients undergoing this procedure being young and otherwise healthy. Nevertheless, most patients suffer from postoperative morbidity that includes pain, nausea, and vomiting, with recovery to normal function taking up to 2 weeks following surgery. It is commonplace for patients to need time off school or work and to require analgesic medications. Posttonsillectomy morbidities are likely to be interrelated. Pain can decrease oral intake, and conversely, decreased oral intake may cause stasis of slough and tendency to secondary infection. The frequency and relative severity of postoperative morbidity give us cause to analyze which tonsillectomy regimes are capable of reducing morbidity without increasing side effects or rate of posttonsillectomy hemorrhage.</p>
<p>Steroids have a beneficial effect on nausea, vomiting, and postoperative swelling; they also increase appetite. Such effects are potentially beneficial to all aspects of morbidity in posttonsillectomy patients. Intraoperative dexamethasone is already commonly given during surgery, and several meta-analyses show some postoperative benefit.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0194599812447776">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0194599812447776">2</xref></sup> Oral steroids such as prednisolone are more easily administered and can be given as a postoperative course. Current research into the effect of a postoperative course of oral steroids is limited, and study sizes have been small.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0194599812447776">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>We designed a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial to evaluate the effect of a postoperative 5-day course of oral prednisolone on postoperative morbidity and time to return to normal function in children.</p>
<sec id="section7-0194599812447776" sec-type="methods">
<title>Methods</title>
<p>The study was designed to be a randomized, placebo-controlled, participant-blinded, researcher-blinded study comparing the effect of oral prednisolone with placebo given for 5 days after tonsillectomy. Ethics approval was obtained from the lower regional south ethics committee (reference LRS 06/08/024). Participants were children aged 3 to 16 years undergoing tonsillectomy for either sleep-disordered breathing or recurrent tonsillitis. Patients who had diabetes, severe asthma, or asthma requiring steroid therapy in the previous month or coagulation abnormalities were excluded. All participants had their preoperative anesthetic risk category assessed using the American Society of Anesthesiologists Score (ASA) and were category 1 or 2. Where other procedures were done in conjunction with tonsillectomy, in all cases, the tonsillectomy was the procedure most likely to be associated with the most postoperative morbidity, particularly pain.</p>
<p>Recruitment was undertaken by a research nurse in one center, and the surgery was performed at 2 hospitals within this city. Children and their caregivers were approached and invited to participate. Full informed consent was obtained and a record kept of those who were ineligible to participate or who declined participation.</p>
<p>Participants were then randomly assigned to receive a postoperative course of either prednisolone syrup (0.5 mg/kg up to a maximum of 20 mg/d) or matched placebo syrup, administered by the caregiver as a single daily dose over 5 days. Clinicians adhered to a standardized surgical technique whereby tonsil dissection was performed either with cold instrumentation or bipolar diathermy dissection technique; ligatures were applied at the lower tonsillar pole prior to tonsil removal. Bipolar diathermy was used for final hemostasis. An anesthetic guideline was agreed on and used during the study. This involved anesthetic induction either by an inhalational agent or with propofol. Paracetamol and a single dose of a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug were administered intraoperatively along with a single dose of dexamethasone (0.1 mg/kg). Opiates (morphine or fentanyl) could be used preoperatively and during early recovery and either ondansetron or droperidol for control of nausea and vomiting postoperatively. The postoperative care was either day stay, with a 6-hour postoperative observation, or an overnight stay in the hospital.</p>
<p>The children were discharged with simple oral analgesics (paracetamol, codeine, and ibuprofen if required) and an oral antibiotic course. An information sheet that described postoperative care was given at discharge.</p>
<p>The primary outcome was pain, which was recorded using a validated pain scale.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0194599812447776">4</xref></sup> The secondary outcomes were presence and severity of nausea and vomiting, return to eating a normal diet, return to normal daily activities such as school, time of going to sleep, and awakening from sleep during the night.</p>
<p>Following surgery, parents and patients completed a face pain scale (see appendix at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.otojournal.org">www.otojournal.org</ext-link>),<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0194599812447776">4</xref></sup> graded from 1 (no pain) to 6 (most pain). There were questions on nausea, vomiting, return to normal function, and sleep quality (see appendix). A final question asked about other symptoms or possible treatment effects during the recovery period. The questionnaire was completed twice on the day of surgery and then daily for 8 days postoperatively.</p>
<p>Our sample size was chosen after a power analysis indicated a desired sample size of 99 participants per arm to have an 80% power to detect a 10% point difference on the 6-point pain scale using a 2-sided 0.05 level of significance assuming a standard deviation of 1.25.</p>
<p>Randomization was performed with computer-allocated randomization, which allocated the first 200 participants to 1 of 2 groups (A and B), with 100 allocated to either group. Toward the end of the study, it became apparent that because of those who discontinued the intervention and those who were lost to follow-up, the sequence had to be increased to 225 in order that the 198 participants be recruited. This was done by generating a further set of numbers randomized in batches of 10, so as to minimize the likelihood of large differences in group size. The coding for active and placebo was held at Dunedin Hospital pharmacy and was not broken until after all data had been returned. There were no adverse events that required the code be broken for any individual patient.</p>
<p>The study was completed over a 1-year period from September 30, 2009, to September 30, 2010. The participants, their parents, the nurse researcher collecting data, and the surgeons performing the surgery were blinded to the randomized allocation of intervention or placebo.</p>
<p>Statistical analysis was performed using linear mixed models with a random subject effect to compare continuous outcomes between arms from day 1 onwards. Log transformations were used when this improved model residuals. Residual covariance structures were investigated (autoregressive and exponential) and included where this improved model fit according to the Akaike information criterion (AIC) statistic. For binary outcomes, logistic mixed models with a random subject effect were used to compare outcomes between arms from day 1 onwards. All analyses were performed using Stata 11.1 (StataCorp, College Station, Texas). All statistical tests were performed at the 2-sided 0.05 level of significance.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>We approached 287 families; 32 declined to participate (89% recruitment rate), a common reason being that the parents wanted their child to have a postoperative course of steroid. Twenty-three children did not met eligibility criteria (10 with asthma, 3 with other medical comorbidities, 6 outside the age range when surgery performed, 2 with medication allergies, 1 each with too many other simultaneous procedures, and 1 requiring further investigation). Seventeen children did not participate for other reasons (14 of the parents wanted coblation tonsillectomy, 3 had surgery postponed).</p>
<p>In total, 215 patients were recruited as summarized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0194599812447776"><bold>Figure 1</bold></xref>. Of these, 2 withdrew consent, 13 did not return a questionnaire, and 7 withdrew during the study, leaving 193 study patients.</p>

<p>The primary outcome was postoperative pain, and the faces pain scale scores are summarized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0194599812447776"><bold>Figure 2</bold></xref>. On each day, the 95% confidence intervals for each group’s pain score overlapped. There is no difference in the pain score between the 2 groups (<italic>P</italic> = .478). There was good control of nausea and vomiting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0194599812447776"><bold>Figure 3</bold></xref>) with no statistically significant difference between the groups (<italic>P</italic> = .556).

<p>Data on hemorrhage were collected, but the study was not powered to detect any difference between the study and the control groups. Twenty-four minor bleeds were noted in the questionnaire diary (12% steroid group, 12% placebo group; <italic>P</italic> = .866); this included bleeding from nasal surgery. Two patients were readmitted to the hospital for bleeding, 1 from each group, but did not require transfusion or surgery (Fisher’s exact test, <italic>P</italic> = 1.000). There were no adverse outcomes recorded that could be attributed to steroid use.</p>

<sec id="section9-0194599812447776" sec-type="discussion">
<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Several meta-analyses have confirmed that a single intraoperative dose of dexamethasone significantly reduces postoperative nausea and vomiting in tonsillectomy patients<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0194599812447776">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0194599812447776">2</xref></sup> and has an initial significant increase in oral intake. In 1 meta-analysis, pain was found to be significantly less on postoperative day 1.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0194599812447776">5</xref></sup> Czarnetzki et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0194599812447776">6</xref></sup> examined different dosages of intraoperative dexamethasone and showed an increased bleeding rate among their study groups such that they discontinued the study. However, there has been discussion about the design of this trial<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0194599812447776">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0194599812447776">8</xref></sup>; subsequently, 2 research groups with larger study populations who had identical steroid dosing intraoperatively published their lower rates of bleeding.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0194599812447776">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0194599812447776">9</xref></sup> As these rates were similar to previously reported standard rates of postoperative hemorrhage and lower than those found in the other study, they concluded that a single dose of intraoperative steroid does not have an effect on postoperative hemorrhage.</p>
<p>To date, the use of postoperative oral prednisolone has been studied only once in a randomized controlled trial. The end points for the 50 patients involved in this study were pain, nausea, and analgesic use following surgery. In this trial, those who received prednisolone had less analgesic use and less nausea. Statistical significance was achieved at 3 time points postoperatively: postoperative days 2, 7, and 8.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0194599812447776">3</xref></sup> However, there was no significant difference in the daily pain score for each group. The authors concluded that there was only a limited role for the use of prednisolone following tonsillectomy. In addition, other randomized trials have investigated the use of postoperative doses of dexamethasone. One study with 86 patients showed a tendency to reduction in postoperative pain on days 1 to 4 with lower pain scores but not reaching the clinically decided level of statistically significant improvement,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0194599812447776">10</xref></sup> whereas the other study comprising 30 patients showed a statistically significant reduction in visual analog scale pain scores on each of the first 9 days postoperatively, accompanied by a decreased consumption of analgesia on postoperative days 7 to 10.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0194599812447776">11</xref></sup></p>
<p>Our study shows that both steroid and placebo groups manage well after surgery with good pain control and little nausea and vomiting. There is no significant difference between the groups at any time point during the trial for each of the variables assessed. Of all those reported, the number of times the child awoke during the night was the least reliably recorded as it relied on the parents being aware that their child was awake or the child telling them how often they awoke during the night, the latter of which becomes increasingly unreliable the younger the participant.</p>
<p>The average age of the children in the steroid group was younger than that in the placebo group. This was a consequence of randomization and was not foreseen when designing the study; we had reasonably expected a similar age distribution. We have not applied a statistical analysis to the age difference because statistical testing of baseline differences is considered inappropriate.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0194599812447776">12</xref></sup> The medication dosages were prescribed according to weight, and a recognized pain rating scale was used. Consequently, we do not consider the age difference to have affected the outcomes.</p>
<p>No complications or adverse events occurred that were attributable to steroids. The possible side effects of behavioral and sleep change in the short term and rarer side effects of psychosis, avascular necrosis of the hip, and gastric complications also have to be considered when prescribing corticosteroids. The dosage regimen we used is similar to that used for managing exacerbations of childhood asthma. We found no adverse effect on sleep; behavioral and psychological sequelae, although not specifically enquired after, were not reported by parents.</p>
<p>There is no difference between the groups with regard to postoperative hemorrhage. This is the most serious complication of tonsillectomy, but we could not include it as a primary or secondary outcome as the population size required to have statistical power would have been much larger. Our study recorded any bleeding events using the questionnaire and follow-up phone calls, and most bleeding occurrences were related to nasal procedures performed at the same time as the tonsillectomy. There were only 2 readmissions for bleeding in the 193 study patients, and this is an acceptable rate of post-tonsillectomy hemorrhage.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0194599812447776">13</xref></sup></p>
<p>The strengths of this study are that it was double blind and designed to detect a relatively small reduction in postoperative pain between the 2 groups, as well as using an age-appropriate, validated tool for measuring postoperative pain. All patients were given the same standard postoperative analgesic regimen proportional to weight. Active monitoring of recruitment meant that at the end of the study period, we were only 5 participants short of our target.</p>
<p>We did not include other tonsillectomy dissection techniques such as monopolar diathermy and coblation methods; this may be considered a limitation, but we consider it a strength as our design minimized variation in surgical technique. We did not include objective measures of pain such as analgesic consumption for 2 reasons: First, we had decided that the clinical end point of pain was what we wished to assess, and second, our clinical catchment covered a 200- to 300-kilometer radius, which made it impracticable for the research nurse to collect used containers for weight measurement. We agreed on guidelines for anesthesia but were unable to predetermine a uniform technique; however, the methods employed by the different anesthetists conformed to our guidelines, which encompass what would be considered “usual” techniques for this type of surgery and reflect longstanding local practice. On balance, we believe that the limitations identified do not detract from our conclusions.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>We report a randomized, double-blind, controlled trial comparing a 5-day course of postoperative prednisolone with placebo that found no beneficial effect favoring 1 group over the other when considering postoperative morbidity and return to daily functions. Thus, although an intraoperative dose of steroid is known to improve postoperative nausea and vomiting, our study shows there is no benefit from extending this to a postoperative course.</p>
