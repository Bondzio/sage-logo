<p><italic>In Zeba Crook's article, “Memory and the Historical Jesus,” BTB 42:4, page 197, there is corrupted text, beginning four lines from the bottom of the right hand column and extending to the first line of the following page (198). The passage should read as follows:</italic></p>
<p>Worse, these particular “memories” in the gospels do not contain the primary characteristic of flashbulb memory: the retention of irrelevant or idiosyncratic details. There are of course some stories in the gospels that do contain irrelevant and idiosyncratic details. One commonly cited example is Mark 6:39, that the grass the hungry crowds sat on was green. And presumably the feeding of five thousand with a little bread and fish is the sort of event that would have surprised people! On the other hand, flashbulb memories are of events short in duration: does this story qualify? How long would it take for Jesus and twelve assistants to organize and feed five thousand people? Probably longer than memory theorists think flashbulb memory applies to. My point here is that though McIver does not make any unreasonable claims about flashbulb memory, it is unclear whether observations about flashbulb memory would ever be useful to the study of the historical Jesus.</p>
