<abstract>
<p>This article analyses Michael Burawoy’s vision of public sociology in light of five distinct ‘epistemic strategies’, each of which generates substantially different expectations regarding the challenges and opportunities facing public sociologists. The five epistemic strategies range along a spectrum from methodological individualism at one end to holism at the other. Between these two poles, considerations of the social relativity of scientific knowledge arise. Constructionist theories highlight the performative dilemma entailed when science reveals itself to be one narrative among others. Hierarchical theories such as Marxism suggest that public sociology is torn by the irreconcilable contradiction between hegemony and counter-hegemony. Heterarchical theories address both of these two problems together. Heterarchy suggests that science’s claim to universality may interfere with public sociology’s social-transformative aspirations. However, the dynamic complexity of ‘public’ social struggles generates opportunities to rethink the place of difference in the production of scientific knowledge.</p>

Much of this literature has focused on the merits of Burawoy’s proposal and the challenges of implementing it in differing contexts. Unsurprisingly, some authors oppose Burawoy’s vision altogether, defending the non-partisanship of professional sociology as necessary for the survival of the discipline and as a condition of possibility for its having any public relevance or political influence at all (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0896920511434217">Holmwood, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr82-0896920511434217">McLaughlin et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr117-0896920511434217">Turner, 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr118-0896920511434217">2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr119-0896920511434217">2009</xref>). On a more sympathetic but still critical note, some Canadian scholars (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0896920511434217">Creese et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0896920511434217">Davies, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0896920511434217">Goldberg and Van den Berg, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0896920511434217">Helmes-Hayes, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0896920511434217">Helmes-Hayes and McLaughlin, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-0896920511434217">Kowalchuk and McLaughlin, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr90-0896920511434217">Mesny, 2009</xref>) have pointed out the parochialism of Burawoy’s analysis of ‘sociology’, noting that Canadian sociologists have their own traditions of public engagement and that would-be public sociologists in Canada face strategic considerations different from those of their American counterparts. Criticisms from feminists (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0896920511434217">Creese et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0896920511434217">Glenn, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0896920511434217">Grauerholz and Baker-Sperry, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-0896920511434217">Lal, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr101-0896920511434217">Risman, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr104-0896920511434217">Rosenberg and Howard, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr112-0896920511434217">Sprague, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr113-0896920511434217">Sprague and Laube, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr114-0896920511434217">Stacey, 2008</xref>), the occasional Marxist (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr95-0896920511434217">Paolucci, 2008</xref>), and other critical sociologists (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0896920511434217">Hadas and Nichols, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0896920511434217">Keith, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr89-0896920511434217">Mello e Silva, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr115-0896920511434217">Touraine, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr125-0896920511434217">Yuan, 2008</xref>) raise more troubling issues still. These writers, speaking from projects that have long had a public dimension through their ambitions for transformative praxis, tend to dispute the validity of Burawoy’s classification of sociology into professional, policy, critical, and public, while suggesting that Burawoy’s notion of public sociology may have a conservative tendency that perpetuates, or fails to address, marginal subjects and neglects the lessons of past social movement struggles.</p>
<p>In this article I will use five different epistemological frameworks to examine the potential challenges that face public sociology as a form of praxis, that is, as a mode of intellectual production engaged with practical efforts at social transformation. If theory provides intellectual frameworks for establishing and evaluating factual claims and relating them to one another, epistemology provides frameworks for constructing, evaluating, and organizing theoretical claims. Sociologists commonly organize epistemological frameworks into two dichotomously opposed strategies, reductionism and holism,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0896920511434217">1</xref></sup> but it is possible to organize epistemological claims into a broad spectrum differentiable into at least five distinct categories or ‘epistemic strategies’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-0896920511434217">Kontopoulos, 1993</xref>: 75). Each of these strategies involves a qualitatively distinct conceptualization of social structure by attributing differing degrees of <italic>emergence</italic> to collective social phenomena. Shifting one’s thinking from one epistemic strategy to another does more than entail differing claims about a common set of observed phenomena; such a shift constitutes, in the observer’s perceptual field, new structures and relational dynamics which otherwise do not appear, or appear less importantly. By moving through all five epistemic strategies in comparatively short order, I will show how each of these strategies or frameworks maps differently the terrain of public sociology, and the differing challenges it faces as an intellectual and a sociopolitical strategy.</p>

<sec id="section2-0896920511434217">
<title>The Spectrum of Emergence</title>
<p>The term ‘emergence’ refers to the quality of the whole being greater than the sum of its parts, or ‘much coming from little’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0896920511434217">Holland, 1998</xref>: 2); more rigorously, it can refer to ‘the arising of novel and coherent structures, patterns, and properties during the process of self-organization in complex systems’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0896920511434217">Goldstein, 1999</xref>: 49). Questions about emergence have played an important part in sociology’s epistemological debates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr106-0896920511434217">Sawyer, 2001</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr107-0896920511434217">2005</xref>). Strong claims of emergence appear in statements like Durkheim’s famous dictum that we must treat social facts as things (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0896920511434217">Durkheim, 1982 [1895]</xref>: 60). Strong stances <italic>against</italic> emergence appear in the work of methodological individualists who, like Weber, insist that<disp-quote>
<p>When reference is made in a sociological context to a state, a nation, a corporation, a family, or an army corps, or to similar collectivities, what is meant is, on the contrary, only a certain kind of development of actual or possible social actions of individual persons. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr123-0896920511434217">Weber, 1978a [1922]</xref>: 13–14)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>For much of the 20th century, theoretical debate over social structure tended to polarize towards one of these two stances (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-0896920511434217">Kontopoulos, 1993</xref>: 75). However, in practice sociologists can take and have taken various positions along a continuum of emergentist claims of which individualism and holism are only the end-points. Kontopoulos divides this continuum into five broad types of position, which he calls <italic>epistemic strategies</italic>. Since nearly all sociologists, even methodological individualists, conceptualize supra-individual phenomena, we may distinguish among the epistemic strategies by noting the epistemological status given these phenomena. Although emergent phenomena in sociology go by many names (forms, figurations, networks, discourses, structures, and so on), for the sake of convenience I will use the familiar terms ‘structure’ and ‘system’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0896920511434217">2</xref></sup></p>
<p>I describe the five epistemic strategies in detail elsewhere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr98-0896920511434217">Powell, 2010</xref>). Briefly, however, they work as follows. In strong <italic>methodological individualism</italic>, social structures have no explanatory weight or distinct properties of their own; they function as mere heuristics which must reduce entirely to explanations in terms of individual action. In epistemologically <italic>constructionist</italic> or <italic>compositionist</italic> theories, social structures appear as distinct phenomena with properties irreducible to individual action, which thereby account for external or objective constraints on action. Theorizing the further emergent dynamics generated by the interaction of social structures leads beyond compositionism to <italic>heterarchy</italic>, or ‘tangled-systems theories’. Social order derives from the complex interaction of multiple systems, each driven by its own logic, and none of which can successfully constitute itself as a totality that embraces all the others. Totalization emerges in epistemologically <italic>hierarchical</italic> theories. Although multiple systemic logics may still apply in hierarchical theories, one of these systems determines all the others, at least ‘in the last instance’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0896920511434217">Althusser, 2005</xref>). However, the totalizing system does not produce an organic unity of society; the logic of the system contradicts itself, generating irreconcilable antagonisms within the social order. In contrast to this, <italic>holist</italic> theories conceptualize social conflicts or contradictions as pathological exceptions to the strong integrative tendency of the social system.</p>

<p>Weber, rational-choice theorists, and behaviourists assert methodologically individualist positions, as did Karl Popper in philosophy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-0896920511434217">Kontopoulos, 1993</xref>: 86). Berger and Luckmann’s social constructionism, social network analysis and game theory fall within the compositionist range of the spectrum, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-0896920511434217">Kontopoulos, 1993</xref>: 102–122), as do the work of Simmel, actor-network theorists (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0896920511434217">Callon, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-0896920511434217">Latour, 1993 [1991]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-0896920511434217">2005</xref>), Scott Lash’s cultural theory (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-0896920511434217">Lash and Leury, 2007</xref>), and the liberal postmodernisms of Lyotard and Rorty (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr80-0896920511434217">Lyotard, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr102-0896920511434217">Rorty, 1989</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr103-0896920511434217">1991</xref>; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr92-0896920511434217">Mirchandani, 2005</xref>). Bourdieu, Giddens, Bhaskar, and arguably Foucault all adopt heterarchical epistemological positions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-0896920511434217">Kontopoulos, 1993</xref>: 214ff.), as does <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-0896920511434217">Luhmann (1995 [1984])</xref>. Marx provides a paradigmatic example of hierarchical theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-0896920511434217">Kontopoulos, 1993</xref>: 192); in my view, other radical theories that explain all social conflicts in terms of one underlying contradiction also fit into this category (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0896920511434217">Firestone, 1970</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr91-0896920511434217">Millett, 1970</xref>). The organicism of Durkheim and Parsons exemplify the holist epistemic strategy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-0896920511434217">Kontopoulos, 1993</xref>: 153–154).</p>
<p>Each epistemic strategy enables different kinds of theoretical claims and, as a consequence, generates different frameworks of expectation regarding the constraints and opportunities faced by sociology in general and public sociology in particular. This consideration applies even if one holds an unreflexive conception of sociological rationality itself. One’s conception of the internal and external relations of sociology, about sociologists’ relations to each other and to their publics, necessarily varies along with one’s conception of society itself. Things get more interesting, however, if one turns a reflexive sociological gaze onto sociological rationality itself: not only on the activities by which that rationality is expressed and applied, but on the constitution of that rationality, on the structured processes through which sociologists produce and legitimate the limited consensus that certifies particular statements as sociological knowledge. Like other kinds of scientist, sociologists produce not only specific pieces of knowledge characteristic of their field but also the standards of validity that legitimate that knowledge in the face of competing claims to knowing, claims made by other kinds of scientist, by dominant political actors, and by the very publics whom the public sociologist claims to represent. Therefore, which epistemic strategy one uses to theorize sociological rationality has consequences for how one expects sociology in general and public sociology in particular to <italic>work</italic>. Just as different optical instruments reveal different structural features of, say, an astronomical body, the different epistemic strategies reveal different reflexive dilemmas likely to confront public sociologists.</p>
<p>Briefly, the main such dilemmas are as follows. Methodological individualism highlights the <italic>conflicts of interest</italic> that may emerge between sociologists and the publics they study. Compositionism locates such conflicts within the wider problem of <italic>competing discursive constructions</italic>. Composition also brings out the <italic>performative contradiction</italic> that results when sociology, by de-reifying socially dominant discursive formations, also de-reifies itself and risks its own legitimacy. Hierarchical analyses, particularly those that operate in a dialectical mode, bring out sociology’s enmeshment in an unresolvable <italic>social contradiction</italic> that leaves no middle ground between hegemonic and revolutionary science. These problems all concern <italic>difference</italic>; holist analyses form a special case wherein problems of difference are theoretically subordinate to problems of integration.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0896920511434217">3</xref></sup> In rigorously holist analysis, public sociology appears as a <italic>pathology</italic> because it does not articulate the organic functional integration of society. Treating heterarchy out of order, I argue that it allows an analysis of both performative and social contradictions. In radical, dialectically heterarchical theories, sociologists are faced with the challenge and opportunity of developing a science that is not premised on consensus but that can still transform the world through praxis.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0896920511434217" sec-type="methods">
<title>Methodological Individualism</title>
<p>In methodologically individualist theories, collective concepts appear as heuristic tools with no epistemic status of their own. In other words, ‘institutions’, ‘systems’ and the like appear as a convenient shorthand for patterns in individual social action but cannot in themselves explain that action; all explanations framed in terms of collective concepts must in principle reduce to explanation in terms of individual action (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr123-0896920511434217">Weber, 1978a [1922]</xref>: 6, 9, 13–14, 19–22). Such concepts provide a convenient shorthand for aggregates of individual-level phenomena but cannot in themselves provide an explanation for such action. Only individuals and their actions – including individuals’ motives, perceptions, emotions, values, and rationalizations – do count as explanations for social events. Applying a methodologically individualist epistemology to understanding science in general and sociology in particular leaves open two divergent possibilities regarding the origin of scientific rationality. In the first alternative, scientific rationality may merely provide a social instantiation of values and dispositions that are biophysically innate to all healthy human beings.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0896920511434217">4</xref></sup> In this case, scientific rationality is universally inscribed in human nature. Humans are born without knowledge of science but with a universally shared science-generating set of dispositions in a manner analogous to the universally shared generative grammar of Chomskyan linguistics. This position is consistent with the hard individualism of rational choice theory (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-0896920511434217">Kontopoulos, 1993</xref>: 33–38) and is explicitly articulated by cognitive theorists (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0896920511434217">Heintz, 2004</xref>). In the second alternative, scientific rationality emerges contingently as a widespread subjective response to particular historical conditions. In this case, scientific rationality is not properly universal, only very widespread, and only under specific conditions (those of modernity). Biophysically innate dispositions still operate, but they underdetermine the type of action called ‘science’. Weber himself tended towards this view, treating science as one way of knowing among others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr122-0896920511434217">Weber, 1949 [1897]</xref>: 110), albeit one with special powers of prediction and control over causal forces (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr124-0896920511434217">Weber, 1978b [1913]</xref>).</p>
<p>If one theorizes rationality in individualist terms, then the main challenge facing public sociologists is that of legitimating their own activities to their publics, to the wider society that includes the dominant groups that public sociology aims to challenge, to their own colleagues, and to themselves. Legitimation concerns how public sociologists establish the validity of the knowledge they produce, how they answer the question of why anyone would be interested in or believe what they have to say. If we understand sociologists and their publics as interest groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0896920511434217">Dahrendorf, 1959</xref>: 157ff.), then it appears that sociologists can build legitimacy by serving the interests of their publics. This can happen in at least two distinct ways: either by granting mastery over causal social forces, or by producing representations which that public finds politically useful (these two options intersect, of course).</p>
<p>As a third option, public sociologists may also appeal to publicly held values and dispositions, i.e. to the general legitimacy of scientific discourse. This third type of appeal takes on a vital importance in the wider societal arena where public sociologists challenge the interests of state and market elites. Without scientific legitimacy, public sociology loses some of its usefulness for the publics it is meant to serve. Capitalist and state elites can try to dismiss public sociology as yet another partisan voice on behalf of so-called ‘special interest groups’; or, more radically, they can undercut the authority of science as such in the realm of public decision-making.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0896920511434217">5</xref></sup> The specific origin of scientific rationality therefore affects the political calculus connecting sociologists, their publics, and their professional colleagues. If scientific rationality simply instantiates essentially pre-social rational dispositions, then science will enjoy more legitimacy the more that society allows individual human nature to flourish, and conflicts between science and its detractors appear essentially as conflicts between objective reason and mere ideology. But if science’s legitimacy depends on historically variable subjective value-orientations, then public sociologists who dismiss their opponents as mere ideologues will be gravely underestimating the social resources available to their opponents. In this case, the concerns of professional sociologists that public sociology could undermine the discipline as a whole are well-founded.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0896920511434217">
<title>Compositionism</title>
<p>In compositionist epistemologies, bottom-up analyses of individual action lead to the theorization of emergent, supra-individual social forces. With the shift from individualist to constructionist or compositionist<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0896920511434217">6</xref></sup> epistemologies comes a radical break in the status of sociological knowledge itself: as emergent social forms displace the internal teleology of the personality system in accounting for social action, the prospect of universal rationality recedes, and with it, the scientist’s privileged epistemological status. However, this break does not happen all at once. For instance, Berger and Luckmann’s <italic>The Social Construction of Reality</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0896920511434217">1966</xref>) posited emergent structures in the form of institutions that, once externalized and objectified, possessed their own capacity to determine individuals’ experiences of reality. Although the reality of socially constructed institutions derives from individuals’ actions, these institutions confront individuals as an external and exigent force. But Berger and Luckmann did not turn this constructionist analysis back on sociology itself, leaving sociology exempt from its own de-reifying gaze. Full reflexivity requires applying a compositionist epistemology to scientific rationality itself.</p>
<p>Since the emergence of their strong programme (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0896920511434217">Barnes, 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0896920511434217">Barnes et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0896920511434217">Bloor, 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-0896920511434217">Knorr-Cetina, 1981</xref>), sociologists of scientific knowledge have moved beyond individualist accounts of rationality to employ explicitly constructionist analyses. These accounts relativize scientific rationality, treating it as something made by human beings under specific socio-historical conditions – made, in Shapin’s phrase, ‘as if it was produced by people with bodies, situated in time, space, culture, and society, and struggling for credibility and authority’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr109-0896920511434217">Shapin, 2010</xref>). In this framework, science appears not merely as ‘organized common sense’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0896920511434217"><italic>How to Think about Science</italic>, 2009</xref>) but as a particular institution with its own specific practical norms. Their unit of analysis is not the individual’s social action but social practices. Practices are constituted through (and work to constitute) relations among actors, actors with interests (in both the intellectual and political senses of the term) defined by their location and movement within institutional structures. (At the same time, this programme is merely constructionist or compositionist in the sense that grand systemic concepts like ‘the capitalist mode of production’ or ‘the state system’ have little or no epistemic value.) The defining principle of this programme is the rule of symmetry: one cannot explain only false scientific claims as a product of social forces while leaving true social claims outside the scope of sociology; both true and false scientific knowledge are equally socially constructed. Pursuing this insight has provoked intense controversy, in the form of the so-called ‘science wars’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0896920511434217">Hacking, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0896920511434217"><italic>How to Think about Science</italic>, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr105-0896920511434217">Ross, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr111-0896920511434217">Sokal, 1996</xref>), as sociologists of knowledge (among others) have de-reified science and delegitimized its foundational myths of objective universality and transcendence of social contingency. This position gives rise to a <italic>performative contradiction</italic>. Constructionist accounts of science apply equally to sociology, including the sociology of scientific knowledge itself.</p>
<p>Compositionist sociology of scientific knowledge bears directly on the interests of public sociologists. Neoliberal discourse makes abundant use of the fetishized authority of experts to reify and naturalize the ongoing commodification and marketization of social practice. Subordinated publics have an interest in de-fetishizing expert authority – ‘stripping the experts’, so to speak (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr83-0896920511434217">Martin, 1991</xref>), in favour of their own local narratives. And to the extent that civil society actors aim to establish a common discourse, more democratic and egalitarian than that of neoliberalism, viewing this project as a deliberate act of construction has advantages over viewing it as the mere realization of an already existing truth. Public sociologists can contribute to these efforts by drawing on the sociology of scientific knowledge and other projects, like genealogy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0896920511434217">Foucault, 1984</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0896920511434217">1997</xref>) and standpoint epistemology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr110-0896920511434217">Smith, 1990</xref>) that disrupt expert authority. Paradoxically, they can lend expert authority to the liberating assertion that truth is not found but made. But in so doing, public sociologists inadvertently undermine their own professional authority, opening themselves to the nihilist rejoinder: ‘If no way of speaking has universal validity, then why should I listen to your narrative?’ This is precisely the legitimation crisis identified by Jean-François Lyotard in <italic>The Postmodern Condition</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr80-0896920511434217">1984</xref>). This crisis arises not from subjectivist solipsism, but from a pragmatic, even materialist, constructionist sociology of knowledge.</p>
<p>The performative contradiction of constructionism about science bears mainly on sociology’s struggles with more powerful narratives. The insights of actor-network theory highlight a related problem concerning public sociologists’ relations with those weaker than themselves. Callon’s classic exposition of the formation of an actor network provides the vocabulary that lets us identify this problem (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0896920511434217">Callon, 1988</xref>; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-0896920511434217">Latour, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-0896920511434217">Law and Hassard, 1999</xref>) In Callon’s analysis, scientific researchers do not encounter the objects of their investigation ready-made and do not perform only a passive role of recording what they see before them. Instead, researchers must actively work to reconfigure their objects in ways that enable the production and publication of a peer-reviewed journal article. To this end, researchers begin by interposing their research between actors<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0896920511434217">7</xref></sup> and their interests (problematization); they then lock those actors into place to form a network configured according to the demands of research methodology (interessement); they ensure that the members of that network accept their various roles, especially their roles as representatives of larger populations (enrolment); and they read the actions of enrolled actors to produce an account of a reality that is then held to have existed independently of the research process (mobilization). Callon calls this entire process translation. Translation does not simply represent the objects of scientific study as they are in nature; it symbolically and practically remakes them into forms suitable for scientific discourse. Notably, the work of mobilization involves the silencing of the mobilized actors, for ‘to speak for others is to first silence those in whose name we speak’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0896920511434217">Callon, 1988</xref>: 216).Civil-society actors approached by would-be public sociologists might well exercise scepticism over just what it is that they are being enrolled in and how their perceptions, actions, and desires will be translated.</p>

<title>Modular Hierarchy</title>
<p>Rather than write immediately of heterarchy, the most complex of epistemic strategies, I will next discuss hierarchical and holist strategies before returning to heterarchy at the conclusion of this article.</p>
<p>Fourth on the epistemic ladder from methodological individualism to holism lie those theories that Kontopoulos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-0896920511434217">1993</xref>: 12–13, 22, 42ff.) calls <italic>hierarchies</italic>. In this terminology, hierarchy refers not to the existence of dominance and subordination among actors (which of course appear in theories of all types) but to the organization of social structures into a descending tree of nested modules: for instance, society as a whole, divided into classes, divided further into class fractions, and so on. Hierarchical theories invoke holistic concepts of system or totality but eschew reference to strong functional integration as an explanatory force. Rather, the tensions, dissonances, or antagonisms generated by partially disarticulated modular subdivisions of society explain the particular phenomena apparent in any given historical situation. Moreover, this incomplete integration appears as a normal, not pathological, feature of actually existing society. Marxian theory provides a paradigmatic example of a hierarchical theory, one whose principle of modular subdivision (class difference) derives from differing relations to the means of production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr87-0896920511434217">Marx and Engels, 1976 [1846]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr88-0896920511434217">1988 [1848]</xref>). Radical feminist theories provide an alternative whose principle of modular subdivision (sex difference) derives from relations of biological reproduction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0896920511434217">Firestone, 1970</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr91-0896920511434217">Millett, 1970</xref>).</p>
<p>I contend that hierarchical theories so conceived come in two flavours: dialectical and non-dialectical. Non-dialectical theories frame the agonistic relations among structural modules in terms of <italic>conflict</italic>, locating the motive forces of those conflicts within each module and thus tending towards more reductionistic analysis. From such frameworks we get conceptions of Marx as a limited, unidimensional conflict theorist (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0896920511434217">Collins, 1994</xref>). More interesting are the dialectical versions of hierarchical theories, in which social <italic>contradictions</italic> emerge from the relations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0896920511434217">Ball, 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr94-0896920511434217">Ollman, 1976</xref>) between social forces. For Marx, capital and labour do not exist independently of one another, but constitute each other through their mutual relation. The simultaneous sale and purchase of human labour-power creates the worker as a worker and the capitalist as a capitalist (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr86-0896920511434217">Marx, 2000c [1847]</xref>: 283), so that workers, by producing wealth, society and the conditions of human existence, simultaneously produce their own poverty, alienation, and dehumanization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr84-0896920511434217">Marx, 2000a [1844]</xref>: 86–92). We could say that conflict arises from the non-integration of individuals or of local institutions, whereas contradiction arises precisely from the integration of society.</p>
<p>In a hierarchical view of rationality, truth is just as socially constructed as it is in compositionism. But instead of those constructions spinning off into a limitless plurality of differing local narratives, they resolve into a single bifurcated structure. In Marxian theory, labour and capital produce opposed forms of rationality, and in meeting, mixing, struggling with each other, give rise to a complex duality in the activity of reasoning and the outcomes towards which it tends. Every institution of capitalist society inescapably articulates this capital-labour contradiction. But while some institutions act purely on behalf of one or the other force, others provide sites for the ‘war of position’ to which Gramsci attached such decisive importance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0896920511434217">Gramsci, 1971</xref>: 5–14, 234–235, 245). Academic sociology is one of those sites. In a dialectically hierarchical view such as Marx’s, therefore, Burawoy’s confidence that public and critical sociologists can get along with professional and policy sociologists, that organic and traditional intellectuals complement each other, actually expresses a political conviction that societal contradictions can be resolved within the existing framework of society. To a dialectical hierarchist such resolution is impossible, making Burawoy’s conception of public sociology naïve at best and hegemonic at worst.</p>

<sec id="section6-0896920511434217">
<title>Holism</title>
<p>The implications of a holist conception of rationality are laid out vividly in Durkheim’s account of sociologists as the agents uniquely qualified to diagnose the normal and pathological states of the social body and prescribe remedies for the latter. Durkheim explained society as an organically unified whole composed of objectively existing emergent structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0896920511434217">Durkheim, 1982 [1895]</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr98-0896920511434217">Powell, 2010</xref>). This organic unity of society operates as a developmental tendency; modern society characterized by pathological levels of conflict and alienation should evolve towards greater integration and unity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0896920511434217">Durkheim, 1984 [1893]</xref>: 172–175, 178–183, 339–340). Throughout this process, higher-order forces, the objective developmental tendencies of the social organism, exert determining effects on individual human beings, constituting their very subjectivity. Subjects in modern societies perceive and conduct themselves as individuals <italic>because modern society individualizes them</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0896920511434217">Durkheim, 1992 [1957]</xref>: 65–67). Individual consciousness has a social origin; it grows out of the collective consciousness. This applies to sociologists as much as to anyone else. As the social organism evolves, it tends to produce the forms of ideation that it needs for its own functioning. This includes the science of society, capable of discovering the objective functional needs of the social body, diagnosing its pathologies, and prescribing remedies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0896920511434217">Durkheim, 1982 [1895]</xref>: 102–107). Sociologists can do this with objective validity because their rationality derives from the same objective forces that give society its organization and unity in the first place. Sociologists speak with binding validity because the totality speaks through us, because our thoughts are the organic products of that totality. We are reflexively embedded in the object of our study, but to achieve objective knowledge we do not need to inhabit differing subject positions (as standpoint epistemology requires), because our connection to the totality enables us to articulate the meta-interests that bind all members of society.</p>
<p>When perceived through the terms of a holist conception of rationality, Burawoy’s subdivision of sociology into four types and his call for more public sociology appear either as the symptom of a pathological state of society, or as themselves pathological. A properly constituted scientific sociology making objective diagnoses of the developmental needs of society should simultaneously fulfil the imperatives of professional, policy, critical and public sociology. Or, if these categories express a useful division of disciplinary labour, professional sociology should reign supreme, providing the overarching analysis of which the other sociologies merely work out detailed applications. Conversely, any tendency of public sociologists to go native by siding with their constituents against the dominant social order would be clearly pathological. In a holist framework, a universalist conception of rationality cannot abide a pluralist proliferation of public sociologies. At worst, public sociology would appear to add to the social disintegration of which it itself appears symptomatic.</p>

<sec id="section7-0896920511434217">
<title>Heterarchy</title>
<p>Heterarchical analyses of public sociology fall well short of such bleak dismissal, but do suggest that the enterprise faces some formidable challenges. Heterarchy sits between compositionism and hierarchy on Kontopoulos’s scale of epistemic strategies, more systematic than the former but less totalizing than the latter. Heterarchical theories frame the social world in terms of multiple systems that overlap, intertwine, reinforce each other, subvert or oppose one another, each striving for totality but unable to achieve it, so that the combined product is less a meta-system or system of systems than a perpetually incomplete and unstable tangle of systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-0896920511434217">Kontopoulos, 1993</xref>: 62–72). This complex entanglement reconciles notions of social-structural determination with individual agency: in overlapping with one another, working to different ends, and so disrupting one another, systems may in their very overdetermining tendencies foster situations of local indeterminacy, in which individuals have the scope to innovate new structured practices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-0896920511434217">Kontopoulos, 1993</xref>: 18, 235–236, 318). This turbulence means that causality is not always scale-bound, so that microsocial and even biophysical forces can have macrosocial consequences and vice versa, obeying complex logics that are neither reductionist nor holist (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-0896920511434217">Kontopoulos, 1993</xref>: 32, 173, 238). Heterarchy has become a common epistemological strategy in contemporary sociological theory, at least in its non-dialectical articulations; it appears in Foucault’s analysis of the swarming of institutions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0896920511434217">Foucault, 1990 [1976]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0896920511434217">1995 [1975]</xref>), Giddens’s multidimensional theory of modernity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0896920511434217">Giddens, 1984</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0896920511434217">1990</xref>), Bourdieu’s multiple fields of capital (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0896920511434217">Bourdieu, 1984</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0896920511434217">1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0896920511434217">Bourdieu and Wacquant, 1992</xref>), the multi-level institutional analysis of contemporary organizational theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0896920511434217">Boltanski and Thévenot, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0896920511434217">Friedland and Alford, 1991</xref>), Luhmann’s complexity-oriented systems theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-0896920511434217">Luhmann, 1995 [1984]</xref>), and elsewhere.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-0896920511434217">8</xref></sup> But certain implications of a heterarchical approach to rationality itself have yet to be explored thoroughly, perhaps for fear of their relativizing implications.</p>
<p>Like hierarchy, heterarchy comes in dialectical and non-dialectical forms. In its non-dialectical forms, scientific rationality appears as a social construction, as in compositionist frameworks, but the formative influence of global systems on local processes of construction mitigates the incommensurateness of local narratives, establishing a heterogeneous network of epistemic bridges among those narratives. Public sociology can operate on those bridges; in effect, the public sociologist can say to the indigenous traditionalist, ‘You and I have up to this point narrated the universe in fundamentally different terms, but we both have to deal with neoliberalism, so let’s start from there and see what we can do together.’ Sociology still commits itself to a performative contradiction, its own epistemic logic compelling it to expose its own founding myths and defetishize its own sources of authority. But public sociology might help to remedy this by replacing eroding authority with new relations of solidarity. Feminist work on intersectionality (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0896920511434217">Collins, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0896920511434217">Crenshaw, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0896920511434217">hooks, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr81-0896920511434217">McCall, 2005</xref>) and on kyriarchy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0896920511434217">Bruns, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr100-0896920511434217">Pui-lan, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr108-0896920511434217">Schüssler Fiorenza, 1999</xref>) speaks to the challenges and opportunities of this situation.</p>
<p>Dialectical heterarchy presents an even more complex picture. Social contradictions work counter to the commensurating tendencies of global systems, introducing multiple bifurcations into the heterogeneous network of truth-making. So if consciousness and hence rationality are engendered socially by multiple contradictory systems, then the relative uniformity of scientific rationality in the modern world – its de facto quasi-universality – needs explaining. A dialectically heterarchical framework suggests that such quasi-universality may result from the confluence of multiple systems working together to overdetermine the practical epistemologies of societal members. If so, then professional sociology more or less confidently occupies this zone of multiple forms of naturalized privilege, while public sociology can be entirely uncritical, critical along some axes of oppression but not others, or radically critical along all. The more critically that public sociology engages with marginalized publics and counterhegemonic struggles, the more dispersed and disunified its discourse will become, and the more quixotic will appear the goal of establishing universal truth in the sense of a rational consensus.</p>
<p>The reasons for this can be clarified by applying the reflexive analyses of Dorothy Smith and Pierre Bourdieu to the problem of the performative contradiction. If the performative contradiction impinged only on sociology’s claim to public legitimacy in the face of dominant interests, then public sociologists might willingly pay that price. Taking professional risks in the service of public good against the interests of neoliberal elites is what gives public sociology its heroic elan. But conflicts of interest may also emerge between public sociologists and the publics they wish to study. Sociologists engaged with community-based research or with critical or anti-oppressive methodologies have already noted the potential conflicts between the imperatives of social-scientific research and the needs of politically engaged, and potentially vulnerable, civil society organizations (see e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0896920511434217">Cooke and Kothari, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0896920511434217">Holland and Blackburn, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr93-0896920511434217">Mohan and Stokke, 2000</xref>). This goes deeper than the conflict between the necessary political opportunism of social movements on the one hand and the intellectual’s need for consistency, coherence, and ‘honesty’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr121-0896920511434217">Wallerstein, 2007</xref>: 170) on the other. Social movements have extra-scientific political interests, of course, but they also have their own distinct <italic>epistemic</italic> interests. Social science in its normal mode of operation proceeds by objectifying the social world, translating the subjectively unique and relationally embedded particular experiences of particular subjects into abstract and labile data that can be subjected to the context-nonspecific operations of statistics or qualitative content analysis or middle-range theories and so on, and thereby articulated into the general academic conversation. In the process, knowledge is alienated from the people whose lives that knowledge represents; research subjects do not normally control what is done with data collected from them once that data enters the symbolic economy of academic production. As Smith has pointed out, this objectification has an affinity with the objectification instantiated through ‘relations of rule’, whereby dominated subjects suffer having their lived experience denied or mutilated to meet the instrumental needs of those who govern (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr110-0896920511434217">Smith, 1990</xref>). In the conflict between the objectified discourse of ruling and the fiercely idiographic narratives of the ruled, a sociologist who does not practice reflexive awareness risks representing the latter in the terms and categories of the former, even if the content of that representation is otherwise favourable. In this way, even an overtly progressive social science may readily become complicit with governmentality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0896920511434217">Foucault, 1991</xref>). At the very least, these considerations require public sociologists to act with great care and to reflexively account not only for their subordinated position in relation to state and market elites, but also for their privileged position relative to many of the publics they wish to ally themselves with.</p>
<p>The effective exercise of such reflexive care requires serious commitment, however. For whatever their values, public sociologists must still obey the logic of ‘scientific capital’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0896920511434217">Bourdieu, 2004</xref>: 55). In Bourdieu’s theory, cultural capital (cultural know-how, including useful skills and dispositions; see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0896920511434217">Bourdieu, 1984</xref>: 12–14,53–54, 70–71, 120–122; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0896920511434217">Bourdieu, 1990</xref>: 66ff.; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0896920511434217">Bourdieu and Wacquant, 1992</xref>: 119) becomes symbolic capital (loosely speaking, prestige; see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0896920511434217">Bourdieu and Wacquant, 1992</xref>: 119) when it is externalized and reified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0896920511434217">Berger and Luckmann, 1966</xref>: 89–92). The authority of scientific knowledge is a specific form of symbolic capital, and the production of scientific knowledge requires the ongoing reproduction, on an expanding scale, of this scientific cultural capital (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0896920511434217">Bourdieu, 2004</xref>: 55). Sociologists, public or otherwise, are not free to represent the world as they will; they must work entrepreneurially to expand their own scientific symbolic capital and so, indirectly, that of their field as a whole (regarding fields, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0896920511434217">Bourdieu and Wacquant, 1992</xref>: 96–97, 104–109). This imperative generates strong pressures to adhere to scientific norms, norms that tend to objectify that which is studied. Among the possible antidemocratic effects of this scientific translation, governmentalization is a relatively mild form. More severe symbolic violence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0896920511434217">Bourdieu, 1991</xref>: 51–52; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0896920511434217">Bourdieu, 2001</xref>: 33ff.) can result when the sociologist as a ‘destroyer of myths’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0896920511434217">Elias, 1978 [1970]</xref>: 50ff.) does uncompensated harm to myths that oppressed groups use to construct positive self-identities. The risk of this harm is greater the further removed such myths are, in their value-rationality, from the particular values that underpin scientific normativity. Stark examples of this can be found, for instance, in encounters between anthropologists conducting field research and indigenous groups struggling against colonialism and cultural genocide. Not for nothing has ‘research’ become a ‘dirty word’ in many indigenous communities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr116-0896920511434217">Tuhiwai Smith, 1999</xref>: i).</p>
<p>We could say that the process of scientific investigation entails a contradiction of its own between the active, speaking subject of knowledge and the passive, silent object of knowledge. Critically reflexive public sociologists must negotiate this contradiction while simultaneously also negotiating the contradictions between capital and labour, sovereign and subject, patriarchal masculinity and its various others, and so on. In these difficult struggles, the claim that scientific rationality provides an exclusive, objective, universally valid form of knowledge favours the epistemic interests of the dominating sides of these contradictions. The Marxian or Gramscian problem that sociology’s institutional legitimacy varies inversely with the effectiveness of its counter-hegemonic praxis appears again in heterarchy, and multiplied. However, the competing systemic logics pull in contrary as well as complementary directions, and these incoherencies produce zones of underdetermination through overdetermination that avail subjects of opportunities to develop new structures. Concretely, the imperatives of state power do not always align with those of the market, which do not always align with those of patriarchy, and so on. Subjects in civil society already engage in struggles that play one system off against the other; these kinds of struggles may enable the construction of new institutions not premised on contradiction. The view from dialectically heterarchical epistemology suggests that, one way or another, a critical public sociology must help build the new institutions that will legitimate it, in a race against the loss of institutional support from patron institutions whose dominance it helps to undermine. In the process it works to supersede its own internal contradiction between the knowing expert subject and the unknowing, known-about object.</p>
<p>One way to think about this formidable task is in terms of epistemic difference. In compositionist theories, differences appear plural, separate, endlessly profuse; in hierarchical theories, difference appears dual, the two halves of the duality connected through their antagonism. In dialectical heterarchy, differences appear dual, interconnected, overlapping, riven with contradictions, endlessly dynamic, inseparable but also unresolvable within the existing social order. Difference creates a problem for science, which, despite the provisionality and contestability of all scientific truth-claims, and despite the heterogeneity of its disciplines, depends for its legitimation and much of its practical appeal on the myth of universal truth. In a compositionist universe, one can deal with difference through translation, ‘interpretation’ in Bauman’s terms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0896920511434217">1987</xref>); in a dialectical hierarchy, the aim is transcendence. The ambition of the former might be merely ‘to travel – looking, looking, breathlessly’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0896920511434217">Castañeda, 1968</xref>: 137),<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-0896920511434217">9</xref></sup> while the latter aims to change the world (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr85-0896920511434217">Marx, 2000b [1845/1888]</xref>). A public sociologist in the dialectical heterarchical mode might well combine both of these ambitions. Such a person might ask, how could science work if it no longer reproduced expert authority and no longer pretended to generate a unitary truth? How can socio-political praxis work without either depending on consensus or devolving into new forms of authoritarianism? Auguste Comte, sociology’s nominal founder, believed in a world where a technocratic elite advised authoritarian governments on how to solve social problems with scientific efficiency, avoiding the messy complications of democracy. Public sociology appeals to a radically different belief. But how radical is it willing to be?</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Public sociology, as conceived by Burawoy, offers sociologists exciting opportunities for social engagement that serves both the professional interest of bringing our work to wider audiences and the moral purpose of aiding the dominated against the forces of domination. My purpose here has been to push reflexive thinking, on which public sociology is premised, further than its proponents have done so far. What a reflexive analysis will reveal depends on the epistemological assumptions of that analysis. Kontopoulos’s five-part classification of epistemic strategies draws out a wider, more complex range of positions than allowed for by the simple opposition of holism and individualism. In a methodologically individualist frame, the main challenges to public sociology come from conflicts of interest: between public sociologists and the elites whose dominance sociology opposes, but also between sociologists and the publics they work with, publics who may have their own epistemic interests threatened by the scientific ethos. In a compositionist frame, these challenges appear more starkly in the form of the performative contradiction entered into by a science whose own logic compels it to construe all possible forms of knowledge, including itself, as historically particular and contingent social constructions. On the other side of the spectrum, both hierarchical and holist epistemologies suggest more insurmountable obstacles to public sociology. What appears in a compositionist framework as a performative contradiction becomes, in a (dialectically) hierarchical mode of theorizing, the symptom of a social contradiction. The opposition of capital and labour is such that hegemonic and counter-hegemonic modes of knowing are incommensurable; methodological rigour and institutional autonomy will not suffice to bridge the gap between traditional and organic intellectual activity, between reform and revolution. At the holist end of the epistemological spectrum, the logic of public sociology collapses altogether: sociology derives its authority from its own organic integration into the social order, an integration that enables and demands strict objectivity and non-partisanship. A sociology whose agenda is defined by any extra-scientific considerations appears to the strict holist as a pathology.</p>
<p>Heterarchy, the position in the middle range of this spectrum, presents the most complex ensemble of challenges and opportunities. In heterarchical analysis, public sociology must contend not only with a plurality of overlapping and intersecting forms of domination, as in methodologically individualist and compositionist theories, but with multiple emergent systems of domination, systems that sometimes reinforce each other and sometimes compete with one another to determine action within the social field. Opportunities for radical transformation can emerge from zones of indeterminacy created when competing systemic logics partially cancel each other out. But a specifically dialectical heterarchical framework implies multiple social contradictions, multiple forms of hegemony and counter-hegemony, multiple ways in which the institutional interests of academic sociologists and the epistemic needs of movements for social transformation will pull too far apart to be bridged by the tools currently available to us. These pressures may impel sociologists to reconsider one of their own foundational myths: that of the universality of scientific rationality. For all the de facto heterogeneity of scientific discourse, the principle of rational consensus remains essential to many scientists, including sociologists. The complex multiple forms of epistemic difference implied by a heterarchical conception of social structure suggest that the scope for rational consensus is always limited, even among those working on counter-hegemonic projects.</p>
<p>The current ongoing crisis of neoliberal capitalist society, the multiple forms of resistance that have emerged, and the experiments in radically democratic decision-making that some of those movements have engaged in (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0896920511434217">Gelderloos, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0896920511434217">Graeber, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr120-0896920511434217">Vannucci and Singer, 2010</xref>) are opening up new zones of indeterminacy in which individuals and groups can innovate genuinely new structural practices, even to the point of reinventing their modes of discourse. Will sociology venture into those zones? And what new forms will it take as it engages with epistemic difference in an egalitarian spirit? This may be public sociology’s true adventure: discovering not only new truths about the social, but new ways of making truth, new ways of being a sociologist.</p>

<p>Less commonly, relational thinking or relationism is proposed as a third alternative to these two (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0896920511434217">Elias, 1987 [1983]</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0896920511434217">Emirbayer, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr97-0896920511434217">Powell, 2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr99-0896920511434217">2011</xref>). The specific implications of relational as opposed to objectivist conceptions of social structure are complex enough to warrant an entire other article.

<p>For instance, Durkheim’s work treats social differentiation as either normal (conducive to social solidarity) or pathological (destructive of that solidarity); in his analysis, difference matters because of its relation to social integration and not vice versa.</p></fn>

<p>Alternatively, scientific rationality may constitute an emergent psychological phenomenon that is not itself inscribed within biophysically innate cognitive dispositions, but one that operates universally or near-universally because it constitutes the singular functionally optimal resolution of the interaction of innate dispositions with the social and physical environments in which human beings operate. Emergence happens in what Parsons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr96-0896920511434217">1951</xref>: 6–10) called the ‘personality system’, without engendering a ‘social system’. However, for the purposes of my discussion here the effects of this position are indistinguishable from those of biophysical reductionism.</p></fn>

<p>In Canada, the former process has been used at least since the Mulroney government of the 1980s, and the latter has manifested itself in, for instance, the Harper government’s decision to gut the long-form census by making it no longer mandatory.</p></fn>

<p>Kontopoulos uses ‘constructionism’ and ‘compositionism’ interchangeably to refer to this type of epistemic strategy. However, since the word ‘constructionism’ has acquired so many diverse connotations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0896920511434217">Hacking, 1999</xref>), I prefer the relatively unfamiliar word ‘compositionism’, which, if it evokes anything at all, suggests a sociology in which society appears as the mere composite sum of its structures.</p></fn>

<p>Actor-network theory treats not only humans but also nonhumans – animals, plants, even non-living matter – as capable of social action, and hence as social actors (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-0896920511434217">Latour, 1988</xref>).</p></fn>

<p>Considerable heterogeneity still exists within this category, however. Foucault’s work, for instance, lies more towards the compositionist end of this category while Bourdieu’s lies towards its hierarchical end.</p></fn>

<p>Of course, Castañeda’s purported anthropology is well known to have been a hoax. But as mere poetry it sometimes expresses the spirit of a science that eschews both reductionism and systematicity.</p></fn>
