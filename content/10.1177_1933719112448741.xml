<title>A Role for Corin in Preeclampsia</title>
<p>Pregnancy-induced hypertension, or preeclampsia, is a pregnancy- and postpartum-related condition characterized by a rapid raise in blood pressure that can lead to seizures, stroke, multiple organ failure, and death of the mother and/or the fetus. The severity of preeclampsia and its relatively high frequency call for an urgent improvement in diagnosis, management, and prevention of the disease that will only be possible through a better understanding of its etiology.</p>
<p>During pregnancy, the uterus undergoes profound morphological changes, including trophoblast invasion and spiral artery remodeling. When preeclampsia occurs impaired spiral artery remodeling is common but the underlying mechanisms are still unclear, although vascular growth factor receptors, angiotensin and oestradiol, are known to play a role. </p>
<p>Corin (also known as atrial natriuretic peptide [ANP]-converting enzyme) is a cardiac protease that activates ANP, a cardiac hormone that is important in regulating blood pressure. Corin was unexpectedly detected in the pregnant uterus, and this fact led Cui et al to explore its role during pregnancy. Their findings have been recently published in the journal <italic>Nature</italic> (<italic>Nature</italic>, published online March 21, 2012).</p>
<p>Cui and colleagues observed that pregnant mice deficient for either corin or ANP developed high blood pressure and proteinuria. In addition, the uterus of these mice presented with both a significantly impaired trophoblast invasion and a defective uterine spiral artery remodeling, characteristic of preeclampsia.</p>
<p>When the researchers extended their study to patients with preeclampsia, they observed that in these patients uterine corin messenger RNA (mRNA) and protein levels are significantly lower than that in normal pregnancies. Moreover, Cui et al were able to identify corin gene mutations in patients with preeclampsia that are associated with a decreased corin activity, which results in a lower pro-ANP processing.</p>
<p>Remarkably, the authors also showed that ANP is able to markedly stimulate human trophoblasts to invade matrigels in vitro. Thus, altogether, the findings by Cui et al clearly indicate that corin and ANP play an essential role in the physiological changes that take place at the maternal–fetal interface. Additionally, they suggest that corin abnormalities may present a previously unrecognized underlying cause of preeclampsia, opening doors to the development of new methods to diagnose and treat pregnancy-induced hypertension.</p>

<title>Copy number Variations Impact Cancer Susceptibility</title>
<p>Copy number variations, or CNVs for short, are a class of human germ line polymorphisms present in both coding and noncoding regions of the genome, which have recently emerged as being associated with several types of diseases.</p>
<p>Given the strong inheritability of prostate cancer, Demichelis et al decided to determine whether CNVs could also be associated with this type of cancer. Their study, which has just been published in the <italic>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences</italic> (<italic>PNAS</italic>, published ahead of print, April 2012) led to remarkable findings.</p>
<p>The authors started out by querying low-frequency biallelic CNVs from more than 1900 men of caucasian origin that were enrolled in the Tyrol Prostate-Specific Antigen Screening Cohort and were able to identify 2 CNVs strongly associated with prostate cancer risk.</p>
<p>One of the CNVs mapped to a noncoding enhancer element on 15q21.3, which contains multiple activator protein 1 (AP-1) transcription factor binding sites and seems to have direct cis-interactions with distant genes, by chromosome conformation capture (Hi-C) data. This CNV was associated with a 2.8-fold increased risk of developing prostate cancer and showed a strong association with increased prostate cancer aggressiveness.</p>
<p>The second risk locus, which showed a 4.8-fold increased risk of developing prostate cancer, mapped to <italic>MGAT4C</italic> on 12q21.31. In vitro cell line assays showed the gene to significantly modulate cell proliferation and migration in benign and malignant cells. In addition, <italic>MGA54C</italic> was greatly overexpressed in metastatic prostate cancer as compared to localized prostate cancer.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Demichelis and colleagues replicated these 2 risk associations in an independent cohort of 800 men screened by prostate-specific antigen (PSA) and were able to confirm their statistically significant association with prostate cancer.</p>
<p>Altogether, the findings by Demichelis et al indicate that both the coding and noncoding germ line CNVs identified present a significant risk factor for prostate cancer susceptibility and suggest that they are likely to have a role in disease development and progression. Therefore, the loci identified by Demichelis and colleagues are good candidates for the design of new screening methodologies and to the development of new treatment strategies for prostate cancer.</p>
<p>Moreover, the study illustrates the importance of the previously known desert areas of the genome and the impact these have on the modulation of the transcriptome machinery of known oncogenic pathways in prostate cancer and possibly in other types of cancer.</p>
