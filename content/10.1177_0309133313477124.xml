<p>This progress report on the discipline of fluvial geomorphology for the calendar years 2010–2011 extends the analysis carried out by Stott (2010, 2011) of papers published in <italic>Earth Surface Processes and Landforms </italic>(<italic>ESPL</italic>) during the calendar years 2006–2007 and 2008–2009 to include the period of 2010–2011. A total of 327 papers were published in the 30 issues of <italic>ESPL</italic> during the review period, up from 284 during 2006–2007 and 300 in 2008–2009. Of these papers, 175 (54%) were within the subject area of fluvial geomorphology, compared to 125 out of 284 (44%) in the 2006–2007 period, and 113 out of 297 (38%) in the 2008–2009 period. In comparing the three two-year periods covering 2006–2011, the numbers of papers in each of 10 subdisciplines within fluvial geomorphology (e.g. bank erosion, hydraulics, soil erosion) changed markedly. For example, river management, restoration and the effects of vegetation on fluvial systems changed from first in rank in 2006–2007 to tied in fourth place in 2008–2009 and eighth in 2010–2011. In contrast, the subdiscipline of soil erosion was consistently the second-ranked topic in each of the three two-year periods. Following the analysis of patterns of publications in <italic>ESPL</italic>, selected papers from each of the 10 subdisciplines are reviewed. The articles discussed were selected by searching using keywords from the 10 subdisciplines using http://scholar.google.co.uk, then selecting a relevant journal article from the first 10 hits returned. In this way, 33 papers drawn from 22 journals were sampled and their key findings are summarized.</p>

<title>I Introduction</title>
<p>This progress report continues the theme of the previous reports in this series (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0309133313477124">Stott, 2010</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0309133313477124">2011</xref>) by: (1) repeating the analysis on <italic>Earth Surface Processes and Landforms </italic>(<italic>ESPL</italic>) which was performed in the last two reviews in this series, in order to make comparisons with the 2006–2007 and the 2008–2009 two-year periods and to assess whether there were changes in the direction of research in fluvial geomorphology; and (2) reviewing 33 papers selected from 22 different journals which publish papers with a fluvial geomorphological focus.</p>
<p>In order to give an overall impression of the ‘popularity’ of 10 research themes or subdisciplines within the subject, all papers in 30 issues (2010–2011) of <italic>ESPL</italic> were examined and the research theme of each paper categorized. Of the 327 papers published in <italic>ESPL</italic> during this period (up from 284 in the 2006–2007 review period and 297 in the 2008–2009 period), 175 (54%) were classed by the author as sitting within the subject area of fluvial geomorphology. This contrasts with 125 fluvial geomorphology papers out of 284 (44%) and 113 out of 297 (38%) published in <italic>ESPL</italic> during the periods 2006–2007 and 2008–2009, respectively. Therefore the proportion of fluvial papers in <italic>ESPL</italic> appears to have risen in the 2010–2011 period. In the interest of consistency, landslides and debris flows continue to be included in this topic, although arguably they could have been excluded. Other disciplines represented by papers in <italic>ESPL</italic> were: weathering, tectonics, arid environments, glacial and periglacial processes, and coastal environments.</p>
<p>From the 175 fluvial papers in <italic>ESPL</italic>, the 10 themes used by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0309133313477124">Stott (2010</xref>) in the 2006–2007 and 2008–2009 reviews were retained in order to be able to make a comparison over the three two-year periods. The numbers of papers in each of the 10 themes in the three review periods is presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0309133313477124">Figure 1</xref>.</p>

<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0309133313477124">Table 1</xref> compares the rank orders of the categories for the 2006–2007, 2008–2009 and 2010–2011 review periods. The number of papers in the fluvial sediment transport subdiscipline more than doubled over the six-year period, and papers on advances in methodology more than tripled. These two themes were respectively ranked in first place and tied for second place in 2010–2011, having risen from 4th and 8th ranks, respectively, in the 2006–2007 period. In contrast, papers on river management, restoration and effects of vegetation decreased to only a third of 2006–2007 levels, and the theme’s rank relative to others dropped from 1 to 8, out of 10. It appears that the foci of these 10 themes in <italic>ESPL</italic> (and by assumption the broad discipline) have been quite dynamic over the last six years, suggesting that an analysis over a longer time period (e.g. since the journal started) might prove interesting in terms of how the discipline of fluvial geomorphology has changed over time.</p>

<p>However, meaningful direct comparisons in periods as short as these may be biased by the publication of three special issues in the 2006–2007 and 2008–2009 two-year periods, whereas in the 2010–2011 period additional virtual special or themed issues were published which were not included in the 2010–2011 analysis, but are cited in the following review. In the 2006–2007 period, <italic>ESPL </italic>special issue themes were: ‘The Use of Vegetation for Erosion Control and Environmental Protection’ (volume 35(1), April 2006); ‘Wood in World Rivers’ (volume 32(7), July 2007); and ‘Multi-Scale Characterization and Evolution of Channel Forms in Gravel-bed Rivers’ (volume 32(11), October 2007). The two special issues during the 2006–2007 period that were concerned specifically with the themes of wood and vegetation, and the third on the evolution of river channel forms, may help to explain both the greater number of fluvial papers in the 2006–2007 review period, and why during the same period the rank of the river management, restoration and effects of vegetation on fluvial systems category was so high, but then dropped to a tied fourth place in 2008–2009 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0309133313477124">Table 1</xref>). In the 2008–2009 review period, <italic>ESPL</italic> special issues were on: ‘Ice Sheets’ (volume 33(4), April 2008); ‘Geomorphology and Earth System Science’ (volume 33(9), August 2008); and ‘Aeolian Processes’ (volume 33(11), October 2008), which likely explains the drop in fluvial themed papers from 44% in the 2006–2007 period to 38% in the 2008–2009 period. In the 2010–2011 period, virtual themed issues included: ‘Distance, Time and Scale in Soil Erosion’; ‘New Developments in Process Understanding and Modelling in Geomorphology’; ‘Remote Sensing of Rivers’; and ‘River Meander Dynamics’. Even though fluvial papers have been published in these themed issues, excluding them from the analysis shows that the proportion of fluvial papers in <italic>ESPL</italic> has still shown a general increase from 44% (125/284) in 2006–2007, with a slight drop to 38% (113/297) in 2008–2009 and a large increase to 54% (175/327) in 2010–2011.</p>
<p>A review of 33 key papers in each of the 10 themes now follows in order of their 2010–2011 ranking in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0309133313477124">Table 1</xref>. In contrast to previous progress reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0309133313477124">Stott, 2010</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0309133313477124">2011</xref>) which were focused on papers published in <italic>ESPL</italic>, the papers discussed here were drawn from 22 different journals. The papers chosen for review were selected by searching for the keywords of the subdiscipline (e.g. bank erosion, hydraulics, soil erosion) using http://scholar.google.co.uk, then selecting a journal article from the first 10 hits returned. Since Google Scholar ranks articles by numbers of citations to that article, the articles selected for discussion here were implicitly among those that are the most cited within the categories of the search.</p>

<title>II Fluvial sediment transport</title>
<p>Examples of the kind of progress being made in the area of fluvial sediment transport include the work of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0309133313477124">Gob et al. (2010</xref>) who used lichenometry to examine the influence of sediment size, relative grain size and channel slope on initiation of sediment motion in boulder bed rivers, finding that both hiding and protrusion effects, as well as channel slope, are important factors in sediment transport. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0309133313477124">Haritashya et al. (2010</xref>) examined particle size characteristics of suspended sediment transported in meltwater from the Gangotri Glacier, central Himalaya, over seven consecutive melt seasons, and showed that the evolution of meltwater pathways indicated a progressively better interconnected drainage system with advancing melt season, but also demonstrated complex behaviour of the glacial system, emphasizing the need for a better understanding of sediment availability and contribution. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0309133313477124">Wulf et al. (2010</xref>) analysed daily precipitation data (1998–2007) of 80 weather stations from the northwestern Himalaya in order to decipher temporal and spatial moisture gradients. The two most prominent five-day-long erosional events accounted for 50% of the total five-year suspended sediment flux and coincided with synoptic-scale monsoonal rainstorms, emphasizing the erosional impact of the Indian summer monsoon as the main driving force for erosion processes in the orogenic interior, despite more precipitation falling during the winter season. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0309133313477124">Uncles and Stephens (2010</xref>) examined turbidity and sediment transport in the muddy Tavi Estuary, a sub-estuary (tidal creek) of the Tamar Estuary, UK, where tributary inflows, winds and tides controlled suspended particulate matter transport. In China, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0309133313477124">Yang et al. (2011</xref>) used 50 years of hydrologic and bathymetric data to show that construction of approximately 50,000 dams throughout the Yangtze River watershed, particularly the 2003 closing of the Three Gorges Dam, has resulted in downstream channel erosion, coarsening of bottom sediment, and erosion of the Yangtze’s subaqueous delta. The downstream channel from Three Gorges Dam changed from an accretion rate of ∼90 Mt/yr (1 Mt = 1000 000 t) between the mid-1950s and mid-1980s to an erosion rate of ∼60 Mt/yr after the closing of the Three Gorges Dam. The delta front has changed from ∼125 Mm<sup>3</sup>/yr (1 Mm<sup>3 </sup>= 1000 000 m<sup>3</sup>) of sediment accumulation in the 1960s and 1970s, when river sediment load exceeded 450 Mt/yr, to perhaps 100 Mm<sup>3</sup>/yr of erosion in recent years. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0309133313477124">López-Tarazón et al. (2010</xref>) examined relations between rainfall, runoff and suspended sediment transport in the Isábena basin during 34 floods and found that most sediment load was concentrated in spring when competent floods occur frequently. The non-linear hydrosedimentary response was reflected in the wide range of runoff coefficients and sediment loads that were observed in response to similar amounts of precipitation.</p>

<title>III Soil erosion and control</title>
<p>In December 2010, <italic>ESPL</italic> published a virtual themed issue on ‘Distance, Time and Scale in Soil Erosion Processes’, edited by M.J. Kirkby. This special issue drew together contrasting interpretations of soil erosion and attempted to show where these overlap or diverge, thus suggesting where soil erosion research needs to develop over the next decade. In the journal <italic>Geomorphology</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0309133313477124">Cerdan et al. (2010</xref>) compiled an extensive database from the literature of short- to medium-term erosion rates as measured on erosion plots in Europe under natural rainfall. Statistical analysis confirmed the dominant influence of land use and cover on soil erosion rates, and showed that high erosion rates occurred in areas dominated by vineyards, the hilly loess areas in west and central Europe and the agricultural areas located in the piedmont areas of the major European mountain ranges. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0309133313477124">García-Ruiz (2010</xref>) reported on how soil erosion is a key factor in Mediterranean environments, and is closely related not only to geo-ecological factors (lithology, topography and climatology) but also to land-use and plant-cover changes. The trend towards larger fields and farms in both dry farming and irrigated systems has resulted in a relaxation of soil conservation practices. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0309133313477124">Quinton et al. (2010</xref>) examined the impact of agricultural soil erosion on biogeochemical cycling and found that soil erosion can result in lateral fluxes of nitrogen and phosphorus that are similar in magnitude to those induced by fertilizer application and crop removal, and translocation and burial of soil reduces decomposition of soil organic carbon, and could lead to long-term carbon storage. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0309133313477124">Meusburger et al. (2010</xref>) evaluated the usefulness of QuickBird-derived vegetation parameters in soil erosion models for alpine sites. These they compared to Cesium-137 (Cs-137) derived soil erosion estimates and concluded that field measurements of Cs-137 confirmed the improvement of soil erosion estimates using the satellite-derived vegetation data.</p>

<sec id="section4-0309133313477124">
<title>IV Advances in methodology in fluvial geomorphology</title>
<p>In December 2010, <italic>ESPL</italic> published another virtual themed issue on ‘New Developments in Process Understanding and Modelling in Geomorphology’, edited by D. Lawler and M. Fairchild, comprising a selection of 10 papers from leading researchers in geomorphological processes who presented their work at the British Geomorphological Society annual general meeting in Birmingham, UK, in July 2007. This special issue demonstrated how geomorphology, as a mature discipline, is critically dependent upon technical innovation as a means of reinvigorating the field by generating new questions. Drawing upon state-of-the-art examples from modelling, dating and process measurement, the special issue shows how geomorphology remains a discipline where there is still much not understood and that new techniques are critical for future growth.</p>
<p>In May 2011, <italic>ESPL</italic> published a third virtual themed issue in the review period, this time on ‘Remote Sensing of Rivers’, edited by W.A. Marcus and M.A. Fonstad, comprising 12 articles covering a broad spectrum of applications that used a variety of platforms and sensors, ranging from photogrammetric mapping of riffle-pool morphology beneath forest canopy using a camera mounted on a hand-held pole, to satellite-based synthetic radar mapping of subcontinental-scale hydrology of large rivers. Remote sensing of rivers is clearly emerging as a new subdiscipline in the river sciences, and has grown at a rapid rate in recent years because of: (1) the growing need for data to document and explore the full range of spatial and temporal variations in river systems; (2) evolving technologies that enable lower-cost data acquisition, processing and analysis at reach to catchment to continental scales; and (3) the increasing engagement of river scientists with geographic information science (GISc). The convergence of these factors and the ever-growing number of practitioners speaks to the need for more communication among researchers. The growing use of remote data capture in fluvial geomorphology is evident in this review period with, for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0309133313477124">Smith et al. (2011</xref>) who used terrestrial laser scanning to examine soil surface roughness and overland flow hydraulics, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0309133313477124">Alho et al. (2011</xref>) who demonstrated how terrestrial laser scanning and mobile laser scanning from boats allowed 3D mapping of fluvial landforms on a centimetre scale in the context of change detection of point bars. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0309133313477124">Alho et al. (2011</xref>) concluded that digital panoramic imaging technology enables the integrated use of laser scanning data and panoramic images, further increasing the information content of 3D models in a riverine environment. In another novel application, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0309133313477124">Rothwell et al. (2010</xref>) modelled suspended sediment lead concentrations in contaminated Peak District (UK) peatland catchments using digital terrain analysis.</p>

<sec id="section5-0309133313477124">
<title>V Fluvial hydraulics</title>
<p>In July 2011, <italic>ESPL</italic> published a fourth virtual special issue on ‘River Meander Dynamics’, edited by J.M. Hooke, E. Gautier and G. Zolezzi, featuring a selection of the best papers arising from the Symposium on River Meander Dynamics held at the European Geosciences Union (EGU) Congress in 2008. The aim was to bring together current research on river meandering, particularly examples embracing different approaches, including those of the large and growing modelling community, as well as those more traditionally empirically based. In the journal <italic>Geomorphology</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0309133313477124">Black et al. (2010</xref>) reported on their use of short-lived fallout radionuclides to date fluvial surfaces with the goal of determining lateral migration rates. Variations in radionuclide concentrations along transects provided details of channel migration histories not evident from the limited available aerial photographs, including evidence for both nearly constant linear and episodic channel migrations. Results suggest the broad applicability and added value of the radionuclide approach for quantifying decadal-scale variations in fluvial surface ages. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0309133313477124">Carling et al. (2010</xref>) used unsteady 1D and 2D hydraulic models to simulate one of the largest known floods, which occurred during the Late Quaternary and emanated from glacial lake Kuray–Chuja, formed by a 600 m high ice dam converging in the Chuja River valley of the Altai Mountains in southern Siberia. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0309133313477124">Gessese et al. (2011</xref>) presented a new one-step approach for reconstructing the river bed topography from known free surface data. The proposed methodology was successfully tested on a range of benchmark problems for noisy and noiseless free surface data, and it was found that this solution created very little amplification of noise.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0309133313477124">
<title>VI Gullying, hillslope sediment transfer and landslides</title>
<p>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0309133313477124">Pelletier et al. (2011</xref>) used optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) to date gullies at five sites in the upper Tsangpo Valley on the southeastern Tibetan Plateau. OSL dates constrain the initiation of gullying to be mid- to late Holocene in age, a period which coincides with the onset of pastoralism in the upper Tsangpo Valley. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0309133313477124">Crozier (2010</xref>) published a useful review concerned with deciphering the effect of climate change on landslide activity. The paper examines the theoretical and empirical underpinnings of the assertion that landslide activity is a commonly expected result of human-induced climate change (see, for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0309133313477124">Stoffel and Huggel, 2012</xref>). While there is a strong theoretical basis for increased landslide activity as a result of predicted climate change, there remains a high level of uncertainty resulting from the error inherent in global climate predictions, and the lack of sufficient spatial resolution of currently available downscaled projections.</p>

<title>VII Modelling the fluvial environment</title>
<p>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0309133313477124">Motta et al. (2011</xref>) developed a simplified 2D model for calculating meander migration with physically based bank evolution. Their paper showed that the improved physically based method of bank retreat is required to capture the complex long-term migration patterns of natural channels, which cannot merely be predicted from hydrodynamics alone. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0309133313477124">Valla et al. (2010</xref>) used digital elevation models, topographic maps and field reconnaissance to identify and characterize 30 tributary hanging valleys incised by gorges near their confluence with trunk streams in the Romanche watershed, French Western Alps. Numerical modelling was used to test the capacity of different fluvial incision models to predict the inferred evolution of the gorges.</p>

<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0309133313477124">Kleinhans (2010</xref>), in this journal, offered a useful review of research on river channel patterns, explaining how the pattern/planform is self-organized through feedbacks between bars, channels, floodplain and vegetation, and emerges as a result of the basic spatial sorting process of wash load sediment and bed sediment. The balance between floodplain formation and destruction determines the width and pattern of channels. However, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0309133313477124">Kleinhans (2010</xref>) observes that so far we have been unable to obtain dynamic meandering in laboratory experiments and in physics-based models that can also produce braiding, a limitation that highlights our lack of understanding of what causes the different river patterns. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0309133313477124">Kemp (2010</xref>) investigated downstream trends in flow, channel morphology and sediments over 220 km of the middle and upper alluvial Lachlan River in southeastern Australia. Mean and peak flows, channel size and bed particle size all diminished in a downstream direction, and the development of a full anabranching pattern was associated with large flood volume losses.</p>

<title>IX River management, restoration and effects of vegetation on fluvial systems</title>
<p>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0309133313477124">Newson (2010</xref>) reported on the need for scale-sensitive measures and mechanisms to secure effective solutions for river management and conservation. He explained that instead of blanket ‘remedies’ more practical use is needed of process evidence from hydrology and fluvial geomorphology. This tends to suggest that ‘hot-spots’ dominate risks and impacts of factors such as leaching, surface flow generation and silt entrainment. The European Union’s Water Framework Directive (WFD) encourages ‘joined-up thinking’ on this issue, but Newson argues that it remains to be seen whether spatial scales, structures and concepts already embedded in the WFD and the relevant UK national policies for land use and nature conservation can be exploited to permit the much-needed practical uptake of this new riparianism.</p>
<p>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0309133313477124">Richter (2010</xref>) explained how attempts to implement environmental flows have encountered many obstacles and offered a definition of sustainable water management that explicitly recognizes the fact that society derives substantial benefits both from out-of-stream extractions of water as well as by maintaining adequate flows of water within freshwater ecosystems. To help facilitate sustainable water management, a ‘Sustainability Boundary Approach’ is described for use in setting quantitative water management goals. When the cumulative hydrologic impacts of water and land uses are managed within these sustainability boundaries, the full array of values associated with water can be more fully realized.</p>
<p>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0309133313477124">Rice et al. (2010</xref>) noted that one ‘2020 vision’ for fluvial geomorphology is that it sits alongside stream ecology and hydraulic engineering as a key element of an integrated, interdisciplinary river science. As a contribution to the dialogue between geomorphologists, ecologists and engineers, the authors examine the benefits and challenges of using physical experimentation in flume laboratories to ask interdisciplinary questions. Using two examples from flume experiments, the authors conclude that the interdisciplinary approach was of substantial mutual benefit and led to greater insights than discipline-specific work would have produced. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0309133313477124">Sear et al. (2010</xref>) explored the role of logjams as important agents of channel-floodplain interaction, drawing on a specific case study as well as examples from the literature to show that, although the processes of interaction differ, the resulting dynamic floodplain patchwork is a common feature of rivers with logjams. In China, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0309133313477124">Song et al. (2010</xref>) reported on the emerging water crisis, analysing the deficiencies of the Integrated River Basin Management framework and related policies, and explored alternatives focusing on river basins, recommending, in particular, that the roles, power and responsibilities of the River Basin Commissions should be legally strengthened. This paper highlights the importance of river management at all levels to the wellbeing and sustainability of human society.</p>

<title>X Fluvial chronology</title>
<p>In the subdiscipline of fluvial chronology, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0309133313477124">Astrade et al. (2011</xref>) examined the historical evolution of mid-altitude fluvial systems in the Western Alps and Cévennes (SE Massif Central) in the context of marked climate and anthropogenic change at the end of the Little Ice Age (late 19th century). The authors combined two approaches: the study of historical archives and the use of bioindicators (the dating of terraces using dendrochronology and of silt benches using lichenometry in order to reconstruct the evolution of the river channels). The results highlight the effect of climate (small hydroclimatic fluctuations), amplified by strong anthropogenic impacts, on the rhythm of landscape change and on the relative stabilization of the landscape at the end of the 19th century. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0309133313477124">Chiverrell et al. (2011</xref>) presented a critical analysis of cumulative probability functions of radiocarbon age determinations before suggesting alternative approaches to analysing radiocarbon geochronologies of geomorphic events, which included: (1) Bayesian age modelling of river terrace development; (2) developing regional databases that test specific geomorphic hypotheses; (3) Bayesian age modelling of palaeoflood records; and (4) analysis of sedimentation rates. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0309133313477124">Lespez et al. (2011</xref>) investigated alluvial records of the Yamé River, in the Bandiagara Plateau, Dogon Country, Mali (particularly in the 1 km long Ounjougou reach where Holocene floodplain pockets are inset in the Pleistocene formation), via geomorphologic fieldwork and sedimentologic and micromorphologic analyses, supported by 79 radiocarbon dates. Four major periods are characterized by incision – I1 (ante 11,500); I2 (8760–7800); I3 (6790–6500 cal. BP); I4 (2400–1700 cal. BP) – pointing to dramatic changes in fluvial style. Rapid incision results from high-energy flood flows during dry spells and the study confirms the capacity of the floodplain pocket in the upstream reach of the Sahelian belt to record rapid Holocene climatic change.</p>
<p>In Japan, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0309133313477124">Ishimura and Kakiuchi (2011</xref>) used cryptotephra analysis to identify invisible tephra horizons in aeolian deposits covering fluvial terrace deposits in the Takashima, Sekigahara and Inabe regions, from which they were able to estimate uplift rates of the Kamidera and Kuwana faults.</p>

<title>XI Bank erosion in fluvial systems</title>
<p>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0309133313477124">Pizzuto et al. (2010</xref>) used field data including 2.5 years of bank profile surveys, measurements of tree morphology and ground-based laser scanner surveys repeated biannually to document spatial and temporal patterns describing the retreat of gently curving bends with forested riparian zones containing a mix of very large and smaller trees, cohesive banks and slow rates of migration (∼0.1 m/yr). Large erosion events, many associated with trees toppling into the river, greatly increase the variance of time-averaged rates of bank erosion, and the authors concluded that almost four years of monitoring would be needed to measure time-averaged rates of erosion to an accuracy of within 10%. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0309133313477124">Fox and Wilson (2010</xref>) conducted a review of the mechanisms and importance of subsurface flow processes in erosion associated with hillslopes and stream banks and concluded that further research advances are necessary, especially on the complexity of the interactive effects of surface flow, seepage, pipe flow and vegetation on soil erosion properties.</p>

<title>XII Conclusions</title>
<p>This progress report reviewed 33 papers published during the calendar years of 2010 and 2011, sampled from 22 different journals. As in previous progress reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0309133313477124">Stott, 2010</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0309133313477124">2011</xref>), papers were grouped into 10 themes which were (in order of number contributing to the total): fluvial sediment transport; soil erosion and control/advances in methodology in fluvial geomorphology; fluvial hydraulics; gully and hillslope sediment transfer; modelling the fluvial environment; river regulation, channel change and human influences; river management, restoration and effects of vegetation on fluvial systems; fluvial chronology; and bank erosion in fluvial systems. In addition, the number of fluvial geomorphology papers published in <italic>ESPL</italic> in 2010–1011 was compared with the 2006–2007 and 2008–2009 periods. The proportion of fluvial geomorphology papers in the <italic>ESPL </italic>analysis for 2010–2011 review period increased to 54%, up from 44% from 2006–2007. Surprisingly large variations in numbers of papers published in <italic>ESPL</italic> in the different subdisciplines within fluvial geomorphology were observed over the three two-year periods between 2006 and 2011. For example, river management, restoration and the effects of vegetation on fluvial systems changed from first in rank in 2006–2007 to tied in fourth place in 2008–2009 and eighth in 2010–2011. In contrast, the subdiscipline of soil erosion was consistently the second-ranked topic in each of the three two-year periods. Some of this variability could be attributed to a number of special issues in <italic>ESPL</italic>.</p>
