<abstract>
<p>The Western hemisphere is experiencing a multidimensional system of US domination sustained through asymmetrical alliances of the economic, political, and military kind. That system of domination has fallen into crisis and is being challenged by a multifaceted resistance of popular, democratic, reformist, and revolutionary forces. Attempts to preserve the hegemonic ‘Pan-American Order’ gave rise to a ‘surge’ that is analyzed in this article. This hegemonic design has been confronted with new and alternative kinds of regional integration initiatives, spearheaded by the revolutionary states and to some extent assimilated by reformist governments. In this dynamic context, a futurist analysis of the region’s short-term prospects suggests that the challenge of building unity around revolutionary and reform processes represents the best hope for cracking US hegemony over the Americas.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>This article explores the most probable scenario of the present ‘crisis, understood as change’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0896920511419906">Gandásegui, 2007</xref>: 16) being experienced by the multifaceted system of US domination over the Americas, that is, a hemispheric hegemony backed by armed force. Without denying the contradictions afflicting it, this system remains cemented in place through asymmetrical alliances, imposed by powerful groups, de facto powers, and successive political administrations of a multidimensional US power structure in collaboration with their counterparts in Canada and most Latin American and Caribbean states.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0896920511419906">1</xref></sup> Despite the fact that they may be wearing out, an expression of these active alliances can be found in the diverse political–military institutions that compose the Inter-American System and their interactions with the various Summits of the Americas that have been taking place since 1994.</p>
<p>Rather than assume a deterministic or a voluntaristic stance, this article instead works from the critical school of ‘futurology’, a discipline whose diverse contributors view the future as ‘more constructible than predictable’. The future is therefore ‘neither fixed to one scenario nor is it linear’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0896920511419906">2</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0896920511419906">Mojica, 2000</xref>: 120), but on the contrary rests upon several alternative scenarios, none of which are predetermined but whose outcome instead depends on the results of ‘proactive actions’ of ‘collective actors’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0896920511419906">3</xref></sup> In some schools of sociological thought, these are identified with social and class struggles, while in others they are seen as collective movement ‘social behaviors’.</p>
<p>Consequently, the future is seen as a battlefield (often violent) between social and political, state and non-state, internal and external actors, who ‘struggle to impose their power so as to defend their interests’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0896920511419906">Mojica, 2000</xref>: 117). In this sense, futurology presupposes a commitment to action and change, implying a will to construct a future rather than merely accept it. This signifies weighing the objective and subjective factors present in any reactionary, conservative, reformist, reforming or revolutionary process. In the latter two cases, it means examining the subjective factors that are objectivated in the various contending subjects and social ‘actors’. This is something which Xavier <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0896920511419906">Gorostiaga (2000)</xref> linked to the organization of the hope that it is possible and necessary to construct a better society and a world founded upon an ethical basis, driven by a commitment to create a future citizenship that values the excluded.</p>
<p>From these suppositions, the scenario I put forward focuses on the near short term. Prior to December 2012, it is possible that political changes will come to the governments of Canada and the United States, as well as to those of Argentina, Brazil, the Commonwealth of the Bahamas, Cuba, Guatemala, Haiti, Jamaica, Mexico, Nicaragua, Peru, the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela, the Co-operative Republic of Guyana, the Dominican Republic, Saint Lucia, and Saint Vincent and the Grenadines. This period therefore includes several socio-political and electoral events that will unfold in some of the Latin American States (Argentina, Brazil, Cuba, Nicaragua, and Venezuela) whose current authorities have favored various reformist, reforming or revolutionary processes, together with governments of a similar character in Bolivia, Brazil, Ecuador, El Salvador, Uruguay, and Paraguay, whose corresponding presidential elections are scheduled in 2013 or later.</p>
<p>For their part, members of the so-called ‘old’ and ‘new’ social, political, and intellectual Left have been protagonists in all of the just-mentioned Latin American governments, as well as in some states of the insular and continental Caribbean. Since the 1990s, these leftist forces have contributed in varying degrees of depth and consistency to mounting a multifaceted resistance. We denote this latest phase of US hegemony in the Americas as the ‘new Pan-American Order’, something that diverse concentrations of power have tried to impose in collaboration with the Canadian government and several of the national governments south of the Rio Grande and Florida.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-0896920511419906">
<title>The Surge of the ‘New Pan-American Order’</title>
<p>The institutionalization of this order (functional for the intent of the US ruling classes to ‘manage the world’) has made significant advances in recent years. It has been demonstrated by the subordination of executive administrations in Canada (Paul Martin and Stephen Harper) and Mexico (Vicente Fox and Felipe Calderón) to the Security and Prosperity Partnership of North America (SPP) that was put in place in 2005 by the neo-conservative administration of George W. Bush (2001–9) and backed by the subsequent liberal-democratic administration of Barack Obama.</p>
<p>The second summit of the leaders of the three national governments who initially signed this alliance in March 2006 in Mexico was followed by the powerful ‘Partnership of the Americas’ maneuvers which took place in April 2006, complete with US military forces and those of several NATO countries (Canada included) and the insular Caribbean. This was accompanied by US congressional approval in the same year of a virtual Free Trade Agreement with Haiti and the consent of the second term of René Préval (2006–11) known as the HOPE Act (Haitian Hemispheric Opportunity through Partnership Encouragement). It began with an initial duration of three years and was later extended to 2020.</p>
<p>This extension was preceded by a conference between the American president George W. Bush and the Heads of State of members of the Caribbean Community (CARICOM) held in Washington on 20 June 2007. The diverse agreements consented to at this conference were updated and in some cases expanded at the ‘informal meeting’ held in Barbados on 19 June 2010 by the Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and the chancellors of the 14 independent countries that comprise CARICOM.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0896920511419906">4</xref></sup></p>
<p>In this meeting, the ‘Commitment of Bridgetown: Partnership for Prosperity and Security’ was signed, in which the participants supported all the agreements adopted during the ‘Caribbean–US Security Cooperation Dialogue’ (which also included representatives of the Dominican Republic), held in Washington on 27 May 2010. Among these were the Caribbean–United States Declaration of Principles, the Caribbean–United States Plan of Action on Security Cooperation, and the Joint Caribbean–United States Framework for Security Cooperation Engagement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0896920511419906">CRNM, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>Following the call for a ‘new alliance of the Americas’ sounded during Barack Obama’s electoral campaign (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0896920511419906">Obama, 2008a</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0896920511419906">b</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0896920511419906">2009a</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0896920511419906">b</xref>) came a commitment that included several agreements linked to cooperation and assistance for the reconstruction of Haiti. Among these were agreements to mutual cooperation on energy security, and in several areas linked to global warming and public health. This effectively amounted to transforming Haiti into a US ‘protectorate’ following the humanitarian catastrophe caused by the earthquake of 12 July 2010. Similarly, the extension until 2020 of preferential access of Caribbean products to the US market, included in the so called Caribbean Basin Trade Association Law, was approved by the Obama Administration in April 2010 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0896920511419906">Commitment of Bridgetown, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>As pointed out by Tania <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0896920511419906">García Lorenzo (2006)</xref>, all of the agreements referred to above served to deepen the structural and dynamic dependency of the insular and continental Caribbean, locking it into the service of the geopolitical and geo-economic necessities of the Western hemisphere’s hegemonic power.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0896920511419906">5</xref></sup> This is particularly true since in recent years, the governments of some Caribbean States (Barbados, Jamaica, Trinidad and Tobago) have been in the hands of political forces interested in broadening their political-economic ties with the US and in consolidating a regional security zone – under the aegis of US repressive organs. This was taken up during the 2007 Cricket World Cup and led to the articulation of this ‘common security space’ with the Forward Operating Location of the United States Southern Command (USSOUTHCOM) established in Aruba and Curaçao in 2000 (with the ready consent of the Dutch government), as well as in the Bahamas and Guyana. This presence is in addition to the Naval Bases maintained on Guantanamo Bay in Cuba and on the colonized island archipelago of Puerto Rico.</p>
<p>This signified a ‘triangulated’ presence along with the bases and troops of USNORTHCOM, founded in 2002, and charged with the ‘defense’ of Canada, the United States, Mexico, the Bahamas, Cuba, Virgin Islands, and Puerto Rico. The coasts of these territories are further ‘guarded’ by the US Fourth Fleet, reactivated in 2008 with missions of vigilance and ‘protection’ of the ‘blue waters’ (oceans), ‘green waters’ (shorelines), and ‘brown waters’ (rivers) running from a North to South line through the archipelago of the Bahamas, Cuba and other states of the insular Caribbean, as well as Venezuela, Guyana, Surinam, Cayena (French Guiana), Brazil, Uruguay and Argentina.</p>
<p>Something similar has been occurring in Central America whose governments, with decisive US support, decided in 2005 to unify their police and military forces for the purpose of ‘combating terrorism, drug trafficking, organized crime and youth gangs’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0896920511419906">CEG, 2005</xref>). They also eventually signed a free trade agreement with the United States which included the Dominican Republic (DR-CAFTA). Almost two years later, the government of Panama, headed by the social democrat Martín Torrijos (2004–9), signed a Trade Promotion Treaty (TPT) with the US under the George W. Bush Administration and began to reorganize the leadership of the Panamanian repressive forces with aid from the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB).</p>
<p>These and other agreements found an essential continuity of support from the Barack Obama Administration. The project, formerly known as the Plan Puebla Panama (PPP) until it was renamed the ‘Mesoamerica Project’ in 2008, was supported for geo-economic and geopolitical purposes. The same was true of the Mérida Initiative (Mexico and Central America Security Cooperation Initiative) which involved massive funding aimed to fight against ‘organized crime’ in Central America, Haiti, and the Dominican Republic, and above all, the increasingly militarized and bloody ‘war on drug trafficking’ initiated by Mexican president Felipe Calderón (2006–12).</p>
<p>On a parallel track, the Obama Administration supported the June 2009 coup against constitutional president Manuel Zelaya of Honduras and the fraudulent election of the coup-installed president Porfirio Lobo. It also managed to ‘neutralize’ the most radical positions of the Salvadoran government led by Mauricio Funes (2010–14) of the Farabundo Martí Front for National Liberation (<italic>FMLN</italic>). In February 2010, the US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton met in Guatemala City with the leaders of the host country, El Salvador, Honduras, Costa Rica, and the Dominican Republic and the Prime Minister of Belize.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0896920511419906">6</xref></sup> An agreement known as the Central American Regional Security Initiative (CARSI) was ratified whose details were defined during the visit of the Assistant Secretary of State for Western Hemisphere Affairs, Arturo Valenzuela, to the region three months later.</p>
<p>As a part of CARSI, President Laura Chinchilla (2010–14) of Costa Rica signed an agreement with the American government which extended the already completed ‘modernization’ of the Cooperative Security Center at Liberia Airport (approved by her predecessor, Oscar Arias) and in so doing authorized the arrival of ‘forty-six warships and seven thousand American troops’ with the declared aim to ‘carry out military operations, anti-narcotic missions and alleged humanitarian actions in the region’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0896920511419906">Golinger, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>These ‘facilities’, together with those previously installed in El Salvador and Honduras, also shared a counterpart in Guatemala where the Division of Anti-Narcotics Information and Analysis was set up under US control in Puerto San José and began operations in January 2010. These will be joined by air and police bases slated to be established in Panama as a result of the talks held in late 2009 between Presidents Ricardo Martinelli and Barack Obama. Needless to say, all of this amounted to a threat to the Nicaraguan government headed since 2006 by the leader of the Sandinista National Liberation Front (FSLN) Daniel Ortega. A diverse front of socio-political forces in that country (most of them spurred on by the United States) aimed to prevent his re-election in the general elections of 2011.</p>
<p>Washington’s frustration with the failure to achieve the FTAA had led the Bush Administration not only to the CAFTA-DR agreement but also to seek Free Trade Agreements with Chile, Peru, and Colombia. Congressional approval of an agreement with Panama and Colombia did not prove to be easily forthcoming for the Obama Administration, as it was placed squarely on the White House agenda as the 2012 elections began to loom. All such treaties have favored the increase of trade, investment, and financial flows with the United States and, thereby, greater control by transnational capital over the main sectors of the economies of these countries. At the same time, the various bilateral or multi-lateral ‘security’ agreements have strengthened this control, including the Andean Regional Initiative and Plan Colombia, whose ‘new’ version was negotiated in 2007 between the Bush Administration and former Colombian president Álvaro Uribe (2002–10).</p>
<p>In 2008, the Colombian government was not only intensifying domestic repression but also entering into the Mesoamerica Project mentioned above. In October 2009, then President Uribe signed the Complementary Agreement for Cooperation and Technical Assistance in Defense and Security with the US government. The latter agreement, even as it was temporarily disavowed by the Colombian Constitutional Court, authorized the entry of US armed forces as well as hundreds of ‘contractors’ to use seven military bases and other terrestrial, naval, and aerial premises, civil or military, in different points of the country for at least a decade, including the strategic air base located in Palanquero.</p>
<p>According to a report presented by the US Air Force to the US Congress in 2009, this cooperation agreement granted ‘access to the whole South American continent, save Cape Horn’ and will give ‘a unique opportunity for full wide range operations [espionage and direct military intervention included] in a critical sub-region in our hemisphere, where security and stability are under constant threat from terrorist insurgencies sponsored by drug cartels and anti-American governments, endemic poverty and the frequent natural disasters’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0896920511419906">DFA, 2009</xref>: 3).</p>
<p>This initiative was accompanied by the visit to Brazil, Colombia, Chile, and Peru by the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Admiral Michael Mullen, in mid-2009. During his visit to Peru, the government of both countries ratified agreements linked to the war on ‘drug trafficking’ negotiated earlier in 2006 by President Alan García (2006–11) and George W. Bush. The Bush Administration also built up a growing presence of US security and intelligence apparatus in South American countries and, in particular, in the ‘triple border’ region (Argentina–Brazil–Paraguay).</p>
<p>Following the military agreements signed by Paraguayan president Nicanor Duarte (2003–8), SOUTHCOM had made heavy investments in remodeling the Mariscal Estigarribia air base, ‘in order to have a central role on the logistic supply and movement of US troops in South America’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0896920511419906">Ceceña and Motto, 2005</xref>). With the justification of helping to fight ‘narco-terrorist groups’ active in Paraguay, the current head of SOUTHCOM, General Douglas Fraser, visited Asunción at the end of 2009. This visit was followed by a another meeting in Asunción in January in the following year between Paraguayan president Fernando Lugo (2008–13) and US Assistant Secretary of State for Western Hemisphere Affairs, Arturo Valenzuela. According to the available information, these visits acted in concert with pressures from the Paraguayan armed forces in leading to an incremental increase in the presence of US military advisors and other security agents.</p>
<p>All of these elements taken together have created a strengthened political–military presence that seeks to subordinate the state structures of all the Americas to the strategic, geopolitical, and geo-economic demands of the US state. Moreover, all of the aforementioned ‘free trade’ and ‘security’ agreements are interwoven into different resolutions of the Summits of the Americas and successive OAS General Assemblies. Very specifically, we can cite the so-called Defense Minister Summits, the Meetings of Justice Ministers or other Ministers, Prosecutors or Attorney Generals of the Americas (REMJA), the Meetings of Public Security Ministers of the Americas (MISPA), the establishment of the Inter-American Defense Board (IADB), and the conferences of commanders of the armies, navies, and air forces of its member states, which are still covered by the 1947 Inter-American Mutual Assistance Treaty and ‘by the cooperation’ of the OAS Special Commission of Hemispheric Security.</p>
<p>It is further verified by approval given by the MISPA held in Mexico in 2008 of the ‘Commitment for the Public Security of the Americas’ as well as the agreements of the second MISPA, held in the Dominican Republic in 2010; the participation in the UNITAS Gold-09 maritime military maneuvers, organized by the US Navy in April 2009; and by the presence of military forces of Argentina, Brazil, Canada, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, the Dominican Republic, and Uruguay, as well as, for the first time in history, more than 350 elements of the Mexican Navy. More recently, we can cite the presence of representatives from 16 Latin American and Caribbean countries (Argentina, Belize, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Mexico, Nicaragua, Panama, Paraguay, Peru, Dominican Republic, and Uruguay) as well as Canada in the PANAMAX exercise, organized on 18–26 August 2010 by USSOUTHCOM and the Second Fleet of the US Navy, with the clear aim to ‘improve the capacities of terrestrial, naval, aerial and special forces of the participant nations to respond to the possible threats on the Panama Canal and to plan humanitarian assistance in the case of disaster’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0896920511419906">AFP, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>As has been repeatedly denounced, all of these exercises supposedly aimed at consolidating the US ‘defensive perimeter’ in the Western hemisphere are carried out as a means to control the region’s vast natural resources while dissuading multiple state and non-state resistances. To the extent possible, it seeks to ‘contain’ and if possible roll back the Cuban and Venezuelan Bolivarian revolutions as well as the ongoing ‘democratic and cultural revolution’ in Bolivia, the ‘citizens’ revolution’ in Ecuador and the so-called ‘liberal-Sandinista’ government in Nicaragua.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0896920511419906">
<title>Pushing Back the ‘New Pan-American Order’</title>
<p>In spite of social class and programmatic differences in the design of domestic and foreign policies by the governments of Argentina, Brazil, El Salvador, Uruguay, and Paraguay, each has contributed to slowing the consolidation of the ‘Pan-American Order’. These and other processes point to the incapacity of the military and political diplomacy of the US and its main allies to fully impose their scheme of ‘hemispheric security’. This was dramatically underscored by the ‘metamorphosis’ suffered by the FTAA after its failure to reach approval at the Fourth Summit of the Americas held in Bariloche, Argentina towards the end of 2005.</p>
<p>In addition, we can point to the defeat of US candidates for OAS Secretary General (2006–10) with the election of José Miguel Insulza (ex-chancellor of the former Concertation government of Chile under Michelle Bachelet, prior to the Concertation’s defeat at the polls in March 2010). US designs were further thwarted with the blocking of the ‘collective democratic interventions’ against the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela encouraged by the ‘Venezuelan right’ and the George W. Bush and Barack Obama Administrations. These right wing initiatives were riding on whimsical interpretations of one of the current pillars of the Summits of the Americas and the Inter-American System, the <italic>Carta Democrática</italic> (Democratic Charter) that was unanimously approved by the OAS General Assembly, held in Lima on 10 September 2001.</p>
<p>By reinterpreting the Charter and contravening the policy of embargo and aggression by successive American administrations against Cuba, the Summit of the Group of Concertation and Cooperation Group of Rio de Janeiro (hereinafter the Rio Group) held at the end of 2008 in Salvador da Bahia, Brazil, formalized the permanent incorporation of the Cuban government headed by Raúl Castro (2008–13). Months later, during the Fifth Summit of the Americas in Trinidad and Tobago in April 2009, several member governments demanded that the Obama Administration lift the economic, commercial, and financial blockades against Cuba, as well as the still active ban on Cuban participation in future summits. Although Obama did not accept these demands, with visible resistance as well from US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, the XXXIX OAS General Assembly held in early June of 2009 in San Pedro de Sula, Honduras, made the decision to unconditionally overturn the illegal resolution that since January 1962 has excluded the Cuban government from participating in the political–military organs of the Inter-American System.</p>
<p>Taken together, these agreements along with other elements contributed to the fruitful realization of the First and Second Summits of the Heads of State and Latin American and Caribbean Governments (CALG), respectively held in Brazil (December 2008) and in Mexico (February 2010). Each took place for the first time without the parties being convened by the US government or by the European Union (EU). The latter summit witnessed the founding of the Community of Latin American and Caribbean States (CELAC) whose institutional framework was slated for ratification in the third CALG scheduled for July 2011 in Venezuela.</p>
<p>In this transcendental event of a regional entity convened to counter growing US influence in the region, the consent of the president of Mexico (who was clearly interested in reversing his decreasing domestic legitimacy) was of particular importance. CELAC rode on the assent of all the government leaders and member states of CARICOM, spurred on by the activism displayed by Bolivia, Cuba, Ecuador, Nicaragua, Venezuela, Argentina, Brazil, Uruguay, and to a lesser extent, Paraguay. Previously, the governments of the Southern Cone countries had already favored the incorporation of Venezuela as a full member of the South American Common Market (MERCOSUR) as well as the institutionalization of the Union of South American Nations (UNASUR).</p>
<p>Various problems still have to be resolved for the effective operation of this union, including the ratification of its constitutive treaty by some of the parliaments of the 12 member countries. The same is true of the Bank of the South created by the governments of Argentina, Brazil, Ecuador, Bolivia, Paraguay, Uruguay, and Venezuela. But the level of agreement already achieved together with the ongoing consolidation of the two main regional integration pacts of South America (the Andean Community of Nations and MERCOSUR) all tend to weaken the system of US domination over the Americas.</p>
<p>The progressive institutionalization of UNASUR, and in particular its regional defense council, has been strengthened by the support given by diverse Paraguayan social movements of President Fernando Lugo, by the successful management of successive internal crises that threatened the Argentine government headed by Cristina Fernández, and by the approval via plebiscites of the new constitutions in Bolivia and Ecuador that coincided with the 2009 re-elections of the presidents (Evo Morales and Rafael Correa) of both those countries. It is likewise bolstered by the election of President José Mujíca of the leftist <italic>Frente Amplio-Encuentro Progresista</italic> (FAEP) in Uruguay in December 2009. Despite the loss of some legislative seats, these electoral results reaffirmed the acceptance by most Uruguayans of the foreign and domestic policies pursued by the leftist FAEP administration initiated by former president Tabaré Vázquez (2005–10).</p>
<p>The actions of all these governments, as well as the political stance of the presidents of Brazil and Venezuela have favored the growing political isolation of those governments favorable to Washington, most notably, the governments of Peru and Colombia. Before it left office, the Colombian administration of Álvaro Uribe concluded important military agreements with the US and provocations against Venezuela, accusing it before the OAS of protecting Colombian guerilla forces on its territory. Consequently, the secretary general of UNASUR at the time, former Argentine president Néstor Kirchner, effectively disavowed the OAS and the reiterated accusations from the Obama Administration that the Venezuelan government was a ‘sponsor of terrorism’. Before his unexpected death, Kirchner performed a key role in the conversations between President Hugo Chávez and the newly inaugurated president of Colombia, Juan Manuel Santos. Those talks concluded in August 2010 with various agreements aimed at the normalization of the relations between these neighboring countries. It can be expected in the near future that similar agreements will be reached between the Colombian and Ecuadorian governments. Relations between those countries notably soured after the criminal attack in early 2008 by Colombian and American forces on an unarmed FARC campsite in a jungle zone of Ecuadorian territory. That attack was condemned by the Summit of Rio convened in the Dominican Republic.</p>
<p>All of these incipient expressions of UNASUR coincide more generally with what Immanuel Wallerstein has called the ‘decadence of American power’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0896920511419906">Wallerstein, 2005</xref>); with the ‘ideological-political demise of neoliberalism’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0896920511419906">Borón, 2005</xref>); and with the ever deeper structural crisis that challenges the pretension of successive US administrations of controlling ‘the new world order’. It also coincides with new political phenomena such as the emerging clout of the BRICS countries (Brazil, Russia, India, the People’s Republic of China, and South Africa). Indeed, other countries such as Iran have begun to expand their political and economic relations in Latin America and the Caribbean.</p>
<p>Aside from their diverse etiologies, all of these processes threaten the ‘unipolar’ hegemony of the world’s superpower and make possible, although by no means guarantee, what Lenin called a ‘break in the weak links of the chain of imperialist domination’, at least in certain parts of the world such as in the Americas. Spurred on by the tenacious resistance and the achievements of the Cuban Revolution, several national projects, all anti-capitalist and anti-imperialist in nature, are in ascent and have self-identified with ‘socialism’. At the same time, there has been an upsurge in struggles for new forms of political, economic, and cultural integration within the region that is radically opposed to the ‘neoliberal integration’ fostered by the main imperialist powers. It was precisely the hegemonic, neoliberal designs of ‘integration’ that produced the FTA’s advocated by the US government and the strategic alliances created between the EU and some Latin American governments. The new upsurge of regional integration projects have sought to defeat these designs and at the same time create an alternative to the limitations exhibited by the ‘neo-developmentalist integration’ currently advocated by CARICOM and MERCOSUR.</p>
<p>This dynamic has yielded a growing and deepening institutionalization of what is now called the Bolivarian Alliance for the Peoples of Our America (ALBA) along with the People’s Trade Agreements (TCP). This alternative regional integration framework (ALBA-TCP) has been favored by the progressive consolidation of the governments of Evo Morales and Rafael Correa, by the strong regional ties of solidarity promoted by Venezuela and Cuba, the positive support offered by the Sandinista government of Nicaragua, and by the joining of three governments of Eastern Caribbean countries: Antigua and Barbuda, Dominica, and Saint Vincent and the Grenadines. This motion has been further buoyed by the deepening organized support of social movements, evidenced by the organization of the Council of Social Movements of ALBA-TCP.</p>
<p>The ALBA-TCP alternative has been further advanced by the successive Summits of Heads of States and Governments which since 2005 have allowed for the progressive institutionalization and broadening out of its benefits towards various Central American countries such as PETROCARIBE and the ALBA-Caribbean Fund. These preferential accords have been enjoyed by Guatemala, Nicaragua, and Honduras up until the 2009 coup. None of these decisions were backed by the governments of Trinidad and Tobago or Barbados.</p>
<p>Two years later (on July 2007) the CARICOM governments ratified the creation by 2015 of the Single Market and Economy (CSME) oriented to resolve some of the problems that had been debilitating the development and the integration of this region, its economic self-support, the eradication of poverty and the provision of decent life standards for all its citizens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0896920511419906">Girvan, 2006</xref>). In spite of (or perhaps because of) the incapacity exhibited thus far by the governments of the Caribbean sub-region to fulfill these development aims, there are still various social and political forces, both state and non-state, that are interested in defending the participation of their governments in ALBA-TCP and the ALBA-Caribbean Fund.</p>
<p>The region’s inability to resolve its most pressing development needs has been fueled by the negative impact from the asymmetric Economic Partnership Agreements (EPA) signed in late 2008 with the European Union. These unequal agreements, along with all of the previously existing political establishments, the severe socio-economic effects of the global capitalist crisis and the various commercial and military agreements mentioned earlier in this article, have not proved able to detain growing support for a more progressive regional alternative.</p>
<p>Therefore, the resistance mounted to the ‘new Pan-American Order’ includes the growing activities of the anti-neoliberal, anti-capitalist, anti-imperialist, and alter-globalist social movements that operate across different parts of the Western hemisphere. Some of them are linked to the parties and organizations of the old and new political left in Latin America and the Caribbean, such as those grouped in the Forum of Sao Paulo. The most recent meeting of this forum of leftist political parties was held in Argentina at the end of August 2010. Also important are the diverse actions encouraged by the most active representatives of ‘the intellectual left’ all around the globe, including those in the Defense of Humanity Network. Since its founding in 2003, this ‘network of networks’ has denounced the aggressive strategies pursued by successive US administrations and has expressed its support for social change favorable to the national and popular interests throughout Latin America and the Caribbean, including popular mobilizations against colonial authorities in Guadeloupe, Martinique, and Puerto Rico.</p>
<p>The network has also supported the work of the World Social Forum that held a meeting in Paraguay in August 2010. During its panels, the Forum was punctuated by harsh criticisms of the ‘smart strategies’ (combination of instruments of the so-called <italic>hard-</italic> and <italic>soft</italic>-<italic>power</italic> approaches) towards Latin America and the Caribbean developed by the Obama Administration. Also criticized was the complicity from rightist governments installed in Canada, Mexico, Honduras, Costa Rica, Panama, Colombia, Peru, and Chile, and in some countries of the insular Caribbean. Discussions took place concerning the unpredictable and multidimensional consequences for the hemisphere should one or more armed conflicts break out in the Arabic-Persian Gulf or the Far East. Concern over this possibility has been emphatically expressed by analysts of international affairs, including most notably Fidel Castro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0896920511419906">Castro, F, 2010a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0896920511419906">b</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0896920511419906">c</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0896920511419906">d</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0896920511419906">e</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0896920511419906">
<title>The Most Probable Scenario</title>
<p>After considering the various alternative scenarios that may result, the most probable scenario is that the tendencies and countertendencies referred to earlier in the text will continue. The significant increase in the number of seats held by the representatives and senators of the Republican Party since the November 2010 election results will ‘harden’ the domestic, global, and hemispheric policies pursued by Barack Obama’s Administration. It may also serve to diminish his re-election prospects for a variety of reasons.</p>
<p>Obama’s fostering of pseudo-Keynesian measures as preferred by the political and media power groups that support him have demonstrated their inability to solve the deep crisis that currently affects the US economy. The effects of this crisis on the other two powers of the ‘triad of world power’, Japan and the EU, will be nefarious. The plutocratic social and political forces that control this triad do not have solutions for the contradictory and uneven impacts caused by the deeply structural global crisis on third-world economies, nor can they control the acute ecological, social-economic, political, and ideological-cultural problems that characterize the underdeveloped, dependent capitalism currently prevailing in Latin America and the Caribbean.</p>
<p>This region will continue to provide one of the main sites for predatory activity of the most powerful multinational and transnational corporations, particularly those whose headquarters reside in the US, Canada, and the EU. The governments of this tripartite union will most likely continue pursuing the ‘minimization’ of their states while backing the deformed ‘free market democracies’ currently prevailing throughout the Western hemisphere. The globalized pursuit of profit will enjoy steady support from the political, military, and media representatives of the transnationalized sectors of the US, Canadian, Latin American, and Caribbean ruling classes, as well as support from de facto powers, the bureaucratic–military apparatuses.</p>
<p>There will be a continuing deployment of diverse instruments of hard power (coercion and force), articulating counter-reform, counterrevolutionary, and expansionist actions in the Western hemisphere through blind and unilateral versions of a ‘security state–free trade–representative democracy’ tri-medley. The Obama Administration will continue pursuing a modular multilateralism with those countries in the Americas that it considers ‘democratic’ and cooperative with the war against ‘narco-terrorism’, and this will include those currently governed by what Jorge G. Castañeda calls the ‘modern, democratic, globalized and market-oriented left’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0896920511419906">Castañeda, 2008</xref>: 7).</p>
<p>All of this together with the use of other instruments of <italic>soft-power</italic> (‘public diplomacy’) will be directed at efforts to ‘contain’ and, if possible, depose those Latin American governments who are members of ALBA-TCP (Bolivia, Cuba, Ecuador, Nicaragua, and Venezuela). Attempts will be made to wean away the three participating countries of the Eastern Caribbean as well as to disrupt the efforts at political consensus, economic integration, and cooperation being headed by UNASUR. Likewise, there will be attempts to avert or dilute as much as possible the consolidation of CELAC. This will be bolstered by the presence of rightist governments such as Chile which heads the pro tempore presidency of the Rio Group until 2012 and will do anything possible to prevent the Latin American ‘community’ from reaching agreements that undermine their preferred pillars of the Inter-American System.</p>
<p>Alongside of all these maneuvers, there will be new and multi-leveled social and political conflicts, both internal and external, within most of the 33 independent or semi-independent states and in some of the 18 colonial territories currently located south of Florida and the Rio Grande (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0896920511419906">Suárez Salazar and García Lorenzo, 2008</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0896920511419906">7</xref></sup> In some countries, these conflicts will contribute to the maturation of the subjective conditions needed to challenge the system of domination imposed by the United States. In spite of the differences, contradictions, and internal weaknesses that will not easily change in the short term, the formation of those turbulent conditions will be nourished by the continuation of socialist, anti-imperialist, anti-colonialist, democratic, and popular spirit manifested by the Cuban, Venezuelan, Bolivian, and Ecuadorian revolutions.</p>
<p>Despite the ‘generational transition’ taking place in Cuban society within its political leadership, the popular character of the Cuban state will not be destroyed nor will the legitimacy of the institutions created by the Revolution or the majority popular support it continues to enjoy. This will be evidenced by the emergence of a political consensus that mandates actions be taken to ‘update’ the Cuban economic model. The participation of broad sectors of the citizenry in this process begins with the VI Congress of the Cuban Communist Party in 2011 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0896920511419906">Castro R, 2010a</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0896920511419906">b</xref>) and will continue in the 2012–13 general elections.</p>
<p>Meanwhile in Venezuela, there will likely be significant political-institutional conflicts derived from the increased number of oppositional seats in the National Assembly that resulted from the September 2010 elections, complicating the prospects for the administration of President Hugo Chávez. In any case, the relative majority of the 165 seats in the Venezuelan National Assembly will continue to be held by supporters of the Bolivarian Revolution. This will guarantee ‘democratic governability’ through the presidential elections in 2012 when the Venezuelan United Socialist Party (PSUV) will be well-positioned to win re-election of the current Venezuelan president.</p>
<p>Maintaining electoral power will not permit the Venezuelan government to avoid the exacerbation of domestic social, political, and ideological contradictions in the country nor free it from the multidimensional actions of its adversaries aimed at foiling the domestic and international advances of the Bolivarian revolution. Rather, they will continue and in the end help make even more acute the existing conflicts between the Venezuelan government and other Latin American and Caribbean governments that support the actions of the Obama Administration. Washington will seek to ‘isolate’ the Bolivarian revolution and weaken the various regional instances of political consensus, economic cooperation and integration it has helped sponsor. Among the rightist governments likely to cooperate in that effort figure Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Honduras, Mexico, and Panama.</p>
<p>In Peru, the political representatives of rightist forces, such as the followers of Fujimori, worked hard to attempt to block the change of internal and external policies that had been announced by the new Peruvian President Ollanta Humala (2011–15). Simultaneously, their Nicaraguan peers, supported by successive US administrations, will do anything possible to delegitimize and isolate Daniel Ortega’s government, at least within the sphere of the System of Central American Integration (SICA). Meanwhile, the Obama Administration will work to achieve the international recognition of the coup-installed Honduran government headed by Porfirio Lobo. It will also support a candidate favorable to US interests in the presidential elections in Guatemala in 2011, while attempting to weaken the influence of the FMLN on the current Salvadoran government.</p>
<p>Bolivia and Ecuador, besides trying to solve their conflicts with diverse sectors of the popular movement and in particular with some indigenous organizations, will have to face the constant presence of counter-reform and counterrevolutionary forces. These will include the neo-fascist forces of the Bolivian oppositional provinces as well as the powerful oligarchic groups in Guayaquil that fuel reactionary political, economic, social, and ideological-cultural politics. To help confront these forces, the governments of Evo Morales and Rafael Correa will benefit from the solidarity of the other ALBA-TCP member countries. Both nations will also have the support of most of the governments of UNASUR member states, including President Dilma Rousseff of the Brazilian Worker’s Party (PT). In Argentina, most probable is the re-election of President Cristina Fernández.</p>
<p>This notwithstanding, the difficulties that have been encountered in reforming the ‘neo-developmentalist’ logic of MERCOSUR and in strengthening its supranational institutionality will persist. The Paraguayan right will carry on with its actions directed to ‘constitutionally disable’ President Fernando Lugo and to sabotage the parliamentary ratification required for the full incorporation of Venezuela into MERCOSUR. Moreover, none of the member states will manage to transcend the limits imposed by their domestic policies within the ever more ‘globalized’ financial system, nor modify the way that US and European interested transnationals use MERCOSUR as a complementary part of their global commodity chains, particularly those related to the production of soy and agro-combustibles.</p>
<p>The reflection of standing commitments in the international politics of Argentina, Brazil, Uruguay, and Paraguay will also hinder the deepening of UNASUR commitments. Nevertheless, UNASUR will go on operating by virtue of the interest that most of the 12 member countries have in institutionalizing it. It will have to operate in spite of the contradictions and resistant stances of rightist-led governments, especially Chile and Colombia. The persistence of contradictions among MERCOSUR member states also include conditions imposed upon the governments of Guyana and Suriname, whose foreign policies must remain harmonized with other governments who are members of CARICOM.</p>
<p>The People’s Progressive Party, expected to retain power after the October 2011 elections, and the favorable attitude toward UNASUR held by the Suriname government headed by Desiré Bouterse (2010–14) will continue to mark the major differences which those countries have with other Caribbean governments controlled by the social and political forces interested in strengthening their asymmetric alliances with the US and the EU. Despite their own disputes, these two governments are akin to the CSME, the ALBA-Caribbean agreements, and are for more autonomous development strategies in cooperation with Brazil. Similar stances will continue to prevail in CARICOM in general and should war break out in the Middle East region, the spike in oil prices will simply reinforce this tendency.</p>
<p>From all of this, it follows that the Cuban, Venezuelan, Bolivian, and Ecuadoran revolutions will continue to be the epicenter of the dynamic between the reform, revolution, reformism, counter-reform, and counterrevolution. The Obama Administration and his main allies will continue scheming against the processes of change unfolding in these countries, and they will try to fracture their alliances with the reformist or reforming governments of Brazil and Argentina. At the same time, Washington will try to pry the Eastern Caribbean states away from ALBA-TCP, something that has already begun in Saint Vincent and the Grenadines after the December 2010 elections. The US goal is to weaken all those social and political forces that support the continuity of the ALBA-Caribbean agreements.</p>
<p>In Haiti, Washington will continue to maintain a ‘protectorate’ over the country. Likewise, it will go on boosting the economic-commercial agreements in the field of ‘security’ signed with the governments of Mexico, CARICOM, and with the majority of the Central American countries, along with Colombia, Panama, Peru, and the Dominican Republic. These agreements – and the weakness of the opposing political forces – will favor the election of the candidate of the Partido de la Liberación Dominicana in the presidential elections that will be held in the Dominican Republic in late 2012.</p>
<p>In the interim period, the US government will do anything within its reach to defeat Colombia’s and Mexico’s insurgent organizations through military means and by working with political, media, and military representatives of the Colombian and Mexican ruling classes. Every attempt will be made to neutralize the challenges posed to their domination by the exacerbation of political and social struggles (with certain political–military expressions) in Mexico and, in particular, the frustrated presidential aspirations of Andrés Manuel López Obrador. In a similar vein, Washington will enact diverse actions devised to prevent the maturation of socio-political actors grouped in the National Resistance Front who are in opposition to the illegitimate Honduran coup-installed government headed by Porfirio Lobo, who recently obtain the recognition of the OAS.</p>
<p>The synergy of all these resistances will help prevent the deepening of the ‘new Pan-American Order’. Nevertheless, the social and political, state and non-state forces opposed to this ‘order’ will not be able to reverse all the advances that were earlier obtained and institutionalized during the last decade of the 20th century and the first decade of the 21st century. This includes all those norms that currently regulate the celebration of the Summits of the Americas (next to be hosted by Colombia in 2013), the structure and operations of the Inter-American System, and all of the Treaties that juridically legitimize the ‘security-free market democracy’ binomial.</p>
<p>As is demonstrated by the historical evidence, the only brakes on unbridled fulfillment of these hegemonic objectives will be the diverse struggles and multi-tiered resistances of state and non-state subjects of the Americas. To do this implies establishing global solidarity with alter-globalization sectors across different parts of the world and establishing alliances between the reformist and reforming governments and other powers competing with the US, particularly the BRICS countries.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>As the introduction of this article indicated, the future is far from predetermined. It unfolds in an arena of conflicts where political and social subjects, internal and external, battle one another to defend their power and interests. Each of these ‘actors’ will fight to build a particular desired future. The results of these struggles may produce several alternative scenarios that are impossible to fully describe in the space of this essay.</p>
<p>We can infer that the future of US domination in the Western hemisphere will be subject to multiple (and in some cases, unforeseeable) global, continental, and national occurrences. As has occurred on other occasions, any defeat or collapse of will on the part of the progressive, reforming or revolutionary governments identified in previous pages will likely facilitate a recomposition of this system. This does not mean, however, that the always present contradictions between dominant US groups and diverse Canadian, Latin American, and Caribbean social and political sectors will disappear.</p>
<p>Rather, these contradictions will become even more acute, particularly in the event that any new popular victory occurs which this author was unable to foresee. Be it small or large, it will contribute to an accelerated formation of subjective and objective conditions that the region’s popular movement requires in its search for anti-imperialist and anti-capitalist solutions. In the end, every socio-political process that develops in this hemisphere, regardless of being national in form, has a hemispheric and global scope.</p>
<p>In the years to come, it will furthermore become very difficult for some national or pluri-national states (just as it was for the Cuban socialist transition) to become disconnected from the system and the capitalist world economy. Nevertheless, there is already growing evidence that the unipolarity resulting from the end of the Cold War will be increasingly substituted by a multi-polarity that in turn opens up new opportunities for popular change in the Americas. The ability to build on these opportunities will remain closely linked to the steady erosion of US hegemony and directly proportional to the capacity that regional leaders, organizations, and socio-political movements exhibit to reach and consolidate political–state power. Their success will also rest upon creating comprehensive and integrated development in their corresponding countries. Without reforms or revolutions that shift the deformed bases of the dependent, peripheral, and under-developed capitalism prevalent among the hemisphere’s 33 national-states and 18 colonial territories, there will no genuine and independent integration of our countries.</p>
<p>At the same time, building a stronger unity under the present conditions of great diversity will be very difficult. Without doing so, however, it will be nearly impossible to crack US domination over this hemisphere. In this conditions, we are pointed anew to the words of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0896920511419906">José Martí (1974[1889]</xref>: 22): ‘These are not times for sleeping in a nightcap, but with weapons for a pillow … weapons of the mind, which conquer all others.

<p>In Marxist literature, there has always been a difference between State and Government; from the recognition of its socio-classist nature, the former alludes to that called ‘the bureaucratic–military machinery’ and the different ideological-cultural apparatuses that guarantee the reproduction of the domination system. Government refers to the political representatives of the dominant classes or sectors of them which alternate in place to conduct the domestic and foreign policies of the state. Curiously, this differentiation was retaken by the writers of the famous document Santa Fe I. For them, the state or ‘permanent government’ was integrated by ‘other power groups and factual powers’, while the administrations or ‘temporary governments’ resulted from diverse electoral cycles or other non-democratic changes produced in different countries of the world.</p></fn>

<p>Commonly, the scenarios are classified as probable, alternative, and desirable. The first identifies the prolongation of tendencies and countertendencies of the processes under study; the second refers to other alternatives which the future might present, independently from the degree of probability indicated by the dominant tendencies and countertendencies in a given moment; and the last defines the best options to fulfill the objectives of the ‘subjects of action’ and ‘conscious subjects’ implied in the social dynamic.</p></fn>

<p>The social attitudes concerning changes are usually defined as reactive, preactive, and proactive. The proactive are linked to the actions consciously directed to the construction of the future while the preactive are limited to making preparations for changes, this under the assumption that the changes do not depend on their will. Reactive attitudes refer to confronting situations at the moment they first appear.</p></fn>
