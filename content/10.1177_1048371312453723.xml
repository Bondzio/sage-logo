<p>The policy statement on world music in education released by the International Society for Music Education reflects current thought among many practicing music educators: “We believe that the musics of the world’s cultures, seen individually and as a unit, should play a significant role in the field of music education, broadly defined . . .” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1048371312453723">ISME Panel, 1994</xref>, p. 67). In practice, various expressions of the world’s musics are being included in the curricula of elementary, secondary, and tertiary schools in the United States and across the world. In the public schools in the United States, general music teachers are often in search of more resources to incorporate world music into their music curricula.</p>
<p>Today, access to world music resources such as videos and sound recordings have increased with the advent of YouTube and the efforts of music educators working closely with ethnomusicologists to provide more detailed visual and audio information about various musical practices. This column adds more recent information to Bryan Burton’s fine series of columns for <italic>General Music Today</italic> titled, “Multicultural Resources,” in which he, Ann McFarland, and Ann Clements illuminated some of the best multicultural resources available between 2004 and 2010. Also included are suggestions for using the plethora of Internet resources available to music teachers today.</p>
<p><italic>West African Drum &amp; Dance: A Yankadi-Macrou Celebration</italic> by Kalani and Ryan M. Camara encapsulates a well-rounded curriculum called the “World Rhythm Arts Project” (WRAP). The educational package provides in-depth cultural information, instrumental and technique, and singing and dance instruction through a detailed Teacher’s Edition with 20 developmentally sequenced lesson plans accompanied by a CD, DVD, as well as a student workbook. The materials focus in on the songs, rhythms, and dances of one particular cultural celebration in Guinea. Although the teacher and student books are well organized and user-friendly, the strongest points of this curricular package are the videos. In addition to a full village performance of the final performance product of the <italic>Yankadi-Macrou</italic> celebration, the DVD also has easy-to-navigate tracks that include narrated footage of the every-day life of the people from whom this music and dance originates, drum techniques for each pattern viewed from the vantage point of the drummer, and narrated instruction of the dance steps from both the front and the back view.</p>
<p>The Internet also provides a wide variety of world music resources for to teachers. From recordings, lesson plans, and interactive musical games on the Smithsonian Folkways’ “Tools for Teaching” website<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1048371312453723">1</xref></sup> to the Virtual Javanese Gamelan from the Wells Cathedral School in the United Kingdom,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1048371312453723">2</xref></sup> there is much to choose from. Interactive whiteboard tools such as Xpeditions from National Geographic<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-1048371312453723">3</xref></sup> provides an atlas that can be used on interactive whiteboards can help students explore every region of the world. Snag Learning<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-1048371312453723">4</xref></sup> brings award-winning documentary films (many produced by National Geographic or PBS) to an audience around the world via the Internet (free, but with commercials). If YouTube is accessible at one’s school, students can watch a Mongolian man demonstrate Tuvan throat-singing technique, a traditional Navajo dance practice, or a Japanese elementary school wind ensemble presenting an outstanding championship performance. With this seemingly endless flow of information via technology, how should a general music teacher go about finding high-quality online educational materials for bringing world music to students?</p>
<p>When searching websites for educational tools, teachers can follow the advice of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1048371312453723">Carlos Abril (2006)</xref>, who encourages the consideration of “cultural validity” and maintenance of an awareness of bias when selecting curricular materials. Abril suggests that when searching for multicultural music and materials, key steps include (a) knowing reputable publishers, (b) making sure that the musicians understand the culture and style, (c) finding contextual details about the music, and (d) gathering as much information about how the music is performed. When examining world music on the World Wide Web, this translates to doing some background research on the people who made that YouTube video, website, or online tool under consideration. Where were the videos produced? Is there a transcription of the piece available for performance? What cultural knowledge, musical skills, and creative dexterity will students be gaining from playing a particular on-line game or using an interactive whiteboard activity? If you are unsure of the authenticity of a YouTube video, scrolling down to read the comments below the video and searching for similar videos for comparison can often shed some light on the details of where, when, and how the video was produced. Most important, music educators need to trust their instincts and communicate with others to avoid inadvertently providing incorrect or insufficient information by quickly showing a video clip without researching the cultural validity of the source in advance.</p>
<p>SchoolTube is another resource that teachers may wonder about. Stephanie Cronenberg<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-1048371312453723">5</xref></sup> provides an insightful research-based discussion of access and ethics involved in music learning on SchoolTube. In 2010, she analyzed SchoolTube videos to align them with meeting specific National Standards of Music Education and discovered there was a complete lack of videos that meet Standard 9: “Understanding music in relation to history and culture.” She notes that, “Teachers without access to YouTube are limited to the videos other teachers post on SchoolTube, thus restricting access to the particular musical styles others choose.” SchoolTube is currently not a good resource for general music teachers looking for high-quality world music videos.</p>
<p>There are, however, many high-quality world music resources for general music teachers to use in order to bring the music of the world into the contemporary music classroom, some of which have been highlighted in this column. Today’s music teachers are engaging students in a wide variety of musical experiences by using the many sources available via the Internet in addition to published resources. General music students can virtually travel to locations around the world to view an expert Taiko ensemble performance or a West African drum ensemble on YouTube before learning to play the drums. They can use interactive whiteboard technologies to contextualize a foreign song from the basal series textbook. They can create gamelan music via the computer and share their musical creations with others around the world through the Internet. The possibilities are endless under the guidance of a thoughtful, creative music teacher!</p>
