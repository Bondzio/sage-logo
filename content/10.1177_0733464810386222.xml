<abstract>
<p>This article reports one of the first known studies which examine the association between cognitive factors and older people’s satisfaction with residential care. These factors are conceptually related to but have seldom been examined in institutional care. They include perceived service performance, service expectation, expectancy disconfirmation (operationalized as the difference between service expectation and perceived performance), perceived care need, and care need fulfillment. Face-to-face interviews were conducted with Chinese Hong Kong residents from 11 government-funded long-term care homes randomly and proportionately selected from two strata based on facility size. Finally, 405 residents were successfully interviewed. Path analysis revealed that perceived performance, expectancy disconfirmation, and being female predicted residents’ satisfaction with care. Perceived care need and care need fulfillment exerted an indirect effect on residents’ satisfaction through perceived performance. It is suggested that cognitive factors as perceived by the residents be included as predictors of resident satisfaction in long-term care.</p>

<p>Population aging inevitably leads to an increase in both the absolute number and the percentage of older people who, because of physical and mental impairments, require institutional care. Hong Kong is no exception. In 2009, 13% of its population were aged 65 and above, and this ratio is projected to rise to 25.9% in 2039 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0733464810386222">Census and Statistics Department, 2010</xref>), mainly due to improved longevity. Institutional care has emerged as the major alternate option to home care for older Chinese who require assistance with their daily living (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0733464810386222">Wu, Tang, &amp; Yan, 2004</xref>) due to the rise of the nuclear family and the crowded living environment.</p>
<p>Due to the frailty and vulnerability of the residents, there has always been a great concern about the service quality of the institutions. Increasingly, resident satisfaction with care has been used as an outcome indicator of the quality of long-term care (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0733464810386222">Atherly, Kane, &amp; Smith, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0733464810386222">Chou, Boldy, &amp; Lee, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0733464810386222">Kruzich, Clinton, &amp; Kelber, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0733464810386222">Lee, Lee, &amp; Woo, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0733464810386222">Sikorska, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0733464810386222">Yeh, Sehy, &amp; Lin, 2002</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0733464810386222">Castle, Lowe, Lucas, Robinson, and Crystal (2004)</xref>, for example, found that 86% of nursing homes in New Jersey monitored quality of care with resident satisfaction surveys. This reflects a delightful change from past reservation about the ability of the long-term care residents to give reliable and valid feedbacks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0733464810386222">Chou et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0733464810386222">Ejaz &amp; Castle, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0733464810386222">Straker, Ejaz, McCarthy, &amp; Jones, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>Satisfaction with care is an experience or a response that is associated with the consumption of certain services. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0733464810386222">Oliver (1997)</xref>, “satisfaction is the consumer’s fulfilment response. It is a judgement that a product or service feature, or the product or service itself, provided (or is providing) a pleasurable level of consumption-related fulfilment, including levels of under- or over-fulfilment” (p. 13). An important issue in resident satisfaction study is to identify factors that would affect residents’ satisfaction with care to provide crucial information to long-term care providers and professionals. Yet a review of the literature reveals that, although personal factors (such as health and age), as well as organizational factors (such as staffing), have been examined frequently, there is a lack of study on cognitive-based perceptual factors (such as service expectation, perceived performance of the facility) that are conceptually related to residents’ satisfaction with care. Although cognitive variables are quite commonly used in the marketing and service industries, to our knowledge, they have seldom been applied to the context of residential care. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0733464810386222">Akamigbo and Wolinsky (2006)</xref> did examine resident expectation, but they measured the service expectation of obtaining a nursing home placement, rather than expectations of service quality. Cognitive factors are important because they reflect residents’ subjective reality and their personal assessment, which are directly related to their sense of well-being. Moreover, these factors are more within the control of service providers than the residents’ personal factors such as gender and age, which are completely beyond control, and organizational factors such as institutional size, which may involve resources that are not readily available.</p>
<p>This article reports the findings of a study that examined a group of cognitive predictors which is very much neglected in nursing home satisfaction. In particular, the study explored how satisfaction with care might be related to residents’ service expectation and perception of their own care needs on one hand and, in their eyes, the facilities’ service performance and provision of assistance to meet their care needs on the other. The study also explored how resident’s sense of satisfaction would be related to the discrepancy between their service expectation and perceived service performance (assessed as expectancy disconfirmation). This study is part of a larger research on examining the degree of satisfaction and various predictors of satisfaction among Chinese residents of long-term care homes in Hong Kong (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0733464810386222">Chong, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0733464810386222">Chong &amp; Chi, 2001</xref>).</p>
<sec id="section1-0733464810386222">
<title>Resident Satisfaction and Cognitive Determinants</title>
<p>One major issue in satisfaction study is whether the construct of satisfaction is unidimensional or multidimensional. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0733464810386222">Levkoff and DeShane (1979)</xref> stated that satisfaction appeared to be unidemensional because high satisfaction with service was found irrespective of service types. However, many others argue that the construct of satisfaction is multidimensional (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0733464810386222">Chou, Boldy, &amp; Lee, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0733464810386222">Hayes, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0733464810386222">Lee et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0733464810386222">Oliver, 1997</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0733464810386222">Higgs, MacDonald, MadDonald, and Ward (1998)</xref> identified five themes of satisfaction experienced by residents of nursing homes in United Kingdom, including relation with staff, autonomy, amenities, privacy, and social environment. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0733464810386222">Chou et al. (2001)</xref> suggests satisfaction consists of six correlated factors. More recently, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0733464810386222">Straker et al. (2007)</xref>, through a survey of 18,560 residents in Ohio, have identified eight factors (such as activities, choice, administration, meals and dining, laundry), along with an underlying secondary Global Satisfaction factor. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0733464810386222">Castle’s (2007)</xref> review of 50 studies on resident satisfaction also found many tools that ask both overall satisfaction and different care domains, reflecting a multidimensional approach to satisfaction.</p>
<p>Another challenge in measuring consumer satisfaction is that the notion of satisfaction has many proxies, such as assessment, good feelings, and service quality. The last one, namely service quality, is very often used interchangeably with satisfaction. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0733464810386222">Bergman and Klefsjo (1994)</xref>, for example, defined <italic>quality</italic> as consumer satisfaction and delight. However, service quality and consumer satisfaction could be recognized as closely related but distinct constructs. <italic>Service quality</italic> is defined as the consumer’s judgment about a service/product’s overall excellence or superiority (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0733464810386222">Oliver, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0733464810386222">Parasuraman, Zeithaml, &amp; Berry, 1988</xref>), and it is generally assumed that higher quality of care would lead to higher level of resident satisfaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0733464810386222">Chou et al., 2002</xref>). However, satisfaction is a state felt by a consumer who has experienced a performance/outcome that has fulfilled his or her expectation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0733464810386222">Kotler, 1982</xref>), it is primarily a subjective response to a consumption experience and may involve the interplay of the individual’s cognition and emotions or, as suggested by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0733464810386222">Oliver (1997</xref>, p. 319), a “hybrid cognition-emotion.” This article argues that long-term care satisfaction arises from the resident’s subjective assessment of the quality of aged care.</p>
<p>A related complexity concerns the way satisfaction and quality of care are operationalized. Features of care such as food and choice could be taken both as independent variables affecting satisfaction and as components of care making up the satisfaction experience. Some studies (such as those conducted by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0733464810386222">Chou et al., 2001</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0733464810386222">2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0733464810386222">Martin &amp; Kettner, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0733464810386222">Straker et al., 2007</xref>) used features of care as different dimensions of satisfaction, whereas other studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0733464810386222">Duffy, Duffy, &amp; Kilbourne, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0733464810386222">Higgs et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0733464810386222">Kane et al., 1997</xref>) used features of care as quality indicators and not as outcome measures of satisfaction. The present study adopts the second approach and uses features of care in the measure of perceived performance, service expectation, and expectancy disconfirmation, to cover major quality indicators involved in long-term care.</p>
<p>Most of the publications on cognitive determinants of consumer satisfaction are in the field of marketing and service industry which takes consumer satisfaction as a consumer response to the evaluation of the discrepancy between actual service/product performance and the consumer’s different comparison standards (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0733464810386222">Oliver, 1997</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0733464810386222">Tse and Wilton (1988)</xref> suggest ideal performance, equity, expectation, and expectancy disconfirmation as possible comparison standards or determinants. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0733464810386222">Oliver (1997)</xref> argued that satisfaction results from the psychological processing of service performance, and proposed expectation, expectancy disconfirmation, needs, need fulfillment, performance, service quality, and fairness as possibly affecting the consumer’s satisfaction or dissatisfaction.</p>
<p>The present study hypothesized that the resident’s satisfaction with care was associated with cognitive-based perceptual factors. In particular, resident satisfaction was postulated to be positively related to the perceived performance of the institution, service expectation, expectancy disconfirmation, and perceived care need fulfillment and negatively related to perceived care need. In addition to the direct influence, it was also hypothesized that perceived performance and expectation exerted an indirect positive effect on satisfaction via expectancy disconfirmation and that perceived care need exerted an indirect and positive effect on satisfaction through care need fulfillment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0733464810386222">Figure 1</xref>).</p>

<p>Assessing the perception of service performance has been the traditional approach in the consumer satisfaction literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0733464810386222">Oliver, 1997</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0733464810386222">Tse and Wilton (1988)</xref> found that perceived performance exerts both a direct influence on satisfaction and an indirect effect on satisfaction through expectancy disconfirmation. <italic>Service expectation</italic> refers to pretrial beliefs about a product or service (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0733464810386222">Faranda, 1996</xref>) and are formed on the basis of people’s past experience with similar situations and the statement made by friends, operators, or organizations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0733464810386222">Kotler, 1982</xref>). It includes ideal or desirable expectation, and practical or realistic expectation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0733464810386222">Ellmer &amp; Olbrisch, 1983</xref>). Practical expectation was examined in the present study because in the pilot study, the participants became confused when being asked about their desirable expectation. Expectancy disconfirmation has been a dominant measure in consumer satisfaction in the service industry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0733464810386222">Gotlieb, Grewal, &amp; Brown, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0733464810386222">Oliver, 1997</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0733464810386222">Oliver &amp; DeSarbo, 1988</xref>). It refers to the difference (positive, negative, or neutral) between the resident’s expectation of the service provided by their institutions and the institutions’ performance on individual features of care as perceived by the resident (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0733464810386222">Oliver, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0733464810386222">Yi, 1990</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0733464810386222">Kotler (1982)</xref> argued that if performance matched the expectation, the consumer was satisfied. If the performance fell short of the expectation, the consumer was dissatisfied.</p>
<p>The notion of <italic>care need</italic> refers to fundamental requirements for human survival and basic well-being. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0733464810386222">Oliver (1997)</xref> differentiates between need and want in that needs are more aligned with deficits whereas wants result from desired enhancement. Need fulfillment assesses the fit between the care needs of the resident and the resources/assistance provided by the long-term care home. The question is whether service performance meets, falls short, or exceeds a consumer’s care needs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0733464810386222">Oliver, 1997</xref>). As is pointed out by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0733464810386222">Bradshaw (1977)</xref>, the concept of need is inherent in the idea of social service, yet there are very few empirical studies on both the concept of need and need fulfillment, possibly because the concept is too intuitively obvious (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0733464810386222">Oliver, 1997</xref>).</p>

<title>Research Design</title>
<p>A cross-sectional survey using face-to-face interview was conducted in Hong Kong with 405 Chinese residents living in 11 government-funded care-and-attention homes randomly and proportionately selected from two strata based on facility size.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0733464810386222">
<title>Sample and Setting</title>
<p>There are two main types of long-term care homes for older people in Hong Kong: government-funded and privately funded homes. The focus of this study was on government-funded care-and-attention homes, which provide the bulk of publicly funded institutional care. Care-and-attention homes mainly provide personal care and limited nursing care to their residents and, compared with long-term care homes in the West such as in the United States, fall somewhere between continuous care residential centers and long-term care institutions. Although the majority of long-term care residents in the United States are cognitively impaired, the percentage tends to be lower in Hong Kong because some residents have been institutionalized due to social instead of nursing needs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0733464810386222">Lee et al., 2005</xref>). These homes are in great demand among older people. As of February 28, 2010, 25,879 older people were on the central waiting list for residential care and 75% of them were waiting for care-and-attention homes. The average waiting time was as high as 30 months (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0733464810386222">Social Welfare Department, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>There was an absence of a complete list of institutionalized older people in Hong Kong; the only available information was the list of long-term care homes, which indicated that there were 8,519 beds in 78 care-and-attention homes at the time of the study. All institutions were financed by the government according to a standard subvention formula based on the capacity of the institutions and thus the resource input would be very similar among institutions of similar size. Proportionate stratified random sampling was used, taking 150 beds as the cutting point between large and small institutions according to government practice. Under this classification, there were 56 small institutions and 22 large ones, providing 47% and 53% beds, respectively.</p>
<p>The sample size was calculated by adopting the formula (<italic>t</italic><sup>2</sup> <italic>p</italic>[1 − p]) / <italic>d</italic><sup>2</sup>, where <italic>t</italic> = .05 significance level for making a Type 1 error, <italic>p</italic> = estimated proportion of residents who were satisfied and was assumed to be 50%, and <italic>d</italic> = acceptable error of 5% that the estimated proportion will lie outside p ± 5%. The resulted figure of 384.16 was around up to a sample size of 400, which, in proportion should include 189 respondents from small institutions and 211 from large ones. Letters with reply slips were sent to institutions down the two randomized list of institutions until the quota was met. A total of 18 care-and-attention homes were approached and 11 consented, giving a response rate of 61%. This rate, though low, is in fact higher than the rate of 55% of another study on government-funded long-term care homes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0733464810386222">Chong &amp; Kwan, 2001</xref>). Moreover, phone contact was made with superintendents of the seven institutions to detect any possible bias among institutions which refused to participate. Being busy with preparing for external assessment newly introduced by the government was given by all the superintendents. Other reasons were as follows: the decision of the senior management, being preoccupied with preparing its own opening ceremony, and having just gone through massive renovation and the whole home had not yet settled down.</p>
<p>The 11 institutions were asked to carry out the initial screening according to the sampling criteria, which is not an uncommon practice in research on residential care (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0733464810386222">Uman &amp; Urman, 1997</xref>), because the institution staff should be knowledgeable about whether individual residents met the selection criteria. Each responsible staff was provided by the research team with a standardized information sheet and briefing on the selection criteria, namely ageing 60 or older, being capable of communicating clearly, not suffering from severe cognitive or physical impairments, and having lived in the facilities for not less than 3 months. In particular, the staff was asked to screen out only residents who were diagnosed by physicians to be severely impaired physically or cognitively or both, but to retain residents about whose eligibility they were not sure. The 10-item Chinese version of Pfeiffer’s Short Portable Mental Status Questionnaire (SPMSQ) was administered as a screening test to ascertain individual resident’s level of cognitive competence. Residents with an adjusted SPMSQ summed score lower than 5 were excluded, as they would not be able to give reliable responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0733464810386222">Chi &amp; Boey, 1992</xref>). These selection measures were intended to reduce selection bias and to retain as many residents as possible, including those who were having mild to moderate cognitive impairment.</p>
<p>After the screening test, 474 (54.9%) out of the 864 residents from these 11 institutions were identified as eligible for the study and were interviewed by trained interviewers. Finally, 405 residents were successfully interviewed, giving a response rate of 85%. The reasons for the 69 residents who were eligible but did not participate mainly concerned health issues such as feeling unwell, sleeping at the time of interview, attending medical appointment, and hospitalization (13%). Some were attending activities or having visitors (1.5%), a few found the interview too long (0.5%). Among the respondents, 193 (47.7%) lived in 6 small institutions and 212 (52.3%) in 5 large institutions, which was an accurate reflection of the actual distribution of beds in the two types of institutions. <italic>T</italic>-tests found no significant difference in the distribution of age and gender of respondents from large and small homes.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0733464810386222">
<title>Measures</title>
<p>Six of the seven measurement tools used in the study were specially constructed for use with older Chinese and were validated through a systematic validation process that included a literature review, a focus group discussion with 5 residents with different health conditions, a review by 8 multidisciplinary experts in long-term care, a pretest with 20 residents, and a pilot survey of 99 residents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0733464810386222">Chong, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0733464810386222">Chong &amp; Chi, 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>The four-item Residential Care Satisfaction Scale (RCSS; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0733464810386222">Chong, 2003</xref>) measured the dependent variable of resident satisfaction and explored different behavioral–emotive dimensions of satisfaction. The first two items measured the behavioral dimension of satisfaction and asked residents whether they would recommend their institution to their friends and choose their institution again should they be able to start afresh. The last two items measured the affective dimension of satisfaction, asked them whether they were happy to live in their institution at the time of interview, and their overall satisfaction or dissatisfaction with their institution. A 4-point Likert-type scale was used in the first three items, with higher scores indicating a higher degree of satisfaction. For the last item, a 20-point Likert-type scale was used to obtain a fine differentiation of the degree of satisfaction or dissatisfaction. RCSS has previously reported to have satisfactory validity and factor analysis found all four items clustering under one factor, accounting for 44.13% of the variance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0733464810386222">Chong, 2003</xref>). In terms of reliability, its Cronbach’s alpha was only .58, which was quite low even after taking into consideration the fact that it has four items only.</p>
<p>The Perceived Performance Scale (PPS), Expectation Scale (ES), and Expectancy Disconfirmation Scale (EDS) each was composed of the same 28-item battery of quality indicators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0733464810386222">Chong &amp; Chi, 2001</xref>). These 28 items were developed from a list of 72 items identified through residents’ focus group discussion and literature review, it was cut down to 55 through a review by eight experts and a pretest with 20 residents, and was further shortened and validated through a pilot study of 98 residents. The 35-item scale was used in the present survey, and 7 items were deleted after the repeated interactive sequence of computing alphas (deleting item if item-total correlation was below .1 and if removal improved correlation alpha) and factors analysis (deleting item if factor loading was below .3). The same 28 items were used in PPS, ES, and EDS to facilitate matching and comparison among the three scales. The score of each scale was the means of the summated score of all 28 items.</p>
<p>The PPS asks respondents to assess the performance of their institution for each of the indicators, with a response format ranging from 1 = <italic>never like this</italic>, to 4 = <italic>always like this</italic>. The ES asks respondents about their service expectation, measured on a 5-point Likert-type scale with 0 being <italic>no expectation</italic> and 1 being <italic>definitely should not be like this</italic> to 4 being <italic>definitely should be like this</italic>; the higher the score, the higher the expectation. The EDS was operationalized by multiplying the perceived performance score by the expectation score to give the interaction value. The Cronbach’s alphas were .81, .86, and .87 for PPS, ES, and EDS, respectively, reflecting high internal consistency.</p>
<p>The construct “care need” in this study is related to the residents’ perceived difficulties in functional and sensory activities, including activities of daily living (such as bathing and dressing), instrumental activities of daily living (such as getting outside and handling money), and basic sensory functioning such as hearing and reading abilities in the past 3 months. Care need fulfillment assesses the degree of fit, in the eyes of the residents, between their perceived difficulties and the assistance provided by the long-term care homes. The 4-point Likert-type scale was used in the 13-item Perceived Care Need Scale (PCNS), ranged from 1 = <italic>no difficulty</italic> to 4 = <italic>cannot do it</italic>, whereas Care Need Fulfilment Scale (CNFS) asks whether the level of assistance provided by the institution for each of the 13 activities was 1 = <italic>too little</italic>, 2 = <italic>too much</italic>, or 3 = <italic>appropriate</italic>. The Cronbach’s alphas were .83 and .80, respectively, which suggest high internal consistency.</p>
<p>Cognitive competence of the residents was measured with the 10-item Chinese version of SPMSQ which asked respondents to give the date, their age, name of district they were living, and to subtract 3 from 20 all the way down. It has been translated into Chinese and validated by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0733464810386222">Chi and Boey (1992)</xref> and is commonly used in Hong Kong. Its scores range from 0 to 11 and are adjusted by the education level of the participants by giving one additional point to participants without any formal education. Respondents with adjusted SPMSQ scores below 5 were considered too severely impaired cognitively to give reliable responses. This screening test is in response to the concern to include residents with cognitive impairment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0733464810386222">Ejaz &amp; Castle, 2007</xref>). With population ageing, an increasing number of demented residents is expected, and their views are important to design services that meet with their expectation and care needs.</p>

<sec id="section6-0733464810386222">
<title>Procedure</title>
<p>Participants were interviewed by interviewers who were social work undergraduates selected on their empathetic communication skills and prior practicum experience with the senior citizens. Two training sessions were organized to strengthen their ability to communicate with older people with different levels of physical and cognitive impairment. Face-to-face interviews would only take place after obtaining the residents’ informed consent. If the residents could not be contacted (such as when they were out for medical consultation or were attending activities), or if they were unfit for interview due to poor health or being asleep, the interviewer would make no less than three attempts to contact them before the respondents were dropped from the list. If the respondents became tired, the interviewers would suggest a break or arrange another appointment. On average, each interview took about 40 to 60 min. The interview took place in a place free from disturbances such as the conference room, the nursing room, or a quiet corner of the resident’s bedroom.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-0733464810386222">
<title>Data Analysis</title>
<p>With the use of SPSS, frequency tables were computed to find out the demographic profile of the participants and their mean scores in the various scales. Pearson’s correlation coefficients were calculated to determine the correlation between the various independent and dependent variables. Regression analysis was conducted to control for the effect of confounding variables. Satisfaction was regressed on all five cognitive variables together with basic demographic variables to identify which independent variables might predict satisfaction with care. Path analysis was then conducted to examine the goodness-of-fit between the hypothesized model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0733464810386222">Figure 1</xref>) and the extracted model based on data of the survey and to identify the predictors of resident satisfaction.</p>

<title>Participants Profile</title>
<p>On average, the participants were 82 years old (<italic>SD</italic> = 7.33). The majority (63.7%) were aged 80 years or above, and approximately 70% were female. More than half (56.3%) were widowed, a quarter (24.7%) were married, 14.3% had never been married, and 3.7% were divorced or separated. The participants had received an average of 2.42 years (<italic>SD</italic> =3.57) of formal education, but about half (51.5%) had no education. The demographic distribution of the participants was very similar to that found by the Thematic Household Survey conducted by the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0733464810386222">Census and Statistics Department—Hong Kong (2005)</xref> to examine the long-term care needs of older persons residing in institutions, suggesting the representativeness of the sample.</p>
<p>The majority (75%) of the respondents had lived in their facilities for 5 years or below, 15.3% more than 5 years but less than 10 years, 8.7% more than 10 years but less than 20 years, and 1% more than 20 years. As mentioned above, only residents with adjusted SPMSQ scores of 5 and above would be interviewed. The cognitive levels of the participants were quite evenly distributed among adjusted SPMSQ scores from 5 to 11, ranging from 13.3% to 18.3%, and the average score was 7.6 (<italic>SD</italic> = 1.8). The only exception was with those who had the highest score of 11 meaning good cognitive competence, which was only 3.5%.</p>

<title>Resident satisfaction</title>
<p>To render the response format of the 20-point general satisfaction item comparable with that of the other three items in the RCSS Scale, it was recoded into four categories by recoding the original points 1 to 5 as “1” meaning <italic>very dissatisfied</italic>, 6 to 10 as “2” meaning <italic>slightly dissatisfied</italic>, 11 to 15 as “3” meaning <italic>slightly satisfied</italic>, and 16 to 20 as “4” meaning <italic>very satisfied</italic>. The average summated scores of the RCSS revealed that nearly half (46.4%) of the participants were very satisfied with the service performance of their long-term care homes, 44.7% were somewhat satisfied, 8.6% were somewhat dissatisfied, and 0.2% were very dissatisfied. The means of the scale was 3.37 (<italic>SD</italic> = .65) out of 4.</p>

<p>Pearson correlation coefficients between the dependent variable of resident satisfaction and the independent variables of perceived performance, service expectation, expectancy disconfirmation, and care need fulfillment were .47, .29, .44, and .27, respectively, all significant at <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001. However, perceived care need was negatively correlated with satisfaction (<italic>r</italic> = -.13, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01). Although the levels of significance of the correlation between all these variables are high, the magnitude of the correlations is only moderate or weak, ranging from .13 to .47.</p>
<p>Pearson correlation showed that all the cognitive variables were significantly (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .001) related with each other. However, the magnitude of the correlations were not high; the exception was found between service expectation and expectancy disconfirmation which was as high as .90 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0733464810386222">Table 3</xref>), and so in further data analysis, only expectancy disconfirmation would be used. It is because expectancy disconfirmation is usually regarded as the most important predictor in consumer satisfaction studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0733464810386222">Oliver, 1997</xref>; Tse, Nicosia, &amp; Wilton, 1990). Moreover, regression analysis of all five cognitive variables only found perceived performance and expectancy disconfirmation predicted respondents’ satisfaction with care. Care need and need fulfillment were also expected to be related to each other. However, the finding that the correlation was negative (-.16) was surprising and contrary to the assumption that residents with higher care need would receive higher level of assistance from the institution.</p>

<title>Path Analysis</title>
<p>Of the five cognitive variables and the six personal variables (including age, being female, years of education, duration of stay in the facilities, and the cognitive levels measured by SPMSQ) examined, regression analysis found only three variables predicted resident satisfaction. They were perceived performance (β = .346, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001), expectancy disconfirmation (β = .178, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01), and being female (β = .115, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01). As a result, gender (being female and being male) was entered together with all five cognitive variables in path analysis to identify the goodness-of-fit between the proposed model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0733464810386222">Figure 1</xref>) and the extracted model based on the sample data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0733464810386222">Byrne, 1998</xref>). The goodness-of-fit of the model had the indicators (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0733464810386222">Figure 2</xref>): <italic>L</italic><sup>2</sup>(4) = 4.450, <italic>p</italic> = .349, standardized root mean square residual (SRMR) = .013, root mean square error of approximation (RMSEA) = .017, comparative fit index (CFI) = .999. It showed that only perceived performance and expectancy disconfirmation could predict resident satisfaction directly and positively. Perceived performance (β = .336, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001) made a greater contribution to resident satisfaction than expectancy disconfirmation (β = .179, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01). Perceived care need and care need fulfillment exerted only an indirect effect on satisfaction through perceived performance. The indirect effect of care need on satisfaction followed two paths: one through care need fulfillment and the other through perceived performance. Both effects were negative (β = -.244 for perceived performance and -.174 for need fulfillment). This seems to suggest that residents who experienced fewer care needs tended to receive more appropriate assistance and to rate their facilities’ performance better than those with more care needs. Standardized effects for men and women found that female respondents were positive about their institutions’ performance (β = .095, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05) and were satisfied with the service provision (β = .105, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05). However, a note of caution is that only 25.4% of the variance in resident satisfaction was explained by perceived service performance, expectancy disconfirmation, and being female.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The performance of long-term care homes as perceived by their residents exerted a direct positive effect on satisfaction as well as an indirect positive effect through expectancy disconfirmation. Among all five cognitive variables, only perceived performance and expectancy disconfirmation could predict, though weakly, residents’ satisfaction with care, with the former exerting a relatively greater influence than the latter. The reason, as suggested by Model 2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0733464810386222">Figure 2</xref>), was that perceived performance was strengthened by the addition of the indirect effects of perceived care need and care need fulfillment. Although the indirect effect of perceived care need was negative, the effects of the care need fulfillment was positive, which suggests that the residents might feel satisfied with their long-term care homes, not just because they perceived the performance of the institution to be good but also because they did not have high care need and they received appropriate assistance with their care needs. This suggests that the operation of the effect of perceived performance is very complex and further study is recommended to identify the factors that affect residents’ subjective assessment of their facilities’ service performance. This result is consistent with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0733464810386222">Yi’s (1990)</xref> finding of high correlations between satisfaction and performance ratings.</p>
<p>Expectancy disconfirmation was found to positively and directly predict satisfaction, suggesting that residents would feel satisfied when there was no discrepancy between their service expectation and the perceived performance of their institutions, and when the institution’s perceived performance was better than their expectation. This points to the need to consider a resident’s service expectation and to examine how expectation may affect their satisfaction with care. Perceived care need and care need fulfillment, however, did not predict resident satisfaction. These findings echo the early finding of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0733464810386222">Locker and Dunt (1978)</xref> which suggested that satisfaction said more about the consumer’s expectations than the service actually received and that studies of satisfaction were distinct from studies of consumer defined need. However, caution should be exercised on the use of expectation as a predictor of satisfaction as there could be an assimilation effect, which suggests that when performance varies only slightly from expectation, the consumer’s perception tends to place it at his or her expectation, and it is only at the extremes that satisfaction or dissatisfaction is expressed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0733464810386222">Smith, Schussler-Fiorenza, &amp; Rockwood, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>An unexpected finding was a negative standardized effect between perceived care need and care need fulfillment, suggesting that residents with higher level of care need tended to receive less assistance from their facilities. This goes against the very purpose of long-term care which is to serve residents who are incapable of self-care. The reasons for this apparently self-defeating phenomenon should be further explored, but the finding might suggest that the institutions were either taking care of residents who were frailer than they were capable of serving or failing in their task. More attention is therefore required to helping institutions design services that can directly meet the care needs of frail residents.</p>
<p>This study found that being women was a predictor of satisfaction. Women are generally assumed to have better social skills than men, and this might have enhanced their adjustment in the aged care homes, leading to higher satisfaction. This might also be due to the larger proportion of women than men in the facilities and their usually larger supportive network. Moreover, to be served by others was traditionally taken as a symbol of “good fortune” and higher social status, and the facilities might have provided women with their first experience of being served (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0733464810386222">Chong, 2003</xref>). However, gender effect on satisfaction is not conclusive. A Hong Kong satisfaction survey which interviewed 175 cognitively intact nursing home residents found no relationship between gender and satisfaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0733464810386222">Lee et al., 2005</xref>). Moreover, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0733464810386222">Joiner and Freudiger’s (1993)</xref> study of 114 residents of nursing homes in United States found that, although gender of the residents did not affect their satisfaction with nursing home care, female residents were perceived by social work designees as less well adjusted than male residents, possibly due to the former’s higher rate of complaints. The relationship between gender and satisfaction is thus a very complicated issue, and further studies are strongly recommended to identify how men and women assess the service quality of the aged care homes and the reasons behind their assessment.</p>
<p>Some limitations in the study should be noted. In the present study, the RCSS was a measure of overall satisfaction, whereas different aspects of care formed the battery of quality indicators in PPS, ES, and EDS. Yet other satisfaction measures may include both features of care and overall satisfaction (such as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0733464810386222">Higgs et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0733464810386222">Straker et al., 2007</xref>). This reflects the lack of consensus about how resident satisfaction should be operationalized. Moreover, the RCSS’s Cronbach’s alpha was rather low, suggesting low reliability, thus, the findings should be interpreted with caution.</p>
<p>This article focuses mainly on the correlation and predicting effect of cognitive perceptual variables on residents’ satisfaction with care as these variables are very seldom examined in nursing home care and yet, as argued earlier, should receive a lot more attention. However, it is very likely that residents’ satisfaction are affected by other variables, such as the residents’ health or the facility size. A local survey (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0733464810386222">Lee et al., 2005</xref>) found health-related quality of life (mental component), state self-esteem, and satisfaction with social support significantly accounted for 31% of the variance of satisfaction. This suggests the need to take into consideration the full array of independent variables that may affect residents’ assessments, including residents’ cognitive and personal variables, as well as the institutions’ organizational factors (such as staffing and culture of a facility).</p>
<p>A further limitation of the study was in its sampling method. Despite the follow-up phone contacts with institutions which refused to participate, there was no safeguard against a biased dropout, as their self-reported reasons might be excuses to hide their reluctance to reveal possible negative resident assessment. In addition, the multistage sampling method might also be a source of bias in the resulting data. As the staff were asked to carry out the first screening, it was possible that they would exclude troublemakers or very outspoken residents. Even though a standardized information sheet and briefing was provided to concerned staff, there might still be selection bias on the part of the staff.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>This is the first known study that examines the correlation and predicting effect of cognitive variables such as perceived service performance and expectancy disconfirmation on resident satisfaction. The findings lend strong empirical support to the inclusion of these hitherto neglected variables in studies of resident satisfaction, in addition to personal and environmental factors.</p>
<p>Results suggest that, to promote satisfaction, systematic efforts are needed to improve the recognition of the institution’s performance among residents. Staff and management not only should improve their own service performance but also should seek to ensure that residents recognize and understand what has been done on their behalf through regular two-way communication.</p>
<p>Expectation disconfirmation was found to predict satisfaction. This suggests the need to nurture a realistic service expectation among the residents throughout the institutionalization process, from community education to older people in general, to the provision of comprehensive information about their own home at admission interviews, and to the timely orientation on admission.</p>
<p>Although this was a study of older residents in Hong Kong, it is likely that the findings might provide some useful reference to other Chinese communities, such as Taiwan, mainland China, and Singapore, because the majority of the present cohort of older Chinese in these societies share similar life experiences, such as being born in rural China, having lived through wars and poverty in their adolescence, and having left their homeland. They may therefore have similar lifestyles, entertain similar value system and expectation on institutional care. However, further studies in these communities are needed to examine the extent to which there are similarities and differences between this study’s findings and those from other Chinese societies.</p>
