<body>
<p>Training cases define clinical immersion for candidates and are essential to their education, progression, and graduation. At the Columbia University Center for Psychoanalytic Training and Research, there are three steps to the recruitment of training cases: (1) evaluation and selection of patients for psychoanalysis (some apply to the center specifically for analysis, while others are cases from the candidate’s psychotherapy practice who are converted for analysis); (2) what happens once an offer of analytic treatment is made; and (3) induction of treatment. While dropouts from treatment are expected, repeated dropouts can be demoralizing and detrimental to a candidate’s education and progression.</p>
<p>Four years ago we published a paper reporting the dropout rate of training cases at the center who began treatment between September 2002 and July 2008 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0003065113490023">Hamilton, Wininger, and Roose 2009</xref>). In that study of 141 cases we found that 40% of training cases drop out of treatment before the end of the first year of analysis; a striking fact was that half of these patients dropped out in the first month of treatment. A literature search in 2009 revealed only one paper (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0003065113490023">Frayn 1995</xref>) that had looked at this topic. A recent search reveals no new papers on this topic since that time.</p>
<p>In the 2009 paper we hypothesized that the timing and frequency of dropout in part reflected problems in technique during the induction and early treatment phases. The implication is that these problems should be addressed in supervision and/or the didactic curriculum. In the hope of generating an educational plan to address the dropout problem, the results of the study were presented to the center’s Executive Committee (on which sit the chairs of the major committees, including Training and Supervising Analyst, Progression, Curriculum, and Clinic Admissions Service) as well as to candidates in various classes and other forums. Some Executive Committee members felt that this is just “the way analysis is”; others agreed that it is a significant issue that ought to be addressed from an educational perspective. The candidates expressed concern and said the situation is very demoralizing. They wondered what might be done about it.</p>
<p>To determine whether highlighting this issue has led to changes in the dropout rate or the educational program since 2009, we compared the dropout rate of training cases from the 2009 study to the rate in a newer cohort from 2007–2012 and reviewed the curriculum in 2012 to see if the issue has been specifically addressed.</p>
<sec id="section1-0003065113490023" sec-type="methods">
<title>Method</title>
<p>For the current study we included all patients who were offered and accepted psychoanalytic treatment at the center from September 2007 through September 2012. The intake procedures for patients have remained the same and are described in our earlier paper (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0003065113490023">Hamilton, Wininger, and Roose 2009</xref>). Patients in the current sample are all patients who were accepted for analytic treatment and either dropped out before twelve months or remained in treatment after twelve months (ongoing cases). The dropouts were sorted into three categories based on the timing of dropout: Failure to Launch, those who dropped out in less than one month (most in less than a week); Early Dropout (2 to 6 months); and Late Dropout (7 to11 months). Cases continuing for twelve months or more were considered ongoing. The plan was to compare the old cohort to the new one, for rate and timing of dropout, across a number of variables including age, gender, clinical diagnosis, case origin, and whether or not the patient was on medication. Comparisons were made by chi-square or <italic>t</italic> tests.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>Between September 2008 and September 2012, 114 patients were accepted as training cases and either dropped out or remained in treatment for twelve months (ongoing cases). To assess change in dropout rates over time, we compared the 141 patients from the 2009 dropout study, Cohort 1, with the 114 patients in our new group, Cohort 2, on a number of variables.</p>
<p>There were no significant differences between Cohort 1 and Cohort 2 on age, gender, medication status, or case origin. Most important, there were no significant differences between cohorts on dropout rates or timing of dropout (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0003065113490023">Table 1</xref>).</p>

<p>Because there were no differences between the cohorts on dropout rates or timing of dropout, we combined them into a group of 255 patients to compare dropouts with ongoing cases across a number of variables. The mean age was 33.0 years (<italic>SD</italic> = 9.0). 59% were female, 47% were conversions, 53% were evaluations, and 56% were prescribed medication during the treatment.</p>
<p>Forty-two percent of patients (108/255) dropped out within the first twelve months of treatment. Of the 108 dropouts, 39% dropped out within the first month, most at one week or less, with only three cases continuing until the three-week mark, 38% within 2 to 6 months, and 23% after 7 to 11 months of treatment. Thus, 17% of all patients beginning analysis dropped out within the first month of treatment.</p>
<p>Dropouts were not significantly different from ongoing patients with respect to age, gender, or medication status. There was a significant difference between the dropout rate of conversion cases (33%) and evaluation cases (50%), χ<sup>2</sup> (1, <italic>n</italic> = 255) = 7.55, <italic>p</italic> = &lt;.01. There was also a significant difference in timing of dropout, with lower failure-to-launch rates for conversion cases (8%) than for evaluation cases (24%), χ<sup>2</sup> (1, <italic>n</italic> = 255) = 10.91, <italic>p</italic> = &lt;.01. More conversion cases (69%) were taking psychotropic medication during treatment than were evaluation cases (44%), χ<sup>2</sup> (1, <italic>n</italic> = 255) = 16.7, <italic>p</italic> = &lt;.01.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The dropout rate between the two cohorts is unchanged, perhaps even higher in the second cohort. There are no data in the literature to compare the dropout rate of training cases to that of cases seen in private practice, so we cannot reassure ourselves by saying that the dropout rate is lower in practice and a high dropout rate is found only among training cases.</p>
<p>Dropout remains a problem, yet the center’s response to the first study appears minimal. However, in response to ongoing discussion among faculty at the center, some innovations that will directly or indirectly address the issue are being initiated. A policy of giving candidates immersion credit for a six-month period of preparatory psychotherapy was approved. First-year candidates will be assigned supervisors at the start of classes and will be expected to discuss their psychotherapy cases with these supervisors with a view toward analytic listening and, when appropriate, beginning a conversion process. This work will be given credit toward the immersion requirement for graduation, even if the patient is not converted to psychoanalysis.</p>
<p>Additionally, a brief course on “the dropout experience” is being added for fourth- and fifth-year candidates. This will be a clinically focused course, with presentation of cases that have dropped out early. The plan is to eventually move this class to the end of the first year. As of yet, there is no direct program for supervisors regarding this issue.</p>
