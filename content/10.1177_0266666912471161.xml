<p>The world’s weather is showing symptoms of weirdness that seems only one step away from madness. Droughts are afflicting areas where they are not normal and lasting longer in areas where they often happen: hurricanes, floods, and tsunamis are more frequent and more intense those recorded in the past century or so. Global weirding is replacing global warming as the topic on which everyone has to have an opinion. It may be the product of humankind’s pollution of the atmosphere as research on global warming seems to suggest, but more urgent than what causes all this is the question of how we cope with it. In particular what do we do about the terrible harvests that have followed the weird weather in so many parts of the world, including not only the vulnerable agro-systems of large parts of the developing world, but also the rich and consistently productive farmlands of the Ukraine or the American Mid West?</p>
<p>One very simple answer would be for the industrialized countries to rationalize their food production and consumption. At present they waste enough to feed most of the world’s starving masses. Enormous numbers of hectares of excellent land are given over to animal husbandry that produces much less food than growing crops would. Good crops are rejected because the shape and colour of the vegetables and fruit is not perfect enough for the dainty appetites of consumers. Food that is put on the shelves of the shops is given stupidly short sell-by dates which mean that high percentages of it are thrown away – yes, thrown away, not given away. Then consumers let even more food rot in their cupboards and refrigerators. Finally a great deal of food that is cooked and put on the plate ends up being scraped into the bin. This utterly grotesque waste would be bad enough if it only affected the industrialized countries, but much of the food we are talking about is grown in developing countries and shipped north before it is thrown away. This is the economics of madness, made worse because it is now also subject to mad weather.</p>
<p>Obviously the consumers of the industrialized countries need to be persuaded to eat less meat, learn to like ugly but delicious fruit and vegetables, refuse to tolerate waste within the distribution system, actually eat what they buy, and maybe even grow more of their own food in their lovely gardens. Equally obviously those consumers’ sense of entitlement will make that a slow and difficult project. In the meantime is there any alternative reason to feel hope? Well, yes there is. A report on sustainability jointly issued by Vodafone, Accenture and Oxfam in 2011 http://www.vodafone.com/content/dam/Vodafone/about/sustainability/2011/pdf/connected_agriculture.pdf draws attention to the ways in which the small farmers of developing countries can make an enormous difference. Smart agriculture based on timely information on input availability, weather, costs and prices can deliver much more food to the markets of the world, with benefit not only for the farmers, but for all of us who need to eat but are not self sufficient. How can this miracle be achieved? The report says, by the use of mobile communications. Is this a credible proposition? Yes, it is. The poor of the developing world are voting overwhelmingly for the phone as their information technology of choice and they are using it in a host of ingenious and effective ways. When farmers can get the right information they can be much more effective farmers. Strange though it may seem the small farmer with a mobile phone in his hand (no, this should read ‘and in her hand’ too because female farmers are a major segment of the farming population) is the potential saviour. The weather may be weird, the world’s agricultural economics at least as crazy, but out there in the fields there are some clever and hardworking people with answers.</p>
