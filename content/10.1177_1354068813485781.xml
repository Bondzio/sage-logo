<p>This book is a contribution to the growing literature on the electoral role of party leaders in democratic parliamentary elections. Its main objective is ‘to evaluate how much impact leaders have on the vote’ (p. 2), and it starts with the observation that the published literature addressing this question is for the most part country-specific rather than comparative in content. Starting from the assumption that ‘the leader effect varies over time, across systems, parties, and voters’, the novelty value of this book is held to be that it ‘formulate(s) hypotheses about the sources of these variations, and we use a comparative data set that allows us to systematically test these hypotheses’ (p. 2). Put differently, their ‘inquiry consists in specifying the contextual factors that make leaders a more or less powerful variable in vote choice’ (p. 3).</p>
<p>To this end, the book presents ten analytical chapters by a set of distinguished authors well known in this field of analysis. All the chapters have the merits of being longitudinal in focus, comparative (usually) in content and focused on a well-defined question in the wide-ranging debate on leader effects. As it turns out, though, not all of them analyse the impact of party leaders on the vote. The first substantive chapter, for example, is temporally prior to this focus and looks at change in the role of television and party leaders in campaign communications. Ian McAllister’s chapter (ch. 4) in turn looks at the changing role of party leaders ‘in ensuring the efficient operation of the parliamentary system(s)’ of Australia, Britain and Canada.</p>
<p>This small qualification apart, the editors group the chapters into four categories. The first (ch. 1) is the communications chapter and its broad focus is how television has affected the personalization of politics. The second category (chs 3–5) is ‘an overall examination of party leader effects on the vote’ (p. 9) and it contains a chapter comparing the impact of party and leader ratings on the vote and a country-specific one on likes and dislikes of US presidential candidates over time. Category 3 (chs 6–9) examines ‘under what conditions leader effects tend to be the greatest or smallest’ (p. 9). Among the ‘conditions’ examined are institutional context (e.g. presidential versus parliamentary systems, type of electoral system and type of party system), type of party (e.g. mass versus cadre, governing versus non-governing, party size and party age), and variations across the leaders (e.g. gender, age and length of tenure in office). The last essay in this category switches focus a little and asks which types of voters are more susceptible to being influenced by leaders (e.g. party identification, level of television news exposure and level of political sophistication and engagement).</p>
<p>Finally, the fourth category consists of two chapters that ‘seek to advance our understanding of how leader effects take place’ (p. 10). The first of them examines whether voters are likely to react more strongly to negative leader evaluations than they are to positive ones. The second takes a similar perspective, but looks at the kinds of character traits by which voters are most likely to be influenced, specifically: perceptions of party leaders’ cognitive competence, leadership, trustworthiness, reliability and empathy.</p>
<p>This is an ambitious volume and, probably for perfectly good space reasons, the methodology underlying often-sophisticated analyses is not always reported fully, raising a number of questions and leaving them unanswered. Another ‘micro’ criticism is that the level of English expression is variable, such that the clarity of meaning and interpretation one expects of published work is not always there.</p>
<p>At a more general level, though, there are two larger problems with this volume. The first is that it is the product of a conference held in Montreal in late 1999 and, judging by this book, it was almost certainly a ground-breaking meeting in which many good ideas surfaced for debate and reflection. As it is, however, the edited collection’s value is devalued and diminished for its many insights not having been made publicly available sooner. The result of the long lead-up to publication is that many of these insights have been pre-empted, primarily by journal articles appearing in the intervening decade or so. Think, for example, of the several recent articles on the ‘conditionality’ of leader effects. The volume’s utility for, and impact on, this field of electoral analysis will likely be commensurately diminished.</p>
<p>The second criticism is that the volume lacks a concluding chapter whose purpose is to bring together its major findings to provide a coherent ‘where are we?’ update on the study of leader effects in democratic elections, parliamentary and presidential. The absence of such a chapter is all the more inexplicable for the number and breadth of influences on leader evaluations and the vote with which the constituent chapters collectively deal and, more importantly, for some chapters finding a (statistically) significant impact on the vote for party leaders and others finding no such impact.</p>
