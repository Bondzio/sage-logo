<p><italic>Introduction</italic>. An increased rate of cardiovascular disease (CVD) has been suggested in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). The risk for myocardial infarction (MI), coronary artery disease and stroke has been reported as particularly prevalent in younger females compared with the reference population. This study was performed to analyse the standard incidence ratio (SIR) of and predictors for cardiovascular events (CVEs) in patients with SLE from northern Sweden, with a fairly homogenous population.</p>
<p><italic>Methods</italic>. In 2000 all prevalent patients with SLE (≥4 American College of Rheumatology [ACR] criteria; <italic>n</italic> = 277) from the four northern-most counties of Sweden were assessed with clinical and laboratory analyses. Seven years follow-up data concerning MI and stroke were extracted from the national registers of hospitalization and death in Sweden. The incidence ratio among the patients was compared with that for the general population from the same catchment area using data from the same register and Statistics Sweden. To identify time to event and CVE predictors, two matched controls for each patient were used and disease related variables as CVD predictors.</p>
<p><italic>Results</italic>. The SIR for a CVE was 1.27 (95% CI 0.82–1.87) and for females separately aged 40–49 years was 8.00 (95% CI 1.65–23.38). The overall SIR for MI was 2.31 (95% CI 1.34–3.7), for females overall was 1.75 (95% CI 0.84–3.22) and for females aged between 40 and 49 years was 8.7 (95% CI 1.1–31.4). The time to an event was significantly shorter among SLE patients (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001) and was predicted by hypertension adjusted for smoking and disease. High SLEDAI and anti-cardiolipin IgG antibodies predicted an event in Cox proportional hazards regression models adjusted for age and previous MI. Diabetes, smoking ever and sex did not affect the prediction models.</p>
<p><italic>Conclusion</italic>. The risk of a CVE, or MI, was eight- or nine-fold greater among middle-aged female SLE patients. Time to event was significantly shorter and CVE was associated with SLE-related factors including hypertension and age.</p>

<p>Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a multi-organ inflammatory disease with increased morbidity and mortality due to atherosclerosis-associated diseases.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0961203311425524">1</xref></sup> Over the last two decades several studies have determined the incidence rate of cardiovascular disease (CVD), and evaluated the role of traditional and disease-related risk factors in the development of CVD in SLE patients. Except for elderly women, the incidence rate of CVD in SLE patients is generally higher compared with the general population.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0961203311425524">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0961203311425524">3</xref></sup> The risk of developing CVD, including myocardial infarction (MI), coronary artery disease and stroke among SLE patients is variously reported to be 2- to 50-fold greater.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0961203311425524">4</xref></sup><sup>–</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0961203311425524">6</xref></sup> The variation may be explained by the selection of patients and controls, age stratification and different analysis methods used.

<p>The aims of this study were to follow-up the incidence of cardiovascular events (CVEs), i.e. MI and stroke, and to identify predictors for CVEs in a cohort of SLE patients from the northern-most region of Sweden. The standard incidence ratio (SIR) for CVE was calculated in comparison with the standard population from the same catchment area. The association of SLE-specific risk factors and some traditional risk factors for CVEs was evaluated by comparison with matched population controls.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec2-0961203311425524" sec-type="subjects"><title>Patients and controls</title>
<p>All patients with possible SLE disease were identified from the registers of 4 rheumatology, 12 internal medicine and 3 dermatology departments, from all 140 primary healthcare centres and one private practitioner from the four northern-most counties of Sweden for the year 2000. Rheumatologists assessed all patients and a total of 277 (234 females and 43 males) patients, fulfilling at least 4 of the 1982 SLE ACR classification criteria and the updated criteria, were identified.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0961203311425524">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0961203311425524">15</xref></sup> Of these patients 269 were willing and able to be assessed clinically and by laboratory analyses for disease activity according to the SLE Disease Activity Index (SLEDAI)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0961203311425524">12</xref></sup> and for organ damage with the SLICC/ACR-DI.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0961203311425524">13</xref></sup> Of the eight patients unavailable three were bedridden in nursing homes, one had psychosis and dementia and four were unwilling to participate. Another nine patients did not wish to donate blood samples. Demographic and significant clinical data, ongoing and previous treatment (corticosteroids and disease modifying anti-rheumatic drugs [DMARDs]) for SLE (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0961203311425524">Table 1</xref>) and anti-hypertensive medication, and smoking habits were recorded at baseline (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0961203311425524">Table 2</xref>). Anti-cardiolipin antibodies of the IgG class (aCL IgG) were analysed using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA; Orgentec, Mainz, Germany). (Cut-off value was &gt;10 RU/ml according to the manufacturer.) Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and C-reactive protein (CRP) were measured by routine laboratory methods.

<p>All 277 SLE patients were followed-up after 7 years by cross-reference to the register from the National Board of Health in Sweden to obtain data on hospital in-patient care and/or death with a diagnosis of a new event, e.g. MI (ICD-10; I21.0-9, I22.0-1, I22.8-9) and/or stroke (ICD-10; I61.0-6, I61.8-9, I62.9, I63.0-6, I63.8-9 and I64) during the intervening period (1 January 2001 to 31 December 2007). Two patients were lost to follow-up. An examination of the validity of the diagnosis of an event, defined as above, by analysing the hospital records gave a positive predictive value of 96%. Previous CVD as recorded according to SLICC/ACR-DI were as follows: 18 registered with a previous MI (diagnosis by electrocardiogram and increased enzymes) of whom 13 also had angina pectoris (AP) or coronary artery bypass graft (CABG); 15 with AP or CABG; and 43 (15.9%) with a prior cerebral vascular accident.</p>
<p>To analyse for the SIR for MI, and stroke (defined by ICD-10), i.e. the ratio of the observed incidence in SLE patients during the 7-year follow-up with that expected from the incidence in the standard population, based on sex and 5-year adjusted rates in the population from the four northern-most counties, i.e. the same geographic origin as the patients, was calculated. Data were extracted for the standard population from the National Board of Health and from Statistics Sweden.</p>
<p>In order to identify predictors for a CVE (i.e. MI and/or stroke by ICD-10) and to calculate time to an event a control group of 520 age- and sex-matched controls were recruited from the Medical Biobank of northern Sweden, a population-based biobank with collected data on smoking habits and blood pressure (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0961203311425524">Table 2</xref>). These controls were identified from the same year as the patients’ assessment and were also followed-up 7 years later by co-analysis of the registers for hospital in-patient care and/or death from National Board of Health. Three controls were lost to follow-up.</p>
<p>The study was approved by the Regional Ethics Committee of the University Hospital in Umeå and all participants gave their written informed consent.</p>
<sec id="sec3-0961203311425524"><title>Statistics</title>
<p>SIR calculations were performed relative to the standard population of the same geographic origin as the SLE patients. The age of each patient at entry into the study and throughout the follow-up period has been taken into account. The expected number of events in SIR is calculated using the same mortality pattern as the SLE patients and the official regional risks for a first CVE published in 1-year periods and in age intervals of 5-years. Confidence intervals are obtained by treating the observed number of events as Poisson variables with expectation equal to the expected number. To ensure comparability in the study the biobank controls SIR calculations were also performed using the standard population-based figures.</p>
<p>Cox proportional hazards simple and multiple regression models with fixed-time covariates were used to identify predictors for the first CVE. Covariates expected to be of importance based on clinical experience, previous studies and with statistical significance (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.2) in simple Cox models were tested in a few candidates of multiple regression models. Adjustments were MI and/or AP with intervention according to SLICC/ACR-DI. Since a prior cerebral vascular accident was not validated as a stroke it was not adjusted for. The chi-squared test was used for comparison of categorical data between patients and matched controls. Calculations were performed using PASW Statistics 18.0 (SPSS, Chicago, IL, USA)</p></sec></sec>
<sec id="sec4-0961203311425524" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title>
<p>The overall SIR for the patients with SLE for a CVE (MI and/or stroke) was 1.27 (95%CI 0.82–1.87), but was significantly greater for females in the age group 40–49 years, i.e. 8.0 (95% CI 1.65–23.38). The SIR was not significant for other female groups stratified for age or males, either overall or age stratified (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0961203311425524">Table 3</xref>). The overall SIR for an MI <italic>per se</italic> was 2.31 (1.34–3.7), for both sexes with the highest value for the 40–49 years age group. In females, the overall SIR for MI was 1.75 (95% CI 0.84–3.22) but for those aged 40–49 years it was 8.7 (95% CI 1.1–31.4) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0961203311425524">Table 4</xref>). To ensure comparability between the two control populations calculations were performed for the controls from the biobank giving a SIR for first CVE for males of 0.94 and for females of 1.05.

<p>Of the 275 patients with follow-up data in the SLE cohort, 17 (6.2%) suffered a MI compared with 20 (3.9%) subjects from amongst the 517 controls, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001. In addition a stroke occurred in eight (3.2%) patients and eight in controls (1.6%) during the follow-up. The mean (SD) age for the patients with MI was 69.6 (13.0) years and 64.8 (11.5) years in those with stroke. During the 7-year follow-up period, the time until a CVE was significantly shorter amongst SLE patients compared with matched controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0961203311425524">Figure 1</xref> Kaplan–Meier; log rank Mantel–Cox test 13.955, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001, Breslow [generalized Wilcoxon] 13.281, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001, Tarone–Ware 13.62, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001). The time to a CVE was predicted by hypertension HR = 2.90 (95% CI 1.15–7.31) when adjusted for smoking habits (ever smoker versus non-smoker) and SLE disease (data not shown). The MI or the stroke was fatal in five and two patients, respectively, with death occurring 0–11 days after the diagnosis of a CVE. During the 7-year follow-up period, 40 of 277 patients had deceased, as had 32 of the 258 (12.4%) who were available for comparison with controls. The corresponding number among controls was 18 (3.5%).

<p>A history of a previous MI and AP with intervention, cerebral vascular accident (according to SLICC/ACR-DI), age at inclusion, disease duration, treatment for hypertension, aCL IgG antibodies and higher SLICC (as continuous and categorical data) all predicted significantly a CVE in a simple regression analysis within the SLE group (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-0961203311425524">Table 5</xref>). Sex, diabetes, smoking habits (ever smoker versus non-smoker), inflammatory activity (ESR/CRP), high doses of steroids (prednisolone ≥10 mg/day versus &lt;10 mg/day), SLEDAI and ACR criteria (≥5 versus &lt;5) or any of the other events (pulmonary infarction, venous thrombosis and aortic rupture) did not predict a subsequent CVE (data not shown). A high SLEDAI or the presence of aCL IgG antibodies predicted an event in multiple regression models adjusted for age (or age × age, data not shown) and previous CVD (MI and/or AP with intervention) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-0961203311425524">Table 5</xref>). SLEDAI (HR = 1.16, 95% CI 1.06–1.26) and aCL IgG antibodies in the same model (HR = 3.08, 95% CI 1.32–7.17) predicted an event when adjusted for a prior MI and/or AP with intervention, and for age. In sub-analyses, using stroke or MI as dependent variable separately, stroke (<italic>n</italic> = 8) but not MI was predicted by aCL IgG antibodies (HR = 4.05, 95% CI 1.01–16.18 and HR = 1.80, 95% CI 0.63–5.18, respectively). The estimated HR using Cox proportional hazards simple and multiple regression with the same variables as in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-0961203311425524">Table 5</xref>, with MI as dependent variable, in addition to the change of aCL IgG antibodies, reduced the HR for SLEDAI (adjusted for previous MI and age) and for previous cerebral vascular accident (according to SLICC/ACR-DI) but increased the HR for SLICC/ACR-DI (categorized as ≥4 versus &lt;4).

<p>In this study including all individuals from the northern-most counties of Sweden diagnosed with SLE, the SIR for a CVE, i.e. a MI and/or stroke, in females, aged 40–49 years, was 8.0, and 8.7 for a MI compared with the standard population from the same area. The risk of a MI for combined female and male patients was approximately twice that of the reference population.</p>
<p>This is, to the best of the authors’ knowledge, the first study in which a cohort of all of the patients diagnosed with SLE, from a defined catchment area, has been compared with the whole population representing the same ethnic population. Our results confirm the increased incidence of a CVE in SLE patients. Although the incidence of a MI and/or stroke in SLE patients in other studies varies due to different study protocols including the selection of patients and controls, the overall incidence of a MI is above two.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0961203311425524">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0961203311425524">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0961203311425524">6</xref></sup> Whilst stratification for age in female patients produces highly disparate results, our observations complement those published by others.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0961203311425524">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0961203311425524">6</xref></sup> Our result that the risk of a MI was not significantly raised in female patients (relative risk [RR] = 1.75, 95% CI 0.84–3.22) contrasts with that presented by Hak <italic>et al</italic>.,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0961203311425524">4</xref></sup> who reported for females a RR of 2.81 (95% CI 1.72–4.59) although that study involved fewer (<italic>n</italic> = 148 versus 277) SLE patients and the study designs differed.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0961203311425524">4</xref></sup> That study did not present age-stratified risk analyses, an approach emphasized by Manzi <italic>et al</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0961203311425524">6</xref></sup> who reported a significantly increased risk of a MI (RR = 52.43, 95% CI 21.6–98.5) amongst females aged 35–44 years with SLE and those aged 55–64 years (RR = 4.21, 95% CI 1.7–7.9). The SIR for a MI in our study was 8.7 (95% CI 1.1–31.4) for females aged 40–49 years. Although the present study contained fewer patients than that of Manzi <italic>et al</italic>.,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0961203311425524">6</xref></sup> it did comprise a homogenous population with the controls being from the same area. The patients in this study were unselected and included all individuals fulfilling the criteria for SLE from a defined geographical region. In one earlier retrospective study the risk of a MI, coronary heart disease or stroke in SLE patients compared with the estimated rate of such events was 10.1 (95% CI 5.8–15.6), 7.5 (95% CI 5.1–10.4) and 7.9 (95% CI 4.0–13.6), respectively.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0961203311425524">16</xref></sup> Based on a hospital discharge register the increased risk for hospitalization due to a MI was calculated to be 2.27 (95% CI 1.08–3.46) among female SLE patients, aged 18–44 years.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0961203311425524">2</xref></sup> However, there was no significant increase in hospitalization rates due to a MI for female SLE patients aged ≥44 years compared with the matched controls.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0961203311425524">2</xref></sup> Consistent with other studies there was a relative decrease in the risk with age, which we consider reflects the increased incidence associated with age as seen amongst controls.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0961203311425524">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0961203311425524">6</xref></sup> At ≥80 years male SLE patients had a seven-fold elevated risk of suffering a MI, whereas when considered together females and males had a five-fold elevated risk of a MI, compared with the standard population. However, the calculation of SIR is weakened due to the expected number of events in the standard population is low despite the highest calculated risk since the number of individuals is small particularly of males above 80 years. Thus, the results achieved for this highest age group must be interpreted with caution.</p>
<p>That no elevated risk of a CVE, i.e. either MI or stroke, except for females aged 40–49 years, was found is consistent with the results published by Hak <italic>et al</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0961203311425524">4</xref></sup> They presented a RR for any CVE as being &gt;2-fold greater for SLE patients, a value that remained for coronary heart disease but not for stroke when the data was stratified. Studies by Ward using the California Hospital Discharge database also showed an increased proportionate morbidity ratio of approximately 2 for stroke amongst female SLE patients aged 18-44 years (Crude ratio; 2.05, 95% CI 1.17–2.93).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0961203311425524">2</xref></sup> Bessant <italic>et al</italic>.,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0961203311425524">16</xref></sup> found an increased risk for stroke amongst patients but not for coronary heart disease when compared with hypothetical matched comparators. Also Esdaile <italic>et al</italic>.,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0961203311425524">17</xref></sup> using calculated controls, found a significantly increased RR for stroke. The number of patients in this study affected by a stroke was small and therefore, precluded sub-analyses related to stroke.</p>
<p>Another aim of this study was to identify predictors for CVE amongst SLE patients by comparison with sex- and age-matched controls from the same region followed over the same period and using recorded information on hypertension and smoking habits. The time to a CVE was significantly shorter among the SLE patients than expected; furthermore, the time to an event was predicted by hypertension adjusted for smoking habit (ever smoker versus non-smoker) and disease. Hypertension is one of the identified traditional risk factors for a CVE in SLE patients.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0961203311425524">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0961203311425524">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0961203311425524">18</xref></sup> Unfortunately no data on lipid levels in patients and controls was available for further analysis of this risk factor.</p>
<p>The impact of disease-related and traditional risk factors was analysed within the SLE patient group. Using a simple regression model a new event was predicted: a prior MI, AP with intervention or cerebral vascular accident (defined according to SLICC/ACR-DI), age at inclusion, disease duration, higher SLICC/ACR-DI, aCL IgG and hypertension. In multiple regression models aCL IgG and SLEDAI adjusted for age and previous MI (and AP with intervention) predicted a new CVE. However, factors, i.e. smoking, sex or medication, that would be expected to be associated with a new event were not.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0961203311425524">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0961203311425524">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0961203311425524">20</xref></sup> Diabetes was more common among SLE patients with a CVE compared with other SLE patients.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0961203311425524">18</xref></sup> Consistent with the results presented here, this traditional risk factor for CVD has not been shown to be significantly associated with CVD in subsequent analyses of SLE patient.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0961203311425524">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0961203311425524">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0961203311425524">22</xref></sup> Greater disease activity, measured as SLEDAI-2K, has been identified as a risk factor for developing coronary artery disease.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0961203311425524">10</xref></sup> SLE disease has recently been identified as one of three predictors for coronary artery disease.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0961203311425524">22</xref></sup> In contrast to other reports, an increased inflammatory activity, measured as CRP and/or ESR, was not associated with an increased risk in the patients.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0961203311425524">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0961203311425524">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0961203311425524">22</xref></sup> Studies of the impact of corticosteroids have rendered conflicting results and we found no relationship with risk of a CVE,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0961203311425524">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0961203311425524">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0961203311425524">11</xref></sup> nor that anti-malarials were protective against CVE as others have suggested, although this has recently been classified as being of low evidence rate.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0961203311425524">23</xref></sup> We have shown that the presence of aCL IgG predicted a new CVE; however, sub-analyses revealed aCL IgG antibodies predicted stroke but not MI, which is consistent with a recent study by Svenungsson <italic>et al</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0961203311425524">24</xref></sup> Contradictory results have been presented concerning the association of anti-phospholipid antibodies,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0961203311425524">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0961203311425524">25</xref></sup> and antibodies to β<sub>2</sub>-glycoprotein1,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0961203311425524">26</xref></sup> with ischaemic heart, cerebrovascular and peripheral vascular diseases, respectively, whilst only lupus anticoagulant was associated with MI in SLE patients.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0961203311425524">27</xref></sup> Comparison of results must, therefore, be made with caution as different methods of antibody analysis have been used, with different results, as has been discussed in relation to the diagnosis of anti-phospholipid syndrome <italic>per se</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0961203311425524">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0961203311425524">29</xref></sup> Studies on endpoints other than CVE, i.e. for atherosclerosis as carotid plaque,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0961203311425524">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0961203311425524">31</xref></sup> progression of carotid plaque<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0961203311425524">32</xref></sup> and coronary artery atherosclerosis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0961203311425524">33</xref></sup> have also shown a wide range of traditional and SLE specific risk factors such as a greater age at diagnosis, longer disease duration and higher SLICC/ACR-DI, in addition to higher homocysteine and triglyceride concentrations.</p>
<p>One limitation of the present study is the relatively low number of SLE patients, particularly male patients, although it does include all prevalent cases in the four northern-most counties of Sweden. However, from calculations based on the population figures for northern Sweden the expected number of cases were identified compared with prior studies.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0961203311425524">34</xref></sup><sup>–</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0961203311425524">38</xref></sup> We maintain that identifying all of the patients within a defined area provides a patient group that is truly representative and enables comparison with a population-based control group.</p>
<p>The SIR calculations for the patients are based on diagnoses from hospital in-patient care registers and the death register as for the population. There is a limitation of the true number of cases since neither the patients nor the controls were followed up by any clinical, radiological or laboratory examination; therefore, it is possible that silent incidence cases may have been missed. Unfortunately, we lack the collection of data during the follow-up time to calculate for time-varying predictors.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec6-0961203311425524" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title>
<p>From the present study we conclude that a SLE patient has a two-fold greater risk for a CVE and among middle-aged females the risk is nine-fold higher compared with the reference population from the same area. Hypertension and age were the only traditional cardiovascular risk factors analysed in this study that predicted a CVE. A high SLEDAI score and the presence of IgG aCL antibodies were the strongest disease-related predictors.</p></sec>
