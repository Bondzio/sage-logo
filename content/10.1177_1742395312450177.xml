<abstract>
<p><bold>Objective:</bold> To explore the experiences of young women with developmental dysplasia of the hip explicating the impact of peri-acetabular osteotomy surgery and recovery in the short and longer term.</p>
<p><bold>Design:</bold> Postings of five, selected women on an online active message board aimed at women with developmental dysplasia of the hip were analysed. Interest lay on their postings after they had had peri-acetabular osteotomy surgery. Data analysis was performed through the approach of interpretive phenomenological analysis.</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> The time length of the postings for the cases ranged from 1 year to 6 years, and the number of postings varied substantially, from 48 to 591. Two major concepts were prominent across participants’ accounts. The first concept, ‘body image’, centred on affects on the women’s self-esteem and body image. The second, ‘the long road to recovery’, highlighted ‘the emotional and physical battle of learning to walk’ and concerns with ‘saving my joints’.</p>
<p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Developmental dysplasia of the hip potentially provides a critical case for exploration of the process of how a disability can affect confidence, self-esteem and body image. Recovery from this condition requires enormous effort, resilience and commitment from the women.</p>

<sec id="sec1-1742395312450177" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title>
<p>This paper explores the experiences of young women diagnosed with developmental dysplasia of the hip (DDH), following their journey from the time of having peri-acetabular osteotomy (PAO) surgery through rehabilitation and ongoing recovery. It seeks to provide insight into their experiences, in particular the multiple challenges that they faced, the aftermath immediately following surgery and the lengthy rehabilitation phase. It builds on an earlier article<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1742395312450177">1</xref></sup> that reported findings on their search for a diagnosis and appropriate treatment. Each paper is situated against a different set of theoretical health-illness literature as befits the findings within the study. The previous paper drew on literature around the areas of facing a diagnosis, adjusting to the diagnosis and deciding on future treatments. The current paper draws on literature around issues of confidence, self-esteem and body image. Given the paucity of literature on this topic area within DDH, this paper draws on literature on other conditions that affect young women in a similar way in order to illustrate the potential psycho-social problems that such debilitating conditions can lead to.</p>
<p>All the young women had late-presenting DDH. Typically, these women either have residual symptoms from when they were diagnosed as an infant or young child or they have developed symptoms through adolescence and early adulthood. As the condition progresses to degenerative arthritis, there will be an increase in the frequency and intensity of the pain, a noticeable limp and a decrease in mobility.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1742395312450177">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1742395312450177">3</xref></sup> Over time when symptoms become severe, DDH can also cause changes in appearance as the affected leg usually lies in external rotation, so that it appears short, compromising posture, and leading to asymmetry of the shoulders, back, waist and hips and sometimes muscle wasting is detectable.</p>
<p>Surgery is the only real treatment for DDH. One option, PAO, reshapes, redirects or salvages bone in order to preserve the natural joint for as long as possible. Another option, resurfacing or total hip replacement (THR) replaces the entire joint and is used when cartilage is significantly worn. All of the five women in this exploratory study had had a PAO and two were also exploring the option of resurfacing or THR. Both surgical options are invasive; the patient is left with scars around their hips and thighs and internally they will have metal screws and/or plates or a metal hip joint. This is particularly traumatic for young women who may be more concerned about their appearance. Surgery involves a lengthy rehabilitation period, likely to be distressing, as very often the person is on the cusp of early adulthood, at a time of gaining their own independence, going to university, starting work or starting their own families.</p>
<p>The DDH literature has not to date explored the potential psycho-social impact of treatment; only three, personal case study reports could be located. Weeks<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1742395312450177">4</xref></sup> provides a moving account of a woman who has lived her life with DDH and is about to undergo THR surgery. She highlights how the resulting limp and postural problems associated with DDH had a profound effect on both physical and psychological well-being. She talks very openly about her altered body image and low self-esteem prior to surgery and the difficulties she had adjusting post-surgery. Similarly, Wells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1742395312450177">5</xref></sup> talks about a lifetime dealing with her pain, and its profound effect on her quality of life and relationships. Following a double THR, she had to ‘master the art of walking again.’ In contrast, West, a trainee surgeon,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1742395312450177">6</xref></sup> diagnosed in her 20 s, emphasises the pain and quick deterioration in her quality of life (from competing in triathlons to barely being able to walk), rather than the impact on her appearance or her long-term psychological well-being.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec2-1742395312450177"><title>DDH and other comparative conditions</title>
<p>This limited literature on patient experience with DDH demonstrates the potential multiple levels of impact of DDH; the need to deal with physical and functional problems, including pain and mobility; the potential impact of a changed body on body image and self-esteem; problems with psychological well-being and, the need for psycho-social adjustment post-surgery. In order to gain insight into the potential impact of DDH on young women, literature on two other similar conditions, rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and adolescent-onset idiopathic scoliosis (AIS), is explored. Work conducted within these areas is more advanced in that it has moved beyond the level of just considering the functional dimensions and consequences onto focusing on wider psycho-social impact.</p>
<p>Similar to DDH, RA is characterised by pain, loss of functional ability, uncertainty of progression and altered appearance. AIS, again similar to DDH, can radically change appearance, requires surgical treatment and symptoms often begin during adolescence. Scoliosis is a structural deformity, with explicit changes in body appearance. A curved spine can cause someone’s body to tilt to the left or right and often scoliosis causes one shoulder blade to be higher than the other, the waist is uneven and there is a tendency to lean to one side, this latter being similar to DDH.</p>
<p>Looking at research into RA, a number of areas of possible impact of DDH is suggested. Rumsey et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1742395312450177">7</xref></sup> found higher levels of anxiety and depression than for many other groups of patients with visible conditions. Those reporting higher levels of stress talked of embarrassment about the appearance of their joints; they felt their condition was noticeable to others resulting in acute self-consciousness. In addition, participants whose RA arose during adolescence were significantly more likely to express more intense disparagement of the body and concerns about weight and shape.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1742395312450177">8</xref></sup> This was seemingly related only to age of onset rather than duration of illness.</p>
<p>Looking at literature on AIS, several studies have demonstrated a disturbed body image both during adolescence and into adulthood.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1742395312450177">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1742395312450177">10</xref></sup> ‘Body image’ is defined as the attitudes toward one’s own body, including appearance, shape and attractiveness, which is influenced by cultural, social, environmental and individual elements.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1742395312450177">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1742395312450177">12</xref></sup> Sapountzi-Krepia et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1742395312450177">13</xref></sup> found that all adolescents with scoliosis had a poorer body image perception than matched controls, with girls expressing the lowest body image perception. Noonan et al.,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1742395312450177">14</xref></sup> in a study of the long-term psycho-social characteristics of patients treated for scoliosis, found that patients who underwent surgery had a more negative body image of the axial skeleton than the braced and control groups. The authors concluded that transient psychological effects often are present during treatment, and a lower body image may persist for years. However, it is important to note that some women who live with the condition do not have psycho-social issues or concerns about their appearance.</p>
<p>These findings suggest that given its timing and nature, that is, a progressively deforming condition usually affecting young women, DDH is likely to have an associated psycho-social impact. Conditions such as DDH are however difficult to characterise. Some women may consider themselves to have a disability as they are struggling with their mobility; others may see DDH as a disfigurement, that is, ‘a difference from the culturally defined norm which is visible to others.’<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1742395312450177">15</xref></sup> Price<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1742395312450177">16</xref></sup> suggests that women see their legs as a social attribute and therefore a visible difference<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1742395312450177">17</xref></sup> in gait or posture may lead to anxiety and self-consciousness. Moreover, a substantial body of literature indicates that individuals living with a visible difference often have difficulties developing a positive self-concept and body image, secondary to the social barriers they encounter.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1742395312450177">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1742395312450177">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1742395312450177">18</xref></sup></p>
<p>In summary, research in two comparable conditions suggests that women with DDH, particularly those who are more debilitated, may be more vulnerable and at risk of psycho-social problems and suffer residual problems after surgical treatment. To recover from surgery, a level of psychological adaptation will be needed. While surgery may be clinically successful from a physical perspective, exploring and understanding its psycho-social impact is very important, with little research to date in this area particularly after surgical treatment.</p>
<p>This paper aims to provide insight into experiences of PAO surgery and recovery, in particular, the multiple challenges that the women faced and the lengthy rehabilitation phase.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec3-1742395312450177" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title>
<p>An exploratory study was conducted selecting five women who were regular posters on an active message board established for persons with DDH. Each of the women posted over an extended period of time pre- and post-PAO (one up to 6 years), and a retrospective period of discussions was downloaded into a Microsoft Word document. The paper draws on data from these selected participants from their first posting post-PAO surgery. Interpretative phenomenological analysis (IPA) was used to order to draw out participant’s meanings surrounding particular experiences. One author read the first transcript in detail, identified significant, interesting themes and then applied these themes across the other four transcripts, adding additional themes as necessary. Both authors then independently listed these themes and organised them into meaningful clusters with any disagreement resolved through discussion. University ethical approval for the study was obtained. In order to protect the anonymity of its members, the message board is not identified and each woman is given a pseudonym. Full details of the methods are reported in our previous paper.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1742395312450177">1</xref></sup></p>

<p>The selected participants all had a PAO (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1742395312450177">Table 1</xref>). For one of the women (Catrin), the PAO was successful and she experienced a smooth recovery. For two of the women (Heidi and Beth), the PAO was unsuccessful; they subsequently had, respectively, a THR and a resurfacing. The two others (Anna and Keely) were bilateral; Anna had her second PAO a few months after the first and Keely was currently awaiting her second PAO. The time length of the postings for the cases ranged from 1 year to 6 years, and the number of postings varied substantially, from 48 to 591 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1742395312450177">Table 1</xref>).

<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1742395312450177">Figure 1</xref> shows the cluster surrounding this master concept. Its central focus lies on the women’s description of how living with DDH has affected their body image, challenging their identity and the way they view themselves as young women, a theme that was continued from pre-surgery. Just after surgery noticing their posture was ‘more normal,’ the women began to reflect on the impact that DDH has had on their lives.
<fig id="fig1-1742395312450177" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p>The first concept and associated cluster of subordinate themes.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1742395312450177-fig1.tif"/>
</fig></p>
<p>Analysis of their posts indicate a lowered self-esteem resulting from the more physical characteristics of DDH including an altered posture, a visible limp and weight gain. All these factors together comprise their notion of body image affecting their self-esteem. The weighting of these dimensions varies depending on the time of diagnosis (as an infant or child versus early adulthood).</p>
<p>For the women diagnosed in childhood (Beth, Heidi and Keely), whose symptoms were very debilitating before they sought treatment,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1742395312450177">1</xref></sup> postural changes were happening gradually over a long period of time. They became used to their ‘altered’ appearance and described finding it difficult to imagine being any other way. They were aware they looked unusual but they saw it as part of their own identity. Beth described feeling ‘used’ to her body even though she perceived it as being different from other peoples. Over a number of posts these women described adapting aspects of their life to match the physical changes presented by DDH. For example, Beth commented: ‘I can’t wear normal clothes … I have kind of just given up on myself – I also live in trainers which limits your wardrobe to trousers. I don’t feel very feminine.’ (Beth) A similar description is given by Keely who began to adapt her clothing to hide the parts of her body that she was not comfortable with.<disp-quote>
<p>It affects what I wear. I tend to wear baggy clothes, then you can’t see the lines of my body … . Trousers are a nightmare because my posture is so bad one leg is longer than the other. At the gym I won’t wear tights or shorts as I have a lot of muscle wastage. (Keely)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>Both cases demonstrate the severe level of physical changes that occurred before surgery and their efforts to mask the outward appearance of their DDH, and how this made them feel less feminine. Limping was another area they tried to mask. Beth talked at length about how she had limped for most of her life and the impact this had on her confidence and self-esteem as an adult, whereas Keely focused more on the pain illustrating how debilitating DDH could be and was embarrassed she could not do normal things.<disp-quote>
<p>I got picked on at school for ‘walking strangely'. This made me very self conscious as an adult. (Beth)</p>
<p>I would get sharp stabbing pains in my hip that would stop me in my stride it was embarrassing when I went shopping. (Keely)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>All three (Beth, Heidi and Keely) felt their posture and limp attracted unwanted attention, and as they did not like being asked about their hips, they tended to avoid new social situations. ‘I must have been in denial not really wanting to think about how other people saw me so I avoided going out’ (Beth). This social stigma attached to DDH caused a lot of anxiety. Through her work Heidi had to go out and meet people but she developed strategies to cope:<disp-quote>
<p>I always make sure I can sit down and that I am the last to leave so that no one can see me limping … . It's affected my confidence at work I am always thinking who will I meet … how far will I need to walk. (Heidi)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>The women also posted about their anxieties concerning gaining weight as a result of being inactive; this made them feel ‘generally out of sorts with their bodies.’ They discussed the real difficulties they faced trying to control or lose weight. They also talked about how this added to their view of themselves and their low self-esteem. Despite describing how DDH had such a profound impact on their identity and the extreme ways they adapted their lifestyle to compensate, all three women had delayed seeking treatment for many years, exacerbating their low self-esteem and body image problems, which in turn affected the recovery process. The next theme ‘New Hip New Me’ highlights how difficult the women found coping and adjusting to their new hip and their long struggle to recover psychologically and move on with their lives.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec8-1742395312450177"><title>New hip new me</title>
<p>All the women spoke in terms of ‘New Hip New Me;’ however, this had different connotations in relation to time of diagnosis. For those diagnosed in childhood they spoke in terms of looking forward to a better life, where their appearance ‘would be more normal’ and they would regain their confidence and self-esteem. For those diagnosed as an adult ‘New Hip New Me’ was represented in a more staged manner, beginning with coping with surgery (‘my hips don’t feel like mine anymore’) onto experiencing a more debilitated self through rehabilitation, but wanting to be as fit and able as before. This comprised a focus on wanting their own body back to how it was ‘pre hip issues,’ acute awareness of how their body felt different now (‘my hips feel like concrete’) and worrying about the detail or nuances of flexibility and perceptions of leg length differences.</p>
<p>Immediately post-surgery the three women diagnosed in childhood began to discuss how their life could potentially change. Beth commented: ‘This hip stuff has affected my confidence, my relationships, my whole self esteem is shot to bits, I can’t wait to get my life back and do normal things!’ While having great expectations of their lives post-op, new unexpected issues with body image presented themselves and the recovery process was not as quick or easy as they had anticipated. ‘My confidence is still shot. I hate the scars and the thought of metal inside me really freaks me out.’ (Beth)</p>
<p>For Beth, this was coupled with her anxieties about the physical aspects of her condition, not feeling aligned and still struggling to walk as a result of this:<disp-quote>
<p>I kind of understand that it is probably 10 years of not walking properly that has caused my current problems. I still feel really self conscious that I can’t walk or stand up straight … [my] new hip feels strange – I’ve become convinced there is an alignment problem or leg length discrepancy – but have been assured there isn’t. (Beth)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>The women had to work hard at standing up straight. One of the things they were determined to do was walk ‘normally,’ unaided. The posts suggest this was not just from a functional point of view but more an aesthetic view of looking and feeling better, being able to work out and lose weight and feeling more socially confident. However this did not just happen; it was a struggle to walk unaided and the women became very frustrated and emotional. ‘Nine months out of surgery I still limp … I am trying to be positive waiting for the day I can get back into the gym and workout and loose some of the weight … ’ (Keely)</p>
<p>One year on these women found themselves stuck in the process of recovery still unable to get on with their lives. For Beth, the years of social isolation have meant she was unable to move her life forward.<disp-quote>
<p>I have had so many years of pain and crap with my hip, I no longer have a social circle of friends, whereas I thought I would get my life back that’s kind of not happening and I don’t really know where to start. (Beth)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>In contrast, for the participants diagnosed when an adult (Anna and Catrin), the impact of DDH was not expressed so strongly. They described having a painful hip, but it had not reached the stage where they were experiencing postural problems or leg length differences. Their expectations of surgery were high, wanting their hip to be like it was before their first symptoms and diagnosis and, moreover, to be as fit post-surgery as they had been prior to having hip problems. Their issues with self-esteem and body image came after surgery when they made comparisons as to how their hip and bodies used to be before any symptoms. Their alignment felt worse post-surgery, in contrast to being fit, well and relatively mobile before surgery; they now struggled to accept a weakened body. Anna explains the impact of surgery on her body, focusing on her body appearance (related to both her posture and gait and its expressions of pain), feelings of depression and self-consciousness.<disp-quote>
<p>My biggest fear was I wouldn’t be any better post surgery … . During the recovery things didn’t feel right … . I felt lo[p] sided, swollen and weak not like me … my hip was like concrete … I can’t wait to [have] the screws out. I feel like an alien I can feel them sticking out – I can’t wear trousers or tight clothes. Some days I feel depressed and self-conscious, in pain … . (Anna)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>All five women either seemed to still need and/or strongly valued mutual support for a long time (at least for a year) post-surgery, sharing ongoing issues about their hips and aspects of their everyday life after surgery They appeared to have a unique connection with each other and were able to discuss in-depth intimate details about their recovery. They were also quite emotional about the future, seeing their ‘new hip’ as a turning point in their lives or a point where they ‘would get their life back.’ They questioned whether their future pathway was going to be ‘a lifetime of hip problems.’ A posting from Keely illustrates this, pointing to her current hope, but also anxiety about the future:<disp-quote>
<p>The op gave me insight into what life could be like – [But] is this my destiny now, a lifetime of surgery, pain and disability in later in life? I now worry about not being able to walk in the future … I always craved for a NORMAL LIFE but now I’m not sure what a normal life is … (Keely)</p></disp-quote></p>

<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1742395312450177">Figure 2</xref> shows the cluster surrounding the second master concept, ‘the long road to recovery,’ centred on issues arising during their recovery. This cluster highlights two areas: ‘the emotional and physical battle of learning to walk,’ which highlights how emotionally and physically draining the women found learning to walk; and, secondly, ‘saving my joints,’ one of the master concepts arising in their experience post-diagnosis but pre-PAO surgery.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1742395312450177">1</xref></sup> This latter is discussed to give insight into these ongoing fears and how they have changed post-PAO.

<sec id="sec11-1742395312450177"><title>Saving my joints</title>
<p>Post-diagnosis and pre-PAO, this theme illustrated how the women fought to have hip preserving surgery to prolong the ‘life’ of their native hip joint. Now, post-PAO, the women wanted to inform themselves about future risks to their hips, speculating how long their hip may last and how to delay replacement surgery. They asked which activities they could return to without damaging their hip. Anna’s posting indicated both the limited advice received from the surgeon and what she wished to know. She described an almost fatalistic stance of balancing her enjoyment of life and some degree of caution regarding her future mobility. ‘I probed the surgeon for a set of dos and don’ts post surgery – but the advice was vague and left up to me to really … Can I run? How many hip years might I loose?’ (Anna).</p>
<p>These issues were debated throughout recovery. Immediately post-surgery the women wanted to take care of their hip and protect it. But as they started to get stronger, they wanted to test their hip and push the boundaries returning to the gym and running, but still with an underlying awareness of the longer term outcomes. There was a degree of anxiety and worry about doing damage in the short- and long-term and weighing up the pros and cons of living a certain lifestyle. Catrin, who had had 10 years of pain, opted for a much more conservative and conserving approach, valuing her new hip and opting to try to delay surgery as long as possible.<disp-quote>
<p>want to live my life, be happy, go out, go shopping, not worry about my hip, so I have decided to limit exercise to just low impact stuff cycling swimming etc … I feel I have been through enough, it’s been so traumatic. I just want this hip to last as long as possible. (Catrin)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>Moreover, analysis demonstrated that the women who had suffered symptoms in their hips longer tended to be more cautious about their future lifestyle.</p>
<p>Two of the participants did not recover from their PAO; Heidi went on to have a THR within a year and Beth had a resurfacing. Both described a sense of hopelessness at not recovering and again expressed their fear of long-term disability in the future.<disp-quote>
<p>I still have a limp and cannot walk without a crutch. I have gone through all this for nothing. Now I face a hip replacement, isn’t that for old ladies. I now worry how many times they can revise it in the future I fear being completely disabled. (Heidi)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>They still associated replacement surgery as something for older people and still difficulty accepting this surgery as it did not fit with their identity as a young women.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1742395312450177">1</xref></sup></p>

<p>Often, when faced with invasive surgery, people feel that their knowledge is incomplete and that they require further information, particularly personal accounts and experiences from others who have the condition.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1742395312450177">19</xref></sup> Online message boards can be especially valuable where the condition is not well known and restrictions on the person’s lifestyle may be a common experience;<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1742395312450177">20</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1742395312450177"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1742395312450177"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1742395312450177">23</xref></sup> both are the case for DDH. Moreover, surgery for DDH is very specialised; in consequence, many women have to travel for surgery and then return home for their rehabilitation.</p>
<p>It is recognised that this small-scale, exploratory study of five women’s postings on a message board has limitations. In particular, the selected participants may not be representative of those who have DDH (not all will access an online forum) and there is likely to be variability in activity (some members may just be ‘listeners’ rather than active posters). However, the findings both add to the body of knowledge on patient experiences with DDH and cohere with the three existing personal case studies, highlighting some similar themes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1742395312450177">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1742395312450177"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1742395312450177">6</xref></sup> The three of our participants diagnosed in childhood, often with severe DDH, described a lifetime of ‘hip issues’, in particular, dealing with pain and debilitation, resulting in lowered self-esteem, altered body image and challenge to their identity as a young woman; moreover, this often led to some degree of social isolation. These finding have similarities both with the accounts of Weeks<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1742395312450177">4</xref></sup> and Wells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1742395312450177">5</xref></sup> but also with the literature on other conditions affecting young women (RA and scoliosis), leading to a visible difference and mobility issues. The women become fixated on the physical appearance of their condition leading to poor body image and low self-esteem. In many orthopaedic conditions surgery is seen as a fix but residual psycho-social issues may still be present in these young women. The length of time they remain engaged within this support group adds weight to this argument. For our case study women, learning to walk ‘normally’ was an important goal, not just as a means of moving around but for their confidence and to improve their body image.</p>
<p>In our earlier paper we highlighted how, for those diagnosed as adults, diagnosis of DDH came as a complete shock<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1742395312450177">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1742395312450177">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1742395312450177">6</xref></sup> and their difficulties accepting the ‘biographical disruption,’ forcing them to take time out from their lives or make significant changes to their lifestyle. These women were however not as debilitated before their PAO-surgery as, at least in part, they had not been experiencing symptoms for very long. This may explain why they did not describe the same anxieties about their body and appearance prior to surgery as those diagnosed in childhood, but rather focused mainly on the pain and rapid deterioration in their mobility. Their fears and anxieties were centred more around the surgery and recovery. Notwithstanding, they expressed some anxiety about body image and their identity as a woman in that they wanted their ‘old” body back and to feel the same as they did before. They became anxious about the surgical scars, screws and plates they were left with and were very self-conscious about how their body had changed post-surgery, for example, losing flexibility and feelings in their legs. In common with those diagnosed as an infant or young child, they also needed to know they would be able to return to the activities they could do before.</p>
<p>The extension of the exploratory study’s analysis of postings pre-PAO<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1742395312450177">1</xref></sup> onto those post-PAO for the same set of women indicates both continuation and change in the central constructs that summarise their experiences. A number of points arise. First, the first master concept in this and the previous paper is characterised in terms of ‘challenging identity as a young woman.’ Post-diagnosis or resurgence of the symptoms pre-PAO, the emphasis lies on pain, discomfort and compromises to their quality of life, along with realising there was ‘something serious.’ Post-PAO, this challenge is expressed more in terms of lowered self-esteem, changes in self-esteem and threats to body image. Second, it is notable that analysis of the postings post-PAO pointed to re-emergence of the second, pre-PAO master concept of ‘saving my joints.’ Post-PAO, focus lay either on postponing as long as possible a PAO on the other hip and/or ensuring the PAO lasted as long as possible and thus postponing future surgery (THR and/or resurfacing). Pre-PAO, its focus lay on the PAO’s potential as a conserving surgical option.</p>
<p>Further work in a more extended study is warranted, both drawing on this and other DDH-specific websites. It could valuably include interviews to enable exploration of these specific points of interest or ambiguity lying in the postings and to supplement insight into their perspectives. More generally, the findings of our research to date are suggestive of possible areas for inclusion in a condition-specific measurement tool to assist DDH surgeons and other healthcare practitioners to monitor the treatment they provide and to help evaluate treatment effectiveness; this forms the focus of our future work. The subordinate themes and master concepts suggest a range of possible areas, including not just the more physical dimensions of pain and changes in gait or changes in mobility but also psycho-social dimensions including body image, self-esteem, returning to a more ‘normal’ life and ‘feeling feminine again.’ The dynamic content of the postings over time also suggests that the content of any measure should be sufficiently flexible to capture change, in its form and nature over time, and for associated measurement to focus on both short- and long-term outcomes.</p>
<p>In conclusion, our findings build on the extant literature and provide another lens by which to understand the process of how a disability and/or a visible difference can over time, affect confidence, self-esteem and body image in young women. This work highlights that women diagnosed with DDH in childhood are at most risk of developing these problems and many of these residual issues are still present post-surgery. For those women diagnosed later, concerns are centred on coming to terms with their ‘new hip’ and a changed body. Similarities have been drawn to other research on other conditions affecting young women (RA and AIS) where research measuring wider outcomes has already begun. A better understanding of outcomes and patient needs in those conditions has led to the development of psycho-social interventions to prepare women for surgery, rehabilitation and life afterward so that they can go onto have a rich quality of life. A similar approach for DDH would be valuable. Taken together, this and the previous paper<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1742395312450177">1</xref></sup> provide the foundation for a better understanding of outcomes and patient needs in those conditions.</p>
