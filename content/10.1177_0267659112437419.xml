<p><italic>Patients and Methods</italic>: Between January 2008 and December 2010, 1959 consecutive patients underwent CABG, AVR, or both. The choice for pulsatile perfusion (PP, n=220) or non-pulsatile perfusion (NPP, n=1739) was made by the surgeon. Patient propensity score to receive PP or NPP was calculated according to 15 preoperative variables.

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>There is ongoing controversial discussions as to whether pulsatile perfusion (PP) is superior to non-pulsatile perfusion (NPP) during surgery on cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB).</p>
<p>Several devices were used to create pulsatile flow, but the flow pattern and the amplitudes are very heterogenous. Although all devices intend to mimic physiological conditions, the generated pulse pressures are usually much lower than those generated by the native heart. Nevertheless, even low pulse amplitudes of 15-30 mmHg have been shown to be beneficial for the patients’ outcomes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0267659112437419">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0267659112437419">10</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>In the older patients, PP has been shown to improve pulmonary, hepatic and renal organ function compared to NPP<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0267659112437419">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0267659112437419">5</xref></sup>. In pediatric patients, PP decreased the need for inotropic support and improved cerebral blood oxygenation during CPB<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0267659112437419">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0267659112437419">6</xref></sup>. The application of pulsatile flow during CPB also proved to decrease cytokine and endothelin levels<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0267659112437419">10</xref></sup>. Further studies suggest PP to be beneficial, especially in patients with moderate to high operative risk<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0267659112437419">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0267659112437419">7</xref></sup>. On the other hand, a propensity score analysis of 1820 CABG (coronary artery bypass graft) patients did not reveal any significant differences in patient mortality, morbidity and renal function according to the perfusion mode<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0267659112437419">11</xref></sup>. In animal studies, PP resulted in reduced cellular damage of porcine livers, lungs and kidneys<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0267659112437419">8</xref></sup> and improved the cerebral and myocardial microcirculation in pigs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0267659112437419">12</xref></sup>. However, when both perfusion modes were compared in dogs, hemolysis and deformability of red blood cells did not significantly differ<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0267659112437419">9</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>We hypothesize that PP may improve the postoperative outcome regarding transfusion requirements, length of ICU and hospital stay as well as renal function after cardiac surgery. Since some authors identified the individual surgeon and his personal learning curve as major contributors to patients’ short- and long- term outcomes after cardiac surgery, we additionally analyzed our data with regard to the surgeon as a risk factor<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0267659112437419">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0267659112437419">12</xref></sup>. The cutoff point to reach a reassurance boundary during the dynamic phase of the learning curve has been described between 50 and 100 procedures<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0267659112437419">13</xref></sup>. Therefore, we have chosen 100 CPB procedures as a cutoff to discriminate the experienced from the non-experienced surgeon.</p>

<title>Patients and methods</title>
<p>Between January 2008 and December 2010, all patients undergoing on-pump CABG, aortic valve replacement (AVR), or the combination of both were enrolled in this study. A group of 1959 consecutively operated patients were included and split by perfusion mode: either pulsatile (PP, n = 220) or non-pulsatile (NPP, n = 1739). The choice of the perfusion mode was made by the surgeon based on the assessment of the preoperative clinical status of the patient. In order to analyze the impact of the surgeon, we categorized 10 subgroups of surgeons: 9 experienced single surgeons (&gt;100 cases on CPB) and a cumulative group of non-experienced surgeons (&lt;100 procedures on CPB). All patients received preoperative, surgical and postoperative care according to our institutional standards. The data set required for the German Quality Assurance System was registered prospectively for all patients, and logistic as well as additive EuroSCORE were calculated for all patients.</p>

<p>To compensate for lack of randomization and the significant differences in morbidity between the two groups (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0267659112437419">Table 1</xref>), we calculated a propensity score that included 15 preoperative variables, which were potentially correlated with the decision to apply pulsatile perfusion.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0267659112437419">
<title>Cardiopulmonary Bypass</title>
<p>All procedures were performed by median sternotomy and central cannulation of the ascending aorta (24 French aortic cannula, Maquet, Hirrlingen, Germany) and the right atrium (two-stage venous cannula MIC2, sized 32/40 or 36/46 French, Medtronic, Minneapolis, MN, USA). Priming of the extracorporeal system was performed with 1000 ml Ringer solution (Berlin Chemie AG, Berlin, Germany), 500 ml NaCl and 40 ml sodium bicarbonate 8.4% (B Braun, Melsungen, Germany). The heart-lung-machines SIII or SV (Stöckert, Munich, Germany) were used with a roller pump (Stöckert) for all patients. The oxygenators used were either the Affinity NT™ Trillium (Medtronic) or the Capiox RX 25 (Terumo Corp., Tokyo, Japan). We used open perfusion systems with hard-shell reservoirs (Capiox®sx RX). Pump flow rate was kept at 2.2-2.4 l/min/m<sup>2</sup> of body surface in all patients. Hematocrit was maintained at 25-30% during bypass. Arterial pH and pCO<sub>2</sub> were maintained at 7.35-7.45 and 35-45 mmHg, respectively.</p>
<p>In the PP group, pulsatility was produced by accelerating and decelerating the pump rate of 60-80 beats per minutes (bpm) during pulsatile perfusion. Pulsatile flow was started at the beginning of aortic cross-clamping and maintained until the declamping of the aorta. The base flow was set at 40% (60% pulsatile and 40% non-pulsatile). The pulse width was adapted according to the pulse pressure signal of the patient. The roller pump produced an average pulse pressure of 20-25 mmHg during the period of aortic cross-clamping.</p>
<p>In both groups, cardioprotection was achieved either with intermittent cold (4°C) crystalloid cardioplegia (St.Thomas’ solution: 10 mmol NaHCO<sub>3</sub> + 110 mmol NaCl + 25 mmol KCl + 16 mmol MgCl<sub>2</sub>*6H<sub>2</sub>O + 1.2 mmol CaCl<sub>2</sub>*2H<sub>2</sub>O and 1000 ml water for injection) or cold blood cardioplegia (Buckberg protocol: compound of 4 parts oxygenated blood and one part crystalloid solution consisting of: 10 ml Tris 36.34% + 15.8 g glucose.1H<sub>2</sub>O + 658 mg sodium citrate-2H<sub>2</sub>O + 75 mg citric acid + 10 mg potassium chloride + 619 mg sodium chloride + 63 mg NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>.2H<sub>2</sub>O ad 395 ml water for injection, + 20-40 ml potassium chloride 7.45%).</p>
<p>The temperatures in the nasopharynx were measured continuously and lowered to 34-35°C during CPB. Weaning from CPB was commenced at a rectal temperature of 36°C. The mean arterial pressure time was maintained between 60 and 90 mmHg. Anticoagulation during CPB was monitored by activated clotting time, which was maintained &gt;400 sec during CPB.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0267659112437419">
<title>Statistical Analysis</title>
<p>Statistical analyses were performed using the SPSS software (Vers. 19, formerly SPSS Inc., Chicago, USA, now IBM SPSS, Armonk, NY, USA). Since most parameters were not normally distributed (according to the Kolmogoroff-Smirnoff test), continuous variables for pre- and perioperative data were given as medians and interquartile ranges. For univariate comparisons of perioperative data, we used the Mann-Whitney U-test or the Kruskal-Wallis test, as appropriate. The impact of pulsatile perfusion on the length of postoperative hospital stay was analyzed by the log rank test.</p>
<p>Binary logistic regression and Cox regression were applied for multivariate analyses, both backward and forward, including factors with p&gt;0.1 and considering those with p&lt;0.05 as significant. The factors used to calculate the propensity for pulsatile perfusion were: age, gender, body mass index (BMI), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, renal impairment, endocarditis, unstable angina, previous myocardial infarction, previous cardiac surgery, urgency, left ventricular ejection fraction, pulmonary hypertension, diabetes mellitus, cerebrovascular ischemia, peripheral vascular disease. Since the patients were not prospectively randomized, the propensity score for pulsatile perfusion was calculated and included in the regression analyses. Regression models were formed, including logistic EuroSCORE, the propensity score for application of pulsatile perfusion, perfusion mode and surgeon to analyze ventilation time, ICU stay, LOHS, transfusion requirements and postoperative development of renal insufficiency according to the RIFLE criteria. Results are given for the variables remaining in the equation after the final step.</p>
<p>The study had no confirmatory design; the statistical findings have to be considered as explorative ones. Taking into account the high number of comparisons, the differences shown with p-values of 0.001 and below might be regarded as robust, while the threshold of 0.05 might require further confirmatory studies.</p>

<p>Expected <bold>mortality</bold> according to the additive EuroSCORE was 5% in the PP group and NPP group. In order to compensate for underestimation of death in the high-risk groups, the logistic EuroSCORE was calculated and resulted in an expected mortality rate of 8.6% (PP) and 7.2% (NPP) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0267659112437419">Table 2</xref>). The observed unadjusted mortalities were 2.7% (PP) and 1.7% (NPP) without significant difference. The mode of perfusion had no significant impact. The surgeon was identified as a risk factor for mortality for the entire patient group as well as for the low risk patients (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0267659112437419">Table 2</xref>). The logistic regression concerning postoperative mortality (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0267659112437419">Table 4</xref>) indicated the logistic EuroSCORE as the predominant independent risk factor for mortality. The propensity for pulsatile perfusion was also found to be an independent risk factor for mortality. However, the perfusion mode itself had no significant influence on mortality (p = 0.49).</p>
<p>Median postoperative <bold>ventilation time</bold> did not differ between PP and NPP and was independent of the surgeon in the univariate analyses (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0267659112437419">Table 3</xref>). Logistic EuroSCORE and the propensity for pulsatile perfusion were independent predictive factors for longer ventilation time (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0267659112437419">Table 4</xref>). The multivariate analysis showed that the ventilation time was significantly influenced by the surgeon. The perfusion mode had no statistically significant influence.</p>
<p><bold>Length of ICU stay</bold> was not affected by the perfusion mode. The median of both groups, PP and NPP, was 24 hours. The surgeon was a risk factor for longer ICU stay of the whole patient group in the univariate analysis (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0267659112437419">Table 3</xref>). The results of the Cox regression indicate the risk factor “Logistic EuroSCORE” as highly significant (hazard ratio of 0.796 for each expected percent mortality risk resulting from the logistic EuroSCORE). In addition, the surgeon had significant impact on ICU stay (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0267659112437419">Table 4</xref>).</p>
<p>The <bold>postoperative length of hospital stay</bold> was influenced by the perfusion mode. A stratified evaluation of the mean LOHS, considering morbidity according to the EuroSCORE, showed that the benefit of PP increases with growing risk of mortality (EuroSCORE &gt;7, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0267659112437419">Fig. 1A</xref>). For this particular patient group, the univariate analysis showed a significant influence of the perfusion type (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0267659112437419">Table 3</xref>). In line with these results, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0267659112437419">Figure 2</xref> demonstrates that postoperative hospital stay is the only factor where the confidence intervals of PP and NPP patients do not overlap, indicating a statistically significant difference (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0267659112437419">Fig 2C</xref>). Focusing on survivors, the Cox regression indicated that pulsatile perfusion was beneficial in terms of shorter LOHS (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0267659112437419">Table 4</xref>).</p>

The EuroSCORE adjusted analysis showed that PRBC requirements increased with the estimated perioperative risk. Pulsatile perfusion resulted in a trend to lower PRBC requirements in patients with increased EuroSCORE (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0267659112437419">Table 3</xref>). The multivariate analysis showed a significant impact of the surgeon.

<p>Morbidity calculated by logistic EuroSCORE was the only significant predictor for postoperative impairment of <bold>renal function</bold> according to the RIFLE criteria.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The ongoing controversy about the usefulness of pulsatile perfusion shows that the impact of the perfusion mode on patient outcome has not been sufficiently clarified so far. To gather more information, we performed a propensity score analysis in a large cohort of patients undergoing cardiac surgery in Hannover between Jan 2008-Dec 2010. The study concentrated on a comparison of pulsatile versus non-pulsatile perfusion with regard to standard clinical outcome parameters and renal function according to the RIFLE criteria. A risk factor analysis focused on EuroSCORE and on the experience of the surgeon.</p>
<p>Renal impairment following cardiac surgery is evident in many patients. Predisposing factors are diabetes mellitus, pre-existing renal dysfunction, advanced age, and poor cardiac function. The pathophysiology of postoperative renal failure is multifactorial and potential causes are related to systemic inflammatory response, renal hypoperfusion, and non-pulsatile perfusion<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0267659112437419">14</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>In the presented study we were not able to confirm previous data demonstrating beneficial effects of pulsatile perfusion on postoperative renal function<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0267659112437419">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0267659112437419">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0267659112437419">14</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0267659112437419">16</xref></sup>. This is in accordance with other reports that also failed to prove the ability of pulsatile perfusion to prevent renal damage<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0267659112437419">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0267659112437419">17</xref></sup>. Different parameters, such as urine output, creatinine, blood urea nitrogen (BUN) or glomerular filtration rate (GFR) were used to determine postoperative renal function<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0267659112437419">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0267659112437419">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0267659112437419">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0267659112437419">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0267659112437419">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0267659112437419">18</xref></sup>, but all these parameters are strongly influenced by the postaggression metabolism after major operations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0267659112437419">19</xref></sup>. The decrease of GFR is assumed to be the most sensitive parameter in identifying patients who experience renal damage during cardiac surgery<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0267659112437419">20</xref></sup>. This might explain why several studies that used GFR for this purpose were able to identify pulsatile perfusion as a protective tool to preserve renal function<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0267659112437419">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0267659112437419">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0267659112437419">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0267659112437419">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0267659112437419">21</xref></sup>. Since GFR levels were not consistently recorded in our retrospectively analyzed patients, we decided to evaluate the degree of renal damage by applying the RIFLE criteria, which are based on serum creatinine levels<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0267659112437419">22</xref></sup>. In our study, significantly more patients with preoperative renal impairment were chosen for PP, resulting in significantly higher mean creatinine levels in the PP group compared to the NPP group. Signs for renal impairment scored by the RIFLE criteria were comparable between both groups, indicating no significant influence of the perfusion mode on renal function. However, since the RIFLE score is based on the ratio between the postoperative and preoperative creatinine values, high preoperative values may have caused an underestimation of the resulting renal damage in the PP group. On the other hand, serum creatinine and the RIFLE criteria might be just not sensitive enough to unveil changes in renal microcirculation based on pulsatile perfusion. In contrast to other studies, we were, furthermore, unable to confirm any impact of PP on a reduction of mortality, mechanical ventilation times and the length of ICU stay<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0267659112437419">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0267659112437419">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0267659112437419">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0267659112437419">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0267659112437419">21</xref></sup>. Nevertheless, we found a positive effect of PP on the length of hospital stay, as previously described by others<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0267659112437419">1</xref></sup>. This effect was pronounced in sicker patients, with a mortality risk of 7% or more according to the EuroSCORE. This can be interpreted as a summation effect of several sub-clinical benefits of pulsatile perfusion. In high-risk patients (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0267659112437419">Fig. 1B</xref>), we found a trend to lower transfusion requirements when PP was used. This can be explained by a more physiological microcirculation and fluid balance, followed by a reduced need for supplementary fluid substitution and an increased urine output<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0267659112437419">23</xref></sup>. Previous reports associated PP with higher fibrinogen levels and platelet counts, leading to lower chest tube drainage and less transfusion rates<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0267659112437419">21</xref></sup>. Kang and Sezai reported on reduced hemolysis during pulsatile perfusion<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0267659112437419">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0267659112437419">16</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>As shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0267659112437419">Table 4</xref>, the multivariate risk factor analysis for outcome in this study revealed the logistic EuroSCORE as a valuable tool to assess not only mortality, but several other basic outcome parameters in patients undergoing standard CABG or aortic valve surgery. The individual decision of the surgeon to consider a patient for pulsatile perfusion, reflected by the propensity for PP, correlates with the logistic EuroSCORE for the outcome criteria mortality, ventilation time, and transfusion requirements.</p>
<p>Furthermore, we identified the surgeon’s experience as an important factor that significantly influences ventilation times, ICU stay and transfusion requirements. This is in accordance with other studies that reported surgical expertise as one of the major contributors of favorable outcome in cardiac surgery. Holzhey et al. showed that at least 50 MIDCAB (minimial invasive direct coronary bypass grafting) procedures were necessary to achieve the expertise for an acceptable rate of complications<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0267659112437419">13</xref></sup>. Bolling and colleagues analyzed the likelihood of mitral valve replacement versus repair related to the volume of mitral operations performed by time interval by individual surgeons. While substantial variability in repair rates was observed among low-volume surgeons, the probability of mitral repair increased according to the experience of the surgeon in mitral valve surgery<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0267659112437419">24</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Our propensity adjusted evaluation indicates that the mode of perfusion is of minor relevance concerning the outcome of bypass grafting and/or aortic valve replacement. Since pulsatile perfusion resulted in shorter hospital stay, especially in high-risk patients, a detailed analysis of this subgroup should be performed in future prospectively randomized studies.</p>
<p>The patient’s morbidity, reflected by the logistic EuroSCORE, and the experience of the surgeon appear to be the most important determinants for a successful treatment of these patients.</p>
