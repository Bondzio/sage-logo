<p>This book is a good effort to present the readers a reasonable understanding of how food is grown, processed and sold presently. The authors’ approach to food supply chain, including its safety, regulatory and political dimensions is based on American food supply chain and reflects their economic, cultural and political beliefs. A high point of the book is that it tries to present both the industrial and the sustainability perspectives. The focus on issues of food safety is also noteworthy as this often is ignored in other such attempts on this topic. On the other hand, the book simply raises the issue of how the managers should take advantage of the present and emergent changes in food supply chain but hardly provides any appropriate solutions.</p>
<p>The book is divided into 11 chapters. The noteworthy and attractive feature of the book is that each chapter besides dealing with a particular aspect also uses an illustrative example. Among these, the alfalfa sprouts, Stahlbush Island Farms and Webvan are particularly informative and are likely to compel the readers to stop and think. It also presents two case studies to help the readers understand and appreciate the food supply chain issues faced by the producers.</p>
<p>Chapter 1 introduces the readers to the food supply chain issues and trends from the US perspective backed by authentic secondary data. The authors rightly call for suitable policy interventions and technological innovations to arrest the decline in this sector, so essential for human survival and growth. There is discussion on industrial and the sustainability perspectives but it fails to suggest how to make an easy transition or ways and means to reach a balance or win-win situations.</p>
<p>Chapter 2 deals with issues of food safety including the important threats of tampering and terrorism. It highlights the role of various stakeholders and summarises the present US practices. The chapter presents the industry’s role in food security succinctly including the supply chain consequences of recalls. The authors draw certain conclusions about various firms’ preparedness and ability to meet and manage recall related crises. However, substantial details about these deductions have not been presented which would have made a greater impact.</p>
<p>Chapters 3–5 deal with animal protein, commodity crops, fruit and vegetable supply chain issues and practices. They provide good descriptions of these supply chain designs and practices as well as various initiatives to address a few societal and environmental concerns.</p>
<p>Chapter 6 describes various food regulation and verification mechanisms including the present food certification and rating methods. Readers are introduced to concepts like carbon footprints, credence issues and life cycle assessment. However, the case study presented at the end of the chapter is rather long and does not add much information or punch.</p>
<p>Chapters 7–9 are more relevant from supply chain managers and researchers’ perspectives. They focus on food service, processing, logistics and retailing. Relevant social and environmental issues in supply chains are highlighted. Hotlips Pizza is an interesting, informative and at the same time intriguing company profile which shall force the reader to look, think and act differently. Issues related to sustainability, outsourcing, traceability, inventory, ICT, retail layout and packaging are also described quite effectively in these chapters.</p>
<p>Chapter 10 provides an overview of the very important issue of hunger relief supply chain management which has been getting increasing attention in the recent years. The authors rightly point out the importance of responsiveness in these types of supply chains. They also distinguish between commercial and relief supply chains. One of the highlights of this chapter is the reproduction of possible performance measures for relief supply chains from Baeamon and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-097226291201600114">Balcik (2008)</xref>. The capacity building examples of Working Village International and e-Caupal although good may not be new to the readers. Some more, newer examples could have made the chapter more interesting.</p>
<p>Finally, Chapter 11 summarizes the various challenges and concerns in creating an adequate and satisfying food supply chain. It looks at food security and also describes some emergent solutions to address a few of these. The opportunities and solutions as well as the suggestion to move towards sustainable food supply chains is a praiseworthy and logical conclusion. However, the authors have failed to make a big impact due to lack of sufficient examples or even a good framework for the suggested approaches.</p>
<p>The language used in the book is clear and straight-forward. There are no factual errors or mistakes. The chapter sequencing is also appropriate. Although important from certain perspectives, Chapters 3–5 have been probably given more than desirable coverage in context of the objective of the book. Overall, the methodology adopted by the authors is appropriate. They have been able to furnish some very impressive quantitative and qualitative data. However, the data could have been arranged more impressively.</p>
<p>Overall, the book is quite useful and topical as the consumer interest in ecological and social issues are at all-time high and likely to increase. Predominant US-centricity is a major drawback of the book. There are many interesting portions that the reader may find interesting. From a supply chain stakeholder perspective, I would especially mention Chapters 7, 8 and 9, which fall in this category.</p>
