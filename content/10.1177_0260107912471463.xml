<p>Maurice Lagueux’s book provides a methodological and historical discussion of a central notion in economics. An essay in the original sense of the term, the book sets forth and defends a central thesis, according to which the rationality principle plays a key role in explanation in economics. The rationality considered here should not, however, be understood as a capacity to maximize. Rather it returns, for the author, to the basic idea that human actions generally have a meaning, a reason: people usually act in a rational manner in accordance with what they consider to be the best thing to do. This minimal conception of rationality—which is basically instrumental—admittedly remains vague, but it has the advantage of being neither false nor tautological, unlike more sophisticated conceptions. Lagueux shows that this rationality principle, often ignored or misunderstood, plays a role in explaining economic phenomena comparable to that of laws in the natural sciences. This principle is also seen as sufficient to allow many idealized theoretical models to be interpreted.</p>
<p>The book is in four parts. The first part traces the evolution of the idea of rationality over the history of economic thought. The author shows that the basic minimal idea of rationality, which he proposes reviving, can be found in the writings of economists since at least the late eighteenth century. He then describes two major developments that marked the history of this concept of rationality. The first development, that we owe to the marginalists, was the emergence of a conception of the rational agent as a maximizing agent and of a ‘geometrical image’ of the rationality of the agent maximizing utility. The second major development, revealed preference theory pioneered by Paul Samuelson, introduces a new conception of rationality as consistency in choice, which is the condition for the revealing of distinct preferences. Lagueux emphasizes the limits of this notion: apart from the fact that it is not even a sufficient condition for basic rationality, it turns out to be contradictory as soon as one wants to take into account changes in tastes. These two developments are, according to him, two stages in the ‘occultation process’ of the original rationality principle (p. 49).</p>
<p>The aim of the second part of the book is to put forward an acceptable conception of methodological individualism and to discuss the objections that have been raised in regard to it. This aim is presented as essential, since, Lagueux writes, ‘the rationality principle, at least in the minimal version that I have proposed, supposes an understanding of individual behaviour which is hardly distinguishable from methodological individualism properly understood’ (p. 7). Apart from the importance of not confusing it with ontological individualism, Lagueux emphasizes that methodological individualism does not exclude social interactions being able to play a crucial role in individual behaviours: in this sense, it is not a constructivist methodology, that would require that ‘social entities can be understood as directly resulting from well thought and well planned human actions’ (p. 77). In another respect, the adoption of methodological individualism is no longer synonymous with reductionism. Finally, methodological individualism resists the ‘fragility and multiplicity of selves’ which the recent work of John Davis (2003) and Philip Mirowski (2002) has stressed.</p>
<p>The fourth chapter is devoted to irrationality. How can the rational be distinguished from the irrational on the basis of a minimal definition of irrationality? The answer here is given in a negative way, as Lagueux points out that it is not on the basis of an action’s material description that one can decide on its rational or irrational character. Nevertheless this limitation is not insurmountable, for it is not necessary to be able to draw a firm and definitive line between rationality and irrationality, nor to be able precisely to determine an action’s degree of rationality: the basic idea of rationality is deemed adequate for explaining economic phenomena.</p>
<p>The fifth chapter looks at another objection that could be raised against the principle of minimal rationality: would not a certain idealization of the rationality principle be needed to have a more precise, less ambiguous definition? Lagueux notes that ‘maximal’ formal definitions of rationality—maximization and consistency—are no less free of ambiguity, especially when one wants to define people’s beliefs and preferences. Moreover, he points out that the ‘minimal’ definition is never strictly minimal, for what matters is having a pertinent level of definition for explaining the functioning of the real economy.</p>
<p>The third part of the book deals with how economists have tried to avoid the problems raised by the notion of rationality. In Chapter 6, the author offers a critical examination of Friedmanian instrumentalism, according to which there is no need to ‘be concerned with the unrealistic character of the assumptions of a hypothesis which seems to have fairly well tested implications’ (p. 131). Lagueux’s criticism concerns different aspects of the thesis: the vagueness of the definition of ‘principles’ and ‘implications’ and the fact that the famous examples put forward by Friedman do not rigorously support his thesis. Finally he points out the difference between Friedman’s notion of instrumentalism and the notion of instrumentalism as generally conceived in the physical sciences. Chapter 7 is concerned with the debate between Gary Becker and Israel Kirzner following the publication of Becker’s paper ‘Irrational behavior and economic theory’ in 1962. Becker’s aim was ‘to neutralize objections frequently raised against the role of rationality understood as maximization’ (p. 153). Lagueux shows that what for Becker is the essential element of rationality, that is, responsiveness to new information, is neither a necessary nor a sufficient condition for rationality. This chapter is also the occasion to mention the work of Daniel Dennet and Don Ross, who tend to relativize the centrality of the rationality principle in the social sciences. These authors emphasize the possibility of predicting the behaviour of individuals or entities by ascribing ‘institutional positions’ to them. This work is described as relevant to a parallel rather than competing field of research.</p>
<p>The fourth part of the book is concerned with the specificity of explanation in economics. In chapter 8, taking Armen Alchian’s (1950) founding paper as a point of departure, Lagueux first examines explanation by way of natural selection which, alongside rational explanation, would be another basis for explanation. He shows that although these two types of explanation may at first sight seem complementary, they are fundamentally mutually exclusive and that rational explanation remains more relevant for the level of explanation required for understanding economic phenomena. In the ninth and final chapter, Lagueux emphasizes that certain difficulties associated with explanation are not specific to the social sciences: the work of Wesley Salmon and Bas van Fraassen (to mention only these two) reveal limitations linked to the epistemic nature and the context dependence of explanations in the natural sciences. In view of these difficulties and despite the relative predictive weakness of economics, Lagueux considers that there is no reason to reject rational explanations in the name of an illusory vision of a unified science, of which Hempel’s model would be the standard example.</p>
<p>The scientific and educational quality of the book, as well as the originality of its thesis, unquestionably make it a key work on the subject. The book has many points to recommend it. First, it puts forward a strong thesis, where what is at stake is central for the understanding and orientation of research in economics and more generally in the social sciences. The thesis is backed up by outstanding historical work, summarizing and critically examining the debates that have punctuated the history of economic thought. The book also helps clarify a number of methodological questions, such as the role of causality and the role of law in scientific explanation.</p>
<p>Another of its qualities lies in its proposing an original thesis that questions the very foundations of economic knowledge. Because the book goes beyond the historic divide between the dominant neoclassical current of thought and its heterodox critics, it makes possible a reconfiguration of the area of discussion around new problematics. One example of such reconfiguration is the status of methodological individualism, often criticized for its supposed reductionism. Lagueux defends methodological individualism, showing at what point this constitutes a central element of explanation in the social sciences, an element that historical figures of the heterodoxy as emblematic as Marx or Keynes have not failed to make use of (p. 73). Another example of this reconfiguration: Lagueux reverses a very widespread way of evaluating the scientificity of the social sciences and economics solely according to the exemplary model of the natural sciences. While it is commonplace to say the social sciences are generally less certain and their predictive capacity less well assured, Lagueux emphasizes that even if the rationality principle remains vague and solely instrumental it nevertheless is a principle of explanation that has no equivalent in the natural sciences (and that economists would be ill-advised not to use).</p>
<p>In conclusion, this book seems to be a major contribution to the methodology of economics. It is aimed at a wide readership: not only specialists in methodology or the history of ideas, but all economists and social science researchers open to thinking about the instruments of knowledge.</p>
