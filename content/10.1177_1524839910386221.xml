<abstract>
<p>Because of the large burden of disease attributable to cigarette smoking, a variety of tobacco control interventions, some focused on changing individual behavior and others focused on influencing societal norms, have been introduced. The current study tested the combined effect of behavioral intention and exposure to a comprehensive smoke-free air law as a prospective predictor of taking measures to quit smoking. Participants were 187 adults living in 7 Texas cities, 3 with a comprehensive smoke-free air law and 4 without such a law, who reported current cigarette smoking at baseline and completed a 1-month follow-up interview. Data were collected by telephone administration of a questionnaire. Results showed that, compared with smokers with low behavioral intention to take measures to quit smoking and no exposure to a comprehensive smoke-free air law, the smokers with high behavioral intention and exposure to a comprehensive law had the greatest odds of taking measures to quit smoking. This longitudinal study provides further evidence that the most successful smoking cessation campaigns will be multifaceted addressing individual factors with educational strategies designed to change beliefs and intentions and environmental factors with policy-based interventions.</p>

<p>Cigarette smoking is the leading cause of preventable death in the United States resulting in 440,000 deaths, or almost 1 out of every 5 deaths, annually (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC], 2002, 2003). Because of the tremendous burden of disease that results from cigarette smoking, a wide variety of interventions have been implemented in an effort to prevent and reduce tobacco use. Increasingly, interventions have involved changing public policy related to the use, manufacture, and sale of tobacco products. Despite the success of interventions in lowering smoking prevalence in recent years, more than 20% of adults in the United States continue to smoke (CDC, 2009). Continuing the downward trend in smoking rates requires a thorough understanding among public health practitioners of the effectiveness of different tobacco control strategies.</p>
<sec id="section1-1524839910386221">
<title>Background on Smoke-Free Air Laws</title>
<p>One policy-based tobacco control intervention is the restriction of smoking in worksites and public places. The number and scope of smoke-free air laws passed at the local and state level has increased dramatically over the past 25 years (Eriksen &amp; Cerak, 2008). These smoke-free air laws are primarily intended to protect the public from exposure to secondhand smoke and not to directly motivate smokers to engage in cessation. However, they change the environment in which smoking occurs, and there is growing evidence that they are effective in reducing individuals’ smoking (Bauer, Hyland, Li, Steger, &amp; Cummings, 2005; Fichtenberg &amp; Glantz, 2002; Hahn et al., 2008; Heloma &amp; Jaakkola, 2003; Moskowitz, Lin, &amp; Hudes, 2000). Most of the existing evidence, however, is from cross-sectional studies. One exception is a longitudinal study that tested the effect of local restaurant smoking regulations in Massachusetts on adolescent smoking initiation. The study’s authors concluded that adolescents who lived in towns with strong restaurant smoking policies had significantly lower odds of progressing to established smoking than those who lived in towns with weak policies (Siegel, Albers, Cheng, Hamilton, &amp; Biener, 2008).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-1524839910386221">
<title>Background on the Theory of Planned Behavior</title>
<p>Although smoke-free air laws operate at the environmental level, what happens at the individual level to influence quitting behavior must also be considered. According to the theory of planned behavior (Ajzen, 1991; Ajzen &amp; Fishbein, 1970; Fishbein &amp; Ajzen, 2010), intention, the perceived likelihood of engaging in a certain behavior, is the most important determinant of an individual’s behavior. In the case of quitting smoking, one’s actual quitting behaviors would be determined most strongly by one’s intention to engage in quitting behaviors. Indeed, previous research has demonstrated the usefulness of intention to quit smoking in predicting future smoking cessation behavior (Borland, Owen, Hill, &amp; Schofield, 1991).</p>
<p>In this study, we considered the combined influence of an environmental and an individual factor on quitting behavior. Specifically, we hypothesized that, compared with smokers with low intention to take measures to quit smoking who lived in a city without a comprehensive smoke-free air law, smokers with high intention to take measures who lived in a city with a comprehensive smoke-free air law would be the most likely to take measures to quit (e.g., reducing the amount smoked or using nicotine replacement therapy as a cessation aid). That is, we predicted that exposure to a comprehensive smoke-free air would only be effective in promoting quitting behavior when accompanied by intention to take quitting measures. To test our hypothesis, we used longitudinal data collected from smokers living in seven Texas cities, three with and four without a comprehensive law.</p>

<title>Method</title>
<sec id="section4-1524839910386221">
<title>Participants</title>
<p>Study participants were adults recruited to a longitudinal study conducted by telephone. Participants lived in one of seven Texas cities, three with a comprehensive smoke-free air law (i.e., covers all public places and workplaces, including bars) and four without a comprehensive law. A person was considered a resident of the city if they reported living in the designated city for at least 6 months. They were required to be a resident of the city proper (not the metropolitan area) because of the primary interest in testing the effect of the city smoking regulations. To obtain an adequate sample size of smokers, we oversampled smokers. At baseline, 395 participants reported current cigarette smoking (smoked at least 100 cigarettes in their lifetime and smoked every day or some days at the time of measurement; CDC, 2008). Of these, 187 (47%) completed the follow-up interview. Demographically, 43% of these 187 smokers were male; 43% were non-White; 18% were of Hispanic or Latino ethnicity; 58% had some education past high school; 29% were married; and their average age was 50 (range 18-86 years). Those who were lost to follow-up did not significantly differ from those who were retained in terms of gender, ethnicity, race, marital status, educational status, number of cigarettes smoked per day, intention to take measures to not smoke, and exposure to a comprehensive smoke-free air (chi squares and <italic>t</italic> tests, all <italic>p</italic>s &gt; .21). However, those who were retained were older, <italic>t</italic>(<italic>df</italic> = 376) = −4.87, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1524839910386221">
<title>Procedures</title>
<p>In September and October of 2007, we obtained a quota sample of adults from seven preselected Texas cities by random digit dialing. Data were collected by computer-assisted telephone interviews. The adult in the household whose birthday had most recently passed was selected for the interview. Three callbacks were conducted to try to reach the identified individual. Data were collected until a target sample of 50 current and former smokers and 50 nonsmokers each was obtained from Austin, Dallas, El Paso, Fort Worth, Lubbock, and San Antonio and 100 current and former smokers and 100 nonsmokers was obtained from Houston. All participants answered questions about attitudes and perceptions of smoking and smoke-free air laws in the city where the person lives, reported exposure to smoking-related messages, and reported demographic information. Participants who reported current cigarette smoking answered additional questions about their smoking behavior and taking measures to quit smoking. Only those who reported current smoking were included in the current study. At the end of the baseline interview, smokers were asked if they wished to participate in a follow-up 5-minute interview. Those who agreed were asked for their name and telephone number and called back 30 days after the initial interview. At follow-up, participants responded to the same measures of smoking behavior administered at baseline. As in the baseline interviews, three callbacks were conducted to try to reach the smokers who agreed to participate in the follow-up interview. The study was approved by the Indiana University Institutional Review Board.</p>

<title>Measures</title>
<sec id="section7-1524839910386221">
<title>Taking measures to not smoke</title>
<p>The outcome variable for this study was created by dividing participants into those who at follow-up reported taking one or more measures to not smoke cigarettes (<italic>n</italic> = 101) or reported taking no measures to not smoke (<italic>n</italic> = 86). Taking measures to not smoke included reporting not smoking in the past 30 days, stopping smoking for 1 day or longer because of trying to quit, and engaging in a specific smoking cessation behavior (e.g., using nicotine replacement therapy).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-1524839910386221">
<title>Demographic characteristics</title>
<p>Study participants reported their age, gender, race, ethnicity, marital status, and level of educational attainment. For analyses, participants were divided into White versus non-White for race, Hispanic/Latino versus not Hispanic/Latino for ethnicity, married versus unmarried for marital status, and high school or less versus some college or more for educational status. Age was treated as a continuous variable.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-1524839910386221">
<title>Smoking behavior</title>
<p>Because amount of smoking is an indicator of nicotine dependence and therefore a predictor of cessation (Heatherton, Kozlowski, Frecker, &amp; Fagerstrom, 1991), the amount of cigarettes smoked per day was included as a covariate. This was measured with participants’ report of the number of cigarettes they usually smoke in a day (mean = 14; range 1-60).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-1524839910386221">
<title>Behavioral intention/exposure to comprehensive smoke-free air law</title>
<p>At baseline, participants responded to six items asking about their intention to take measures to not smoke cigarettes in the next month (e.g., “How likely is it that you plan to take these measures in the next month?”). All items were scored on a scale ranging from 1 to 5, and internal consistency was .804. An overall intention score was computed by taking the mean of items with available responses. A median split was used to divide participants into those with high intention and those with low intention. Participants were also divided into those who lived in a city with a comprehensive smoke-free air law (Austin, El Paso, and Houston; <italic>n</italic> = 89; 48%) versus those who lived in a city without a comprehensive smoke-free air law (Dallas, Fort Worth, Lubbock, and San Antonio; <italic>n</italic> = 98; 52%). For the predictor variable of interest, participants were divided into four groups, those with high intention and exposure to a comprehensive law (<italic>n</italic> = 45), those with high intention and no exposure to a comprehensive law (<italic>n</italic> = 45), those with low intention and exposure to a comprehensive law (<italic>n</italic> = 44), and those with low intention and no exposure to a comprehensive law (<italic>n</italic> = 53).</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-1524839910386221">
<title>Statistical Analyses</title>
<p>First, we fit a logistic regression model for each predictor variable to obtain unadjusted odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). The variables with a bivariate <italic>p</italic> &lt; .25 were selected for the multivariate model (Hosmer &amp; Lemeshow, 2000; Mickey &amp; Greenland, 1989). We then conducted a sequential logistic regression analysis to prospectively predict taking measures to not smoke. We entered demographic covariates in the first block. In the second block, we entered number of cigarettes smoked. In the final block, we entered the predictor variable of primary interest, the combined effect of baseline intention to take measures to not smoke and exposure to a comprehensive smoke-free air law. We used PASW Statistics Version 17.0 for the analyses.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>Results of unadjusted logistic regression models predicting taking measures to not smoke among the longitudinal study cohort (<italic>n</italic> = 187) who reported current cigarette smoking at baseline are presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1524839910386221">Table 1</xref>. Of the total sample, 101 (54%) reported taking some measure to not smoke, and 86 (46%) reported taking no measures to not smoke. In the unadjusted logistic models, those who were of non-White race and who smoked fewer cigarettes per day were more likely to take measures to not smoke. The odds of taking measures to not smoke were also higher among the high intention to take measures to not smoke and exposure to a comprehensive smoke-free air law group and the high intention to take measures to not smoke and no exposure to a comprehensive smoke-free air law group.</p>

<p>Among the eight predictor variables that were considered, five were included in the final multivariate sequential model, as shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1524839910386221">Table 2</xref>. The Hosmer–Lemeshow goodness-of-fit statistic for the final block of the multivariate model with all predictors entered was 14.31 (<italic>df</italic> = 8; <italic>p</italic> = .074), indicating an adequate fit of the model. In terms of demographic covariates, entered in the first block, only race was a significant predictor of taking measures to not smoke with non-Whites more likely to take measures. Number of cigarettes smoked, entered in the second block, made a significant unique contribution to the prediction of taking measures to not smoke. Finally, after adjusting for age, gender, race, and number of cigarettes smoked, our primary predictor variable of interest was an independent predictor of taking measure to not smoke. Specifically, compared with those with low intention to take measures and no exposure to a comprehensive smoke-free air law, those with high intention and exposure and those with high intention and no exposure were significantly more likely to take measures to not smoke (OR = 17.48, 95% CI = 5.58-54.76, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001; and OR = 4.41, 95% CI = 1.78-10.94, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001, respectively). Those with low intention and exposure to a comprehensive smoke-free air law were no more likely to take measures than those with low intention and no exposure to a comprehensive smoke-free air law (OR = 1.01, 95% CI = 0.39-2.56).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In this study, we used longitudinal data to test the combined effect of high intention and exposure to a smoke-free air law on taking measures to stop smoking among smokers in Texas cities. The first finding of note was that 54% of the smokers in this study reported taking measures to stop smoking at follow-up 1 month later. This is consistent with the notion that most smokers want to quit and are actively engaged in the quitting process. Indeed, treatment of nicotine dependence has been equated with management of a chronic disease (Fiore et al., 2000). Thus, smokers must be continually encouraged to make quit attempts and provided with resources to help them in their cessation efforts.</p>
<p>We tested the contribution of three types of variables to taking measures to quit smoking. For the demographic predictors, only race contributed independently to the prediction of taking measures to quit smoking. In this sample, non-Whites were twice as likely as Whites to report at the follow-up interview that they had taken measures. Prior research examining quitting behaviors of African Americans has found high rates of attempting to quit on their own (Ahluwalia, Resnicow, &amp; Clark, 1998; Orleans et al., 1989). In constructing the outcome measure for the current study, we did not distinguish taking measures within a formal smoking cessation program from taking measures outside of a formal program. This may explain why non-Whites were more likely to take measures to quit smoking.</p>
<p>In terms of smoking behavior, when number of cigarettes smoked per day was added to the logistic regression model, it made a significant unique contribution to the prediction of taking measures to quit smoking, over and above the demographic predictors. Because amount of smoking is an indicator of nicotine dependence (Heatherton et al., 1991), it follows that those who smoke more cigarettes per day would be less likely to perceive cessation as an achievable goal and therefore less likely to express intention to take quitting measures. This is consistent with previous research showing that heavy smoking and nicotine dependence were associated with a decreased likelihood of quitting (Breslau &amp; Peterson, 1996; Rose, Chassin, Presson, &amp; Sherman, 1996).</p>
<p>We were most interested in the combined influence of an individual and an environmental factor on prospectively predicting taking measures to quit smoking. As hypothesized, the smokers living in a Texas city with a comprehensive smoke-free air law and who expressed high intentions to take measures to quit smoking demonstrated the greatest odds of taking such measures. This finding is consistent with Triandis’s (1980) conceptualization of facilitating conditions where characteristics of the environment make it easier to engage in a behavior and with Fishbein’s (2008) integrative model for predicting behavior, which recognizes the role environmental factors play in the intention–behavior relationship. In this study, exposure to a comprehensive smoke-free air law made smokers with high behavioral intention the most likely to engage in smoking cessation behavior. Smokers with high intention to take measures to quit smoking but no exposure to a comprehensive smoke-free air law were also significantly more likely to report taking measures compared to smokers with low intention and no exposure to a comprehensive law. However, smokers with exposure to a comprehensive law but low behavior intention were no more likely to report taking quitting measures. These findings underscore the important role of a smoke-free air law as a facilitating condition in combination with the formation of a positive intention to quit as a predictor of subsequent quitting behavior.</p>
<p>Although the current study contributes to the literature by demonstrating that the combined effect of behavioral intention and exposure to a comprehensive smoke-free air law is a strong prospective predictor of taking measures to stop smoking, there are limitations that should be considered. First, because of the low response rate that is problematic in studies using random digit dialing to collect data, the sample may not be representative of the population. This problem is potentially worsened because of households using cell phones only or having no telephone at all. It is worth noting that age was the only baseline difference between those participants retained for the time two interview and those lost to follow-up. Second, the small sample size resulted in relatively large standard errors and large confidence intervals around the odds ratios for the primary predictor variable of interest. Thus, some caution is warranted in interpretation of the results. Third, our analysis did not consider the duration of exposure to a smoke-free air law. For example, El Paso’s comprehensive law was passed in 2002, whereas Houston’s was passed in 2006. Finally, this study was based on a linear model, but tobacco control operates in a complex dynamic system. For example, the combined effect of multiple tobacco control polices and pro-tobacco forces (e.g., the industry) operating simultaneously was not considered. As a result, a true control group was not feasible in this study. Individuals who live in a city without a strong smoke-free air law are nonetheless exposed to other antismoking policies and messages (and pro-tobacco messages). This makes isolating the effect of one tobacco control policy challenging.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Despite these limitations, this study used longitudinal data to demonstrate how the combination of an individual and an environmental factor can lead to behavior change. Reducing the negative health and economic impact of cigarette smoking will continue to require a multifaceted approach. Policy-based tobacco control interventions that change the larger social environment must go hand in hand with communication and educational interventions that are effective in increasing individual smokers’ intentions to engage in quitting behavior. Most evaluations of tobacco control programs consider only one intervention at a time, but our findings make a unique contribution to the literature by suggesting that implementation of a smoke-free air law alone is not sufficient to move large numbers of smokers toward cessation. Other strategies have to be in place to change individuals’ quitting intentions. Moreover, this comprehensive approach is likely to be applicable to other complex health behaviors, such as engaging in physical activity and eating healthy foods. It is critically important for public health practitioners to understand this, and for this message to be delivered to policy makers, especially when public health programs are fighting for increasingly limited resources.</p>
