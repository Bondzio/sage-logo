<abstract>
<p>This article builds an enactment theory to explain the continuing commitment of entrepreneurs to an emerging organizational field like energy efficiency and renewable energy, which is widely seen as being in the interests of society. The authors propose that when such a field is constrained by such factors as low energy prices and a lack of government support, the actions that entrepreneurs take to educate stakeholders drives the entrepreneurs’ continuing commitment to the field. These actions are supported by the entrepreneurs’ perceptions of the field’s attractiveness, their beliefs that they produce superior products and services, and their beliefs regarding the likelihood of disruptive exogeneous change.</p>

<p>Conserving energy and using renewable resources are among the more important activities toward which socially responsible businesses can aim (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0007650310364045">Peterson &amp; Jun, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0007650310364045">Saha &amp; Darnton, 2005</xref>). Understanding how fields in socially important domains like conserving energy and using renewable resources are established and maintained (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0007650310364045">Lawrence, Hardy, &amp; Phillips, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0007650310364045">Rao, Morrill, &amp; Zald, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0007650310364045">Trist, 1983</xref>) and how entrepreneurial commitment to them is sustained are, therefore, important issues for business and society researchers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0007650310364045">Purdy &amp; Gray, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0007650310364045">Sine &amp; Lee, 2009</xref>). Entrepreneurs are individuals who recognize opportunities, coordinate, and combine scarce resources and see ventures through to fruition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0007650310364045">Erikson, 2001</xref>), but not all the ventures that entrepreneurs start culminate in success. A long and distinguished history of research in business and society also shows that simply because fields are labeled <italic>socially responsible</italic> does not mean that they necessarily become successful business endeavors (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0007650310364045">McWilliams &amp; Siegel, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0007650310364045">Ullman, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-0007650310364045">Vogel, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-0007650310364045">Wartick &amp; Cochran, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-0007650310364045">Wood, 1991</xref>). Even in such socially responsible fields as energy conservation and renewable energy, entrepreneurs may give up before the fields in which they are active are fully established and achieve external recognition and widespread acceptance.</p>
<p>When organizational fields—“sets of institutions and networks of organizations that together constitute a recognizable area of life” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0007650310364045">Maguire, Hardy, &amp; Lawrence, 2004</xref>, p. 659; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0007650310364045">DiMaggio &amp; Powell, 1983</xref>)—are well established, entrepreneurial commitment to them is likely to be high, but for fields to move from start-up to sustained takeoff is difficult. Many hurdles must be overcome and many challenges surmounted, and it can take decades before fields successfully get off the ground and grow of their own accord (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0007650310364045">Klepper &amp; Grady, 1990</xref>). When the prospects for emerging fields appear to be dim (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0007650310364045">Fligstein, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0007650310364045">Maguire et al., 2004</xref>), entrepreneurial commitment to them is likely to wane. A tenuous commitment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0007650310364045">Hardy, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0007650310364045">Trist, 1983</xref>) means that the dedication and loyalty needed to make emerging fields recognized and well established diminishes. People participating in them may decide to abandon the fields before they fully mature due to a lack of confidence that the fields will become well recognized and established.</p>
<p>In this article, we develop a theory of enactment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0007650310364045">Danneels, 2003</xref>) that helps to explain why entrepreneurial commitment to emerging fields relevant to business and society, like energy efficiency and renewable energy, persists despite the uncertain prospects for success. According to our theory, actions affect commitment through their effects on beliefs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0007650310364045">Salancik, 1977a</xref>). Entrepreneurs in emerging fields take actions to influence relevant stakeholders and infuse them with a field’s norms and values (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0007650310364045">Harrison &amp; Freeman, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0007650310364045">Smith, Wokutch, Harrington, &amp; Dennis, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-0007650310364045">Wood &amp; Jones, 1995</xref>). The entrepreneurs frame problems and tell stories to stakeholders to justify the need for the field (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0007650310364045">Lounsbury &amp; Glynn, 2001</xref>), in this way firming up collective action in what is otherwise an underorganized domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0007650310364045">Rao et al., 2000</xref>). The entrepreneurs’ actions to influence stakeholders, in turn, shape and mold their own perceptions of the field. Their actions reinforce their beliefs that the field is attractive; that their endeavors have something valuable to contribute—a superior product or service; and that disruptive exogeneous change will positively affect the field’s growth and development. As these beliefs intensify, the entrepreneurs’ commitment to the field grows (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0007650310364045">DiMaggio, 1988</xref>). Our theory of enactment is one in which the actions entrepreneurs take to influence stakeholders shape the perceptions of the entrepreneurs, which in turn bolster the entrepreneurs’ commitment to the field.</p>
<p>This theory is developed and illustrated with analyses and data from surveys of energy efficiency and renewable energy entrepreneurs carried out in a period when energy prices declined and the prospects for this field dimmed. Our results suggest that the actions entrepreneurs took to influence stakeholders fortified their perceptions of the opportunities that the field offered, which in turn strengthened their commitment to the field.</p>

<title>Commitment to an Emerging Organizational Field</title>
<p>Emerging organizational fields often encounter difficulties. They show promise but fail to fully take off. This process can unfold over a long time, with entrepreneurs in the field becoming frustrated and exiting.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0007650310364045">1</xref></sup> To succeed, the entrepreneurs must be persistent and have considerable commitment. The reasons entrepreneurs abandon a field are many and may include controversy about the quality, reliability, and performance of the products and services they offer; technological glitches; fewer customers; and/or weakening government support. An example of a field losing momentum in the 1990s is alternative pesticides and lawn and garden products (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0007650310364045">Marcus, 2010</xref>). These products worked more slowly than conventional ones and their prices were higher. The companies that entered the field experienced technological glitches and faced dedicated and resourceful competition from established firms. By the end of the decade, many entrepreneurs had abandoned this field. Another example of a field losing momentum in this period was electric cars (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0007650310364045">Marcus, 2010</xref>). In 1990, electric cars were seen as a potential answer to growing pollution woes, particularly in cities such as Los Angeles plagued by smog. These cars had been designed in response to new clean-air legislation enacted in various states. In September of 1990, California passed new laws tightening emissions standards and mandating that 2% of all new vehicles sold had to have no exhaust. Zero-emission vehicles (ZEVs) would necessarily be electric—no other alternatives met the California standard. However, the cars had problems with their batteries, the range of the vehicles was limited, and the support of California and other states declined. When cumulative sales figures did not meet expectations, many of the entrepreneurs who had entered this field left.</p>
<p>Among the obstacles entrepreneurs must overcome when legitimacy wanes is heightened hostility and opposition from competing fields. People involved in well-established fields—in this instance petroleum, coal, and natural gas—are inclined to take steps to either prevent the emerging field like energy efficiency and renewable energy from arising or to slow its progress. Entrepreneurs face resistance from incumbent organizations and institutions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0007650310364045">Sine &amp; Lee, 2009</xref>). Key constituents such as suppliers, customers, and regulators may lack knowledge of the field, be skeptical about the field’s prospects, and decide to withhold support. An emerging organizational field encountering such difficulties faces skepticism about its viability. Commitment to the field is essential because of the obstacles and the high likelihood of setbacks. Participants in the emerging field need the resolve to overcome the difficulty. A lack of commitment may mean abandonment of the field, thereby decreasing the likelihood that it will become fully developed. Given that many fields never really get off the ground (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0007650310364045">Hannan &amp; Freeman, 1989</xref>), understanding the antecedents of commitment to socially important fields such as energy efficiency and renewable energy in periods of doubt and skepticism about their future is important.</p>
<p>Commitment can be defined “as a willingness to persist in a course of action” despite the obstacles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0007650310364045">Cooper-Hakim &amp; Viswesvaran, 2005</xref>, p. 241). Though an extensive and varied literature on commitment in organizations exists (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0007650310364045">Cooper-Hakim &amp; Viswesvaran, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0007650310364045">Salancik, 1977a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0007650310364045">1977b</xref>), there is little research that investigates commitment to an emerging organizational field that has made progress but whose success is not yet guaranteed. Such commitment is not about escalating commitment to a failed course of action (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0007650310364045">Staw, 1981</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0007650310364045">1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0007650310364045">Staw &amp; Ross, 1987</xref>), but about maintaining commitment to a domain that has promise. This article is about commitment at a point in the life cycle of a field when the resources needed for its survival are less than ample (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-0007650310364045">Zimmerman &amp; Callaway, 2001</xref>), but the field still has promise. This period in the field’s life cycle can last for decades. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0007650310364045">Porter (1980)</xref> called the resulting situation of extended promise without corresponding take-off “prolonged gestation.” As we have shown, examples include such fields as alternative pesticides and lawn and garden products and electric cars in the 1990s.</p>
<p>During elongated periods before take-off, questions arise about technology, market growth rates, prices, investment, and demand. Entrepreneurs active in these fields must search for answers to such questions as who will be the main adopters, what will be the design path for the technology, what role will government play, from where will trained employees come, and can sufficient capital be raised. Though there are many studies of entrepreneurs who start new ventures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0007650310364045">Choi &amp; Shepherd, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0007650310364045">Shane &amp; Venkataraman, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0007650310364045">Shook, Priem, &amp; McGee, 2003</xref>), little attention has been paid to the factors that affect continued commitment to emerging fields whose success is not yet guaranteed. Our article addresses this gap with respect to the emerging field of energy efficiency and renewable energy during the 1990s. What sustains the entrepreneurs’ commitment during a period of prolonged gestation when the success of their endeavors is not assured (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0007650310364045">Albert, Ashforth, &amp; Dutton, 2000</xref>)?</p>

<title>Entrepreneurship in the Emerging Field</title>
<p>Entrepreneurs in emerging fields must alter understandings and provide robust explanations as to why a new field is needed (Barley &amp; Tolbert, 1977). They are agents of an institutionalization process who socially construct the field by means of scripts and discursive practices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0007650310364045">Lounsbury &amp; Glynn, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0007650310364045">Munir &amp; Phillips, 2005</xref>). The entrepreneurs rely on their discourse to shape understandings and behaviors of participants in the field. Their discourse establishes the self-regulating and taken-for-granted conventions that shape the further interactions of participants in the field. In emerging fields, this process is ongoing, and, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0007650310364045">Purdy and Gray (2009</xref>, p. 355) maintain, “Both structural influences and individual agency affect” it. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0007650310364045">DiMaggio (1988)</xref> applied the term “crystallization” to the entrepreneurs’ efforts to make an up-and-coming field more “solid” —but there are no guarantees that their efforts will be successful. It takes a long time for categories and norms that govern a field to “crystallize.” The entrepreneurs’ efforts to crystallize the field can be a slow, painstaking process that remains unfinished for some time. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0007650310364045">Lawrence et al. (2002)</xref> referred to this slow, painstaking process as “structuration”; entrepreneurs are trying to produce greater clarity and aiming to fashion stable understandings among the participants about how the field should operate. In specifying the rights, responsibilities, and relationships between the participants, they are attempting to forge ties that have a taken-for-granted character. They are trying to get the field to lose some of its volitional nature. They are trying to force patterns of social action to fall into place so that the participants will have a common frame of reference and share understandings and practices. As the field crystallizes, it is characterized by stronger norms. At some point, the norms become so strong that they amount to what Weber has called an “iron cage.” In strong fields, participants <italic>must</italic> play by the rules; they have no choice, but in weak and emerging fields, they have considerable leeway because there remains substantial ambiguity about what the norms for the field will be.</p>
<p>The efforts of entrepreneurs to provide greater structure to a field have a strong “political” component (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0007650310364045">DiMaggio, 1988</xref>, p. 13). In attempting to create an environment in which their claims are central (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0007650310364045">DiMaggio, 1988</xref>), entrepreneurs must deinstitutionalize existing fields. They also must mobilize constituencies to realize the interests to which they adhere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0007650310364045">Maguire et al., 2004</xref>). Critical to this process is how the entrepreneurs interact with various stakeholders whom they must convince that their vision is an appropriate one. Two of the most important stakeholders they must sway are their suppliers and customers; the entrepreneurs must interact with these stakeholders to structure the field so that their claims will be advanced (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0007650310364045">Lounsbury &amp; Glynn, 2001</xref>). Endeavoring to form linkages and create networks where they are the key players, entrepreneurs piggyback on the credibility of their stakeholders to bolster their position in the field. In this way, they try to shape the field, establishing rules of the game for the field that are favorable to themselves. They manage the legitimization process, providing fuller definition to a field, making its standards more familiar, opening up additional resources for survival, and filling an institutional vacuum that if left unfilled will undermine the legitimacy of the field (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-0007650310364045">Zimmerman &amp; Callaway, 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>Given the institutional vacuum that entrepreneurs who pursue uncertain opportunities must confront, a vital form of the actions they take is their efforts to influence key stakeholders. To achieve cognitive and sociopolitical legitimacy for the field, or what Aldrich and Fiol refer to as its “taken-for-grantedness,” entrepreneurs in organizational fields act as “institutional constructionists,” shaping the perceptions and beliefs of key stakeholders. They “reconstitute meaning” by “educating” and making the stakeholders aware of the value of the entrepreneurs’ endeavors. Such education and awareness building is important so long as crucial stakeholders still do not fully understand the nature of the field and the stakeholders’ roles in the field remain in question. Action is necessary to educate and persuade the key stakeholders that the field is given, right, and worth pursuing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0007650310364045">Aldrich &amp; Fiol, 1994</xref>). As Suchman writes, entrepreneurs must “intervene preemptively” to develop bases of support among critical stakeholders. These bases of support among critical stakeholders have to be “specifically tailored” to stakeholder needs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0007650310364045">Suchman, 1995</xref>, p. 591). The entrepreneurs must “actively promulgate <italic>new</italic> explanations” of the field’s value to core constituencies and develop the field by bringing stakeholders along to their point of view (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0007650310364045">DiMaggio &amp; Powell, 1983</xref>).</p>

<title>An Enactment Theory of Entrepreneurial Commitment</title>
<p>A sense that what entrepreneurs is doing is “foolish” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0007650310364045">Aldrich &amp; Fiol, 1994</xref>, p. 645) may hinder them in their efforts. Stakeholders may have good reason to doubt whether the objective factors needed for field success are in place. Entrepreneurs have to struggle against the belief that success is not assured, that objective factors like markets and mature technologies are weak, that the field’s future is difficult to know, and that this uncertainty means that the field still is without sufficient legitimacy. The field does not have a enough of a supportive environment that acknowledges its taken-for-granted character. Believing in success when the odds are against a field may be seen as irrational. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0007650310364045">Keynes (1936</xref>, as cited in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0007650310364045">Freeman, 1982</xref>, p. 156) referred to entrepreneurs who persist despite the odds not being completely on their side as motivated by “animal spirits—a spontaneous urge to action rather than inaction, and not [by] a weighted average of quantitative benefits multiplied by quantitative probabilities.” The entrepreneurs must have an optimistic bias, according to Keynes, for without it, the contemplation of their failure would overwhelm their inclination to go on.</p>
<p>An enactment perspective helps to explain why entrepreneurs persist when others believe that what they are doing does not make sense (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0007650310364045">Danneels, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0007650310364045">Salancik, 1977a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0007650310364045">1977b</xref>). Enactment involves the recognition that environments in part are self-created (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-0007650310364045">Weick, 1979</xref>). This process (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0007650310364045">Figure 1</xref>) is one in which the actions of the entrepreneurs and their beliefs jointly determine each other in a <italic>recurring</italic> pattern over time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0007650310364045">Danneels, 2003</xref>). The entrepreneurs take actions that bind them to further actions. These actions bolster their beliefs in the emerging field’s attractiveness, its superior products and/or services, and disruptive exogeneous change. The actions the entrepreneurs take create for them a reality that alters their beliefs that prompts them to additional actions; the actions they take shape beliefs and bolster their commitment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0007650310364045">Salancik, 1977b</xref>). On this reasoning we build a series of propositions in the sections that follow.</p>

<title>Actions to Educate Others</title>
<p>Entrepreneurs must enlighten their key stakeholders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0007650310364045">Sine &amp; Lee, 2009</xref>), but doing so is somewhat paradoxical. On the one hand, inertia is built into existing ways of thinking, and entrepreneurs have to isolate themselves to initiate the new field (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0007650310364045">Dosi, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0007650310364045">Van de Ven &amp; Garud, 1989</xref>). They must bypass the strong norms wrapped up with existing paradigms that limit peoples’ openness to information and alternative ways of acting and, if unchecked, yield “collective blindness” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0007650310364045">Janis, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0007650310364045">Nahapiet &amp; Ghoshal, 1998</xref>). On the other hand, for the field to succeed, the entrepreneurs must be very outgoing and forge a complex array of new social and economic relationships (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0007650310364045">Garud, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0007650310364045">Porter, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0007650310364045">Van de Ven &amp; Garud, 1989</xref>). Rarely do entrepreneurs possess the resources and competencies to sustain the development of new fields entirely on their own (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0007650310364045">Garud, 1994</xref>). Entrepreneurs require a “recognized area of institutional life” of “key suppliers, resource and product consumers . . . and other organizations” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0007650310364045">DiMaggio &amp; Powell, 1983</xref>, p. 148). They must create a community of “symbiotically related” organizations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0007650310364045">Van de Ven &amp; Garud, 1989</xref>, p. 205) through their actions. As Nahapiet and Ghoshal suggested, for the new field to sustain itself, entrepreneurs must fashion and share knowledge in social communities—stakeholder networks where acquaintance and recognition breed long-lasting structural, relational, and cognitive ties. To believe that the expected value of the opportunity is large enough to compensate for the cost of foregone alternatives (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0007650310364045">Shane &amp; Venkataraman, 2000</xref>), they need strong social ties to such critical stakeholders as customers, resource providers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0007650310364045">Aldrich &amp; Zimmer, 1986</xref>), and competitors. Thus, they must participate in the creation of a complex set of relationships with these parties—both collaborating partners (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0007650310364045">Garud, 1994</xref>), who possess complementary assets and skills, and rivals, who, though in conflict, have shared interests in legitimating a field.</p>
<p>In their efforts to educate and make major stakeholders aware of the potential value of the uncertain opportunity, entrepreneurs frame the unknown in a way in which it becomes believable and desirable. Competing for the right to be taken for granted, they rely on rhetoric—consistent stories, encompassing symbolic language, and behaviors to gain legitimacy for their activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0007650310364045">Aldrich &amp; Fiol, 1994</xref>). They use their powers of persuasion to overcome resistance and skepticism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0007650310364045">Dees &amp; Starr, 1992</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0007650310364045">Salancik (1977a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0007650310364045">1977b</xref>) suggested that commitment to a field stems from taking volitional (i.e., the actor initially has a choice), irrevocable (i.e., it’s hard to back out), and public actions (i.e., the actions cannot be easily denied) to educate and make others aware. As part of this logic of educating and making stakeholders aware, entrepreneurs find supporting evidence regarding a field’s viability, thus providing justification for their commitment.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0007650310364045">2</xref></sup> The perceived stakeholder thus supported makes the entrepreneurs more committed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0007650310364045">Choi &amp; Shepherd, 2004</xref>), and we make the following proposition:</p>

<title>Beliefs Justify Commitment</title>
<p>Viewing a prospective course of action as credible depends on beliefs as well as actions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0007650310364045">Krueger, 2000</xref>). Before an outcome is realized, it cannot be known whether there will be marketplace superiority and success (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0007650310364045">Gort &amp; Klepper, 1982</xref>). Because of this uncertainty, the construction of the perceived opportunity depends on a psychological logic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0007650310364045">Dutton, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0007650310364045">Krueger, 2000</xref>), an optimistic bias based on beliefs without which entrepreneurs would be unlikely to proceed. People who exploit opportunities tend to frame information more positively and respond to positive rather than negative perceptions of what is likely to happen next (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0007650310364045">Palich &amp; Bagby, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0007650310364045">Shane &amp; Venkataraman, 2000</xref>). They tend to believe that the chances of success are higher than they actually are (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0007650310364045">Cooper, Woo, &amp; Dunkelberg, 1988</xref>). These beliefs are crucial (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0007650310364045">Dutton, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0007650310364045">Krueger, 2000</xref>) because perceptions of opportunities vary according to the beholder (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0007650310364045">Krueger, 2000</xref>). Whether entrepreneurs have true, superior insight or merely an optimistic bias, entrepreneurship requires that people hold strong beliefs that they do (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0007650310364045">Shane &amp; Venkataraman, 2000</xref>, p. 220; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0007650310364045">Eckhardt &amp; Shane, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0007650310364045">Shook et al., 2003</xref>). We argue that three beliefs in particular are essential to driving commitment to an emerging organizational field: (1) belief in emerging field attractiveness, (2) belief in product or service superiority, and (3) belief that disruptive, exogeneous changes will occur to make the market more attractive.</p>
<p>The first of these beliefs is that the opportunity is attractive. Typically, economic competition drives rates of return in particular sectors to nearly perfectly competitive rates. Natural selection then exerts pressure on firms to become homogeneous to the point that they begin to resemble each other in technology, knowledge, and organizational forms and practices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0007650310364045">Porac, Thomas, &amp; Baden-Fuller, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0007650310364045">Reger &amp; Huff, 1993</xref>). If the prospects for profits then dim, why continue? Entrepreneurs, however, believe that they can see beyond conventional practice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0007650310364045">Brouwer, 1991</xref>) and that they can set in motion events that disrupt, destroy, and render obsolete established ideas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0007650310364045">Garud, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0007650310364045">Schumpeter, 1934</xref>). In comparison with most people, they believe that they have a wider horizon from which to try yet unproven possibilities. They can envision new combinations among factors of production, either production increases using the same amount of production factors, or the same level of production using a lesser amount of these factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0007650310364045">Brouwer, 1991</xref>, p. 16). They tend to believe they are engaged in the “creation or identification of new ends and means . . . previously undetected or unutilized by market participants” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0007650310364045">Eckhardt &amp; Shane, 2003</xref>, p. 336). Thus, we propose,</p>
<list id="list2-0007650310364045" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p><italic>Proposition 2</italic>: Entrepreneurs who believe in the emerging field’s attractiveness will have a greater commitment to an emerging organizational field.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>A second belief that we argue is an important driver of commitment is the belief that the entrepreneur’s product or service is superior. The characteristic endeavors in which entrepreneurs engage are introducing new production processes, organizational methods, resources, markets (geographical as well as economic), and products (or better versions of existing products). Attracted by the perception of possibly higher rates of return, they invest capital in novel endeavors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0007650310364045">Van de Ven &amp; Garud, 1989</xref>) outside the scope of established fields. Commitment requires an optimistic belief that the new products or services their firms offer are indeed superior. The entrepreneurs believe the products and services their firms offer have decisive cost or quality advantages because of innovations in technology, sources of supply, organization type, or other factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0007650310364045">Van de Ven &amp; Garud, 1989</xref>). They believe that the potential gain is large enough to compensate for the opportunity costs of alternatives not pursued (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0007650310364045">Kirzner, 1973</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0007650310364045">Schumpeter, 1934</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0007650310364045">Shane &amp; Venkataraman, 2000</xref>). A belief in product or service superiority is a manifestation of their belief in the field’s viability. Thus, we propose,</p>
<list id="list3-0007650310364045" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p><italic>Proposition 3</italic>: Entrepreneurs who believe that the products or services they offer are superior will have a greater commitment to an emerging organizational field.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>The final belief that is necessary for commitment to the emerging organizational field is the conviction that conditions will change to make the situation more attractive. Current prospects for the field may not be bright because of exogeneous factors, but they will improve. As market participants, entrepreneurs, according to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0007650310364045">Kirzner (1979)</xref>, rely on “systematic changes in the information and expectations” (p. 5). They are alert to new opportunities (p. 6) and have the capacity to discover instances of potential disequilibrium that are likely to come into existence in the future, which may require “flashes of superior insight,” where they can see “what is around the corner before others do” (p. 8). As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0007650310364045">Eckhardt and Shane (2003</xref>, p. 339) argued, entrepreneurs “must attempt to foresee the characteristics of future markets” to determine <italic>ex ante</italic> whether opportunities have potential value. Optimistic biases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0007650310364045">Camerer &amp; Lovallo, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0007650310364045">Keynes, 1936</xref>), as we have indicated, thus influence the entry of entrepreneurs into emerging fields and sustain their commitment to them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0007650310364045">Gort &amp; Klepper, 1982</xref>). This optimism is based on the belief that basic conditions that block realization will turn around. That is, entrepreneurs tend to believe that dynamic, disruptive, external factors will alter the existing landscape and disrupt the current equilibrium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0007650310364045">Brouwer, 1991</xref>).</p>
<p>Those who commit have the confidence that they are able to see these things that afterward will prove to be true (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0007650310364045">Brouwer, 1991</xref>). Rather than economic processes in subsequent years being like economic processes in previous ones, they believe that the processes are subject to external shocks, disruptions, and upheavals, which can come from a variety of sources—wars, revolutions, changes in weather patterns, the availability of raw materials, alterations in consumer preferences and tastes, dramatic swings in population, shifts in values, and changes in technology and the role of government toward business (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0007650310364045">Brouwer, 1991</xref>). These disruptions can fundamentally alter the way the system works—what products and services are valued, where economic opportunities lie, and what fields will be legitimate. When the equilibrium shifts, the changed conditions will increase the odds that new products or services will be commercialized and the new field will become well established. Thus, we propose,</p>

<title>Actions Shape Beliefs</title>
<p>Although people intuitively believe that their actions are based on their beliefs, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-0007650310364045">Weick’s (1979</xref>, p. 194) discussion of retrospective sensemaking suggests that the opposite is frequently also true, that actions precede beliefs. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0007650310364045">Danneels (2003</xref>, p. 560) noted, “Enactment implies that taking actions produces cognitions, which then guide further actions.” We suggest that the actions to educate key stakeholders lead entrepreneurs to believe that the organizational fields in which they are participating are attractive, that their products or services are superior, and that disruptive exogeneous change will take place that will be positive to the endeavors they have undertaken. The more that they act to educate key stakeholders, the more these beliefs grow. By engaging in actions to convince key stakeholders, entrepreneurs firm up their own convictions and build confidence in the rightness of their beliefs. Even if the emerging organizational field currently shows weaknesses, they act. Their interactions with stakeholders then convince them that the field does indeed have the potential they have been claiming. They are likely to become convinced because individuals generally “attempt to resolve inconsistencies between the behaviors they do and the attitudes they hold” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0007650310364045">Salancik, 1977a</xref>, p. 7), and if behaviors have already occurred, then the only way to resolve inconsistencies is to alter beliefs to match those actions.</p>
<p>In trying to educate key stakeholders, entrepreneurs come to believe in the conditions that justify their continued commitment to the field, a reasoning supported by the literature on institutionalization and structuration. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0007650310364045">Barley and Tolbert (1997)</xref> argued, the “web of values, norms, rules, beliefs, and taken-for-granted assumptions” in which people “are suspended” are of people’s “own making” (p. 93). “Institutions are socially constructed templates for action” generated and maintained through people’s ongoing interactions (p. 94). Thus, we propose that actions to educate key stakeholders are likely to influence entrepreneurs’ beliefs about industry attractiveness, product or service superiority, and disruptive exogeneous change. These beliefs in turn affect the entrepreneurs’ commitment to organizational fields that otherwise may appear foolish. Based on this reasoning, we propose,</p>

<p>In establishing organizational fields, action has a direct effect on producing commitment as well as an indirect or mediated one through the actors’ beliefs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0007650310364045">Salancik, 1977a</xref>). The direct effect is that actions shape the expectations of others, which then constrain the actors, causing commitment to grow. The following proposition describes the expected mediation effect.</p>

<title>Illustration of the Theory</title>
<p>We illustrate the theory by discussing a preliminary study and presenting the results of two subsequent surveys of energy efficiency and renewable energy (EERE) businesses. The EERE businesses had products and services designed to help consumers save or replace traditional forms of energy such as oil, coal, natural gas, and nuclear power. These products and services were likely to gain acceptance only at the expense of established fossil-fuel and nuclear-energy companies. The field we studied included manufacturers whose products or services saved energy in residential or commercial buildings (e.g., energy efficient windows, lighting components, insulation materials, and appliances) or industrial processes or settings (e.g., process controls, thermostats, heat-recovery systems, and ventilators), reduced energy use in commercial buildings or industrial settings (e.g., demand-side management programs, energy audits, training and software for energy systems), and/or produced renewable-energy or alternate fuel products (e.g., photovoltaic products, wind power systems, and whole-tree biomass systems). Though many of the EERE businesses we studied were new firms, others were new businesses within larger, established firms. These new businesses within larger firms also represented entrepreneurial ventures and were subject to many of the same forces that affected the new firms. The illustration of the theory in this article is not a definitive test of the theory, but rather preliminary supporting evidence that we hope will lead to future validation efforts by other researchers.</p>
<sec id="section8-0007650310364045">
<title>Preliminary Study</title>
<p>In the early 1990s, several years prior to the two surveys we discuss below, we conducted an initial study of EERE businesses that indicated that the field was in a state of “prolonged gestation” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0007650310364045">Marcus, Sutcliffe, &amp; McEvily, 1994</xref>). This preliminary study involved 20 in-depth, onsite interviews with owners and managers of EERE firms, and surveys sent to 106 managers surveyed, 66 of whom provided their responses. When we did this preliminary study, it became clear to us that the majority of firms we were studying had not achieved what they believed to be their full growth potential and that they had characteristics of companies in an emerging field. Examples from the interviews point to the challenges the managers confronted and how they coped with these challenges. For example, the focus of one firm’s business was to help clients manage their purchase and use of energy so as to minimize costs, whereas the focus of another firm was to develop software to predict building energy use to help engineers and architects construct new buildings and retrofit old buildings. The major customers of both firms were large local companies. Small firms with low margins could not hire these companies. Only large, well-run organizations could afford their services. Customers wanted sound products and services that performed as expected, delivered promised savings, and/or were a reliable source of power. However, they were constrained from making energy-efficiency investments by many factors existing at the time, including high real-interest rates, the riskiness of the expected returns, long-term investment uncertainty about innovative services, high information and transaction costs, and lenders’ inexperience. In addition, customers reasoned that if they waited for a new generation of services and products, their needs would be better met.</p>
<p>Most customers were not individual households. They had to be well established. They were from the construction industry; distributors, customizers, installers, and service firms; manufacturers; utilities and power generators; and well-run nonprofits, such as governments and schools. This type of customer had the capacity to consider the long-term cost savings and was more able to invest than individual households; however, this type of customer also was highly constrained; for example, the rate at which this customer replaced its exiting energy was slow, which could be the result of using old equipment. It tended to care about the net salvage value of old equipment, the costs of acquiring ancillary equipment if upgrades were made to energy efficiency models, the costs of retraining employees, and the potential for expensive equipment failures. The factors deterring investment included high capital costs, the engineering and R&amp;D costs associated with a changeover, and the expense of modifying interrelated production stages.</p>
<p>As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0007650310364045">Purdy and Gray (2009)</xref> pointed out, emerging fields do not mature in a deterministic way to stability, equilibrium, and take-off. Factors such as those mentioned in the foregoing were keeping EERE businesses in a state of prolonged gestation. At the time that we did our interviews, EERE firms confronted the following: low energy prices for conventional fuels, a trend that began in the 1980s; a pullback in government subsidies that occurred around the same time; and relatively low consumer demand. Another key issue that EERE firms faced was the need to reduce performance uncertainties in products and services they offered. The performance uncertainties often arose because different parts of the value chain, such as procuring inputs, manufacturing, distribution, marketing, sales, and service, were not well developed. For these reasons, we concluded that EERE businesses in our sample, though established, had not yet taken off and that they were in a state of prolonged gestation. EERE businesses had sales and had been in existence for some time, but in comparison to substitute products from established sectors likes coal and other fossil fuels, their sales were relatively low and their ongoing existence still in doubt. They were in an emerging as opposed to established field.</p>
<p>An outcome of the preliminary study we did was the creation of Energy Alley, a trade association aimed at furthering the development of this field. The supposition behind Energy Alley was that the field was still emerging; it had potential, but not enough had been done to realize this potential. The purpose of Energy Alley was to further develop the field’s potential and create a more viable and accepted field. The subsequent surveys we did for Energy Alley were meant to assist the organization in achieving that purpose.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-0007650310364045">
<title>Two Surveys</title>
<p>With the aid of Energy Alley, we mailed our primary survey to leaders in 878 firms that Energy Alley considered to be in the EERE field in March of 1998. We assumed that the 878 firms were the population of EERE businesses at the time. We attempted to contact by phone each business that did not return a survey after roughly a month, asking why the survey had not been returned. We discovered that 148 of the businesses in the initial sample were not in EERE businesses, had moved, had disconnected phone numbers, or were no longer operating. Removing these from the sample yielded a sample size of 730. We then received 197 responses to our survey (a response rate of 27%). However, as we were unable to reach all of the businesses represented in the sample, this response rate represents the minimum, and the true response rate is probably several percentage points higher. The 1998 survey confirmed that the participants in this sector believed that the field had potential but that this potential was not being realized and that development was stalled and was not taking place as fast as expected. Their businesses were growing, though not at the pace that these leaders in the field hoped. Their commitment was not to a failing course of action, but to one that could be doing better. Businesses in the sample employed an average of 283 people and their average sales were $72 million. A few very large businesses, though, skewed these figures, as more than one third (36%) of the businesses in the sample had sales between $1 million and $10 million and nearly 50% of them had sales of $25 million or less. In terms of full- and part-time employees, more than two thirds (70%) employed 50 or fewer people.</p>
<p>To address the issue of skewness, we ran analyses in two additional ways. First, we used the natural log of size. Second, we removed five values that were greater than three standard deviations from the mean. The results of these additional analyses were similar to those we report below.</p>
<p>In the summer of 2001, we mailed a follow-up survey to the 197 leaders who had responded to the earlier survey. We tested for nonresponse bias in the second survey using <italic>t</italic> tests and found no significant differences in any of the study variables between businesses responding to the second survey and those that responded only to the first survey. As with the first survey, we attempted to contact respondents who did not return the second survey after roughly one month. We found that 30 of the 197 initial respondents had either sold their businesses or gone out of business. In the end, we received 100 responses to the second survey (a response rate of 60%; 100 of 167). When we asked in the telephone contacts why some businesses no longer existed, it was usually because the entrepreneur/founder had changed personal circumstances (e.g., retirement). Some also sold their businesses, which possibly indicated success (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0007650310364045">Bates, 2005</xref>). Though we believe our responses were representative of the businesses involved in this sector in the two periods and that the responses to the second survey were not biased in favor of survivors, we acknowledge this as a limitation of our study, which is illustrative of the theory and propositions we offer but does not fully confirm them.</p>

<title>Measures</title>
<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0007650310364045">Table 1</xref> lists the items and scale reliabilities of the dependent and independent variables. Our independent-variable measures came from the first survey. They are (a) actions during the prior 12 months to educate key business stakeholders, (b) belief that the emerging field is attractive, (c) belief in superior product or service, and (d) belief that disruptive exogeneous change positive to the emerging field will take place. The dependent variable—commitment—came from the second survey. Our intention was to test whether the independent variables measured in the first period determined the degree to which leaders in this emerging sector were committed to the field in the later period. The fact that we measured the commitment variable a full 3 years after measuring the independent variables was important in matching our study design to our theory. To examine the predictors of long-term commitment required a longitudinal approach. If the independent variables in the theory predicted commitment 3 years after they were measured, support would be found for our predictions.</p>

<p>Confirmatory factor analysis (using LISREL 8.30) verified that the items and scales for our key independent variables exhibited discriminant validity. The chi-square was not significant (as is desired), the normed fit index was 0.90, the comparative fit index was 0.98, the standardized root mean square residual was 0.052, the goodness of fit index was 0.93, and the adjusted goodness of fit index was 0.90. Scale reliabilities were adequate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0007650310364045">Nunnally, 1978</xref>). The dependent variable, commitment to an emerging organizational field, was operationalized using 6 items that dealt with the level of ongoing and continued commitment study participants had toward being in the energy efficiency and renewable energy businesses, including the extent to which they saw EERE to be a core part of their product and services.</p>
<p>Actions to educate key business stakeholders was a 3-item measure. These actions had to have taken place during the 12 months prior to the time of the survey and thus they had to have <italic>preceded</italic> the beliefs we measured. We originally included another item in this measure, which resulted in a reliability of .77, but this item produced a poorer fit in the confirmatory factor analyses. Rerunning all of the regression analyses using this 4-item measure of actions to educate key business stakeholders yielded very similar results to those we report here.</p>
<p>Belief that the emerging field was attractive was a 4-item measure, whereas belief in product or service superiority was a 2-item measure. Finally, belief in disruptive exogeneous change was a 3-item measure; it dealt with the extent that the participants in the study were aware of the issue of global warming and saw it as an important concern. Although this measure was only one possible construct of the concept, it was an appropriate for this industry. Indeed, if global warming was truly recognized as a problem, conditions were likely to change and many of the products and services offered by these businesses would become more valuable.</p>
<p>We included several control variables in the analysis that may be alternative explanations for commitment or the lack of it. The first of these was prior business success, which we measured using 4 items. The second was access to capital (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0007650310364045">Castrogiovanni, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0007650310364045">Pfeffer &amp; Salancik, 1978</xref>), which we measured with the single item: “To what extent is a lack of access to capital an obstacle to the growth of your business?” (using a 5-point Likert scale with anchors ranging from 1 = <italic>not at all</italic> to 5 = <italic>to a great extent</italic>). Finally, we controlled for firm size, as large firms generally have more resources, and perhaps greater slack, more patience, and more tolerance for failure. We measured firm size as the number of full- and part-time employees. We originally planned to also include firm sales as a control, but could not, as it was correlated at .91 with firm size (and had a greater number of missing observations). The control variables came from the first survey.</p>

<p>The first column of <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0007650310364045">Table 3</xref> presents our model without the three belief measures. Actions to educate business stakeholders was a strong predictor of commitment (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .01). Supporting Proposition 1, this model accounted for 9% of the variance in commitment and was significant (<italic>F</italic> = 3.16, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05). The second column of <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0007650310364045">Table 3</xref> shows the full model, including the three belief measures. The full model accounted for 41% of the variance in commitment, and the model was highly significant (<italic>F</italic> = 9.21, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001). Two of the belief variables were highly significant predictors of commitment, belief in product or service superiority (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .001) and belief in emerging field attractiveness (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .001), whereas belief in disruptive exogeneous change was marginally significant (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .10). These results provided support for Propositions 2 and 3 and marginal support for Proposition 4.</p>
<p>To examine Proposition 5 and finish our examination of the mediation effects (Proposition 6), three additional models were run (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0007650310364045">Table 4</xref>), in which each of the three beliefs was regressed on actions to education business stakeholders and the three control variables. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0007650310364045">Tables 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0007650310364045">4</xref> show that the requirements for mediation were met (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0007650310364045">Baron &amp; Kenny, 1986</xref>). The independent variable actions to influence business stakeholders influenced both the proposed mediators (the three beliefs) and the dependent variable (commitment) in the correct direction. The model for belief in emerging field attractiveness was significant (<italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> = .09, <italic>F</italic> = 2.94, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05), with actions to educate business stakeholders significant at the <italic>p</italic> &lt; .10 level. Prior business success was also significant (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .05) in this model. The model for belief in product superiority was significant (<italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> = .08, <italic>F</italic> = 2.76, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05), with actions to educate business stakeholders at the <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05 level. The model for belief in disruptive exogeneous change was significant at the <italic>p</italic> &lt; .10 level (<italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> = .06, <italic>F</italic> = 2.22, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .10), with actions to educate business stakeholders significant at the <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05. These results generally supported Proposition 5.</p>
<p>As shown in Column 2 of <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0007650310364045">Table 3</xref>, the three beliefs affected commitment, and the effect of actions on commitment disappeared when the three beliefs were present. Thus, the three beliefs fully mediated the effect of actions on commitment. In line with our proposed enactment theory, these analyses tended to show that the extent to which managers took actions to educate business stakeholders significantly predicted commitment to the emerging organizational field. Beliefs in emerging field attractiveness, product or service superiority, and future disruptive change mediated the effects of actions to educate business stakeholders on commitment, supporting Proposition 6.</p>

<title>Discussion and Conclusions</title>
<p>This article has examined how organizational fields that are supportive of businesses that conserve energy and use renewable resources are maintained when their external prospects are diminished. When fields are well established, commitment to them usually is high, but when fields are not well established (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0007650310364045">Fligstein, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0007650310364045">Maguire et al., 2004</xref>), commitment tends to be lower as well. A tenuous commitment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0007650310364045">Hardy, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0007650310364045">Trist, 1983</xref>) means that the dedication and loyalty needed to make the emerging field a recognized and well-established domain is weak. Entrepreneurs who are participating in the field may decide to abandon it before it has fully matured because of a lack of confidence that it will become well recognized and established.</p>
<p>Thus, our results support the following propositions:</p>
<list id="list7-0007650310364045" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p><italic>Proposition 1</italic>: Entrepreneurs who take actions to educate and increase awareness among major stakeholders will have a greater commitment to an emerging organizational field.</p></list-item>

<p>Entrepreneurs have been described as both a product and an agent of the historical process, at once the representative and the creator of social forces that change the shape of the world (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0007650310364045">Montanye, 2006</xref>). Given that it frequently takes a decade or two before businesses like conserving energy and using renewable resources take off, understanding the factors that explain entrepreneurial commitment to this type emerging organizational field is critical to business and society research. In this article, we present a theory to explain this commitment that involves both actions and beliefs and provide illustrative evidence drawn from two surveys that supports our propositions.</p>
<p>As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-0007650310364045">Zimmerman and Zeitz (2002</xref>, p. 414) noted, “Legitimacy can be enhanced by strategic actions . . . and . . . such strategic action is particularly important for new ventures.” They discuss the taking of proactive steps to change the environment. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0007650310364045">Pfeffer and Salancik (1978)</xref> called this process of active construction of the environment <italic>enactment.</italic> In this article, we have examined such a model in which actions to educate business stakeholders lead to beliefs in emerging field attractiveness, product or service superiority, and disruptive exogeneous change. In turn, these factors help build commitment to an emerging organizational field. Our empirical findings connect actions to educate stakeholders to these beliefs and to commitment. Actions to educate stakeholders have for a long time been central to the concerns of business and society scholars. This research indicates that such actions have an important role in maintaining the development of such socially important fields as energy efficiency and renewable energy.</p>
<p>According to our proposed theory, actions, beliefs, and commitment reciprocally affect each other. They are the foundations on which cycles of increasing attachment or disengagement to emerging fields are based. Commitment to an emerging organizational field, which otherwise might seem unwise to pursue, grows when entrepreneurs take actions to educate key business stakeholders. In the process, the entrepreneurs change their own beliefs about the emerging field and their firms’ prospects. The reciprocal influence between action, belief, and commitment can be the start of positive or negative cycles of engagement or disengagement, and progress or decay. The approach taken here is somewhat different than the standard industrial organization point of view. The emphasis is on legitimacy and beliefs about economic conditions, not on economic conditions per se. We hold that legitimacy is a function of the reciprocal influences of actions, beliefs, and commitment.</p>
<p>Our research addresses several calls by scholars; for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0007650310364045">Shook et al. (2003</xref>, p. 390) found only one study that had examined the individual’s role of persistence in venture creation activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0007650310364045">Gatewood, Shaver, &amp; Gartner, 1995</xref>). A review by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0007650310364045">Busenitz et al. (2003)</xref> argued that “the <italic>intersection</italic> between opportunities and enterprising individuals . . . is central to entrepreneurship theory” (p. 298). Busenitz et al. further argued that “cognitive . . . approaches to the study of opportunity identification, evaluation, and response may help us understand how entrepreneurs think and explain their unusual tendency to take bold action” (pp. 299, 302). We take a cognitive approach in proposing an enactment theory that suggests commitment is driven by specific types of actions necessary to help build a supportive institutional environment and three key beliefs that these actions reinforce. Our work argues that opportunity exploitation has an important temporal dimension in that exploitation can take many years or even decades and that during this time a substantial commitment on the part of the individuals involved is required.</p>
<sec id="section13-0007650310364045">
<title>Limitations and Future Research</title>
<p>There are several limitations with respect to our findings. First, we have done our study in a single emerging organizational field—the energy efficiency and renewable energy sector—which may have peculiar features, for instance, an overabundance of idealistic people with unrealizable entrepreneurial ambitions. Additional studies in other emerging fields of central concern to business and society researchers are needed to see how our model generalizes.</p>
<p>Another limitation is that we have surveyed a single respondent from each business. However, the survey was targeted at the field’s leaders—the CEO, president, or founder of these businesses, who represent the major decision makers and whose long-run commitment was especially needed. We specifically asked respondents who were not CEOs, presidents, or founders to refer to the main business unit for which they were responsible when answering the survey questions. Our respondents thus are “key informants” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0007650310364045">Huber &amp; Power, 1985</xref>) and are most knowledgeable about the types of issues we asked about.</p>
<p>We did not examine whether actions taken were effective or not, and, indeed, our enactment theory applies to both effective and ineffective action, because even ineffective action is theorized to be binding and hence to intensify commitment. Yet from a practical standpoint it is clearly desirable to discover the types of actions that are more effective in building the institutional infrastructure required for success. Individuals who take ineffective action and nevertheless become highly committed to an uncertain opportunity should be much more likely to end up failing due to a lack of legitimacy and an unsupportive institutional environment. The productive capacity such individuals represent could be more fruitfully applied elsewhere. Future research might, therefore, investigate the effectiveness of the actions entrepreneurs take to educate key business stakeholders and whether the effectiveness of actions makes a difference to commitment.</p>
<p>Our view of the relationships between the variables in our study is that they affect each other in a recursive way. Though we did not fully examine the reciprocal influence of each variable on the others over time, other than examining the effect of actions and beliefs at one point on commitment at another, we believe that the overall system is a self-sustaining one that is prone to both positive and negative feedback; that is, commitment is likely to feed back on beliefs and affect actions so that each variable reciprocally influences the others over time. These reciprocal influences yield positive or negative momentum that create a sense of progress or stalemate. Future research is needed to examine whether this is the case.</p>
<p>To repeat our main argument, emerging organizational fields require that entrepreneurial leaders remain committed to their businesses on the basis of beliefs, for they are dealing with uncertainties and “are navigating, at best, in an institutional vacuum of indifferent munificence” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0007650310364045">Aldrich &amp; Fiol, 1994</xref>, p. 645). Even if there is some evidence to support the contention that the emerging organizational field in which they are participating will ultimately flourish, this evidence is less than conclusive, and many unknowns and doubts remain. To a degree, what the participants in the field are doing may be considered foolish because external conditions may not yet be ripe for the field to flourish. They need to have an optimistic bias. They require “animal spirits” that are not solely motivated by rational calculation. In a period of prolonged gestation, they lack a supporting institutional environment to legitimize their actions. Our enactment theory proposes that this lack of a supporting institutional environment can be overcome by actions to educate key stakeholders. We have argued in this article that sustained entrepreneurial commitment is driven by a specific set of actions and cognitions. In particular, actions to educate business stakeholders are likely to lead to beliefs in emerging field attractiveness, superiority of product or service, and coming disruptive exogeneous change. These in turn are essential to sustaining commitment to an emerging organizational field.</p>

<p>For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0007650310364045">Marcus, Sutcliffe, and McEvily (1994</xref><italic>)</italic> reported on an entrepreneurial firm that distributed resource efficiency products and services in the 1990s. The firm was not very successful. The energy-efficient lighting fixtures this firm sold were expensive. Many of the firm’s potential customers appeared to be motivated by money savings and not reducing resource use. The firm could not get retailers to stock the items it sold if consumers did not ask for them. The entrepreneurs who started this business, therefore, were reluctant to make direct sales pitches to customers because of what they perceived to be their customers’ lack of interest. Instead, they gave repeated talks about energy efficiency to people in churches, Rotary Clubs, and other organization where they obtained confirmation and validation and confirmation for their views. Through these channels they obtained enough sales to keep them in business.</p>
