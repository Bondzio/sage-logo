<p>Christiania is a Freetown, which has caused considerable focus of attention since its formation in the early 1970s. To many people in Scandinavia, it has been a laboratory for alternative ways of living and, indeed, its history provides insight into how it is to live in a community of 900 residents. Located less than one mile from the Danish parliament in the centre of Copenhagen, it also offers an opportunity to learn about how a Freetown interacts with the rest of the city. By listening to the voices of spokesmen/women and by examining research on Christiania, this book offers insights into at least three modi for this interaction. The first chapter of the book provides a thorough introduction: the Freetown as a social experiment (1970s), as a laboratory for the construction of alternative cultures (1979–2002) and as a practice room for urban struggles of the right to the city (2004 onwards). The contribution of the book links up thematically with all three periods.</p>
<p>In chapter 2, René Karpantschof records the second thoughts of a squatter activist: how can we help Christiania? The question is linked to ‘the general strategic situation’—i.e. “the fact that the state is a durable counterpart, which cannot be ignored” (p. 42). The chapter examines the parliamentary situation in 1971–2011 with a particular focus on Christiania’s “negotiation cards” (p. 66). The question is also related to Christiania’s ability to connect with friendly social movements. It examines Christiania activism from within, as well as its relationship with squatter activism outside Christiania. Chapter 3, by Håkan Thörn, uses Michel Foucault’s studies of governmentality to approach the topic of ‘freedom’ and ‘the shifting meanings of normalisation’ that highlight parliament’s controversies over Christiania. The chapter also studies Christiania “as a highly symbolic issue, which fits well into an emerging pattern in mainstream politics to focus on ‘value politics’” (p. 71) and it considers Christiania as a test ground for a shift in political life, including the question “of how to govern urban life in a society” (p. 76). Chapter 4, by Signe Sophie Bøggild, offers a view from architecture, with Steen Eiler Rasmussen, “godfather of Danish welfare city planning” (p. 114), as the ultimate focal point. The architect of the new town on Tingbjerg (completed in 1971) later came to “regret the master plan’s lack of openness towards reinterpretation and innovation” (p. 109). Christiania is of interest due to the ‘counter-functionalist discourse’ already at work in Situationists’ questioning of ‘planning megalomania’. Today, we learn, it is incorporated in “post-planning projects” (p. 117). Chapter 5, by Maria Hellström Reimar, highlights the role of the media in “transmitting a shift in attitude” (p. 132) towards Christiania with the juxtaposition of two television broadcasts from 1976 and 1988. <italic>Dagbog fra en fristad</italic> [Diary from a Freetown], depicts “a stereotypical social constellation” called the Hansen family on a one-week visit to “the infamous squatter community” (p. 134). The follow-up documentary, <italic>Gensyn med Christiania</italic> [Return to Christiania], “was aired in a totally different media landscape, where the expectations of phenomena such as ‘family’, ‘experimentation’ or ‘everyday life’ have changed” (p. 155).</p>
<p>Chapter 6, by Helen Jarvis, is on everyday life in Christiania, the aim being “to consider the question whether and in what ways the Freetown cultivates a more harmonious, creative and just means of coordinating home, work and family” (p. 57). By means of “first-hand ethnographic observations”, a detailed picture is pieced together of the infrastructures of daily life, as well as a matrix illustrating the intersection infrastructure of daily life (pp. 164–165). It also studies the secret conflict mechanisms of everyday life and how coping strategies are shaped “by unequal access to networks and flows of local knowledge and social capital” (p. 179). Chapter 7 (pp. 181–204) by Cathrin Wasshede views Christiania through a queer lens with Bøssehuset (the Gay Garden) being the focus. Since 1976, this has been a permanent home for the Gay Men’s Liberation Front, a sanctuary “where good laughs are expected” (p. 185). We learn that gays differ: some “think it would be limiting to live there”, while others “are among the most devoted and hard-working Christianits” (p. 187). Also, the site fits well into Christiania’s overall ideas about the freedom of the individual. Chapter 8, by Tomas Nilson, is on Christiania and drugs, with a case study of the 1982 public controversies being central: “a drug (hash) and a group (the Christianias) became targets for intense criticism, mobilisation and stigmatisation” (p. 207). Founded on two contrasting assumptions, one that makes no difference between hard and soft drugs, and another that uncouples hash from other drug issues, the chapter studies images and counter-images in the neighbouring countries, in parliament and among Christiania activists.</p>
<p>In chapter 9, Christa Simone Amoureux focuses on normalisation within Christiania “to discuss how normalisation operates, but also how it is negotiated, resisted and reformed” (p. 262). Using Michel Foucault’s notions of normalisation, it studies “the intersection of spatial strategies of control and narratives of normalcy”. The idea of Christiania as open, care preserving and friendly is contested: “in Christiania, a disciplining power is spatialised, but also instantiated in narratives of what it means to be an activist or a pusher, an insider or outsider” (p. 240). Chapter 10, by Amy Starecheski, studies Christiania’s direct democracy. Based on 16 oral history interviews with ‘activists’, it asks “does it function strategically?” (p. 263). Taking its point of departure in the 2004 demand of the Danish state to “legalise their property ownership” (p. 263), it uncovers contrasting interpretations of what it means to negotiate with the state. Also, strategic uses of consensus-seeking for personal purposes is uncovered: such as pushers, who “were kind of like saying no because it would ruin their business” (p. 279). Chapter 11, by Anders Lund Hansen, is on “two very different visions of the right to the city” (p. 307): private property rights, “which accommodate investors, developers and the so-called creative class”, versus Christiania, which is “fighting against normalisation” and for the “collective right to land and housing” (p. 308). The normalisation plans of the parliament are situated in the context of “a broader class struggle for social justice” (p. 297), a “space war against ‘gentrification’ and unjust conditions for the urban poor” (p. 296).</p>
<p>With Christiania now 40 years old, this could have been a perfect chance for reflexive critical evaluations. First, for whom is Christiania a social experiment? Activists and architects have learned, but how about social work? Is Christiania a better alternative for the poor and excluded? A contribution on social work in Copenhagen would have helped. Secondly, is it a site for alternative cultures? We hear about spectacular occurrences to protect Christiania, but less about Christiania as a realm of heterotopias. How does this site stand in a complex relationship to the rest? Is Christiania capable of offering a rite of passage to people in crisis? Or is it all about starting a career as a hash addict in Christiania’s green light district? Thirdly, Christiania is indeed a laboratory for urban struggles over the right to the city. But what do squatter activists see of Christiania? It would have been helpful if the chapters on ‘normalisation’ and ‘space war’ had made use of the findings of Helen Jarvis, Christa Simone Amoreux and Amy Starecheski to reflect upon a different kind of squatter community than, for example, Ungdomshuset (the youth house in Copenhagen). These contributions nevertheless represent a good beginning for a new and realistic approach to the study of Christiania.</p>
