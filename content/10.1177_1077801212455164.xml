<abstract>
<p>The purpose of this study was to explore perceptions of dating violence among a sample of sexual minority youth. Focus groups were conducted as part of a larger study that surveyed 109 sexual minority youth between the ages of 18 and 24 years. Participants identified four main themes contributing to dating violence among same-sex couples: homophobia (societal and internalized); negotiating socially prescribed gender roles; assumed female connection; and other relationship issues. Such information is essential for determining the need for and content of dating violence services, including education, safety planning, and referrals for mental and physical health services for sexual minority youth.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Dating violence has been defined by the Centers for Disease Control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1077801212455164">CDC, 2006a</xref>) as physical, sexual, or psychological violence that occurs within the context of a dating relationship. Intimate partner violence (IPV) is abuse that occurs between two people in a close relationship, with the term “intimate partner” being inclusive of current and former spouses and dating partners. The CDC has identified IPV as including four types of behavior: physical abuse, sexual abuse, threats, and emotional abuse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1077801212455164">CDC, 2006b</xref>). The term dating violence is frequently used to describe such violence among both adolescents and young adult populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1077801212455164">Amar &amp; Gennaro, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>Research has revealed a disturbingly high prevalence of dating violence among American youth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1077801212455164">Eaton, Davis, &amp; Barrios, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1077801212455164">Howard, Wang, &amp; Yan, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1077801212455164">Sears, Byers, &amp; Price, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1077801212455164">West &amp; Rose, 2000</xref>). Youth Risk Behavior Survey (YRBS) data estimate prevalence rates of victimization at approximately 10% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1077801212455164">Eaton et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1077801212455164">Eaton et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1077801212455164">Howard et al., 2007</xref>), whereas community-based assessments have found prevalence rates for perpetration and victimization as high as 19% to 67% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1077801212455164">Sears et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1077801212455164">West &amp; Rose, 2000</xref>).</p>
<p>Research on dating violence tends not to focus on sexual minority (lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, or questioning) youth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1077801212455164">Freedner, Freed, Yang, &amp; Austin, 2002</xref>). Efforts to assess dating violence among this population have been minimal, addressing prevalence only, and reveal disturbing results. The most recently published Massachusetts Youth Risk Behavior Survey results revealed that sexual minority youth were significantly more likely than their heterosexual counterparts to experience dating violence (35% vs. 8%; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1077801212455164">Massachusetts Department of Education, 2006</xref>). Using a national sample of adolescents reporting exclusively same-sex sexual or romantic relationships, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1077801212455164">Halpern, Young, Waller, Martin, &amp; Kupper (2004)</xref> reported that nearly 25% identified as experiencing some form of abuse. Results of an assessment of sexual minority youth, aged 13 to 22, attending a youth rally indicated that 45% of the gay male youth, 57% of bisexual male youth, 44% of lesbian youth, and 38% of bisexual female youth surveyed had experienced dating violence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1077801212455164">Freedner et al., 2002</xref>). A survey conducted by Community United Against Violence and the Lavender Youth Recreation &amp; Information Center identified 49% of their youth sample reporting “feeling abused” and 25% reported having been abusive in their intimate relationships (as cited in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1077801212455164">Letellier &amp; Holt, 2000</xref>). Though these studies suggest high prevalence rates, little is known about the nature and manifestation of such violence among this population.</p>
<p>Multiple studies have identified individuals who suffer IPV as being at increased risk for adverse mental and physical health outcomes. Consequences documented in the literature include increased rates of depression, posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), sleep disturbances, chronic pain, fatigue, injury, gastrointestinal problems, gynecological problems, sexually transmitted infections (including HIV/AIDS), mortality, disability, reproductive disorders, poor pregnancy outcomes, substance abuse problems, and overall poor general health (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1077801212455164">Amar &amp; Gennaro, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1077801212455164">Campbell, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1077801212455164">Heintz &amp; Melendez, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1077801212455164">Kramer, Lorenzon, &amp; Mueller, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1077801212455164">Naumann, Langford, Torres, Campbell, &amp; Glass, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1077801212455164">Plichta, 2004</xref>). The effects of emotional abuse have been found to be just as detrimental as physical violence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1077801212455164">Kramer et al., 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>Also of concern is that teen dating violence has been linked with increased engagement in risk behaviors including early sexual activity, unprotected sex, alcohol and drug use, and greater number of lifetime sex partners (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1077801212455164">Eaton et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1077801212455164">Howard et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1077801212455164">Ismail, Berman, &amp; Ward-Griffin, 2007</xref>). Two studies found increased risk of HIV infection among lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) populations experiencing IPV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1077801212455164">Heintz &amp; Melendez, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1077801212455164">Stall et al., 2003</xref>). Finally, research suggests that individuals who are victimized as adolescents are at increased risk for victimization during their college years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1077801212455164">Smith, White, &amp; Holland, 2003</xref>). These problems are compounded in populations already at increased risk for negative mental and physical health outcomes as a result of being victims of hate crimes and the social stigma associated with societal homophobia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1077801212455164">Meyer, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1077801212455164">Sandfort, Melendez, &amp; Diaz, 2007</xref>). Such traumas are even worse for sexual minority persons of color, who too often face the assaults and insults of racism as well.</p>
<p>Adolescence is the period in which individuals form their nascent individual identities. This process includes developing one’s sexual identity and experiencing and negotiating dating relationships. The social pressure to fit in during this time is intense. For sexual minority youth, developing a positive sexual identity, often in the context of a homophobic/heterosexist environment, is even more uncertain in this already difficult period of development. Not conforming to socially approved dating practices may lead to teasing, ostracism, and violence for sexual minority youth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1077801212455164">Marrow, 2004</xref>). In addition, such experiences may lead to the internalization of homophobia in sexual minority youth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1077801212455164">Marrow, 2004</xref>). Such development may have a direct impact on the ability of these youth to develop healthy relationships. Internalized homophobia has been linked to less favorable perceptions of the quality of relationships and to both victimization and perpetration of IPV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1077801212455164">Balsam &amp; Szymanski, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1077801212455164">Otis, Rostosky, Riggle, &amp; Hamrin, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1077801212455164">Tigert, 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>In addition, the process of identity development occurs within the context of socially prescribed gender roles constructed around male dominance and female submissiveness. Gendered dating norms have been linked to the perpetration of male IPV against women (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1077801212455164">Ismail et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1077801212455164">Schechter, 1982</xref>). Despite the desire to believe that such dated notions no longer impact relationships between males and females, recent research indicates that youth are still influenced by such social norms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1077801212455164">Ismail et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1077801212455164">Johnson et al., 2005</xref>). Identity development of sexual minority youth also occurs within such contexts and may shape their perspective of relationships norms. This may be especially true because of the lack of models of healthy lesbian and gay relationships represented in communities and in the media for youth to look to for guidance and failure of school-based sex education classes to address LGBT sexualities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1077801212455164">Marrow, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>Another concern is that youth may not turn to adults or formal sources of help when experiencing dating violence, and do not receive adequate assistance when they do. Victims of dating violence have stated that they encountered skeptical or dismissive attitudes after revealing their abusive experiences, with avoidance and minimization among the responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1077801212455164">Ismail et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1077801212455164">Weisz, Tolman, &amp; Callahan, 2007</xref>). Fear of disapproval or rejection by family, peers, and school administrators on the basis of their sexual orientation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1077801212455164">Marrow, 2004</xref>) may be an additional barrier for sexual minority youth in seeking help for dating violence. These youth would not only have to reveal their experiences of dating violence, but also in the process would have to “come out” to anyone from whom they sought assistance. This creates an additional burden for sexual minority youth, making it more likely that they will keep quiet and suffer in silence than their heterosexual counterparts.</p>
<p>Given the detrimental effects of dating violence and the unique vulnerability of this population, these findings demonstrate the importance of understanding the issue of dating violence among sexual minority youth. Such an assessment is essential for determining the need for dating violence related services, including education, safety planning, and referrals for mental and physical health services for sexual minority youth.</p>
<p>As indicated above, a limited literature has addressed dating violence prevalence. What is lacking is qualitative exploration of dating violence among this population. Research that explores this issue with sexual minority youth is needed to enhance our understanding of the phenomenon among this underserved population and target prevention and intervention efforts appropriately. One particular area of interest is the unique factors that contribute to dating violence among this population.</p>
<p>The data that follow are part of a larger study designed to explore perceptions of dating violence, mental and physical health outcomes associated with such violence, and the correlation between early adolescent experiences of dating violence and dating violence as a college student. Results presented here discuss the perceptions of dating violence identified by a college student sample of sexual minority youth. Focus groups were conducted to address prevalence and reasons for sexual minority youth dating violence. Specifically, our guiding research questions were as follows: (a) How do sexual minority youth perceive prevalence of dating violence among their population? and (b) What factors do sexual minority youth identify as contributing to dating violence among their population? For the purposes of this research, sexual minority youth were defined as individuals between the ages of 18 and 24 who identify as lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, or questioning, or who indicate dating or being sexually intimate with a member of the same sex.</p>

<title>Sample and Recruitment</title>
<p>The focus groups were conducted as part of a larger study that surveyed 109 sexual minority youth between the ages of 18 and 24. Participants were recruited via flyers posted in strategic places on a large rural New England university campus and via active recruiting at campus-based queer groups, activities, and community events. Potential participants followed-up by making an appointment to complete the survey at the project office. After completing the survey, participants were informed that the investigator would subsequently hold focus groups and asked if they wished to be contacted for potential participation in those groups. Two separate focus groups were conducted, one with female participants and one with male participants. Limited enrollment of transgender individuals in the overall study prohibited our desire to include this perspective in focus group results. Special procedures were followed in an attempt to assure that focus group participants were not involved with each other to reduce the possibility that two individuals involved in an abusive relationship would participate in a group together.</p>
<p>Demographics of the overall study sample were as follows: 63 females, 37 males, 4 female-to-male transgendered, 3 gender queer, 1 “other,” and 1 “non-gender conforming”; 76% White, 6% Black/African American, 6% Asian American, 4% Latino, and 8% “other” (including Cape Verdean, Middle Eastern, Armenian, Israeli and mixed-race individuals); ages 18 to 24, mean = 20; 32% identified as gay, 26% as bisexual, 25% as lesbian, 13% as “other” (including those who identified as queer, pansexual, and non-orientation conforming), and 4% as questioning. Of these 109 participants, 18 participated in focus group discussions. Demographics of the focus group sample are as follows: 11 females, 7 males; 16 White (89%), 2 Black/African American (11%); ages 19 to 23, mean = 20; and 6 (33%) gay, 4 (22%) bisexual, 3 (17%) lesbian, 2 (11%) pansexual, 2 (11%) non-orientation conforming, 1 (6%) queer. Consequently, focus group participant demographics were similar to that of the overall study sample. Those who participated in focus groups were paid a stipend of US$20 for their time.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1077801212455164">
<title>Analysis</title>
<p>Focus groups were electronically recorded and transcribed verbatim. Thematic analysis utilizing an emergent coding approach was used to assess focus group data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1077801212455164">Miles &amp; Huberman, 1994</xref>). The analysis identified salient themes representing participant perspectives on the prevalence of and reasons for dating violence among this population. For the purposes of this research, dating violence was not defined for participants as they were asked how they would define dating violence. Participant responses identified definitions consistent with the literature, identifying physical, sexual, and psychological dating violence, respectively. With this understanding of the definition, we proceeded to ask participants questions regarding prevalence and contributing factors. Focus group questions are listed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1077801212455164">Table 1</xref>.</p>

<p>With the first round of coding, focus group transcripts were read and coded independently by both authors and a third reader trained in qualitative methodology. Each coded for emerging themes regarding dating violence prevalence and perceived reasons for its occurrence. A list of codes was generated as a result of each individual’s coding process. These three separate coding schemes and supporting quotes were compared for assessment of similarities and discrepancies. Discrepancies were resolved and when necessary, codes were redefined and renamed and a uniform coding scheme was created. Once a final coding scheme was reached through this process, the authors revisited the transcripts to match content with codes. Codes were then independently grouped by the authors into themes. Themes were then compared and finalized. Agreed-upon themes are presented below.</p>

<sec id="section6-1077801212455164">
<title>Dating Violence Prevalence</title>
<p>When asked about their perceptions of the prevalence of dating violence among sexual minority youth, most participants endorsed a belief that such violence was either more prevalent or the same as their heterosexual counterparts. One male participant expressed his belief that prevalence was higher among this population as follows:
<disp-quote>
<p>I just think it is more common that gay men could be, or not just necessarily gay men but like homosexual couples, could be in more violent situations than heterosexual. There’s so much at stake with coming out and keeping a lot of stuff in . . .</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Similarly, a female participant stated the following:
<disp-quote>
<p>I think there’s more potential for it to happen because you’re at the same physical level and so that if a girl hits a guy that will be the end of it and like it will be resolved, but if a girl hits a girl, you may be going at it for a while. Like, you’re going to hit her right back. . . . Or if a guy hits you, you might be afraid to hit him back and you might get out of the situation, but it can just snowball into something so physically after. Like the first punch is thrown so you’re just like, you know what, you’re the same size and I’m going to kick your ass. So it would, like there’s a lot of potential there for physical abuse in the same sex relationship . . .</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Those participants believing that the prevalence of dating violence within same sex relationships was the same as among their heterosexual peers agreed with one male participant who stated, “I’d have to say from personal experience it’s 50/50.”</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-1077801212455164">
<title>Reasons for Dating Violence</title>
<p>Participants were asked about their perceptions of the reasons that dating violence happens in sexual minority youth relationships. Responses identified four themes within this category: homophobia (both societal and internalized homophobia); negotiating socially prescribed gender roles; assumed female connection; and other relationship issues.</p>
<sec id="section8-1077801212455164">
<title>Homophobia</title>
<p>We live in a society where heterosexism and homophobia are ever present. As a result, for sexual minority youth, there is a constant negotiation of “self as other” in relation to the larger culture. According to the youth, the intense stigma associated with “being other” than heterosexual is one of the most important contexts for understanding the existence of violence in same-sex dating relationships. This culture of homophobia may keep them from coming out to others, lead them to feel isolated, and/or ashamed of their sexual identity. These factors associated with homophobia place stress both at the individual level and at the relational level. Participants discussed societal homophobia and internalized homophobia as reasons for violence in same-sex relationships.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-1077801212455164">
<title>Societal homophobia</title>
<p>Societal homophobia contributes to fear and stigma among sexual minority youth. This may result in youth choosing to stay in a violent relationship because of fear of reporting the abuse or fear that reporting the abuse will lead to their identity becoming public to family and friends. Societal homophobia also results in a lack of awareness about violence in same-sex relationships or a minimization of such violence.</p>
<p>The participants described needing to understand themselves against a larger cultural mirror that has universally presented heterosexual identities as “normal,” and as the only acceptable sexual orientation, while those that identify as lesbian, gay, or bisexual are made invisible, and viewed as deviant or unnatural. As one woman stated,“ . . . it’s not made visible . . . it [dating violence] happens so often because it’s not really culturally okay yet to be gay . . .”</p>
<p>This invisibility may lead to a perception of limited dating options. One male participant identified this as a reason for remaining in an abusive relationship:
<disp-quote>
<p>. . . in a gay relationship, you almost in a way have a lot more invested because the numbers in the pool are just so much smaller. So you almost feel like oh, this is kind of like, for me, it’s an emotionally kind of abusive relationship, but maybe you can come out of it. Like I’m just thinking if I was a heterosexual, I would never have considered that. I never would have been like, well, I mean there’s really a small pool to date out here, that would never be a thought in my mind.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Turning to the police for assistance when experiencing dating violence is not always an option for youth. Some of the youth in this study discussed how a larger culture of homophobia leads to fear of reporting the violence to authorities. There is a perception that if youth report violence from a partner, they may not be taken seriously or possibly could be revictimized by the police. As one male participant stated the following:
<disp-quote>
<p>I haven’t had friends who’ve been in violent relationships, but I’ve heard of people saying I’m afraid to go to the police or the authorities or whoever’s in charge because they won’t be sympathetic because it’s a gay relationship or they won’t understand, or they’ll ridicule me or they feel this is something that I need to keep under wraps because [even if] the person is out, they might not want that kind of scrutiny.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Because the youth may not be “out” to family and friends, they say that they may endure abuse because reporting it may result in having to tell their parents about their relationship. Telling parents may result in being cut off financially, being kicked out of the home, or a disconnection from family members.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>[In] a closeted relationship, the prospect of fear really makes it even worse. . . . It’s a fear of that parents will find out, that they’ll be moved out of the house, that they’ll be cut off from financial funding, all of these issues go together.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Another young woman talked about needing to hide her identify from her parents:
<disp-quote>
<p>. . . for me it’s just like a family member, like I can’t afford to be on my own right now. I can’t afford to be on my own. . . . I can’t take that risk. There’s no possible way I would be able to survive on that risk. Love is great, but like sometimes at the end of the day I hopefully can pay my bills.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Homophobia results in a silencing of sexual minority identities in social discourse about violence. This silencing serves to maintain heterosexual dominance and thereby further alienate sexual minority youth. The lack of same-sex models makes it difficult for youth to know what abuse looks like or leads to a minimization of abuse that may occur in a dating relationship. The following is an exchange about the difference in how violence is perceived between heterosexual and same sex relationships.</p>
<speech>
<speaker>Female participant:</speaker>
<p>Like a man beats his wife, like that is a big thing, more than hearing about it from a man beating a man in a same-sex relationship.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Female participant:</speaker>
<p>And it’s seen as more of a problem, I think, the man hits his wife than if two fags are beating each other or two dykes are going at it, whatever, who cares? Crazy gays. If a man beats his wife, it’s like, “whoa, abuse.”</p>
</speech>
<p>Another person discussed how she was unaware of abuse in her relationship until she left that relationship: “I didn’t even realize how bad the abuse was until I was out of the relationship and I looked back on it and I’m like, ‘oh my god, did I really let someone talk to me like that?’” A male participant expressed a similar sentiment: “If you’re being abusive or you’re getting abused and no one’s ever told you anything differently, how else are you going to know? You’re just going to continue to repeat these kinds of actions.”</p>
<p>This pervasive silencing and discrediting of same-sex relationships in the national discourse results in sexual minority youth feeling as if their relationships are viewed as inferior to heterosexual relationships and therefore physical violence in these relationships is perceived as less important. As one male participant stated the following:
<disp-quote>
<p>. . . until the government allows gay people to serve openly in the military, until gay people are allowed to marry in the United States, you’re never going to be considered equal and that goes all the way down to physical violence. Your physically violent relationship is not the equal of a heterosexual physically violent relationship.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The dynamics of homophobia and heterosexuality as the privileged orientation may provide permission or tacit support for victimization in dating situations. According to these youth, the omission of dialogue about the existence of same-sex relationships, the tacit approval of homophobia by a larger society through silence and overt policies, contribute to the existence of violence in same-sex relationships.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-1077801212455164">
<title>Internalized homophobia</title>
<p>Several participants discussed how societal homophobia becomes internalized, resulting in a discomfort with self or their same-sex relationships. Participants stated that this discomfort or shame with one’s sexual identity might be associated with violence in a relationship:
<disp-quote>
<p>. . . there’s some contributing factor to the fact that as gay people we have different ways of coming out or coming to our identities and in that sense, thinking about the ways we think about relationships and the ways in which we have had to kind of identify something outside of a norm. I think it allows for more of these things to occur. . . . I just think it is more common that gay men could be, or not just necessarily gay men, but like homosexual couples could be in more violent situations than heterosexuals. There’s so much at stake with coming out and keeping a lot of stuff in . . . [male participant]</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Another male participant stated, “I think that a lot of violence stems from insecurity. Like if you don’t feel good about yourself or the relationship, then you might lash out . . .”</p>
<p>Being unable to express one’s identity, whether in a heterosexual or same-sex relationship, may also lead to expressions of violence:
<disp-quote>
<p>I think [dating violence] has lots to do with the internalization of how you feel about being in that relationship and especially, like, how comfortable you are with your own gender, your own body, and I think people can have a lot of resentment towards themselves, towards their bodies, and towards their identities and, especially like for me, being in a lot of straight relationships . . . in [those] relationships, any violence that I exhibited towards the guy has always been my resentment towards him for not being able to express, like, a huge part of myself, which is like having feelings for girls. There’s always having feelings for girls and the part of me that can’t express [that] and that’s definitely led to violence in [those relationships]. Like not knowing what you think or not always being okay with the relationship that you’re having.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>“Internalized homophobia” may lead to feeling the need to hide or deny one’s sexual orientation in an attempt to fit into a heterosexual norm. Within this context, individuals continually negotiate the degree to which they are “out” in the world. Being in a same-sex relationship means considering a partner’s “out” status and the affect this status may have on you. Differences here may create tensions within couples as represented by the following exchange:</p>
<speech>
<speaker>Female participant:</speaker>
<p>I think dealing with pressures because I don’t think one person in a relationship is comfortable and the other person is not can create a lot of issues. I see that a lot.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Female participant:</speaker>
<p>It comes down to controlling coming out . . . my girlfriend had that situation where I was like, I just want to come out, and she just looked at me like, whoa, where are you going with this? She’s like, “you can come out as gay, but you better not [tell] people you’re in a relationship or anything like that. Like you can’t do that.” And I was just like, I don’t understand. She was like, “You have to understand the risk . . .”</p>
</speech>
<p>Similarly, another female participant stated the following:
<disp-quote>
<p>. . . people are really different in homosexual relationships, like in queer relationship, because expressing yourself is big. That’s a big, big part of you, whereas in like a heterosexual relationship, like you’re not really trying to express your sexuality I guess and at times like your sexuality is already known, whereas like in a homosexual relationship, you want to be known as such, want to identify as such, this other person’s like no, you can’t identify this. You can’t look like that. That’s against the law in my book. So like that’s a form of abuse where people are just like they’re kidding, you know. If they’re calling you names, you know, it’s just a different type of abuse. It comes in a different form.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Being in a same-sex relationship may reinforce a status as “other” such that these youth often feel marginalized, disconnected, and even targeted. Resisting this otherness can be so important as to lead to abusive or violent behavior. One woman described her anger that emerged as her girlfriend expressed an interest in dressing in more stereotypical male ways. She feared that being seen with a more masculine partner would expose her as “other.”</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>She was like, “I want to wear ties.” I was looking at her like, “I’m not going outside with you wearing ties.” . . . For the longest time I couldn’t understand, I was so angry with her and it was just because I’m bisexual and already I don’t want to be seen as other. I’m already other, like in the community, period . . . but, I have the pleasure of being able to not . . . have my gayness be so [obvious]. You just don’t see it. It doesn’t come across at all I guess and I was comfortable with that, but if I’m walking down the street with her and she has a tie on and we’re walking together . . . it just turned into a very disgusting argument, very disgusting time.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Similarly, another female participant described how her past abusive partner tried to control her gender expression so that she would appear more feminine and the two could appear as friends rather than as girlfriends:
<disp-quote>
<p>I was in a relationship over the past summer, like she was pretty abusive and controlling. . . . I had long hair and she told me if I cut it she would dump me, or like, I mean like another time we got into a full out argument because I wanted to leave the house wearing a hat forward and she said, “No, you have to wear your hat backwards because I like it like that.” And yes, she wouldn’t let me leave the house. I couldn’t leave my apartment . . . at the same time, I think she didn’t want to be identified with a more masculine female because she was in the military so no one could know she was gay.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-1077801212455164">
<title>Negotiating socially prescribed gender roles</title>
<p>Participants, both male and female, described a process of negotiating socially prescribed gender roles as a reason for conflict, sometimes contributing to violence in same-sex partnerships. This included gender role or expression conflicts, changes in or fluidity of gender roles, need for one partner to assert a dominant role and the association between being dominant and abusive. Participants described an imposition of heterosexual relationship molds on same-sex relationships and attempts by one or both parties in a relationship to conform to this mold. One female participant stated the following:
<disp-quote>
<p>. . . my girlfriend originally identified as gender queer. So like for the first year or so we were together, we’re both sort of like femmy or whatever and all of a sudden, she’s like presenting really masculine and she passes as a guy all the time and I like just got okay, like completely with I’m with a woman, yada yada, the whole gay thing and like now when people see me they’re like, oh straight, heterosexual, and like I’m trying to deal with being perceived that way again because I don’t want to pretend or be in a closet or be viewed that way. So it’s sort of hard to deal with that.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>A related exchange between two male participants emphasizes this point:</p>
<speech>
<speaker>Male participant:</speaker>
<p>I mean they could become the more dominant person in the relationship. So from there the other partner is now supposed to fill in basically what they don’t want to do and then if they don’t want to do that, from there you can risk potential violence.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Male participant:</speaker>
<p>I’d have to agree with that. Like if you have two people who consider themselves tops and it’s about the role of taking . . . it’s like that is obviously going to create a tension if there’s a sexual attraction and it possibly could lead to that, of course it’s going to be increased risk of violence if nobody’s willing to give as in any relationship. It’s just another source of tension.</p>
</speech>
<p>In other cases, trying to resist prescribed male and female gender roles can result in physical abuse. In the following excerpt, the participant described how her partner, who identified with a male gender role, did not want to engage in physical violence because it is not socially acceptable for a male (or butch female) to hit a female (or feminine female). The participant resisted these gender messages, thereby encouraging a physical fight with her girlfriend:
<disp-quote>
<p>. . . we just recently had issues like some legit, like battling issues where I don’t like the binary fem-stud-butch binary, I don’t like whatever and she looks at me and she goes, “I can’t hit you,” and I’m looking at her and what the fuck you talking about? Like we’re two girls, if you want to punch me then I’m going to punch you. Like this is how it’s going to go down. You know what I mean? If somebody wants to hit me, I don’t care if you’re a boy, girl, whatever, I’m going to fight you and she’s like, “I can’t hit you,” and I’m like, “Okay.” She’s like, “It doesn’t work out and make sense in my head . . . ”</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Conflicts also arose when defined “roles” were in place and one partner attempted to change or modify their previously defined “role.” One male participant stated this as follows:
<disp-quote>
<p>. . . a relationship can start off as honeymoon-esque in the beginning and then change to a nightmare because the roles that one person wants to hold can change halfway through a relationship and it could add severe amounts of stress to a relationship and lead to abuse.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Related to this, some participants attributed violence to being the means by which one partner asserts his or her dominant role in the relationship to fit gender stereotypes. One female participant articulated this as follows:
<disp-quote>
<p>I think a lot of people think that you can’t be dominant without being either verbally abusive or like readily make it known that you’re the dominant one in the relationship between two girls.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-1077801212455164">
<title>Assumed female connection</title>
<p>A contributing factor that emerged unique to female participants was the notion of an assumed female connection. Females asserted the idea that between two females there is an assumption of a shared connection with which comes the expectation that they should automatically understand each other, limiting the need for communication or the need to explain themselves to one another. The female participants expressed that when this does not occur within the relationship, tensions develop, which sometimes lead to abuse. One female participant describes this as follows:
<disp-quote>
<p>I was going to say as far as the communication piece, how it can manifest itself, I’m talking about girls. She should be able to understand me. We both have the same periods. We both get moody the same way. Why don’t you understand? What the fuck is wrong with you? Why don’t you get it, you know what I mean, and I’m going to be angry at her and not sensitive. If I was dating a man, it’s like he’s just not going to get it, I’m just going to let this go and go want to talk to my home girls.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Other participants expressed similar sentiments: “. . . there’s kind of like that female connection what you [referring to another participant] were talking about and connection you assume leads to a shared understanding and doesn’t necessarily . . .” and “. . . I mean same-sex couples . . . you have to deal with . . . like expecting the other person to understand you because they’re the same gender.”</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section13-1077801212455164">
<title>Other relationship issues</title>
<p>In addition to discussing factors they perceive to be unique to dating violence among same-sex couples, participants also identified factors that are similar to dynamics experienced in heterosexual couples. These include incompatibility, one person not being ready for a relationship, stress, class differences, lack of clarity regarding relationship status, and jealousy. For example, “Some people just aren’t good together. So sometimes the reason for the violence is because they push each other’s buttons” [male participant]. Another male participant stated the following:
<disp-quote>
<p>Another issue that came up in my first relationship wouldn’t just be like a closeted issue, but it’s also a class issue, somebody who perceived himself as higher class, who was more or less middle class, the idea of like the social norms that come with that and the understanding of that. So that’s something that would happen in homosexual relationships or heterosexual relationships.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Participants, however, also articulated that these factors may manifest themselves differently and/or more intensely in same-sex relationships than they do in heterosexual dating relationships. For example, when speaking of jealousy one female participant indicated that if one female is dating a bisexual female, the idea that she would be jealous of potential males and females adds to this dynamic. She expressed this as follows: “Plus you have double the jealousy if you’re dating a bisexual girl. They’re always looking at dudes and girls, like that jealousy level is just like up there.” Related to this, a male participant stated the following:
<disp-quote>
<p>I think they have . . . some of the reasons are going to be the same. I mean the basic stress of being in a relationship or who you are . . . but at the same time I feel like there are different stressors in different types of relationships. So there’s the closeting factor for homosexual relationships . . .</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>This study makes an important contribution to the literature as it provides additional understanding of dating violence in an understudied population. As indicated above, previous studies have assessed prevalence among sexual minority youth. However, previous work has not qualitatively explored the dynamics of such violence among this population, including factors that youth identify as contributing to its occurrence.</p>
<p>The participants in this study perceived dating violence prevalence among sexual minority youth to be at least equal to, but mostly more prevalent than, among their heterosexual peers. In this process they identified reasons for this perception, including the additional stress of navigating a same-sex dating relationship and the notion that a same-sex partner is viewed as being of equal power and thus fair game for striking or engaging in a physical altercation. First, this perception appears to mimic the reality demonstrated in the current literature as most existing data support that dating violence among sexual minority youth is occurring at a rate that exceeds that of heterosexual youth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1077801212455164">Freedner et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1077801212455164">Massachusetts Department of Education, 2006</xref>). These findings are important for two reasons. First, they provide additional reinforcement of the presence and magnitude of the problem of dating violence among sexual minority youth, supporting the need for prevention and intervention efforts targeting this population. Second, they provide support for the contention that sexual minority youth are aware that this is an issue within their community and consequently may be receptive to interventions targeting this issue.</p>
<p>Participants identified the process of navigating socially prescribed gender roles as a source of tension that sometimes led to violence. It is not surprising that heterosexual gender roles and relationship molds impact same-sex relationships. As indicated above, we live in a culture where socially prescribed gender roles constructed around male dominance and female submissiveness prevail and continue to influence today’s youth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1077801212455164">Ismail et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1077801212455164">Johnson et al., 2005</xref>), with gendered dating norms having been linked to the perpetration of violence in intimate partnerships (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1077801212455164">Ismail et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1077801212455164">Schechter, 1982</xref>). Consequently, as discussed by the youth in this research, these norms shape their perspective of what their relationships should resemble. This is especially true given the dearth of public models of healthy lesbian and gay relationships and the exclusion of LGBT sexualities in school-based sex education classes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1077801212455164">Marrow, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>These norms impact youth same-sex relationships in significant ways. What is clear from these results is that some sexual minority youth consciously resist these norms whereas others ascribe to them. Having individuals with these differing positions in a relationship together creates a source of conflict as they negotiate this space. These norms also influence same-sex relationships through the male-dominant, female-submissiveness model where “masculine” identified females and males assert their dominant role via the use of aggression and control tactics.</p>
<p>Participants in this study also identified homophobia, both societal and internalized, as a contributing factor to dating violence in same-sex relationships. The concept of “minority stress” provides us with a lens through which to understand this relationship. The impact of an oppressive culture has been referred to in the literature as minority stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1077801212455164">DiPlacido, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1077801212455164">Meyer, 2003</xref>) and has been linked to such negative outcomes as increased isolation, shame, depression, substance abuse, and even suicide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1077801212455164">Allen &amp; Oleson, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1077801212455164">Herek, Cogan, Gillis, &amp; Glunt, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1077801212455164">Lock &amp; Kleis, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1077801212455164">Shidlo, 1994</xref>). As operationalized by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1077801212455164">Balsam and Szymanski (2005)</xref> in their study of domestic violence in women’s same-sex relationships, minority stress includes both experiences of heterosexist discrimination (societal homophobia) and internalized homophobia. Research has identified that sexual minorities experience multiple stressors, including stigma, prejudice, and discrimination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1077801212455164">Balsam &amp; Szymanski, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1077801212455164">Marrow, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1077801212455164">Meyer, 2003</xref>). The authors inform us that the stress of living in a heterosexist society contributes to the use of violence in relationships (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1077801212455164">Balsam &amp; Szymanski, 2005</xref>). This contention is supported by other prior research that has found stress to negatively impact intimate relationships (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1077801212455164">Murry, Brown, Brody, Cutrona, &amp; Simons, 2001</xref>), including the use of violence in these relationships (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1077801212455164">Cano &amp; Vivian, 2001</xref>). What this research tells us is that experiencing societal homophobia creates additional stress for sexual minorities. Consequently, this stress may result in the use of violence in one’s intimate relationship. In their study, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1077801212455164">Balsam and Szymanski (2005)</xref> also found a relationship between homophobia and intimate partner violence, thus highlighting this relationship. One finding in particular was an identified association between experiences of discrimination (one aspect of minority stress) and perpetration of psychological and physical/sexual aggression against a partner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1077801212455164">Balsam &amp; Szymanski, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>The period of adolescence is a time when individuals are engaged in the process of forming their unique identities, transitioning from childhood into adulthood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1077801212455164">Ryan &amp; Futterman, 1997</xref>). Part of this identity formation is developing and coming to terms with the reality of one’s sexual identity and the experience and negotiation of dating relationships. Research with young women has shown this as a time in which peers and media exert pressure on female youth to develop committed relationships and have boyfriends (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1077801212455164">Ismail et al., 2007</xref>). For sexual minority youth, developing a positive sexual identity, often in the context of a homophobic/heterosexist environment, adds an additional challenge to this already fragile period of development. Not conforming to socially sanctioned dating practices may lead to teasing, ostracism, and violence for LGBT youth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1077801212455164">Marrow, 2004</xref>). Consequently, such an experience may lead to the development of internalized homophobia, another component of minority stress, in sexual minority youth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1077801212455164">Ryan &amp; Futterman, 1997</xref>). Internalized homophobia has been conceptualized as the negative feelings or even self-hate that results from growing up in a homophobic environment that devalues those who identify as a sexual minority (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1077801212455164">Bohan, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1077801212455164">Shidlo, 1994</xref>). Such development may have a direct impact on the ability of these youth to establish healthy relationships as well as on the quality of their dating relationships, as internalized homophobia has been linked to both victimization and perpetration of same-sex intimate violence and less favorable perceptions of relationship quality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1077801212455164">Balsam &amp; Szymanski, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1077801212455164">Otis et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1077801212455164">Tigert, 2001</xref>).</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1077801212455164">Balsam and Szymanski (2005)</xref> found in their study that relationship quality moderated the relationship between internalized homophobia and domestic violence. The authors contend that it may be through relationship quality that internalized homophobia leads to domestic violence. In other words, experiencing internalized homophobia leads to poorer perceptions of relationship quality, which in turn leads to domestic violence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1077801212455164">Balsam &amp; Szymanski, 2005</xref>). Again, for sexual minority youth these factors may be compounded by lack of role models and sexuality appropriate education (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1077801212455164">Marrow, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1077801212455164">Ryan &amp; Futterman, 1997</xref>).</p>
<p>For heterosexual relationships, the larger culture of oppression against women is a context for understanding heterosexual violence. For those in same-sex relationships, this larger context includes both gender norms and a homophobic context. The youth in this study have identified societal homophobia as a risk to same-sex relationships because of the increased stress homophobia brings into a same-sex relationship. They also identify it as a factor in whether they report dating violence to others (including family, police, or peers). Reporting dating violence would necessitate identifying as a sexual minority youth. They also identified the impact that internalized homophobia has on relationships, including concerns about the other partner being too “out” or trying to control the look of the other partner so as not to be identified as a sexual minority. As the literature above supports, youth perceived that coping with these experiences might place additional stress on relationships, which contributes to dating violence. More research is needed in this area to fully understand the association between homophobia and relationship violence for youth same-sex relationships.</p>
<p>A surprising theme that arose from this work was the identification of an assumed female connection contributing to relationship tension when violated. Females talked about an underlying assumption in relationships between themselves that they understand and relate to each other, including each other’s moods and emotions, simply on the basis of their same gender and female positions. If this assumption exists for some individuals it is likely to lead to a lack of adequate communication in the relationship. This is particularly concerning as healthy communication is important for relationship quality and longevity in both same-sex and heterosexual intimate partnerships (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1077801212455164">Mackey, Diemer, &amp; O’Brien, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>It is not surprising that factors that create tension in heterosexual dating relationships would also do so in same-sex dating relationships. Participants identified issues such as incompatibility, stress, and jealousy as negatively impacting dating relationships. It is noteworthy, though, that these issues may manifest differently or be compounded in same-sex dating relationships.</p>
<p>Worthy of reinforcement here is one youth’s comment that societal devaluing of sexual minorities and same-sex relationships fosters lack of attention to dating violence in this population. His words highlight the message that discriminatory polices that cast sexual minorities as second class citizens and their relationships as unworthy of legal recognition and its associated rights and privileges has many detrimental affects, including placing these individuals at heightened risk for the negative consequences of dating violence via inadequate acknowledgement and response. Research supports the detrimental impact of these discriminatory policies on the mental health of sexual minorities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1077801212455164">Hatzenbuehler, McLaughlin, Keys, &amp; Hasin, 2010</xref>), which likely also impacts relationship quality.</p>
<p>Understanding sexual minority youth’s perceptions of dating violence in the context of their same-sex dating relationships is important to enhancing our understanding of this phenomenon and the unique factors that would need to be targeted through prevention and intervention efforts. This research suggests that sexual minority youth experience dynamics unique to them and their relationships that cannot be understood through examining heterosexual dating violence and cannot be effectively addressed through existing dating violence prevention programs that use and presume a heterosexual dating context for all youth. This study, therefore, makes a significant and useful contribution to the dating violence literature and the informing of dating violence services and programs for sexual minority youth.</p>

<sec id="section15-1077801212455164">
<title>Limitations</title>
<p>As with any research, this study has limitations. First, with only two focus groups, the sample size was limited. However, even from this limited sample, a richness of data emerged.</p>
<p>A second limitation is the absence of the voices of transgender-identified youth. Conducting focus groups with transgender youth was indeed a goal of this project and efforts were made to recruit transgender individuals. However, an insufficient number of transgender youth were enrolled in the larger study making it difficult to include them in the focus groups.</p>
<p>Third, this is a specific sample, college-enrolled sexual minority youth. In addition, the geographic area is in a progressive, liberal area in a state that legally allows and recognizes same-sex marriage. College campuses in this area include programming and support for sexual minority students. Thus, further research is needed with community-based samples and those youth in states that do not allow same-sex marriage and do not have such support in place.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section16-1077801212455164">
<title>Implications for Research</title>
<p>Further research needs to be conducted with community-based samples to identify the extent of violence experienced by youth who may not go on to higher education. It would be particularly informative to conduct such research in urban areas where violence in general tends to be high and additional life stressors are present.</p>
<p>This field would also greatly benefit from research that further explores, both qualitatively and quantitatively, those factors that contribute to dating violence among this unique, underrepresented population. Given the multiple stressors that youth who identify as sexual minorities or are questioning their sexuality often encounter, it is possible that there are additional unique factors that contribute to violence within this population. In addition, factors identified here may vary in manifestation by such characteristics as geography, race, ethnicity, class, and/or location. Research that facilitates our understanding of these unique dynamics may help to inform needs and services for this population.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section17-1077801212455164">
<title>Implications for Service</title>
<p>This research supports other studies in identifying dating violence as a present and problematic dynamic among this population. It is important to use this information to enhance services available to this population, create new, targeted intervention efforts, and modify current efforts such that they are inclusive of this particularly vulnerable population.</p>
<p>Community-based agencies that work with sexual minority youth should include dating violence education within their agencies. They may inform youth about the existence of such violence, warning signs of abuse, and where and from whom they may seek assistance. Training a staff person who could hold occasional dating violence workshops or programs at the agency and serve as a resource for youth who are experiencing dating violence would be beneficial. Dating violence awareness materials (posters, pamphlets), especially those that depict sexual minorities, may also be placed within the agency. These agencies may also collaborate with local domestic violence agencies working to build the capacity of these agencies to address the unique needs of same-sex couples. Gay-straight alliances that are present in some high schools across the country may engage in similar efforts.</p>
<p>Community-based domestic and sexual violence agencies should also begin to make their services more inclusive of sexual minority populations and their needs. Likewise, high schools using teen dating curricula and teen dating violence prevention programs should discuss the unique needs of same-sex couples, including how to identify harmful relationships.</p>
<p>Lastly, our youth need programs that teach them how to have healthy relationships and how to identify unhealthy ones. This is something our youth are missing in the formal education they receive. This is especially true for sexual minority youth whose relationships are often unacknowledged or ridiculed. Because of homophobia and heterosexism in our society, sexual minority youth often do not receive the benefit of having sexual minority role models with whom to identify and models of healthy same-sex relationships. Thus, such programming would be especially beneficial to this population that is clearly demonstrating unhealthy relationship dynamics that carry into adulthood with detrimental consequences.</p>
<p>In conclusion, this work contributes to a limited body of literature and calls attention to the need for raising awareness and investing resources in researching and addressing the problem of dating violence among sexual minority youth with attention to the unique nuances of its manifestations among this population.</p>
