<p>Introduction: This study is designed to identify proteomic biomarkers that predict the subsequent development of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM). Methods: Maternal blood was obtained prospectively from healthy pregnant women in the early second trimester (16-20 weeks). Twelve women subsequently diagnosed with GDM at 24 to 28 weeks were selected as cases; an equal number of normoglycemic women as controls. Proteomic analysis of the previously stored plasma was performed by surface-enhanced laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight (SELDI-TOF) mass spectrometry. Results: Three peaks (9122 Da, 9412 Da, and 9701 Da) that were increased in cases were characterized as isoforms of apolipoprotein CIII. Another discriminatory peak (17 105 Da) that was decreased in cases was matched to apolipoprotein AII. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) confirmed that women who subsequently developed GDM had significantly higher levels of apolipoprotein CIII than controls did. Levels of apolipoprotein AII failed to reach statistical significance. Conclusion: Our data suggest that there already exist biomarkers in the maternal circulation at 16 to 20 weeks in women who subsequently develop GDM.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is associated with adverse perinatal outcomes (including stillbirth, macrosomia, and birth trauma) as well as maternal morbidities (preeclampsia, infection, increased cesarean delivery rate, and future development of diabetes mellitus).<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1933719111417889">1</xref>

</sup> The prevalence of GDM in the United States has increased dramatically from 1.9% in 1989 to 1990 to 4.2% in 2003 to 2004,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1933719111417889">7</xref>
</sup> due primarily to an increase in obesity rates.</p>
<p>The timely and accurate diagnosis of GDM is important because identifying and treating this disorder substantially reduces the risk of adverse perinatal outcomes.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1933719111417889">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1933719111417889">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1933719111417889">9</xref>
</sup> A previous study reported that early glucose tolerance screening could decrease some diabetes-associated complications such as hydramnios and preterm labor.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1933719111417889">10</xref>
</sup> Routine screening for GDM in those women not known to have glucose intolerance earlier in pregnancy is generally carried out after 24 weeks of gestation. The reason given for this delay is to allow the placenta to achieve sufficient mass to produce levels of counterregulatory (anti-insulin) hormones in the maternal circulation—including human chorionic somatomammotropin (previously known as human placental lactogens) and placental growth hormone—that are sufficient to interfere with glucose homeostasis.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1933719111417889">11</xref>
</sup> A new approach is needed to accurately predict the subsequent development of GDM at an earlier gestational age, thereby allowing for earlier intervention to improve perinatal outcome. With this goal in mind, the current study was designed to use proteomic technology to identify biomarkers in maternal plasma in the early second trimester of pregnancy that will predict the subsequent development of GDM. Surface-enhanced laser desorption and ionization time-of-flight (SELDI-TOF) mass spectrometry is a proteomic technique that can generate reproducible protein profiles from a variety of biologic compartments with a small amount of starting material.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1933719111417889">12</xref>
</sup> Proteomic technology has previously been used to identify biomarkers that are differentially expressed in the circulation of nonpregnant patients with confirmed diabetes mellitus.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1933719111417889">13</xref>

</sup> The current study is novel in 2 respects (i) it investigates for the first time differential expression of proteins in the circulation of women with GDM and (ii) in contrast to identifying differentially expressed proteins in women with established GDM, it is designed to identify biomarkers that predict the subsequent development of GDM.</p>

<title>Methods</title>
<sec id="section3-1933719111417889">
<title>Patients and Samples</title>
<p>Maternal blood was collected prospectively in the early second trimester (16-20 weeks of gestation) from healthy singleton pregnant women without chronic disease or pregnancy-associated complications, who presented to the hospital for genetic amniocentesis due to advanced maternal age or abnormal serum analyte screening results. Blood samples were taken by venipuncture and collected into EDTA-containing tubes. Samples were centrifuged at 700<italic>g</italic> for 10 minutes and the supernatant stored in polypropylene tubes at −70°C until assay. Samples were excluded if significant hemolysis was identified.</p>
<p>All patients were screened for GDM between 24 and 28 weeks of gestation using a 1-hour nonfasting 50-g oral glucose challenge test according to the recommendations of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG).<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1933719111417889">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1933719111417889">17</xref>
</sup> A cutoff of &gt;140 mg/dL was regarded as a positive screening test. The diagnosis of GDM was confirmed on a 3-hour 100-g oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) using the Carpenter and Coustan criteria.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1933719111417889">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1933719111417889">17</xref>
</sup> Women subsequently diagnosed with GDM were selected as cases (n = 12) and normoglycemic women matched for ethnicity, age, parity, gestational age at blood sampling, and body mass index (BMI) were selected as controls (n = 12). Women with chronic medical conditions or obstetric complications (such as preterm labor, preterm premature rupture of membranes, preeclampsia, placenta previa, or fetal structural or chromosomal abnormality) were excluded. The research protocol was approved by the Institutional Review Board at Seoul National University Hospital, Korea, and written consent was obtained from all patients.</p>

<sec id="section4-1933719111417889">
<title>Proteomic Profiling Using SELDI-TOF Mass Spectrometry</title>
<p>Individual (unpooled) plasma samples were analyzed by SELDI-TOF mass spectrometry (ProteinChip system model series 4000; Ciphergen Biosystems Inc, Fremont, California). The Q10 ProteinChip Array was selected because pilot study showed that it gave the most discriminatory proteomic profile (data not shown). After each spot of the Q10 ProteinChip Array was equilibrated, 2 μL of each plasma sample was mixed with 3 μL of solubilization buffer (9 mol/L urea, 2% 3-[(3-Cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonate [CHAPS]) and incubated for 30 minutes at room temperature. Thereafter, 45 μL of Q10 binding buffer (0.05% triton X-100 in 50 mmol/L 4-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1-piperazineethanesulfonic acid [HEPES], pH 7.0) was added and 5 μL of the plasma mixture (plasma sample + solubilization buffer + binding buffer) loaded onto each spot and incubated in a humidity chamber for 1 hour at room temperature. After washing and air drying, 1 μL of sinapinic acid (5 mg of SPA in 50% acetonitrile [ACN] and 0.5% trifluoroacetic acid [TFA]) was loaded twice onto each spot. The ProteinChip arrays were then analyzed by a ProteinChip Reader using ProteinChip System Series 4000 (Ciphergen). After peak calibration, peak alignment, and normalization of each proteomic profile obtained from the analysis, a total of 159 individual peak clusters were detected by ProteinChip software (Ciphergen Express Client ver. 3.0 software [signal-to-noise: ≥5, valley depth: ≥5, minimum peak threshold: 0%, cluster mass window: 0.3%]). Statistical analysis using the Mann-Whitney <italic>U</italic> test was used to identify the proteomic “fingerprint” (peaks of interest) that was able to most accurately discriminate between women who subsequently developed GDM (cases) and normoglycemic controls.</p>

<sec id="section5-1933719111417889">
<title>Purification and Isolation of the Protein Peaks of Interest</title>
<p>Hydrophobic chromatography on beads was used for purification and isolation of the protein peaks of interest. In brief, individual plasma samples (200 μL) were boiled, diluted in 200 μL of 1% TFA, and bound to a chromatography column packed with octyl-sepharose CL-4B resin (O6001; Sigma-Aldrich, ST. Louis, MO). After washing with 1% TFA, the proteins bound to the beads were eluted from the column using a buffer containing 0.1% TFA/10%, 20%, 30%, and 50% ACN. Each eluted fraction was loaded onto an Au ProteinChip (Ciphergen) and was read using SELDI-TOF mass spectrometry. The fractions containing the proteins of interest were freeze-dried, and the dehydrated samples dissolved in 40 μL of deionized water and stored at −70°C prior to further analysis. Thereafter, 40 μL of stored samples containing each of the peaks of interest were mixed with 10 μL sample buffer and boiled. The mixture was electrophoresed on a 15% sodium dodecyl sulfate–polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE), which was stained overnight with Coomassie blue G-250. The gel band corresponding to the molecular weight of the protein of interest was excised, washed, and dehydrated by incubating with 100% ACN for 20 minutes. The dehydrated gel was incubated with shaking in an elution solution (10% formic acid; Fluka Chemie AG Switzerland), 30% ACN, 20% isopropanol, and 40% deionized water). Thereafter, 2 μL of the eluted protein were placed on an Au ProteinChip (Ciphergen), followed by confirmation with SELDI-TOF mass spectrometry. The gel band whose molecular weight was identical to that of the peak of interest was selected for further identification and characterization.</p>

<sec id="section6-1933719111417889">
<title>Identification of the Proteins of Interest by In-Gel Tryptic Digestion and ESI-Tandem Mass Spectrometry</title>
<p>Excised pieces of SDS-PAGE containing the proteins of interest were exposed to overnight in-gel trypsin digestion at 37°C as previously reported.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1933719111417889">18</xref>
</sup> The gel pieces incubated with the digestion buffer were desalted, centrifuged, and the supernatant collected. The peptides generated by in-gel tryptic digestion were analyzed by tandem mass spectrometry with nano-electrospray ionization (nano-ESI) on a Q-TOF-2 mass spectrometer (Micromass, Manchester, UK). The data processing was done using Mass Lynx (Waters, Manchester, UK) on a Windows NT PC system (Microsoft Corp, Redmond, Washington). To identify the proteins of interest, all MS/MS spectra recorded on tryptic digest peptides were used to derive amino acid sequences using a peptide de novo sequencing program and were compared with known protein sequences from National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) Expressed Sequence Tags databases using the MASCOT search program (Matrix Science Ltd, London, UK) and NCBI Basic Local Alignment Search Tool.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-1933719111417889">
<title>Validation of Proteins of Interest by Immunodepletion</title>
<p>Immunodepletion was performed to confirm the identity of the proteins of interest characterized by MS/MS. In brief, 10 μg of the antibody against the protein of interest was loaded into protein G agarose beads and incubated overnight at 4°C protein G-agarose (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc, Waltham, Massachusetts). The beads were washed with 1× phosphate-buffered saline ([PBS] pH 7.4). The antibody-coupled beads were then incubated with a solution containing the unspecified proteins (0.5 μL of plasma + 99.5 μL of 1× PBS) at 4°C for 3 hours. After all the supernatant had been removed, the beads were washed 3 times with PBS and twice with deionized water, and then mixed with 20 μL of elution buffer (0.1% TFA/50% ACN). The eluted fraction was collected, loaded onto an Au ProteinChip, and analyzed by SELDI-TOF mass spectrometry.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-1933719111417889">
<title>Quantification of Proteins of Interest by Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay</title>
<p>The proteins of interest were quantified using sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The ELISAs were performed on individual plasma samples by providers who were blinded to the clinical data. Capture antibody diluted in coating buffer (15 mmol/L Na<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub>, 35 mmol/L NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, pH 9.6) was loaded into each well of a microtiter plate (NUNC Immuo Module, 469914) and incubated overnight at 4°C, then washed, blocked, and incubated with plasma samples at a dilution of 1:10 000 for 2 hours. The plasma samples were identical with the samples used in proteomic profiling by SELDI-TOF mass spectrometry. After washing, diluted detection antibody was loaded into each well and incubated at room temperature for 1 hour. After color development, absorbance was measured at 450 nm. The antibodies used included (<italic>i</italic>) capture antibody MAB4215 (R&amp;D Systems, Inc, Minneapolis, Minnesota) and detection antibody A2299-32 (US Biological Inc, Swampscott, Massachusetts) for apolipoprotein AII (apo AII) ELISA; and (<italic>ii</italic>) capture antibody AB821 (Millipore Corp, Bedford, Massachusetts) and detection antibody K97113R (Meridian Life Science Inc, 60 Industrial Park Road Saco, Maine) for apolipoprotein CIII (apo CIII) ELISA. Intra-assay coefficients of variation were &lt;10% for each ELISA.</p>

<p>The clinical characteristics of the GDM cases and normoglycemic controls are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1933719111417889">Table 1</xref>. There were no statistical differences between the 2 groups as regard maternal age, parity, gestational age at blood sampling, and BMI. All patients were delivered at term and did not have any medical complication aside from GDM. In all cases of GDM, the levels of hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) measured at the time of diagnosis (24-28 weeks) were within the normal range for our laboratory (median [range]: 5.5 [5.2-6.1]%). Of the 12 patients with GDM, 5 used insulin during pregnancy. pregestational diabetes was excluded using a postpartum 75-g OGTT performed at 6 to 12 weeks postpartum visit.<sup>

<p>To further identify the protein peaks of interest, selected SDS-PAGE pieces were characterized by in-gel tryptic digestion and ESI-MS/MS as described above. Using this approach, 3 of the 9 peaks that were significantly upregulated in women who subsequently developed GDM with similar molecular weights (9122 Da, 9412 Da, and 9702 Da) were characterized as different isoforms of apo CIII; the other 6 peaks were not characterized. Other peaks (17 105 Da, 17 222 Da, and 17 350 Da) were characterized as different isoforms of apo AII. Immunodepletion experiments using agarose beads coupled with antibodies against apo CIII and apo AII were performed to confirm the identity of the characterized proteins. These experiments confirm that the 3 peaks in the 9000 Da range do indeed represent isoforms of apo CIII (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1933719111417889">Figure 3A</xref>), and the 3 peaks in the 17 000 Da range represent isoforms of apo AII (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1933719111417889">Figure 3B</xref>). Use of nonspecific immunoglobulin showed no background (nonspecific) immunodepletion (data not shown).</p>

<p>Confirming the identity of the proteins of interest using immunodepletion. To confirm the identity of the discriminatory protein peaks, maternal plasma samples containing each of the protein peaks of interest were immunodepleted using specific antibodies against apolipoprotein CIII (A) and apolipoprotein AII (B). In each case, selective affinity with the specific antibody of putative protein identified by in-gel tryptic digestion resulted in appearance of the peak of interest on subsequent analysis by surface-enhanced laser desorption and ionization time-of-flight (SELDI-TOF) mass spectrometry.

<title>Quantification of Proteins of Interest by ELISA</title>
<p>The differentially expressed proteins were quantified by sandwich ELISA in the maternal plasma collected from cases and controls. The concentrations of apo CIII were significantly increased in the pregnant women who subsequently developed GDM compared with the normoglycemic controls (median [range]: 12.6 [9.8-22.2] vs 11.0 [9.2-29.3] mg/dL, respectively; <italic>P </italic>= .028 by Mann-Whitney <italic>U</italic> test).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>This study demonstrates for the first time that biomarkers exist in the maternal circulation in the early second trimester that predict the subsequent development of GDM several weeks before the diagnosis is confirmed, and that these biomarkers include among others apo CIII and apo AII.</p>
<p>Previous proteomic studies in nonpregnant patients have identified circulating biomarkers that are differentially expressed in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus compared with normoglycemic controls. In a study, the concentrations of apo CIII were significantly increased and those of apo CI, apo AI, and apo E were significantly decreased in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus compared with matched controls.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1933719111417889">20</xref>
</sup> In another study, the levels of apo CIII and transthyretin were upregulated, whereas those of albumin and transferrin were downregulated in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1933719111417889">13</xref>
</sup> Our current data confirm a significant upregulation of apo CIII also in patients who were subsequently diagnosed with GDM. This increase in women with GDM was not due to the presence of undiagnosed pregestational diabetes, since women with pregestational diabetes were excluded by 75-g OGTT in the postpartum period. It was also not related to the degree of glycemic control, since the difference was noted several weeks prior to the diagnosis of GDM.</p>
<p>Apolipoproteins bind to lipids to form lipoproteins, which serve as transport chaperones for lipids in the lymphatic and circulatory systems. Some also serve as enzyme cofactors or receptor ligands in tissues. Apolipoprotein CIII, a major constituent of very-low-density lipoproteins (VLDL) and chylomicrons, has additional functional importance since it also acts as an inhibitor of lipoprotein lipase<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1933719111417889">21</xref>
</sup> and reduces hepatic uptake of triglyceride-rich lipoprotein remnants.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1933719111417889">22</xref>
</sup> Elevated circulating level of apo CIII has been previously documented in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1933719111417889">23</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1933719111417889"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1933719111417889">25</xref>
</sup> In our proteomic profiling experiments, we identified several distinct protein peaks of similar molecular weights (about 9000 Da) that were all subsequently characterized as apo CIII. These isoforms of apo CIII result from different degrees of sialylation. The number of sialic acid residues attached to the threonine at residue 74 modifies the molecular weight of the protein.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1933719111417889">26</xref>
</sup> It is unclear yet whether each isoform has functional significance. A similar phenomenon was observed also with apo AII.</p>
<p>Apolipoprotein AII is the second most abundant protein component of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) with molecular weight of approximately 17 000 Da and exists in human tissues as a homodimer. Several isoforms of the apo AII monomer exist based again on the degree of sialylation. <italic>O</italic>-linked glycosylation is a common method by which apolipoproteins are modified, and the degree of modification seems to play an important role in HDL metabolism by controlling the association between apo AII and HDL.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1933719111417889">27</xref>
</sup> The function of apo AII remains largely unknown. As such, there are conflicting data about the relationship between apo AII and type 2 diabetes mellitus. Using a transgenic murine model, one set of investigators suggested that an increased plasma concentrations of apo AII might contribute to type 2 diabetes mellitus,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1933719111417889">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1933719111417889">29</xref>
</sup> whereas several clinical studies in humans have suggested that decreased serum apo AII concentrations predict the development of metabolic syndrome and type 2 diabetes mellitus.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1933719111417889">30</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1933719111417889"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1933719111417889">32</xref>
</sup> While this apparent difference may be accounted for at least in part by differences between species, clearly additional studies are needed to better define the relationship among apo AII, glucose metabolism, and insulin resistance.</p>
<p>In this study, we used proteomic profiling to identify 9 protein peaks that were significantly and differentially increased in the plasma of women who subsequently developed GDM compared with normoglycemic controls, and identified 3 of these proteins as apo CIII. However, the proteins characterized as apo AII showed variable results in each peak of the protein profiling, such as significantly decreased, decreased with marginal significance, or increased without statistical significance in the cases compared to the controls. Quantitative analysis by ELISA confirmed the increase of apo CIII in women who were subsequently diagnosed with GDM, but levels of apo AII as measured by ELISA were not significantly different between the 2 groups. This may be explained by the nature of the apo AII ELISA. The in-gel tryptic digest and immunodepletion experiments confirmed that 3 of the discriminative peaks identified by proteomic profiling corresponded to apo AII. Of these 3 peaks, the first was significantly decreased and the second was decreased with marginal significance, whereas the third was increased in women who were subsequently diagnosed with GDM. In the ELISA experiment, the concentration of apo AII appeared to be increased in women who were subsequently diagnosed with GDM, although the difference failed to reach statistical significance. This may be caused by a type II statistical error (with only 12 pairs of participants). However, a more likely explanation is that it reflects the existence of the different isoforms of apo AII in human plasma. The ELISA measures overall apo AII concentrations and cannot distinguish the different isoforms. Our result appears as if the critical difference between the 2 groups lies in the isoform represented by the third peak in our proteomic profile but which cannot be detected separately by ELISA. The functional features of the different apo AII isoforms are not known.</p>
<p>The limitation of this study is that it was performed with relatively small number of participants. However, SELDI-TOF mass spectrometry is a powerful technique in which significant and meaningful results can be obtained with a relatively small number of samples as previous reported.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1933719111417889">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1933719111417889">34</xref>
</sup> Additional prospective studies with larger sample numbers would be required to confirm and further validate these observations. Experiments are currently underway to characterize the different apo CIII and apo AII isoforms identified on proteomic analysis to see whether these individual peaks can better inform our predictive model. We went to great lengths to ensure that we excluded patients with pregestational diabetes using the level of HbA1c at the time of diagnosis of GDM and the results of a postpartum 75-g OGTT. Specifically, there were no cases of pregestational diabetes diagnosed in the postpartum period and the levels of HbA<sub>1c</sub> measured at that time of GDM diagnosis (24-28 weeks) were all within normal range. Since HbA<sub>1c</sub> levels reflect mean glycemic control over a period of around 3 months, we can presume that cases were normoglycemic at the time of blood sampling (16-20 weeks). However, we cannot completely rule out the possibility that some degree of glucose intolerance or early-onset GDM was already present in the early second trimester at the time of genetic amniocentesis in some cases, because we did not perform routine testing for GDM at the time of sampling.</p>
<p>In conclusion, using proteomic technology, we demonstrate for the first time that biomarkers exist in the maternal circulation in the early second trimester that predict the subsequent development of GDM several weeks before the diagnosis is confirmed, and that these include among others apo CIII and apo AII. Earlier prediction and diagnosis of GDM would allow for earlier intervention which has been shown to improve obstetric outcomes.</p>
