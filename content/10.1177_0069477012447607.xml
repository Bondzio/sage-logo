<title>Acute Kidney Failure</title>
<p>A retrospective review of electronic medical records for a 3-year period was performed to evaluate the adverse renal events associated with the administration of trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole in a middle-aged veteran population who had been receiving the drug for at least 6 days. Of the 573 patients who met the inclusion criteria, 11.2% (n = 64) demonstrated increases in both serum creatinine and blood urea nitrogen. Acute kidney injury was likely attributed to trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole in 5.8% of these cases (n = 33) and possibly in 4.9% (n = 28) of the cases. Three acute kidney injury cases were deemed unrelated to the drug. Five patients had elevations in serum creatinine but not blood urea nitrogen. Risk factors associated with developing acute kidney injury included diabetes mellitus, hypertension, chronic kidney disease, and osteomyelitis. Dose and duration of therapy beyond 10 days did not appear to be correlated with an increased risk of developing acute kidney injury. Acute kidney injury developed as early as the third day of therapy and as late as 2 days after completion of therapy. In the majority of patients with acute kidney injury who were followed-up 1 month later (n = 64), the majority (92.9%) had normal renal function. One patient required dialysis.</p>
<p>The authors concluded that acute kidney injury associated with trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole is more common than documented in previous reports and that the dose and duration of the drug is not related to developing this complication. In most cases, renal impairment is transient and resolved after drug discontinuation.</p>

<title>Fatal Acute Pulmonary Injury (First Report<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0069477012447607">*</xref>)</title>
<p>A 71-year-old male with a history of cardiac transplant presented with dyspnea on exertion, cough, and hemoptysis. Concurrent medications included alfacalcidol, furosemide, dihydralazine, esomeprazole, metoclopramide, pravastatin, methylprednisolone, mycophenolate mofetil, and everolimus. Dosages were not reported. Everolimus had been initiated 5 weeks prior in place of cyclosporine after the patient experienced a decline in renal function. Following this change, the patient developed a nonproductive cough and increasing dyspnea on exertion. Due to dyspnea, weight loss, and anorexia, the patient was tentatively diagnosed with acute heart failure. Chest auscultation revealed a third heart sound and bibasilar lung crepitations, and a chest x-ray showed bilateral patchy infiltrates. A cardiac ultrasound was significant for slight left ventricular hypertrophy, slightly decreased global systolic function with normal end-diastolic volumes, and grade 1 pulmonary and mitral valve regurgitation. Other abnormal laboratory parameters included decreased hemoglobin (10.1 g/dL), elevated serum lactate dehydrogenase (586 units/L), elevated serum creatinine (3.59 mg/dL), and elevated C-reactive protein (12.8 mg/dL). Everolimus levels at this time were within the therapeutic range (6.3 ng/mL; reference = 3-8 ng/mL). On hospital day 4, the patient developed excessive asthenia, anorexia, and dyspnea at rest, as well as hypoxemia and hemoptysis. A repeat chest x-ray showed diffuse patchy infiltrates, and cardiac ultrasound was significant for slight pulmonary arterial hypertension (systolic pressure 37 mm Hg). High-resolution computed tomography of the lungs showed bilateral ground-glass infiltrates in the upper lobes with centrilobular micronodules in the lower lobes. Due to the patient’s worsening clinical status, he was transferred to the intensive care unit, and shortly he thereafter required intubation and mechanical ventilation. Pulmonary artery catheterization was completed, revealing normal bilateral filling pressures and a cardiac index of 2.5 to 3 mL/kg/m<sup>2</sup>. Treatment was initiated with empiric moxifloxacin and high-dose trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole. Chest x-ray at this time showed bilateral alveolar consolidation, and pulmonary computed tomography revealed bilateral patchy to nodular alveolar infiltrates in the upper lobes and bilateral lower lobe consolidation. Laboratory examination of tracheal aspirates and blood cultures failed to show pathogens, as did other diagnostic workups. At the time of intensive care unit admission, everolimus levels were elevated (9.4 ng/mL), and a working diagnosis of drug-induced pulmonary toxicity was established. Everolimus was discontinued and high-dose methylprednisolone (120 mg daily) was initiated. Hemoptysis failed to improve, the patient developed oliguria, and later experienced an episode of massive hemoptysis and refractory hypoxemia that led to cardiac arrest and death. Autopsy showed diffuse and severe pulmonary congestion, with alveolar spaces containing hemosiderin-laden macrophages and numerous red blood cells interspersed with neutrophils and eosinophilic membranes on the walls of the alveolar septa.</p>
<p>The authors concluded that this patient likely experienced drug-induced pulmonary toxicity due to everolimus. Application of the Naranjo probability scale produced a “probable” association. Pulmonary toxicity is a known adverse effect of everolimus, although the exact mechanism is unknown. Potential etiologies may be a CD4+-mediated hypersensitivity reaction or direct dose-related toxicity. The authors recommend careful monitoring in an attempt to recognize toxicity before irreversible pulmonary damage may occur.</p>

<title>Local Cutaneous Necrosis</title>
<p>A 47-year-old female presented with a 2-day history of fever, rigors, headache, nausea, vomiting, and progressively worsening shortness of breath 27 days after receiving chemotherapy (carboplatin/paclitaxel) for ovarian cancer. Concurrent medications included dalteparin (5000 units subcutaneously daily), montelukast (10 mg daily), prednisone (25 mg daily), albuterol (100 µg 1 puff twice daily), ciclosenide (200 µg 2 puffs 4 times daily), salmeterol (50 µg 1 puff twice daily), omeprazole (20 mg twice daily), multivitamin (daily), mometasone (2 sprays each nostril twice daily), lorazepam (1 mg sublingually 3 times daily as needed), and domperidone (20 mg 4 times daily as needed). Vital signs at presentation included temperature 36.9°C, heart rate 136 beats/minute, blood pressure 82/40 mm Hg, and respiratory rate 18 breaths/minute. The patient was diagnosed with pneumonia based on chest x-ray and experienced a complicated initial hospital course requiring intubation and mechanical ventilation with propofol sedation (40-100 mg/h, titrated to effect), central venous access, normal saline (6 L total), intravenous meropenem (500 mg every 7 hours), and methylprednisolone (125 mg every 8 hours). Several hours after presentation, the patient’s temperature increased to 39.3°C and systolic blood pressure further decreased to 60 mm Hg. The patient was given intravenous norephinephrine and vasopressin and was transferred to the intensive care unit. The patient experienced ventricular fibrillation cardiac arrest 12 hours after intensive care unit transfer, which converted to normal sinus rhythm after an epinephrine bolus (1 mg) and chest compressions. She was also given calcium chloride (1 g), dextrose 50% in water (50 mL), and regular insulin (10 units) for hyperkalemia (5.4 mEq/L), as well as amiodarone (150 mg). Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation score was 26 at this time, and intravenous drotecogin alfa (1440 µg/h) was administered for 9 hours. Persistent hemodynamic instability in the setting of refractory septic shock was treated with methylene blue (1%, 10 mg intravenous push followed by a continuous infusion titrated to 0.5 mg/kg-h). Hemodynamic parameters improved; however, after 10 hours of the methylene blue infusion, a bluish discoloration surrounding the infusion site (peripheral venous catheter, left hand) was noted. The infusion was transferred to the patient’s right hand for an additional 6 hours before discontinuation. A large mottled blue patch then developed on the volar surface of the patient’s left forearm. Additionally, the patient’s left third and fourth fingertips appeared blackened. The decision was made to debride the forearm 7 days after extravasation and was repaired with skin grafting 2 weeks later. The patient continued to require hemodynamic support with norepinephrine, continuous renal replacement therapy, and transfusions of packed red blood cells and platelets. Tracheostomy was performed on hospital day 7 with ventilator support, which was weaned and discontinued on day 10. Antibiotics were continued for 6 days until cultures showed levofloxacin-sensitive <italic>Stenotrophomonas maltophilia</italic>, at which time the previous regimen was discontinued and intravenous levofloxacin (500 mg daily) was initiated. Methylprednisolone was weaned and oral prednisone was administered and tapered over 3 weeks. The patient slowly improved and was discharged home on hospital day 54.</p>
<p>The authors concluded that the patient experienced skin necrosis and digital ischemia after extravasation of methylene blue, with application of the Naranjo probability scale indicating a “probable” relationship. The vasomotor properties of this agent may have contributed to the reaction by inhibiting the nitric oxide–mediated cyclic guanosine monophosphate pathway, thus inhibiting smooth muscle relaxation and vasodilation. Methylene blue is easily oxidized to formaldehyde and other oxide radicals, potentially leading to direct injury. Furthermore, the 1% solution has a pH between 3 and 4.5, which likely contributes to direct cytotoxic potential. The authors recommend that prolonged infusions of methylene blue be administered through a central venous catheter when possible.</p>

<title>Neutropenia</title>
<p>A 73-year-old female with a past medical history of ulcerative colitis presented with abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting. Concurrent medications included pantoprazole (40 mg daily), azathioprine (200 mg daily), budesonide extended release (9 mg daily), and hydrocortisone enema (100 mg rectally daily). A computed tomography angiography scan of the abdomen and pelvis showed portal and superior mesenteric vein thrombosis with additional thrombi in the distal aortic and left common iliac arteries. The scan was also significant for grossly thickened small bowel loop and inflammatory bowel disease of the left hemicolon. The patient was treated with intravenous heparin and subsequently underwent thrombectomy and thrombolysis of the superior mesenteric vein thrombus with tissue plasminogen activator. The patient experienced rectal bleeding and a 2 g drop in hemoglobin concentration while receiving heparin, and a transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt procedure was performed to improve portal blood flow. Rifaximin (400 mg every 8 hours) was initiated for the prevention of hepatic encephalopathy after the transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt procedure. At the time of initiation, white blood cell count was 6800/µL; 4 days later, it had decreased to 1200/µL. Manual differential count revealed 49% neutrophils and 8% bands, for an absolute neutrophil count of 684. On the fifth treatment day, rifaximin was discontinued. The patient’s white blood cell count improved to 3300/µL 3 days later before increasing into the normal range. Although neutropenia resolved, the patient then developed thrombocytopenia (platelets 43 000/µL) on hospital day 9. This decrease was attributed to enoxaparin therapy, and heparin-induced thrombocytopenia was confirmed via serotonin-release assay on hospital day 13. The patient later underwent multiple abdominal surgeries secondary to hemorrhagic ulcerative colitis.</p>
<p>The authors concluded that this patient likely experienced neutropenia due to rifaximin initiation. Application of the Naranjo probability scale produced a score of 5, indicating a “probable” relationship. A mechanism for this reaction was not proposed; however, the authors recommend careful monitoring for the development of serious adverse drug events in patients receiving rifaximin.</p>

<title>Hard Palate Hyperpigmentation</title>
<p>A 60-year-old female patient developed a diffuse blue gray pigmentation on the hard palate during therapy with chloroquine diphosphate (4 mg/kg/d) for the management of rheumatoid arthritis. The duration of therapy and temporal relationship of the drug with the onset of the event was not specified. Though the patient had been an extensive smoker for 30 years, she had quit the habit approximately 9 years prior to the development of this event. The pigmented area measured approximately 3.0 × 4.0 cm. No other symptoms were reported and the area did not blanch under pressure. A biopsy revealed normal epithelium with an abundant presence of dark brown granular pigment scattered in the fibrocollagenous connective tissue. A Perl statin positively marked some of the particles as located both intracellularly and extracellularly. The final diagnosis was pigmentation related to drug therapy.</p>
<p>The authors concluded that this patient experienced pigmentation of the hard palate related to chloroquine. The authors suggested that this symptom may also warrant ocular examination as this is a frequently recognized side effect of chloroquine. The authors also noted that it is important to rule out melanoma in the event hyperpigmentation occurs in patients receiving chloroquine therapy.</p>

<title>Pancytopenia, Mucositis, and Hepatotoxicity</title>
<p>A 68-year-old male presented with shortness of breath, mouth and hand sores, nausea, and general malaise 4 days after receiving intralesional methotrexate (25 mg) for refractory squamous cell carcinoma of the hands. Concurrent medical conditions included epoetin alfa (24 000 units subcutaneously once weekly), paricalcitol (2 µg intravenously with dialysis), cinacalcet (30 mg once daily), sevelamer (3200 mg with meals and 1600 mg with snacks), pantoprazole (40 mg twice daily), extended-release nifedipine (90 mg daily), lisinopril (20 mg daily), formoterol (12 µg inhaled twice daily), clonidine (0.2 mg twice daily), and multivitamin (daily). He also received daily peritoneal dialysis. Vital signs at presentation included blood pressure 142/74 mm Hg, temperature 35.6°C, heart rate 84 beats/minute, respiratory rate 36 breaths/minute, and pain 7/10. Significant laboratory parameters included elevated alkaline phosphatase (219 IU/L; reference = 8-119 IU/L), alanine aminotransferase (456 IU/L; reference = 7-40 IU/L), and aspartate aminotransferase (653 IU/L; reference = 10-42 IU/L). White blood cell count and platelets were within normal limits. Treatment was initiated with vancomycin (1000 mg every 48 hours) due to concern for infection secondary to pustular hand lesions. He also received supportive care with a mouthwash containing magnesium hydroxide, aluminum hydroxide, diphenhydramine, nystatin, and viscous lidocaine, in addition to intravenous morphine sulfate (2 mg every 2 hours as needed), oral acetaminophen (650 mg every 6 hours as needed), and oral spray containing phenol (every 4-6 hours as needed). For empiric treatment of oral and esophageal candidiasis, he received oral clotrimazole (10 mg 4 times daily) and fluconazole (200 mg daily). Mucositis worsened in the 24 hours following admission, and on hospital day 3, white blood cell count had decreased to 1300 cells/µL. Other abnormal laboratory parameters at this time included decreased hemoglobin (12.4 g/dL; reference = 13-17.5 g/dL) and hematocrit (37%; reference = 39% to 52.5%). Body temperature also increased to 38.8°C. The patient was treated with subcutaneous filgrastim (480 µg) and intravenous cefepime (2 g every 48 hours). The patient was unable to eat or swallow foods and was started on parenteral nutrition on hospital day 3. The patient’s clinical status failed to improve, and he was given intravenous folic acid (1 mg every 6 hours) and leucovorin (20 mg every 6 hours) due to concern for methotrexate toxicity. White blood cell count and platelets continued to decrease, reaching a nadir of 600 cells/µL and 15 000 platelets/µL, respectively, on hospital day 6. Methotrexate concentration at this time was 0.03 µmol/L (potential toxicity when levels &gt;0.02 µmol/L 1-2 weeks after low-dose methotrexate therapy). Leucovorin dosage was increased to 200 mg every 6 hours on days 6 to 9, followed by 20 mg every 6 hours on day 10. Peritoneal dialysis sessions were also adjusted from alternating exchanges of 1.5% and 2.5% dextrose 5 times daily to 4-hour treatments of high-flux membrane hemodialysis to enhance methotrexate removal. Serum methotrexate decreased to &lt;0.01 µmol/L on hospital day 10. Other hematologic parameters gradually improved, and liver function tests normalized with the exception of alkaline phosphatase (403 IU/L). Dietary intake was slowly increased, and the patient was discharged to a rehabilitation facility on hospital day 14.</p>
<p>The authors concluded that this patient experienced severe adverse reactions after receiving intralesional methotrexate. Application of the Naranjo probability scale produced a score of 8, indicating a “probable” association. The severity of the reaction was likely due to prolonged elimination of methotrexate in the setting of chronic kidney disease. The authors note that as much as 50% of an intralesional dose of methotrexate may reach the systemic circulation.</p>

<sec id="section14-0069477012447607">
<title>Cutaneous Toxic Effects</title>
<p>Three cases of dermatologic adverse effects after vemurafenib treatment were reported.</p>
<p><italic>Patient 1</italic>. A 50-year-old male presented with cutaneous melanoma (Breslow thickness 2.3 mm) on the right lower back. Sentinel lymph node examination revealed 2 of 2 right inguinal sentinel lymph nodes positive for metastatic disease. Concurrent medications were not reported. The patient was treated with lymphadenectomy, high-dose interferon, and later dacarbazine monotherapy, which failed to produce desired clinical effects. Additional subcutaneous metastases developed and treatment was initiated with vemurafenib (960 mg by mouth twice daily). Within 1 week of treatment initiation, the patient experienced arthralgias of both hands and pruritic hyperkeratotic eruption resembling keratosis pilaris in addition to acneiform cysts on the face. The patient also developed painful hyperkeratotic papules and plaques on the soles of both feet. Clinical and radiologic improvement of metastases was noted during vemurafenib treatment; however, 2 months after initiation, the patient developed hyperkeratotic nodules on the right arm and nose, which were biopsied and diagnosed as squamous cell carcinoma.</p>
<p><italic>Patient 2</italic>. A 51-year-old female with a history of melanoma (Breslow thickness 0.8 mm) on the back experienced recurrent disease 6 years later. Concurrent medications were not reported. She was treated with interferon for 1 year but later developed metastatic disease on the left flank and in the bone. Treatment included radiotherapy, experimental drug therapies, and a 4-dose course of ipilimumab; however, her disease continued to progress. Treatment was initiated with oral vemurafenib (960 mg twice daily), with noted improvement in disease. Approximately 3 weeks after vemurafenib initiation, she developed hyperkeratotic, folliculary centered papules on the chest, abdomen, and upper and lower extremities. At 4-week follow-up, a pruritic erythematous patch had developed on the forehead, cheeks, and skin in a seborrheic distribution. Desonide cream (0.05% applied twice daily as needed) was prescribed with symptom improvement noted. The patient later developed callous-like thickening of the plantar skin overlying the fifth metatarsalphalangeal joints bilaterally in addition to a scaly red papule on the left distal medial thigh that was biopsied and diagnosed as invasive squamous cell carcinoma.</p>
<p><italic>Patient 3</italic>. A 79-year-old female was diagnosed with dermal metastatic melanoma on the left leg. Concurrent medications were not reported. Sentinel lymph node mapping revealed 1 of 3 inguinal lymph nodes containing metastatic melanoma. Approximately 6 months later, she developed small nodules on the left leg, with scan revealing multiple fluorodeoxyglucose–avid nodules with inguinal lymphadenopathy. The patient was treated with 3 cycles of granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor and a 4-dose treatment course of ipilimumab; however, repeat scans revealed bone metastases. She was then initiated on vemurafenib (960 mg twice daily). The patient was hospitalized with fatigue, nausea, and hypokalemia (2.4 mEq/L) 2 weeks after beginning treatment. The dose of vemurafenib was reduced at this time (720 mg twice daily). Scaly, indurated red papules on the arms, legs, and torso developed after approximately 1 month of treatment. Biopsies were performed on 6 lesions, revealing well-differentiated squamous cell carcinomas. After 2 months of therapy, the patient developed more lesions on the torso as well as keratoacanthoma-like lesions on both forearms, the nose, and the right dorsal hands. After 10 weeks of treatment, 17 well-differentiated squamous cell carcinomas were diagnosed in addition to hyperkeratotic actinic keratosis and 2 verrucae vulgaris. Vemurafenib was subsequently discontinued and the patient was treated with surgical excision of the squamous cell carcinomas in combination with Mohs surgery for the nose lesion.</p>
<p>The authors concluded that these patients experienced significant cutaneous reactions after vemurafenib treatment. The mechanism for these reactions is unknown, but may relate to the BRAF or RAS/mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways. The authors recommend further research into the role of the cellular pathways involved in these reactions to determine the exact mechanism of the reaction.</p>

<p>Three cases of metoprolol-related visual hallucinations are described.</p>
<p><italic>Patient 1</italic>. An 84-year-old female patient suffered from visual hallucinations for several years without any causative reason established despite various diagnostic evaluations. In addition, there were no significant neuropsychiatric findings on examination. Current medications included aspirin, a calcium channel blocker (not specified), an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (not specified), and metoprolol tartrate (50 mg twice daily). The duration of these medications was unknown but the patient had been taking metoprolol for at least 2 years for the treatment of hypertension. All the hypertensive medications were discontinued, with complete resolution of symptoms within several days of stopping metoprolol.</p>
<p><italic>Patient 2</italic>. A 62-year-old male patient began having visual hallucinations at night shortly after starting metoprolol tartrate (100 mg twice daily) during a hospitalization for a myocardial infarction. Other current medications included aspirin, isosorbide, and lisinopril (no dosages specified). The patient experienced the visual hallucinations approximately 18 months before disclosing the disturbing visions to his physician, which included seeing dead people at night. Once the metoprolol was discontinued, the hallucinations completely resolved within several days. However, the patient requested to be restarted on the medication shortly thereafter. The symptoms recurred but the patient did not find them frightening as he understood the origin.</p>
<p><italic>Patient 3</italic>. A 68-year-old female patient reported visual hallucinations shortly after starting metoprolol tartrate (100 mg daily) for the treatment of severe hypertension. Concurrent medications included aspirin, amlodipine, enalapril, escitalopram, and levothyroxine. These symptoms, which included seeing people at night and objects turning into animals, lasted for 2 years before the patient switched physicians. All diagnostic evaluations were negative and the symptoms resolved within 4 days after the metoprolol was discontinued.</p>
<p>The author concluded that these patients experienced visual hallucinations related to metoprolol administration. They noted that oftentimes the adverse event is not correlated with the drug therapy. Metoprolol has an intermediate degree of liphophilicity and thus has some degree of central nervous system penetration, which is potentially related to hallucinations as a side effect. The author also suggested that the reporting of visual hallucinations related to metoprolol is underestimated based on the lack of recognition with the drug administration and the event. As this agent is a widely used medication for hypertension, clinicians should be aware of this potentially disturbing adverse event.</p>

<title>Severe Coagulopathy</title>
<p>Two patients (aged 59 and 69 years) with primary sclerosing cholangitis received oral rifampicin (300 mg daily) for the treatment of refractory pruritus. Prior to the initiation of the drug, the prothrombin time was 12.7 and 13.8 seconds, respectively. Two to 3 weeks later, the prothrombin time was prolonged in both patients (114.7 and 99.6 seconds, respectively). The drug was withdrawn in both patients and intravenous vitamin K (10 mg) was administered. The prothrombin time normalized within 24 hours.</p>
<p>The authors concluded that these patients experienced significant prothrombin time changes and hypothrombinemia during rifampicin therapy.</p>

<title>Retinal Detachment</title>
<p>The possible association between the use of oral fluoroquinolones and retinal detachment was examined in a nested case–control study of a cohort of British Columbian patients who had visited their ophthalmologist between 2000 and 2007. Cases were defined as those patients who had received a procedure for retinal detachment and were matched to 10 controls by age and month and year of the cohort entry. All oral fluoroquinolone use in the year prior to the index date was identified. Ocular use of these agents was excluded. Fluoroquinolone use was classified as current, recent, or past. Current users were defined as those with a prescription termination date overlapping with the index date. A recent user was defined as a patient with a prescription ending date of 1 to 7 days prior to the index date. A past user was defined as a patient with a prescription termination date of 8 to 365 days prior to the index date. Therapeutic indications were searched for 14 days prior to the first fluoroquinolone being dispensed. In addition, the risk of retinal detachment was also examined with 2 other classes of medications that have not been associated with retinal detachment and included oral beta-lactam antibiotics and short-acting beta-agonists. Of 989 591 patients, 4384 cases of retinal detachment were identified and matched to 43 840 corresponding controls. The mean age of the groups was 61.1 and 61.1 years, respectively. Cases were more likely to be male (58.2% vs 43.5%) and more likely to have myopia (3.7% vs 3.1%), diabetes (15.4% vs 13.1%), or had received cataract surgery (46.2% vs 33.9%). Ciprofloxacin was the most common fluoroquinolone cited in the cases of retinal detachment (82.7%). Other fluoroquinolones were less frequently documented, including levofloxacin (7.2%), norfloxacin (4.9%), moxifloxacin (4%), and gatifloxacin (1.1%). The most common infections being treated in the cases included respiratory tract and genitourinary tract infections. Current use of fluoroquinolones carried a significantly higher risk of developing retinal detachment (adjusted relative risk = 4.50). For current users, the mean number of days from the first fluoroquinolone prescription to the first event of retinal detachment was 4.8 days. However, no risk was associated with recent users or past users (adjusted relative risk = 0.92 and 1.03, respectively). No risk of developing retinal detachment was also associated with the current use of beta-lactam antibiotics (adjusted relative risk = 0.74) or short-acting beta-agonists (adjusted relative risk = 0.95). The absolute increase in the risk of retinal detachment was 4 per 10 000 person-years.</p>
<p>The authors noted that this is the first study demonstrating that oral fluoroquinolones are possibly associated with retinal detachment. They stated that current users of oral fluoroquinolones were approximately 5 times more likely to develop retinal detachment than nonusers. However, they did also note that the absolute risk for the condition was small. They suggested that fluoroquinolones have been shown to interfere with collagen synthesis and disrupt the extracellular matrix outside of the retina, including the corneal matrix. They also proposed that because oral fluoroquinolones have a relatively high bioavailability and a high volume of distribution, they may have action in the vitreous and vitreous cortex. They noted that this study was intended to examine a class effect and not powered to examine an effect between drugs in the class. Finally, the authors suggested that future pharmacoepidemiological studies should be conducted to validate these data.</p>
