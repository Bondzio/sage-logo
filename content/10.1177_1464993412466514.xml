<p>A quarter of a millennium ago, Adam Smith said, ‘Little else is required to carry a state to the highest degree of opulence from the lowest barbarism, but peace, easy taxes, and a tolerable administration of justice; all the rest being brought about by the natural course of things’. Using the tools of modern political economics and combining economic theory with a bird’s-eye view of the data, the book <italic>Pillars of Prosperity: The Political Economics of Development Clusters</italic> reinterprets Smith’s pillars of prosperity to explain the existence of development clusters – places that tend to combine effective state institutions, the absence of political violence and high per capita incomes.</p>
<p>As history demonstrates vividly, state authority, tax systems, court systems and democracy co-evolve in a complex web of interdependent causality. Hence, an effective state is a state which invokes an authority that can tax, enforce contracts and organize public spending for a wide range of activities. Any failure in this web is likely to produce weakness and fragility in a state. The absence of common interests and/or cohesive political institutions can explain the existence of very different development clusters in fragile states that are plagued by poverty, violence and weak state capacity. Indeed, policy failure resulting from weak state institutions tends to be found in countries with massive poverty and violent internal conflict. Further, these failures and state weakness diminish the aims of achieving peace.</p>
<p>Though the authors stress the avoidance of repressive government and civil conflict in order to achieve peace, this is not what usually happens on the ground. For example, in their book, <italic>Competitive Authoritarianism: Hybrid Regimes after the Cold War</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1464993412466514">Levisky and Way (2010)</xref> say that competitive authoritarian regimes are civilian regimes in which formal democratic institutions exist and are widely viewed as the primary means of gaining power, but in which the incumbents’ abuse of the state places them at a significant advantage vis-à-vis their opponents. They are competitive in that opposition parties use democratic institutions to contest seriously for power, but they are not democratic, because the playing field is heavily skewed in favour of the incumbents, thus making competition real but unfair. Therefore, what distinguishes competitive authoritarian regimes from democratic ones is the fact that incumbents’ abuse of the state violates at least one of the three defining attributes of democracy: (a) free elections, (b) broad protection of civil liberties and (c) a reasonably level playing field.</p>
<p>On development assistance, the World Bank Policy Research Report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1464993412466514">1998</xref>) titled, <italic>Assessing Aid: What Works, What Doesn’t and Why</italic> argues that aid can be the midwife of good policies in a good policy environment and can be the midwife of good institutions where a good institutional environment exists. Hence, in countries with good management, aid spurs growth, reduces poverty and brings in high productivity private investment. But Dambisa <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1464993412466514">Moyo (2009)</xref> is firm on the stand that aid is not working in Africa and says that both her country, Zambia, and other countries in Africa continue to flounder in a seemingly never-ending cycle of corruption, disease, poverty and aid-dependence. She says that Africa’s development impasse demands a new level of consciousness, a greater degree of innovation and a generous dose of honesty about what works and what does not as far as development is concerned.</p>
<p>In this, the author of the book concurs in observing that receiving aid appears to be positively partially correlated with political violence. In the book <italic>Museveni’s Uganda: Paradoxes of Power in a Hybrid Regime</italic>, Aili Mari <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1464993412466514">Tripp (2010)</xref> observes an increase in what she calls a carrot and stick method: a carrot (goodies) is used for opponents that are co-opted through patronage, whilst a stick (repression) is used for opponents that are crushed by security forces. Appointments in government and the military in Museveni’s Uganda increasingly went to a narrower group of loyalists, which undermined the claim to a broad-based government. Power became more centralized within the National Resistance Movement (NRM) and by late 1990, the perception was growing among north-westerners that Museveni favoured his own people when it came to government appointments, State House scholarships, welfare programmes, presidential donations and appointments to key and strategic military and security offices. Although not legally banned, opposition leaders could not hold meetings, sponsor candidates for office, or raise funds – and therefore they were effectively banned.</p>
<p>The authors show that countries tend to enjoy all three pillars of prosperity when they have evolved cohesive political institutions that promote common interests, guaranteeing the provision of public goods. A case in point may be Botswana. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1464993412466514">Levisky and Way (2010)</xref> say that although the level playing field was highly uneven, it was one of the least repressive regimes examined in the book. Elections were generally free of vote-rigging, intimidation or violence.</p>
<p>Hence, lessons learnt from the book include: that predation and elite control do not invest in state capacity; and that common interests in society, as manifested in fiscal capacity, are used to provide public goods to the broad population, rather than to redistribute in favour of the incumbent groups. Furthermore, there is a complimentarity between the building of state capacity and cohesive political institutions. Overall, a tolerable administration of justice is about legal infrastructure that can support the enforcement of contracts and property rights in line with the rule of law. The authors show that countries tend to enjoy all three pillars of prosperity when they have evolved cohesive political institutions that promote common interests, guaranteeing the provision of public goods.</p>
