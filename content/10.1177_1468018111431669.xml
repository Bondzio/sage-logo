<p>Since the end of the Washington Consensus, the World Bank has advocated good governance reforms, the development of a social safety net, and participatory approaches to social policy decision-making. It has also embraced the pursuit of gender equality as a means to more inclusive economic development. While some analysts have perceived both these shifts in policy as a welcome move away from Washington Consensus neoliberalism, in <italic>Developing Partnerships</italic> Kate Bedford argues that these trends actually indicate a deeper, more intrusive neoliberalism, in which not only economic policies, but also human subjectivities, are reformulated. In the current period, therefore, neoliberalism is ‘a process of subject formation as well as an economic reform regime’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1468018111431669">Hale, 2006</xref>, quoted in Bedford, p.xiii). As part of its effort to ameliorate some of the effects of neoliberal globalization, without challenging its basic tenets, the World Bank is now concerned with restructuring domestic partnerships between men and women, so that women are able to do more productive work, and men, more caring work.</p>
<p>This is not to say that the World Bank’s perspective on gender has not changed from the structural adjustment period of the 1980s, when women bore the burden of adjustment through increased paid and unpaid labour. The Bank is now very much aware of the social reproduction dilemma: that if women’s entry into the paid workforce is not accompanied by a decrease in the amount of unpaid labour in the home, women’s equality cannot be achieved. But its understanding of this dilemma, according to Bedford, is underpinned by heteronormative assumptions: that the heterosexual couple is ‘universal and morally righteous’ (p.xx) and that sex differences are biologically determined. The Bank has also interpreted the means of dealing with the problem in terms that are amenable to neoliberal economic policies. For example, relieving women from the burdens of social reproduction labour, therefore, means men taking up the slack in the home, rather than supporting women’s entry into the workforce through state-sponsored child-care. The Bank also assumes that productive labour is always liberating for women; Bedford asks us to consider whether this is necessarily the case.</p>
<p>To develop her argument about the centrality of gender and sexuality to post-Washington Consensus forms of neoliberalism, Bedford uses a multi-method and multi-scalar approach, which allows her to make a rich, nuanced and complex case. Focusing on Latin America, which was the origin of both Washington Consensus policies and feminist resistance to them, she traces the formation of Bank policy from Washington and regional offices, to its implementation at the national and local level. Her sources include policy documents and loan agreements, as well as fieldwork and interviews with project managers in Ecuador and Argentina.</p>
<p>The chapters follow the Bank’s practices from the global to the regional and local scale. The first two chapters examine the production of knowledge in World Bank policy documents, and how men have been made visible through these texts. In line with its post-Washington Consensus recognition of the social consequences of economic crisis, in the mid-1990s the Bank turned its attention to the impact of economic recession on gender relations and family breakdown. The organization acknowledged that it had neglected not only the dual burden of production and social reproduction on women, but also the harm done to men’s masculinity by the loss of the male-breadwinner family model. When men are unemployed, or otherwise unable to take care of their families, their masculinity is wounded, and their behaviour becomes destructive to themselves, and to the women and children in their lives. Rather than addressing the policies that have caused this situation, in the Bank’s view it is men’s behaviour that must be adjusted to new economic and social realities. Bedford does not deny that male violence and irresponsibility may be a problem for women in developing countries: she points out, however, that this portrayal of gender relations has been dependent on particular knowledge practices; that it serves to further a market liberalization agenda; and that it is poor, racialized men, rather than men in general, who are perceived to be in need of rehabilitation. Bedford’s attention to knowledge production practices is particularly interesting: she argues that while much of the research utilized by the Bank is complex and nuanced, the nuance is filtered out in the process of turning research findings into policy documents. In the case of violence against women, for example, there are contradictory findings about the relationship been poverty and violence, and women’s workforce participation and their subjection to domestic abuse. Bedford has carefully examined citation practices and background papers to discover the complexity of the underlying story, which she contrasts with the simplicity of the final version.</p>
<p>The remaining chapters follow Bank policies on the ground in Ecuador and, in the final chapter, Argentina. This empirical focus allows the author to acknowledge the conflicts and contradictions that arise when both ‘gender equity’ and ‘male inclusion’ policies are implemented simultaneously. In Ecuador, ‘institutional pressure to define gender policy through a complementary focus on couples provoked conflict with feminist partner organizations and intensified concern with poor men’s irresponsibility, alcoholism, and violence’ (p.65). The Bank’s emphasis on men’s responsibility for work in the home also sidelined possibilities for the introduction of childcare, which was also the case in the Ecuadorian flower industry, although there were openings for policy advocacy on this issue. Women’s participation in the flower industry, in Bank representations, increased both women’s erotic autonomy and harmony in the home; a study showing a slight increase in men’s domestic labour meant that complementary heterosexual partnerships, rather than childcare provision, were advocated as an answer to the social reproduction dilemma.</p>
<p>The Argentinian case is another example in which complex feminist politics have become simplified over time. A loan for ‘social capital promotion and family strengthening’ (p.161) – Profam – financed a wide range of projects, and the 2001 financial crisis opened up possibilities to contest the meaning of the term ‘family strengthening’, with feminists and sexual minorities, as well as Peronist groups nostalgic for the days of the male-breadwinner family, obtaining funding. Pro-choice groups used Profam money to run reproductive health seminars; others helped women leave abusive relationships (p.175). Over time, however, calls for a return to the conventional forms of the family were enforced, organizations without gender expertise were financed, and community kitchens closed in an effort to restore family dinner times. Profam became more aligned with goals shared by the Catholic Church, and funding more directed towards micro-enterprise rather than interventions in reproductive health, domestic violence or women’s capacity building (p.186).</p>
<p><italic>Developing Partnerships</italic> is a thoroughly researched and carefully argued work. The one place where I would have liked to see more development of the argument was in Chapter 3, where Bedford notes how the Ecuadorian Bank staff’s research was sidelined by officials from Washington because it was ‘not well packaged’ (p.79); I would like to have known what the Ecuadorians’ research entailed, and in what respects its findings differed from the World Bank’s prescriptions. But this is a minor point about a book that breaks new methodological, theoretical and empirical ground, and bravely engages in a critique of gender policies that, on the face of it, seem innocuous, if not laudable, but that play an important role in sustaining a neoliberal economic order.</p>
