<abstract>
<p>Jackson and Scheel aptly elucidate the relevance of master’s level counselor training programs for counseling psychology doctoral training programs, highlighting key antecedents of the current <italic>critical period</italic> in our relationship. Counseling psychology has an essential role in the professional lineage of counseling master’s programs. Master’s training programs have been essential in generating the revenue necessary to sustain doctoral training in counseling psychology at many if not most of our institutions. This commentary suggests that it is imperative for counseling psychology to first acknowledge the professional abdication of our master’s programs—and then fight to remedy the situation through reconciliation, and recognition of the unique professional contributions and identity of master’s level counselors. The remedy requires aggressive action and legislative advocacy on behalf of our master’s programs. A case study in effective legislative advocacy follows, providing suggestions for actions that may serve to ensure our viability.</p>

<body>
<p>The simple response to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0011000012473164">Jackson and Scheel’s (2013)</xref> query whether the current state of master’s training and education presents a concern for counseling psychology is <italic>yes</italic>. Their article presents the issue of master’s training in counseling psychology as a necessary concern for doctoral training and specialty practice in counseling psychology. The authors provide a historical as well as contemporary context that is familiar to those of us who are immersed in the implications of this situation. I am not confident, however, that a new training director, university administrator, legislator, or our students would be able to fully discern the urgency inherent in this dilemma, or implement the recommendations. I hope to validate that the issue of master’s training in counseling psychology is an <italic>urgent</italic> concern, one that presents as a clear and present danger to the viability of counseling psychology doctoral degree programs. There are possible means of averting this impending professional disaster, but the solutions require a skill set that is not well articulated in our core competencies—such as decisive, efficient coalition building, strategic, political action, engagement in legislative processes, and allocation of financial resources—to name a few. I respectfully offer the following comments, corrections, and insights gleaned from our experience with this matter in New Jersey, and specifically in our program at Seton Hall University.</p>
<sec id="section1-0011000012473164">
<title>The Model</title>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0011000012473164">Jackson and Scheel (2013)</xref> present the situation of master’s training in counseling psychology as a hypothesis, more specifically, as a null hypothesis. I would suggest that prior to stating the hypothesis, we need to further address the historical context of this situation as well as the current implications for counseling psychology doctoral training programs. In addition, selecting the appropriate method of investigation for research <italic>or</italic> the most efficacious intervention design absolutely requires <italic>both</italic> conceptual and operational definition of terms (behavior, factors, variables). Subsequently, a review of other relevant sciences and systems may yield models of investigation as well as solutions that will save some time, such as social work, and marriage and family therapy. Let me say this once again, this situation is an <italic>urgent</italic> one, and renders our standard problem-solving approaches to large-scale issues—forming task forces, special interest groups, designation of committees—insular, redundant, and typically impotent. It is questionable in my mind whether we will be able to avert eventual professional annihilation. I have unwavering certainty of the unique value of the discipline of counseling psychology to the science of human behavior as well as to the overall benefit of society. I am equally certain that the demise of counseling psychology master’s level education would not be in the best interest of individuals, the science of psychology, the field of mental health, or society at large. However, I am not at all certain that we possess the collective attitude, fortitude, political savvy, and skill set that is required to set forth and sustain the actions necessary to ensure the longevity of our discipline. I will return to this challenge later in this response, as I want to address some of the key features of master’s training in counseling psychology that have led to the development of the current disastrous state of affairs.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-0011000012473164">
<title>The Problem: Antecedents, Context, and Professional Abdication of Responsibility</title>
<p>Problem-solving models typically involve discrete steps and procedures—define the problem; identify the antecedents; identify the desired outcome or behavior; teach, model, and/or shape the target behaviors; extinguish/punish the problematic behaviors; anticipate and modify the antecedents; and reinforce the target behavior. I wish it were so simple! This is a dynamic, systemic, multidimensional process that renders our standard linear problem-solving approaches grossly inadequate. However, it is still imperative to begin by stating the problem—The quality of master’s level education and training is an area of concern for doctoral training and practice in the specialty of counseling psychology. Arguably, it is more authentic and transparent to state that master’s level education and training represents an area of grave concern for doctoral training and practice in the specialty of counseling psychology, and the quality of that training represents one of several aspects of the larger problem.</p>
<p>The statement of the problem is best understood in the context of relevant background (antecedents) and elaboration of significance or impact. The historical context of this issue is the structural relationship between master’s and doctoral-level training programs in counseling psychology. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0011000012473164">Jackson and Scheel’s (2013)</xref> article indicates that most counseling psychology doctoral training programs are associated with and often funded through larger master’s counseling programs. In some universities, the counseling psychology doctoral training program was established before the master’s training program; in others, the master’s program preceded the doctoral program; and yet, in others, the programs may have been established simultaneously. The establishment of many to most of the existing master’s training and education programs preceded the licensed professional counselor movement by decades. In fact, eventual licensure of professional counselors was not only predictable but also professionally responsible.</p>
<p>There are a number of additional contextual factors I think important to reference as some help explain the acrimony and resistance often associated with attempts to remedy some of the current concerns within the larger organizational and systemic arenas. One factor is that in <italic>some</italic> situations, the master’s training programs were developed either strategically or surreptitiously to help fund the doctoral training programs. In addition, whereas the master’s training programs contribute much more substantially to the fiscal health of the university, it is the doctoral training programs that contribute more to the prestige and rankings of the institution.</p>
<p>It is important to acknowledge that many of our master’s training programs are populated by applicants diverted from the doctoral program applicant pool. In addition, many more students enter the master’s programs with aspirations of advancing into the doctoral training programs that could ever be actually accommodated. These are just a few of the many factors that contribute to the institutional hierarchies that form within departments. I would venture that this process results in contrived, intellectual hierarchies that are hurtful and divisive. It could be argued that as a profession, we overpopulated to <italic>feed and sustain</italic> our doctoral programs with limited sense of responsibility to this burgeoning group of unregulated yet presumably authenticated group of graduate-level mental health professionals.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0011000012473164">
<title>The Lack of a Common Taxonomy</title>
<p>Psychologists have a propensity for articulating—naming, defining, and issuing guidelines, regulations, and procedures—every nuanced aspect of our experience, education, training, and practice. We are exceptionally protective about the term <italic>psychologist</italic>; in fact, with the benchmark competencies, we can almost place a gestational metric on the developmental process of <italic>becoming</italic> a psychologist! We are also explicitly clear about who is <italic>not</italic> a psychologist. So how have we failed so miserably in articulating the relationship between our master’s and doctoral training programs? We have missed an opportunity to responsibly delineate a defensible scope of practice that would distinguish the value added of the doctoral training process in counseling psychology from a 45-to-60 credit graduate degree in mental health counseling. Again, we articulate the body of knowledge, clinical skills, attitudes, and experiences required to become a psychologist. Don’t take my word for it—just read the Commission on Accreditation Guidelines and Principles. If you need more direction, then you can consult the implementing regulations. However, at this time, we have <italic>no</italic> mechanisms for authenticating the training of master’s level counselors (or psychologists) within the American Psychological Association (APA) accreditation structure. As aptly reviewed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0011000012473164">Jackson and Scheel (2013)</xref>, the recognition of the master’s degree in psychology has been contentiously debated within the various APA structures for years, and was only recently reacknowledged by the <italic>Board of Educational Affairs in 2010</italic>.</p>
<p>Thus, a significant aspect of the context of the concern regarding master’s education and training is one of relationship. The doctoral programs have been more than complicit in perpetuating the practices that have resulted in our current state of affairs. We not only missed the opportunity to delineate scope of practice, but we also offered little to no assistance in shaping a unique sense of professional identity for our master’s students. More fundamentally, we cannot even agree on the appropriate professional title.</p>
<p><italic>Psychologist</italic> is a protected term. Recognizing graduates from our master’s programs that are associated with our counseling psychology doctoral training programs presented a dilemma: “What were we to call them?”—masters in counseling psychology graduate (but do not call yourself a psychologist, because you are not one)? mental health counselor? counselor? professional counselor? As a field, we were graduating a few hundred counseling psychologists every year—and a few thousand master’s level counselors! As this group of graduate-level professionals grew in numbers, they became a viable constituency who set claim to their own unique professional identity. This group has been told in no uncertain terms what they are not—They are not psychologists! We have done a poor job with assisting with acknowledging who they <italic>are</italic>. Not that the group as a whole has fared much better on their own—<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0011000012473164">Kaplan (2012)</xref> identified 45 various professional titles for professional counselors in licensure regulations currently in place across the United States.</p>
<p>We have not as a profession actively engaged in a process of workforce analysis, employment forecasting, or cost containment although we have mechanisms in place through the APA Center for Workforce Analysis. As a profession, we are experiencing <italic>THE RECKONING.</italic></p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0011000012473164">
<title>The Crisis of Meaning/Identity</title>
<p>The emergence of licensing processes for graduate-level professional counselors began officially in 1975 in Virginia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0011000012473164">Pope, 2012</xref>). Currently, all 50 states, Puerto Rico, and D.C. license professional counselors. According to the American Counseling Association website, there are currently more than 120,000 licensed professional counselors in the United States. By comparison, there are approximately 93,000 licensed psychologists in the United States, with an average of 2,700 licensed psychologists entering health service provider fields annually. This growing profession responded to the zeitgeist of accountability with the establishment of accreditation guidelines specific to <italic>counselor education</italic> in 1981 when the American Counseling Association established the Council for Accreditation of Counseling and Related Educational Programs (CACREP). Currently, CACREP reports accrediting more than 600 graduate counseling programs in more than 200 institutions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0011000012473164">Ritchie &amp; Bobbie, 2011</xref>). The current state of alarm, however, was precipitated primarily by two concurrent factors—the 2009 CACREP guidelines specific to the definition of core faculty and CACREP’s systematic attempts to have states require counseling master’s programs to be CACREP accredited as a prerequisite for licensure of their graduates. There has been a flurry of backroom lobbying efforts at the state level for the promulgation of regulatory changes that substantially threaten the viability of counseling psychology doctoral programs specifically, and potentially the long-term survival of smaller graduate departments and colleges. Our experience in New Jersey across the past 3 years exemplifies the primary aspects of these convergent agendas that present potentially lethal threats to counseling psychology doctoral training programs—as well as a course of action that has been successful thus far in averting this professional parricide.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0011000012473164">
<title>The Situation in New Jersey</title>
<p>The Professional Counselor Examiners Committee, operating under the authority of the New Jersey State Board of Marriage and Family Therapy Examiners, is the entity responsible for the licensing of professional counselors. This Committee proposed regulation changes in May 2009 requiring that by October 5, 2012, licensee applicants had to graduate from a CACREP-accredited training program. There were a number of changes in the regulations that were problematic, but the mandate that programs had to be CACREP accredited for our graduates to obtain licensure would effectively force the closing of one or more programs in New Jersey. There was not sufficient time or resources for our program at Seton Hall University (SHU) as well as four other graduate counseling programs in New Jersey to meet this mandate.</p>
<p>One may question how we let such devastating regulatory changes occur without protest. Although these proposed regulation changes were published in the New Jersey Register in May 2009, they were not widely publicized, and the mandated period for public comment went unnoticed by all of the graduate counseling programs. It is important to note that the regulation changes were noticed by the legislative advocacy officer of the local state psychological association, but were deemed to be irrelevant to psychologists! That is a conversation for another time. SHU faculty vigilantly monitored Committee processes, including the review of minutes and attending meetings, and we received notification of all other processes and directions pertaining to our program. It is important to understand as part of the context in New Jersey, the Committee had been in the process of moving from reviewing and approving individual licensee applications to one in which area programs preapproved. At face value, this sounds judicious and efficient. <italic>However</italic>, the Committee would not provide programs with the <italic>criteria</italic> to be used for the approval process, nor would they disclose the qualifications of the <italic>consultants</italic> selected by the Committee to conduct the program review. The Committee did inform us that the consultant determination was <italic>privileged communication</italic> but would not provide programs with any means of due process, schedule for program reviews, or procedures for corrective actions should a program receive an unfavorable review. The licensing process for counselors had become a high stakes game, and the rules of the game were a moving target—stressful, but it gets better. Map onto this quagmire the announcement of the regulatory changes that now mandated CACREP accreditation for programs by October 5, 2012, for graduates to be eligible for licensure in New Jersey.</p>
<p>We became aware of the <italic>approved</italic> regulations in September 2009. We had 24 months to achieve accreditation—or close shop. The 2009 CACREP requirement that core faculty members had to be counselor educators and would no longer recognize counseling psychologists as appropriate faculty was ideologically and professionally indefensible. The faculty criteria—for full time equivalent (FTE) requirements as well as specific degree requirements—were financially prohibitive for SHU as well as several other counseling programs in New Jersey. The timeline to bring programs into compliance was also unachievable.</p>
<p>So what happened? OK, remember this is New Jersey. I know this guy. Actually two guys, John Torok and James Wulach, JD, PhD. I worked with key faculty members at SHU—Margaret Brady Amoon and Margaret Farrelly, to organize a meeting with the other counseling graduate programs in New Jersey to assess individual and collective impact, as well as to mobilize a response. We brought in John Torok, a seasoned governmental consultant who has worked with the New Jersey Psychological Association for the past 25 years, and James Wulach, PhD, JD, who advised our newly assembled New Jersey Professional Counseling Coalition on the necessary course of action. The combined expertise and experience of these <italic>guys</italic>, along with the righteous indignation of the Coalition members, fueled by a sense of responsibility to our students and alumni and supported financially by our collective academic institutions set forth a relentless advance on the Committee and regulatory processes to correct this situation.</p>
<p>What has been achieved? We did get the regulations reversed! Legislative action was initiated within the New Jersey State Senate for the Licensing Board to either amend or withdraw the regulation. The Committee of the New Jersey Licensing Board unanimously voted on December 5, 2011, to adopt regulatory language that reversed their earlier decision and now permits graduates from non-CACREP-accredited programs to qualify for licensure as long as they meet the current curricular requirements. As far as I know at the time of this writing, there is no other regulatory board in the United States that requires professional counselor licensing applicants to have graduated from CACREP-accredited institutions. Rather, most regulations state that the training programs must either be accredited by CACREP or <italic>equivalent</italic>.</p>

<title>Legitimizing the Master’s Degree in Counseling Psychology—Or Reclaiming Our Own!</title>
<p>While I am concerned about our ability as a discipline to marshal the resources, vim, and vigor for the fight ahead, I am certain that it is a fight worth fighting. I am equally certain that the ultimate goal of reclaiming our master’s graduates and subsequently situating the master’s program within a defensible scope of practice and training paradigm <italic>is</italic> achievable and <italic>imperative</italic> to the long-term viability of the doctoral training program. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0011000012473164">Jackson and Scheel (2013)</xref> identified three important processes that may prove to be essential to the process of reclaiming and re-locating the master’s training programs.</p>
<p>First, their review of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0011000012473164">Korman’s (1974)</xref> concept of the career lattice highlights a viable conceptual model that should be revisited as it provides a way of articulating the means of differentiating the unique value and competencies of each level of professional development. I also applaud the work that has been initiated toward establishing benchmark competencies for master’s training (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0011000012473164">Fouad et al., 2009</xref>). Finally, Masters in Counseling Accreditation Committee (MCAC) represents a viable alternative accreditation for our master’s training programs, as the curriculum and supervised experience standards are rigorous and equivalent with existing CACREP standards across fundamental standards.</p>
<p>However, there is not a lot of time for deliberation. I would recommend the following interim steps:<list id="list1-0011000012473164" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>Realign the masters in counseling programs as a terminal masters within our counseling psychology doctoral training programs.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Propose interim accreditation structures <italic>within</italic> the existing CoA structures for accreditation of our master’s training programs. To relegate accreditation of our master’s training programs to <italic>any</italic> other accrediting body perpetuates the disenfranchisement of these students. This compartmentalization further legitimizes their need for a distinct professional identity complete with core faculty, curriculum, professional associations, and regulatory processes that are affirming of theses artificial distinctions.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>If we are to have the luxury to pursue either of these two avenues of discourse, we need to implement the type of watchdog, legislative action process that has been successful in New Jersey in every state. If CACREP gets a toehold in even one state, there will be a domino effect—and we will lose this fight!</p></list-item>
