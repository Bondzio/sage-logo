<p><bold>Objective:</bold> To compare the effectiveness of electromyographic biofeedback training and electrical stimulation therapy for rehabilitation following arthroscopic partial meniscectomy.</p>
<p><bold>Design:</bold> Randomized, prospective, controlled single-blind trial.</p>
<p><bold>Setting:</bold> Department of physical medicine and rehabilitation, university hospital.</p>
<p><bold>Subjects:</bold> Forty-five patients who had undergone surgery for arthroscopic partial meniscectomy were randomly divided into three groups with 15 patients in each group.</p>
<p><bold>Interventions:</bold> The control group had home exercise, the second and third groups received electromyographic biofeedback training or electrical stimulation therapy to quadriceps muscle in addition to home exercise.</p>
<p><bold>Main measures:</bold> The patients were evaluated for: visual analogue scale, gait velocity (m/s), time using a walking aid after surgery, Lysholm Knee Scoring Scale score, knee flexion–extension angle, maximum and average contraction powers of vastus medialis obliquus and vastus lateralis muscles on the day before the operation and two and six weeks after.</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> The time using a walking aid was 8.3 ± 8.0, 1.5 ± 2.5 and 4.5 ± 5.5 days, respectively, for the home exercise, electromyographic biofeedback training and electrical stimulation groups, and significantly shorter in the electromyographic biofeedback training than in the home exercise group (<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.017). While significant progress was detected in Lysholm Knee Scoring Scale score in the second and sixth postoperative weeks compared to the preoperative within-group evaluation for each of the three groups (<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.017), there was significant difference in Lysholm Knee Scoring Scale in the second postoperative week in favour of electromyographic biofeedback training compared to home exercise (<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.017). There were significant differences in vastus medialis obliquus average and vastus lateralis maximum and average contractions in favour of electromyographic biofeedback compared to home exercise and electrical stimulation in the second postoperative week (<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.017).</p>
<p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> The addition of electromyographic biofeedback training to a conventional exercise programme following arthroscopic partial meniscectomy helps to speed up the rehabilitation process.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The most common surgery technique for meniscal lesions, which are injuries frequently encountered in sports and daily life, is arthroscopic partial meniscectomy.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0269215511419382">1</xref></sup> After knee surgery, rapid atrophy and weakness develop in the quadriceps muscle, which is responsible for the extensor mechanism of the knee, as a result of reflex inhibition of motor neurons and immobilization. Quadriceps femoris muscle power and knee-related quality of life have been shown to decrease after arthroscopic partial meniscectomy.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0269215511419382">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0269215511419382">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>Although it is a widely applied surgery, discussion about the rehabilitation programme to be applied following partial meniscectomy continues, and it was reported that there is need for further randomized trials.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0269215511419382">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0269215511419382">7</xref></sup> While some studies suggest the need for observed physical therapy for optimal results,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0269215511419382">8</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0269215511419382">11</xref></sup> others argue that home exercise programmes are as effective as observed physical therapy.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0269215511419382">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0269215511419382">13</xref></sup> However, the studies that examine the same rehabilitation programme as home programme or observed physical therapy compare the compliance of the patients rather than investigating the most effective treatment modality.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0269215511419382">14</xref></sup></p>
<p>It was determined that joint range-of-motion exercises started soon after surgery play a key role in recovery after orthopaedic surgery.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0269215511419382">4</xref></sup> Although the importance of early active joint range-of-motion exercises in order to achieve good results post arthroscopic partial meniscectomy rehabilitation was emphasized,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0269215511419382">4</xref></sup> there are limited number of evidence-based studies which compare the efficacy of physiotherapy modalities for increasing quadriceps muscle power in these patients.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0269215511419382">15</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0269215511419382">18</xref></sup></p>
<p>Electromyographic biofeedback, one of the physical therapy techniques for increasing the strength of the quadriceps muscle, is a method which allows retraining of the muscle by creating new feedback systems as a result of the conversion of myoelectrical signals in the muscle into visual and auditory signals.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0269215511419382">19</xref></sup> Electrical stimulation increases muscle power by stimulating muscle fibres and muscle contraction.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0269215511419382">20</xref></sup> While during electromyographic biofeedback the patient has to do voluntary muscle contractions, in electrical stimulation the muscle contraction is provided by electrical stimulation of the fibres without the voluntary contraction done by the patient. Studies comparing the efficacy of electromyographic biofeedback and electrical stimulation treatments following anterior cruciate ligament surgery are available in the literature.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0269215511419382">20</xref></sup> Although electromyographic biofeedback<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0269215511419382">15</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0269215511419382">17</xref></sup> or electrical stimulation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0269215511419382">18</xref></sup> practices versus an exercise programme for rehabilitation following arthroscopic partial meniscectomy were compared, the effectiveness of electromyographic biofeedback had not been compared with that of electrical stimulation.</p>
<p>The objective of this study was to compare the effects of electromyographic biofeedback with electrical stimulation therapy in addition to conventional home exercise programme on muscle power and functional status following arthroscopic partial meniscectomy.</p>

<title>Methods</title>
<p>Patients who were to undergo electively arthroscopic partial meniscectomy surgery were included in the study. The presence of neurological disease that affects the lower extremities, having undergone surgery on the same knee within the last six months, application of extra surgical procedures except for arthroscopic partial meniscectomy (e.g. repair of anterior cruciate ligament), fracture experienced in the operated knee, the presence of a deformity which develops in association with conditions such as inflammatory arthropathy, and use of cardiac pacemaker, severe arrhythmia or epilepsy which prevents electrical stimulation were determined as criteria for exclusion from the study.</p>
<p>Forty-nine patients were initially evaluated in the study. Two of them were excluded from the study since they did not come to surgery, and the other two were excluded since they received surgery other than meniscectomy at the time of operation, hence the study was continued with 45 patients (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0269215511419382">Figure 1</xref>).</p>

<p>Approval was obtained from Pamukkale University Medical School Ethics Committee. Before the study, the patients were given information about the study and their informed consent was obtained.</p>
<p>The study was planned as a prospective, randomized, single-blind, clinical study. The assessor physician was blinded, but the patients and the physician who applied the therapy were not. A balanced randomization was performed by selection of a sealed envelope from opaque envelopes including the group assignment numbers which were produced by a computer random number generator.</p>
<p>Demographic data: age (years), gender, height (m), weight (kg), body mass index (kg/m<sup>2</sup>), educational status, occupation, period of knee pain (months), history of knee trauma (yes/no), side which has received arthroscopic partial meniscectomy and dominant side were asked about.</p>
<p>The meniscus rupture phases of the patients were recorded as 1, 2, 3 or 4 according to knee magnetic resonance imaging, which was carried out in our hospital before the surgery.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0269215511419382">21</xref></sup></p>
<p>Since osteoarthritis may affect the severity of symptoms and examination findings of the patients, in order to determine the presence and stage of osteoarthritis in the knee which received arthroscopic partial meniscectomy, the stages of medial, lateral tibiofemoral and patellofemoral joint osteoarthritis were determined as 1, 2, 3, 4 according to the Outerbridge classification<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0269215511419382">22</xref></sup> by an orthopaedist at the time of surgery. Meniscectomy type applied at the arthroscopy and meniscectomy region were recorded.</p>
<p>The patients included in the study were randomly divided into three groups: first group (<italic>N</italic> = 15) received home exercise programme (home exercise group), second group (<italic>N</italic> = 15) received electromyographic biofeedback training to quadriceps muscle in addition to home exercise programme (electromyographic biofeedback group), third group (<italic>N</italic> = 15) received electrical stimulation to quadriceps muscle in addition to home exercise programme (electrical stimulation group).</p>
<p>An illustrated exercise booklet describing the exercises the patients do for a period of one month as from the day of surgery were given to all patients as the home exercise programme and exercises were taught to the patients. The first phase (days 1–7) of the applied exercise protocol comprised ice application, elevation, application of mild compression bandage on the knee and quadriceps setting, hamstring stretching, straight leg rising and ankle pumping exercises; second phase (days 7–14) comprised hip abduction–adduction, knee flexion–extension, gastrocnemius and quadriceps muscles stretching exercises in addition to the foregoing; third phase (weeks two to four) comprised closed kinetic chain exercises and side-stepping exercises in addition to the above; fourth phase (following the fourth week) comprised progressive resistive exercises to the muscles surrounding the knee as a follow-up and in addition to the previous exercises.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0269215511419382">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0269215511419382">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0269215511419382">23</xref></sup> The patients were asked to determine the period of using crutches according to the level of their pain.</p>
<p>In addition to home exercise programme, the electromyographic biofeedback group received daily electromyographic biofeedback training for isometric contraction of quadriceps muscle with a Myomed 932 (Enraf-Nonius, The Netherlands) device for 5 days a week and two weeks in total as from the first postoperative day. While the patient sits on the stretcher with his or her legs stretched, the surface electrodes of the device were placed on the operated leg in the following manner: two active electrodes of its first channel were placed 4 cm above and 3 cm medial to the upper end of the patella for vastus medialis obliquus muscle, active electrodes of its second channel were placed 10 cm above and 6–8 cm lateral to the upper edge of the patella for vastus lateralis muscle, earth electrode was placed 2–3 cm below the patella on the same side.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0269215511419382">15</xref></sup> Quadriceps muscle isometric contraction threshold value was established on the first postoperative day. The patients were asked to do isometric quadriceps contraction with time of contraction over a specified threshold value being 10 seconds, time of rest being 20 seconds and total time of work being 20 minutes. Visual feedback was provided to the patients by watching contraction in the monitor and audio feedback was provided by adjusting the signal so that it can be heard when threshold value is exceeded. By increasing the threshold value every day, the patients had to contract their quadriceps muscle more strongly.</p>
<p>In addition to the home exercise programme, the electrical stimulation group received daily electrical stimulation therapy for quadriceps muscle with an Endomed 582 device for 5 days a week and two weeks in total from the first postoperative day. With two active electrodes of one channel of the device on vastus medialis obliquus muscle and active electrodes of the other channel on vastus lateralis muscle, they were placed on both ends of the muscle according to bipolar electrode placement technique. Isometric contraction of the quadriceps muscle was provided by applying electrical stimulation with intermittent alternative current to vastus medialis obliquus and vastus lateralis muscles for 23 minutes in accordance with the Russian stimulation protocol in the device.</p>
<p>All patients were evaluated three times: preoperatively, in the second postoperative week and in the sixth postoperative week by a physician unaware of the treatment modality.</p>

<title>Statistical analysis</title>
<p>Statistical Package for Social Sciences for Windows 17.0 programme (SPSS 17.0, SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) was used in the statistical evaluation of the data. During the investigation of whether there is any difference between the groups in terms of socio-demographic data before therapy, Kruskal–Wallis test and Mann–Whitney <italic>U</italic>-test (with Bonferroni correction) were used for numerical data and chi-square test for categorical data. While Kruskal–Wallis test (<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05 significance value was accepted) was used in order to establish if there are any differences between the groups in terms of evaluation criteria before therapy, at two and six weeks after the therapy, Mann–Whitney <italic>U</italic>-test (<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.017 significance value was accepted with Bonferroni correction) was used to establish from which group the differences arose. In the investigation of difference between the groups during therapy, repeated measures (repeated ANOVA, repetitive variance analysis) were used. The presence of any significant in-group difference within each group was investigated by Friedman test (<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05 was accepted as significant). When significant difference was detected inside a group by Friedman test, the presence of any statistically significant difference in in-group change (before the surgery–second postoperative week, before the surgery–sixth postoperative week, second postoperative week–sixth postoperative week) was assessed by Wilcoxon test (with Bonferroni correction) and <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.017 was accepted as significant.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The results of this study reveal that the addition of electromyographic biofeedback training following arthroscopic partial meniscectomy for strengthening of quadriceps muscle ensures early recovery of knee extensor muscle power, and better knee functional state in the early postoperative period which may be accompanied by problems such as pain and oedema.</p>
<p>In different studies using surface electromyography or isokinetic tests for measurements of neurological function of quadriceps femoris following meniscectomy it was found that weakness detected in the quadriceps femoris during the postoperative immobilization period was not related to nerve or muscle injury but was caused by reflex inhibition of motor neurons.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0269215511419382">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0269215511419382">26</xref></sup> It was found that maximal contraction rather than submaximal power was affected and the decrease in muscle power still continues in the sixth postoperative month when evaluated by surface electromyography and isokinetic dynamometer.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0269215511419382">27</xref></sup> The detection of 22% decrease in quadriceps muscle power and 13% decrease in muscle volume by functional muscle magnetic resonance imaging, suggests that maximal muscle power development is required for effective rehabilitation after arthroscopic meniscectomy.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0269215511419382">28</xref></sup></p>
<p>By the addition of electromyographic biofeedback into conventional therapy programmes applied in the rehabilitation of muscle weakness associated with the immobilization period following arthroscopic partial meniscectomy, the compliance of the patient to the exercise programme may be enhanced.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0269215511419382">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0269215511419382">20</xref></sup> It was reported that electromyographic biofeedback training was an effective method for increasing quadriceps muscle power as evaluated either by surface electromyography or by isokinetic dynomometer.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0269215511419382">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0269215511419382">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0269215511419382">30</xref></sup> In one of these studies, it was reported that while significant increase was detected in quadriceps muscle power in favour of the electromyography group, there was no difference between the groups in terms of loading the operated knee.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0269215511419382">16</xref></sup> However, we detected improvements in favour of electromyographic biofeedback compared to home exercise for both the time using a walking aid and knee function, as well as improvements in muscle power. The detection of these clinical improvements in favour of electromyographic biofeedback training indicated that the electromyographic biofeedback was effective both in clinical parameters and in muscle power.</p>
<p>It was suggested that the significant development in torque that took place without any significant change in thigh circumference measurements, in other words without any muscle hypertrophy after electromyographic biofeedback training, may be caused by motor learning.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0269215511419382">30</xref></sup> Similarly, no difference in thigh circumference measurements was detected in within-group evaluation for each of the three groups in our study. Therefore, the development established in quadriceps muscle power in electromyographic biofeedback group was thought to be associated with motor learning, rather than a result of muscle hypertrophy.</p>
<p>In a study by Kirnap et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0269215511419382">15</xref></sup> the effects of home exercise and electromyographic biofeedback after arthroscopic meniscectomy was compared and they found a significant increase in Lysholm Knee Scoring Scale score, knee flexion angle, vastus medialis obliquus and vastus lateralis muscle electrical activity measured by surface electromyography and quadriceps muscle power in the second and sixth postoperative weeks in the group which received electromyographic biofeedback. In our study, in the second postoperative week, vastus medialis obliquus average and vastus lateralis maximum and average contraction values were significantly better in the electromyographic biofeedback group than the home exercise and electrical stimulation groups, and Lysholm Knee Scoring Scale score was significantly higher in the electromyographic biofeedback group than in the home exercise group.</p>
<p>Electrical stimulation is a conventional method which has the feature of artificially stimulating intramuscular branches of motor nerve and is used to increase muscle power.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0269215511419382">20</xref></sup> In a study comparing the effectiveness of electrical stimulation and isometric exercise for quadriceps muscle after open meniscectomy it was reported that muscle volume and muscle power loss were less in the electrical stimulation group four weeks after surgery and the electrical stimulation group used crutches for a shorter time.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0269215511419382">31</xref></sup> In our study, the time using a walking aid in the electromyographic biofeedback group was significantly shorter than that in the home exercise group. Although the difference was not significant, the time using a walking aid in the electrical stimulation group was longer than that in the electromyographic biofeedback group and shorter than that in the home exercise group.</p>
<p>It was reported that isokinetic quadriceps power increased in both the electrical stimulation and home exercise groups after arthroscopic meniscectomy.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0269215511419382">18</xref></sup> However, in a study comparing the addition of electromyographic biofeedback or electrical stimulation therapy to an exercise programme following anterior cruciate ligament surgery it was reported that better recovery on peak torque power of quadriceps muscle in isokinetic measurement and active knee extension were detected in favour of the electromyographic biofeedback group.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0269215511419382">20</xref></sup> In our study, muscle power evaluation was carried out by surface electromyography instead of isokinetic dynomometer, and results obtained in terms of muscle power were in favour of the electromyographic biofeedback group. However, no significant difference was detected among groups in terms of active knee extension, and no superiority in terms of pain severity, Lysholm Knee Scoring Scale score and improvement in muscle power was found in the electrical stimulation group compared to the home exercise group.</p>
<p>Normally, recovery of active range of motion is reported 24–48 hours after arthroscopic knee surgery, and quadriceps and hamstring muscles allow early rehabilitation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0269215511419382">23</xref></sup> Since no complications were observed in our patients, active joint range-of-motion exercises were started early. In our study, while the electrical stimulation and electromyographic biofeedback groups exhibited significant progress in knee flexion in the sixth postoperative week in comparison to the second postoperative week, the home exercise group exhibited significant deterioration in active knee flexion in the second postoperative week compared to preoperative value. Kirnap et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0269215511419382">15</xref></sup> reported significant differences in favour of the electromyographic biofeedback group for flexion angle at two and six weeks after arthroscopic meniscectomy in a comparison between home exercise and electromyographic biofeedback groups. The severity of pain of the patients was not evaluated in Kirnap et al.’s study.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0269215511419382">15</xref></sup> Since pain in the postoperative period is an effective factor in quadriceps muscle inhibition, the severity of pain experienced by the patients during walking was also evaluated in our study. In all three groups, a significant decrease in pain experienced during walking was detected in the second and sixth postoperative weeks compared to the preoperative period. Although decrease in severity of pain was detected in the second postoperative week in the home exercise group, a deterioration in knee active flexion was an interesting finding.</p>
<p>Postoperative rehabilitation protocols and quadriceps muscle strengthening exercises with conservative therapy are important in terms of providing normal walking pattern.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0269215511419382">32</xref></sup> Arthroscopic meniscectomy patients were reported to be able to generally walk without a walking aid within one week postoperatively, and to go back to work within several days to six weeks depending on their physical requirements.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0269215511419382">33</xref></sup> In our study, it was determined that the patients in home exercise group had to use a walking aid for longer period of time compared to the electromyographic biofeedback group.</p>
<p>In a study carried out by Koutras et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0269215511419382">34</xref></sup> to evaluate the effects of isotonic, isokinetic and home exercise programmes after arthroscopic meniscectomy, it was suggested that taking measurements of the unoperated knee would be beneficial to make correct comparisons between the groups. In contrast, it was reported that absolute values of the operated knee were preferred in a study investigating the effects of functional exercise training following arthroscopic meniscectomy on muscle power, since the certain patients had also complained about the unoperated knee from time to time.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0269215511419382">11</xref></sup> Similarly, since certain patients had also complained about the unoperated knee in our study, only data from the operated knee were used.</p>
<p>Fabricant et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0269215511419382">35</xref></sup> reported that early recovery after arthroscopic partial meniscectomy was negatively related to female gender and severe osteoarthritis, however there was no relationship between age, body mass index, meniscus rupture or size of resection and recovery in the first year. In our study, there was no significant difference in terms of age, gender, body mass index, grade of osteoarthritis among the patients in all three groups. The homogeneous nature of the groups in terms of demographic and surgical features in our study is a beneficial factor for the pure evaluation of the treatment modalities.</p>
<p>In our study, the reduced time using a walking aid by the addition of electromyographic biofeedback training compared to home exercise only is an important clinical result. In terms of muscle power, the results of our study are in favour of electromyographic biofeedback training, but because electromyographic biofeedback therapy and measurements were made with the same device in our study, it is not possible to eliminate the effect of learning on measurement values. This is one of the limitations of our study, the other one being the very small number of patients.</p>
<p>According to the results of our study, the addition into conventional exercise programme following arthroscopic partial meniscectomy of electromyographic biofeedback training, which increases active participation of the patient in exercise therapy by providing visual and audial stimulation, enables the patient to achieve preoperative muscle powers earlier and provides better knee functional status in the postoperative early period. Therefore, it can be concluded that the addition of electromyographic biofeedback training into a conventional exercise programme after arthroscopic partial meniscectomy contributes to speeding up the rehabilitation process. Although the addition of electrical stimulation therapy showed superiority over the home exercise group in terms of shorter time using a walking aid and better recovery in knee flexion, these differences were not statistically and clinically significant. Furthermore, the electrical stimulation group did not show superiority over home exercise and electromyographic biofeedback groups in terms of pain, gait velocity, the time using a walking aid, muscle power, and progress in functional status.</p>
<p>A limited number of studies have been carried out on electromyographic biofeedback for increasing muscle power in arthroscopic meniscectomy rehabilitation, hence investigation of the long-term effects of electromyographic biofeedback on the recovery of quadriceps muscle power by randomized, controlled and blind studies with broader participation is needed.</p>
