<abstract>
<p>This article analyzes data from a major household survey in Melbourne, Australia, to assess the relative importance of each of the five sets of predictors—individual (structural and attitudinal) and contextual (household, dwelling, and locational)—to an explanation of urban resource consumption that encompasses water, energy, housing, carbon-intensive travel, and domestic appliances. Using general linear modeling and multiple regression, we find that the determinants of consumption vary for the different domains of consumption and also that an individual’s attributes are less influential than contextual factors in accounting for a particular level of per capita resource consumption.</p>

<p>From an environmental perspective, the 21st century has ushered in a number of critical challenges requiring solution within a narrowing window of opportunity if major social and economic dislocation is to be avoided. First, we live in a carbon-constrained world that is witnessing increasing concentrations of greenhouse gases in the earth’s atmosphere capable of triggering climatic change of a scale that could take centuries to reverse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0013916510390494">Parry, Canziani, Palutikof, van der Linden, &amp; Hanson, 2007</xref>). How we generate and consume energy are central to this issue, and the most recent world energy outlook (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0013916510390494">International Energy Agency, 2010</xref>) indicates that demand for fossil fuels will continue to supply 80% of a rapidly increasing demand for energy over the next 20 years. Second, we live in a resource-constrained world where peak oil, water shortages, decline in agricultural land, and loss of biodiversity are indications that our harvesting of the earth’s natural resources is now occurring at a rate that is exceeding replacement rate (WWF [World Wild Life Fund], 2009). Our patterns of consumption of housing, travel, water, and manufactured products are central to this issue. Population growth—forecast to reach 9 billion by 2050—when coupled with per capita consumption defines the magnitude of the sustainability challenge of the 21st century. The task of winding back unsustainable levels of consumption is a challenge for the citizens of high-income developed countries in North America, Western Europe, and Australia that have ecological footprints (EFs) two to four times the global average.</p>
<p>The EF has emerged over the past decade as the most widely accepted key indicator for the environmental effects of consumption (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0013916510390494">Wackernagel &amp; Rees, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0013916510390494">Wiedmann &amp; Barrett, 2010</xref>). The EF shows how much productive land and water a population requires to support its current level of consumption and waste generation using prevailing technology. It is a metric capable of being calculated across scales ranging from that of a city, to a nation, to the entire planet. The <italic>Living Planet Report</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0013916510390494">WWF, 2009</xref>) has calculated EF metrics for 160 countries, which range from 9.4 global hectares per person (gha/person) for the United States and 2.1 for China, to less than 1.0 for most of the African countries. The global average is 2.7 gha/person. For Australia, the national EF is 7.8 gha/person, with each of its major cities’ aggregate consumption being of similar magnitude (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0013916510390494">Turner &amp; Foran, 2008</xref>), with almost half due to resident consumption of housing, urban travel, and domestic goods. The size of per capita footprints in both developing and developed societies continues to increase: in China, for example, the per person footprint doubled between 1961 and 2005; in high income countries, the increase was 76% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0013916510390494">WWF, 2009</xref>). Global biocapacity is incapable of accommodating this trajectory of resource consumption in the 21st century as human demands on the world’s natural capital reach nearly a third more than the earth can sustain: “Most of us are propping up our current lifestyles, and our economic growth, by drawing—and increasingly overdrawing—on the ecological capacity of other parts of the world” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0013916510390494">Leape, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>With the world’s forecast population of 9 billion to be 70% urban by 2050, the sustainability challenge will focus more closely on the resource consumption of cities and their populations. In this regard, recent State of Environment reports on human settlements in Australia and internationally are not encouraging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0013916510390494">European Environment Information</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0013916510390494">Observation Network, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0013916510390494">Newton, 2006</xref>) with increasing levels of consumption being recorded across most of the headline environmental indicators such as energy, travel, housing, and water as well as increased levels of waste generation. Concerns about the environmental effects of consumption have also been registered in the Organisation for European Economic Co-Operation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0013916510390494">OECD; 2008a</xref>) with forecasts that consumption pressure from households are expected to intensify significantly by 2030.</p>
<p>With the world’s forecast population of 9 billion to be 70% urban by 2050, the sustainability challenge will focus more closely on the resource consumption of cities and their populations.

<p>Studies seeking to understand the determinants of urban resource consumption—the factors that underpin energy and water use, consumption of housing space, urban travel, and domestic appliances—are therefore increasingly important to identify where the most prospective points for public policy intervention exist. On the <italic>supply side</italic>, increasing knowledge is being assembled on the ecological signatures of those materials and products that make up our built environment through life cycle assessments of the manufacturing processes linked to housing, automobiles, consumer durables, and so on (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0013916510390494">Horne, Grant, &amp; Verghese, 2009</xref>), <italic>and</italic> how they can be better designed into our cities by more sustainable approaches to metropolitan land use and transport planning than has been characteristic of much urban development since World War II (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0013916510390494">Newman &amp; Kenworthy, 1999</xref>). These transitions will take time, however, to make an impact.</p>
<p>Attempts to reduce urban resource consumption more rapidly will require <italic>demand side</italic> interventions capable of affecting change in individual and household behavior in the key domains of energy, water, travel, and housing. This study is unique to the extent that it aims to assess how much of Australia’s urban resource consumption is “designed into” its cities and housing and how much is related to the discretionary behavior of an individual or household. The resulting knowledge will provide an evidence-based platform that is currently lacking for policy and program development by all tiers of government and industry to target areas where resource consumption can be most effectively wound back—by individuals, households, housing design professionals, and urban planners.</p>

<title>Framework for Modeling Consumption</title>
<p>The conceptual model for this study involves the components represented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0013916510390494">Figure 1</xref>. The model reflects the fact that consumption is a topic of interest in multiple fields of research—economics, psychology, sociology, marketing, and environmental science—and is becoming more multidisciplinary in focus, for example, in environmental psychology, environmental sociology, environmental economics, and so on. The role of individual belief systems, values, attitudes, and lifestyles in explaining human behavior have their roots in the psychological literature and a wide spectrum of qualitative measurement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0013916510390494">Wang, Worsley, &amp; Cunningham, 2009</xref>). In econometrics, consumption behavior is typically explored through a battery of measures of a quantitative nature where individual or household expenditures are related to factors such as income and employment status, sometimes extending into the more qualitative arena of consumer sentiment and so on (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0013916510390494">Chua &amp; Claus, 2011</xref>). In sociology, a spectrum of approaches can be found, ranging from sociodemographic studies of consumption lifestyles that draw attention to age, generational differences, social class and ethnicity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0013916510390494">Gilleard, Higgs, Hyde, Wiggins, &amp; Blane, 2005</xref>), and occupation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0013916510390494">Chan &amp; Goldthorpe, 2007</xref>), to those that explore the role that social and family contexts play in shaping everyday life and consumption (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0013916510390494">Shove, 2003</xref>), to those that extend their search for influences on consumption to the “community” in which the person belongs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0013916510390494">Hartel, Scruggs, &amp; Heidkamp, 2007</xref>). In the geographical sciences, there is an interest in the role that space and place play in consumption (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0013916510390494">Goss, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0013916510390494">Mansvelt, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0013916510390494">Perkins et al., 2009</xref>).</p>

</fig>
<p>The conceptual framework that underpins the research on which this article is based necessitates the specification of a <italic>set of multifactor determinants</italic> of urban resource consumption. It also recognizes the existence of <italic>several key components of urban resource consumption</italic>—water, energy, housing, transport, and domestic appliances—that need to be <italic>jointly examined</italic>. It is likely that the key determinants and potential intervention points for winding back consumption in these different domains will vary based on the studies reviewed in the following sections. Such a hypothesis requires testing within the context of a multifactor model where the relative strength of each determinant of consumption can be established, in particular, the relative significance of <italic>contextual setting</italic> (household, dwelling, and urban location) in explaining variations in levels of individual (per person) resource consumption.</p>
<p>We now proceed to identify the specific sets of factors and the measurement metrics necessary for a statistical modeling of the determinants of resource consumption. Operationalizations of all variables are described later in Method, Measures, and Metrics.</p>

<title>Consumption</title>
<p>A majority of studies have sought to explore the determinants of a specific consumption domain separately (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0013916510390494">OECD, 2008b</xref>). Here, we identify five consumption domains for examination—<italic>energy</italic> (electricity and gas), <italic>water, urban travel, domestic appliances</italic>, and <italic>housing</italic>—all of which impose both direct and indirect environmental pressures on natural resources and the environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0013916510390494">Dey et al., 2007</xref>). As a group, they provide a set of measures of consumption that can be assigned to a household or to specific individuals within households for modeling purposes.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0013916510390494">
<title>Individual Structural and Attitudinal Factors</title>
<p>In this study, we specify a range of individual-level factors that have been identified from the literature in this field as groups of “predictors of environmentally significant behaviors” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0013916510390494">Stern, 2000</xref>). They comprise a set of structural attributes that relate to economic and demographic status and a set of attitudinal factors deemed to be aligned to different environmental actions. A majority of studies reviewed have tended to focus on identifying key factors associated with the level of consumption of one specific product or resource. For water, studies by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0013916510390494">Grafton (2009)</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0013916510390494">Randolph and Troy (2007)</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0013916510390494">Syme and Nancarrow (2008)</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0013916510390494">Troy, Holloway, and Randolph (2005)</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0013916510390494">Guerin, Yust, and Coopet (2000)</xref>; and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0013916510390494">Loh and Coghlan (2003)</xref>, among others, have identified several significant influences on water use that include age and socioeconomic status (principally through income and education). Consistent linkages between an individual’s environmental attitudes and resource consumption have proven more difficult to establish (see major review of published studies in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0013916510390494">OECD, 2008b</xref>). Syme and Nancarrow reported that attitudes to water were important to the extent in which inconsistencies between attitudes and actions can be drawn to the attention of households, behavior changes may follow—in the context of community engagement/social marketing types of studies. However, in traditional social surveys (after <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0013916510390494">Grafton, 2009</xref>), measured environmental attitudes (e.g., level of concern about environment and level of environmental awareness) have tended to reveal no significant role in affecting household water use. In other studies where environmental values (also termed “environmental beliefs” and “ecological worldviews”) have been measured, results have suggested positive associations between “environmentalism” and levels of participation in “green” activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0013916510390494">Kahn, 2007</xref>) and curtailment of consumption (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0013916510390494">OECD, 2008b</xref>). It has also been suggested that attitudes or beliefs about specific environmental practices tend to be more predictive of behavior than general environmental attitudes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0013916510390494">Fishbein &amp; Ajzen, 1975</xref>). In other studies where environmental attitudes have been measured (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0013916510390494">Gilg &amp; Barr, 2006</xref>), they have been used along with a battery of demographic variables in cluster analyses to identify “types” of households involved in a range of water, energy, and waste behaviors but have not featured in any attempt to explain different levels of resource consumption.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0013916510390494">Faiers, Cook, and Neame (2007)</xref> recommend that studies attempting to develop a model for understanding human behavior and domestic energy use also need to be “informed by a wide range of internal and external factors” (p. 4390). As with the water-oriented research, empirical studies of domestic energy use have identified associations with income, household size, and age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0013916510390494">Lenzen, Dey, &amp; Foran, 2004</xref>), also climate, dwelling characteristics, and social factors (including socioeconomic status), but no significant correlations with any attitudes, beliefs, or intentions were elicited from respondents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0013916510390494">Kristrom, 2008</xref>). More investigative research is required here as well as a move from bivariate to multivariate and causal analyses.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0013916510390494">
<title>Household Context</title>
<p>In this study, we diverge from others reviewed by differentiating an individual respondent’s attributes from those associated with the household of which he or she is a part. The literature reviewed above suggests that there are household effects associated with consumption that involve household size, income, and car access, which in some instances reflects the operation of an economy of scale influence (see, for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0013916510390494">Höglund, 1999</xref>) and in others suggest evidence of “peer pressure” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0013916510390494">Troy et al., 2005</xref>). In a retail consumption context, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0013916510390494">Wakefield and Inman (2003)</xref> found that levels of expenditure on consumer items were different (higher) if consumption occurred in a social as opposed to a nonsocial setting.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0013916510390494">
<title>Dwelling Context</title>
<p>By introducing a consideration of the residential building into our model framework, we are recognizing that the housing stock varies in the degree to which some properties use more as opposed to less energy to provide occupants with year-round thermal comfort. The variability can be significant—up to 75% less operating energy being needed for energy-efficient housing compared with the average stock—based on “normal” household activity patterns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0013916510390494">Newton &amp; Tucker, 2010</xref>). The size of the dwelling, represented by floor area, is also positively correlated with energy used for space heating and cooling. Use of energy-efficient appliances provides further opportunity for reduction in energy use, although the number of appliances and manner in which these are used will affect the overall pattern of energy and water consumption (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0013916510390494">Newton &amp; Tucker, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>Research is also indicating that there are variations between the major types of housing (medium density, detached, and high-rise apartment) in terms of energy and water use (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0013916510390494">Newton, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0013916510390494">Pears, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0013916510390494">Perkins, Hamnett, Pullen, Zito, &amp; Trebilcock, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0013916510390494">Rickwood, Glazebrook, &amp; Searle, 2008</xref>), with demands from gardens being a prime determinant in respect of water consumption. Housing tenure also features as a determinant of behavior in a number of studies because of the split incentive for a renter to invest in any material upgrades to the dwelling or its built-in appliances that would enhance operating energy or water efficiency but deliver enhanced capital value to the landlord (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0013916510390494">International Energy Agency, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>The emergence of what has been termed an <italic>affluenza</italic> lifestyle in many advanced Western societies, reflected in an accumulation of household goods and appliances (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0013916510390494">De Graaf, Wann, &amp; Naylor, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0013916510390494">Hamilton &amp; Denniss, 2005</xref>), is also aligned to a period of significant growth in demand for and supply of housing space, as expressed in extensions and alterations to existing stock as well as floor areas of new housing; Australia’s newly constructed houses are now averaging 245 square meter in size—the largest in the world (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0013916510390494">Blackwell, 2009</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0013916510390494">
<title>Locational Context</title>
<p>The link between residential location within a city and consumption has generally focused on aspects of travel and mobility and the associated energy and carbon footprints (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0013916510390494">Holden, 2004</xref>). Car dependency emerged as a characteristic feature of Australian and North American suburbanization after World War II (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0013916510390494">Newman &amp; Kenworthy, 1999</xref>). For Melbourne, suburbs established post-1950 are largely car dependent, with buses the only public transport available. The inner city suburbs are transport rich, with extensive access to rail, tram, and bus. For the current “middle suburbs” that were established pre-1950, there is rail and bus access.</p>
<p>Cities also comprise multiple “places” that provide opportunities for their residents to enjoy contrasting styles of living and consuming. On one hand, there is the mainstream suburban consumer described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0013916510390494">Johnson (2006)</xref> as being resident in large new (post-1990) estates that have been master-planned or are dominated by housing designed and built by one or more of the nation’s major project-home builders, places of relative luxury designed with separate spaces for adults and children, entertaining and leisure and conspicuous consumption. For many, the suburban garden with its lawns, pools, and spas is seen as evidence of a “culturally significant consumption practice” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0013916510390494">Askew &amp; McGuirk, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>Alternative consumption practices that contrast with mainstream suburban consumer culture have been associated with the lifestyles of gentrifiers who bring change to inner-city neighborhoods. Since the early 1970s in Australia, inner-city gentrification has been linked to lifestyles that value social and cultural diversity, cosmopolitanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0013916510390494">Luckins, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0013916510390494">Zukin, 2008</xref>), “urban grittyness” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0013916510390494">Bridge &amp; Dowling, 2001</xref>), higher density living (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0013916510390494">Badcock, 2001</xref>), and access to unique and authentic outlets for food, clothing, and specialty goods compared with the supermarkets and franchised chain stores of suburbia.</p>
<p>The seven precincts surveyed in this study provide representatives of the new outer greenfield suburbs, long-established middle suburbs, and redeveloped and gentrified inner-city neighborhoods, with contrasting levels of residential density and public transport access.</p>

<p>A postal survey undertaken in June 2009 in seven residential precincts across Melbourne resulted in data for adult individuals representing 1,250 households at a response rate of 16%. The questionnaire was designed to collect information on the structural and attitudinal attributes of individuals, their household and dwelling characteristics as well as household consumption data for electricity, gas, and water based on the most recent utility bills. Electricity and gas bills were combined in this analysis because both electricity and gas are used for operating the spectrum of built-in and plug-in domestic appliances in a dwelling. The expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm was used for imputation of missing values when scales were used. This algorithm assigns realistic values to missing values on the basis of responses for the other items included in the scale.</p>
<sec id="section8-0013916510390494">
<title>Dependent Variables</title>
<p>There are five measures of per capita resource consumption selected for study (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0013916510390494">Figure 1</xref>): (a) water, (b) energy, (c) domestic appliances, (d) carbon intensity of personal travel, and (e) housing space. Later, we describe and define each in turn, comparing the median values for these measures for the seven survey precincts, ordered according to distance from the CBD, in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0013916510390494">Table 1</xref>.</p>

<p>Respondents to the survey were asked to provide details regarding their household’s last water, electricity, and gas bills (a technique commonly used in the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0013916510390494">Australian Bureau of Statistics [ABS], 1999</xref>). These amounts were divided by the number of people in the household to obtain per capita measures of consumption. The measure for domestic appliances was obtained by adding together the number of plug-in appliances in the home before dividing by the number of people in the household. Air conditioning units, dishwashers, separate freezers, television sets, home entertainment systems, and computers were included, but built-in appliances such as kitchen and lighting systems, hot-water heating and space heating, and cooling systems were excluded. Checklists similar to those used by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0013916510390494">Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO, 2008</xref>) and Victorian Utility Consumption Survey (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0013916510390494">VUCS, 2001</xref>) were employed.</p>
<p>The carbon intensity of personal travel was measured by considering the type of transport used to get to work, study, shopping, and social events. A scale ranging from 1 to 28 was established with a maximum score of 28 when a private car was used for all four of these purposes. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0013916510390494">Table 2</xref> explains how this measure was developed for each travel purpose, with the total score simply obtained by addition. Our measure for the carbon intensity of travel was designed to capture the relative use made of cars as opposed to public transport, as opposed to foot and bicycle travel. To validate this measure, we used the estimated kilometers personally driven per year by the respondent. This traditional vehicle-kilometers-traveled (VKT) metric underestimates the carbon intensity of travel in that it ignores travel as a passenger and it ignores the use of public transport. Indeed, more than 50% of those who claimed that they did not drive at all had transport scores above 10 on our carbon intensity of personal travel scale. In addition, VKT proved to be a very inaccurate measure, as evidenced by the fact that more than 6.5% of the sample was unable to give even an approximate value for the number of kilometers they personally drove each year. Despite these deficiencies, when the median approximate distance driven in a year was correlated with our measure for the carbon intensity of personal travel, a Spearman rank correlation coefficient of 0.89 and a Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.86 were obtained. This suggests that, on average, our measure for the carbon intensity of personal travel correlates well with the simpler but less accurate measure of kilometers driven per annum, validating our measure for the carbon intensity of personal travel.</p>

<p>Finally, the per capita measure for the consumption of housing space was calculated by aggregating the space currently occupied, including holiday homes, and dividing by the number of people in the household. On the basis of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0013916510390494">Newton and Tucker (2010)</xref>, typical floor areas were assigned for each type of dwelling as follows: 230 square meter for one-storey detached, 300 square meter for two-storeys detached, 115 square meter for medium density (town house, apartment blocks with at most six storeys), 115 square meter for high-rise apartments (&gt;six storeys), and 175 square meter for holiday home.</p>

<title>Individual structural attributes</title>
<p>Demographic data were collected for the individual completing the questionnaire and for the household. In particular, respondents were asked to specify their age using five age cohorts (aligned to generations), their gender, their country of birth, their education level, and their current occupation or last job title. Only 4% were under 25 years of age, with 43% between 25 and 44 years of age, 38% between 45 and 64 with the remaining 14% aged 65 and above. There were more female respondents (59%) than male respondents, and 65% of respondents were born in Australia, 11% in Asia, and 20% in the United Kingdom, Europe, North America, or New Zealand. Only 17% of respondents had an educational level of less than 12 year, whereas 61% had completed some sort of degree, diploma, or certificate. In the sample, 57% of respondents gave manager or professional as their job description, and only 5% said that they had never worked.</p>

<title>Individual attitudes</title>
<p>The questionnaire collected information on individual attitudes, a number of which were subsequently condensed into scales referred to below as environmental concern, energy sensitivity, water sensitivity, carbon travel sensitivity, and importance of environmental action. All items for individual attitudes are available in the online appendix. Since 1992, the ABS has been undertaking regular national surveys that confirm that environmental concern is a major continuing issue to the public (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0013916510390494">Newton, 2006</xref>). It has been measured by a single question: “Are you concerned about any environmental problems?” Environmental concern is also seen as a multidimensional issue that extends to belief systems and a range of personal attitudes and can be represented and measured as a multifactor construct. The work has provided a framework and sets of scales that have been drawn on variously in multiple studies. The Environmental Concern Scale (see appendix D1) includes several of Dunlap and colleagues’ indicators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0013916510390494">Dunlap &amp; Jones, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0013916510390494">Xiao &amp; Dunlap, 2007</xref>) that were consolidated into a scale used in this study and by the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0013916510390494">NSW Department of Environment and Climate Change (2006)</xref>. All other scales in the appendix were assembled specifically for this project but will have individual items that feature in many community “sustainability” surveys (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0013916510390494">VUCS, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0013916510390494">WDRHS [Waste Disposal and Recycling Householder Survey], 2004</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0013916510390494">Hair, Black, Babin, Anderson, and Tatham (2006)</xref> claimed that scales with Cronbach’s alpha of above 0.60 may be considered sufficiently reliable for an exploratory study such as this.</p>

<title>Household context</title>
<p>The household data included gross income in six income brackets and current living arrangements or household structure. The median household income was between US$60,000 and US$80,000, with 37% of households having an income of less than US$60,000 and19% with an income of below US$36,000. However, 9% of households had an income of above US$180,000, 23% above US$119,000, and 45% above US$80,000. Single-person households comprised 25% of households, with 39% of households consisting of only two persons. Households without children made up 32% of the sample, couples with children made up 29%, with 5% for single parent families and 7% for adults living with related or unrelated adults. A total of 11% of households owned no registered vehicles, 42% owned one vehicle, 35% owned two, and 11% owned at least three.</p>

<title>Locational context</title>
<p>The seven precincts surveyed (described in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0013916510390494">Table 4</xref>) represent distinctive residential environments in relation to type of housing and public transport access. For the purpose of exploring the significance of urban location or urban setting in per person consumption patterns, precincts can be conceptualized in at least three ways. First, dwellings differ in distance from the central business district (CBD) in kilometers. Melbourne remains a city with a dominant CBD that has grown primarily in radial fashion with no “edge cities” or competing subcentres, and displays a traditional population-density gradient with distance from centre. Second, the seven discrete precincts offer different environments for urban living (as described briefly in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0013916510390494">Table 4</xref>). Third, there are three archetypal urban living environments—inner, middle, and outer suburban—strongly differentiated by dwelling type and density and public transport access (nominal measurement).</p>

<title>Data Analysis</title>
<p>A three-stage analysis process has been employed. For stage 1, a general linear model analysis has been used to identify those variables that have a significant effect on consumption. Only those that have a significant effect on consumption were retained in the final model, reducing the effect of missing values. Five per capita consumption variables were considered: (a) water, (b) energy, (c) appliances, (d) carbon intensity of personal travel, and (e) housing space. Five sets of explanatory variables were considered for each of these consumption variables: individual structural attributes and individual attitudes, and household, dwelling, and locational context. For Stage 2, a prediction of consumption was obtained for each category of consumption using each of the five explanatory sets of variables. In Stage 3, a multiple regression analysis was then run for each of the consumption categories using the Stage 2 predicted consumption values to establish the relative importance of the five sets of explanatory variables for each consumption variable. Relatively, low variance inflation factors, all below 3, indicated that multicollinearity was not an issue in these analyses.</p>
<p>The general linear model procedure is capable of handling independent variables with a variety of measurement scales. Variables such as precinct are treated as seven distinct entities. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table6-0013916510390494">Table 6</xref> shows the percentage of variation in per capita consumption explained by each of the independent variables. The variables with superscript “a” are the significant variables in the general linear models when the two sets of individual determinants of consumption and the three sets of contextual determinants of consumption were considered separately. The nonsignificant variables were removed from these Stage 2 models to minimize the number of missing values.</p>

<p>The predicted consumption values from these 25 models were used to construct correlation matrices and regression models for each type of consumption, allowing an assessment of the importance of individual and contextual variables in regard to per capita consumption. This allows us to compare the importance of individual and contextual determinants of per capita consumption in regard to energy, water, appliances, carbon intensity of personal travel, and housing space. In addition, the relationships between the five measures of consumption are analyzed using Pearson’s correlations.</p>
<p>Four of the five consumption measures required transformations to provide more independent normally distributed residuals with constant variance. A square root transformation was applied for the per capita water and appliance consumptions, whereas a log transformation was applied for the per capita energy and housing space consumption variables.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table6-0013916510390494">Table 6</xref> suggests that when the five determinant clusters are considered independently, the dwelling context is most important for water consumption (<italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> = 28.5%) followed by the household context (<italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> = 24.3%). For energy consumption, the household context is more important (<italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> = 35.2%) than the dwelling context (<italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> = 11.3%). <xref ref-type="table" rid="table6-0013916510390494">Table 6</xref> suggests that the household context is most important for per capita appliance consumption (<italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> = 54.6%). Carbon intensity for personal travel is also best explained by the household context (<italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> = 36.1%), but the dwelling context and locational contexts are also important with <italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> values of 26.8% and 21.1%, respectively. We will find that there is considerable overlap between the predictions obtained for these three contexts in the case of this dependent variable. However, this overlap was not sufficient to cause multicollinearity problems. For our measure of housing space, the household context (<italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> = 55.6%) is by far the most important predictor of consumption, followed by the dwelling context with an <italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> of 36.6%.</p>
<p>The significant variables with superscript “a” in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table6-0013916510390494">Table 6</xref> indicate when consumption is significantly higher. The independent importance of these and other effects can be judged by their individual <italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> values. Interestingly, some variables that were significant when considered independently were no longer significant when other variables were included in the model. In addition, some variables that were not significant when considered independently became significant when other variables were included in the model.</p>
<p>The location context results in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table6-0013916510390494">Table 6</xref> suggest that there is variation between the precincts that cannot be totally explained by the distance from the CBD or archetypal urban living environment (inner, middle, and outer). In the case of water, appliance, and house-space consumption, less than half the variation in consumption due to precincts could be explained by these factors. However, 78% of the between-precinct variation in the carbon intensity of personal travel could be attributed to distance from the CBD with 88% of this variation attributed to archetypal urban living environment (inner/middle/outer suburb). In addition, 59% of the between-precinct variation in energy consumption could be attributed to distance from the CBD with 88% of this variation attributed to archetypal urban living environment (inner/middle/outer suburb).</p>
<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table7-0013916510390494">Table 7</xref> shows the correlations for the per capita consumption measures and the predictions for these measures obtained using the five clusters of explanatory variables. These results show weaker correlations between the individual explanatory clusters and the consumption measures, with generally stronger correlations between the context explanatory clusters and the consumption measures.</p>

<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table8-0013916510390494">Table 8</xref> shows the results when predicted consumption levels for each of the clusters of explanatory variables are used to predict the five consumption measures. The <italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> values show that 78% of the variation in per capita consumption of housing space can be explained by this model. This percentage falls to 56% in the case of per capita appliance consumption, 45% for per capita water consumption, and 43% for per capita energy consumption. The model for per capita carbon intensity from personal travel explains only 37% of the variation in this variable.

<title>Discussion and Conclusions</title>
<p>It is clear that there is no “one-size-fits-all” explanation for the different categories of urban resource consumption. Attempts at winding back consumption need to focus on each domain separately.</p>
<p>For per capita water consumption, the key determinants rest with the household and dwelling context in which the (individual) consumer resides, rather than any attributes peculiar to the individual. The possible exception is age/generation. Here, the trend toward higher consumption among the elderly is in line with other studies (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0013916510390494">ABS, 2010</xref>) that reveal that this cohort of the population is less concerned about the environment as well as having fewer concerns about climatic change than all other generational groups—a reflection, perhaps, of the era through which this group has grown up—one not characterized by resource or climate constraints. Smaller, wealthier (as measured by income and home ownership) households are linked to high levels of consumption. The income and wealth effect are revealed almost universally in studies of consumption. The link between water consumption and single-person households—the most rapidly growing demographic in Australia and projected to increase by a further 60% to 90% over the next 20 years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0013916510390494">Lunn, 2010</xref>)—highlights where continuing pressures will come from. These groups are also those with lowest scores on the water-efficiency scale—reflective of a level of desensitization not evident in other groups. The effect of a garden is not as pronounced as might have been expected, but the concurrence of the survey with a prolonged drought (over a decade in duration) and severe restrictions that curtail use of water outside the dwelling could be in play here.</p>
<p>The household context is most important for per capita energy consumption—housing occupants, after all, derive their level of thermal comfort and amenity from the type and range of built-in and plug-in appliances used. Here, small or single-person, high-income, apartment-dwelling households emerge as the high consumers, especially when the individuals concerned exhibit low-energy sensitivity scores. That the Docklands precinct is aligned with the high-energy users (refer again to <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0013916510390494">Table 1</xref>) is suggestive of a form of “hotel effect” operating among this high-rise, apartment-dwelling group. Responses to other questions in the “Living in Melbourne” survey reveal that apartment dwellers have least knowledge among all other categories of dwelling occupant (detached and medium density) about energy or water conservation. For example, they lack awareness of the existence of water or energy-efficient appliances, level of energy performance (rating) of their building envelope, type of hot-water heating appliance installed, and so on—all of which can affect variability in energy and water efficiency and use.</p>
<p>Per capita appliance consumption is primarily driven from a household context and is highest for single-person households who are not in a position to “average out” their acquisitions among other occupants of the dwelling, and for high-income households who own their own property and are significant consumers in other areas such as number of vehicles garaged on site. The growth in small and single-person households as well as increasing wealth in Australian society are clearly key drivers of increasing consumption of domestic appliances, leaving aside any role that conspicuous consumption may play. The individual-level influences associated with higher levels of appliance acquisition are linked to age and occupation (professional and managerial). That the dwellings that high-appliance users occupied had higher energy ratings are suggestive of a Jevons effect in operation, whereby increases in the efficiency with which a resource is used tend to increase rather than decrease the rate of consumption of that resource—in this case, where energy savings from the operation of the dwelling (space heating and cooling) are allocated to increased appliance purchase and use.</p>
<p>High levels of per capita consumption of housing space are linked most strongly with households in owner-occupied detached housing who also own a holiday home for personal use. Other determinants of high per capita housing space consumption are small households and the elderly, the latter finding being aligned to aggregate (census) analyses that indicate very high levels of underoccupancy of housing by Melbourne households aged 60 plus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0013916510390494">Newton, 2010</xref>). There are a number of supply side factors aligned to this trend of increased consumption of housing space: size of new houses entering the market are now the largest in the world (averaging 245 square meters in area [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0013916510390494">Vasek, 2009]</xref> and are being constructed in a highly cost-effective manner). Australian housing is also among the costliest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0013916510390494">Demographia, 2010</xref>), in part because of significant supply constraints (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0013916510390494">National Housing Supply Council, 2010</xref>) but also due to a highly favorable tax environment for those wishing to invest in housing, either as home owners or investors.</p>
<p>As shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table7-0013916510390494">Table 7</xref>, locational context emerges as a particularly significant influence when focus shifts to the carbon intensity of urban travel. Residents in the car-dependent outer suburbs exhibit high levels of carbon intensive travel, reflecting their longer vehicle kilometers traveled, more than twice that of the inner suburban resident (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0013916510390494">Lucas, 2009</xref>), and the relative absence of the lower carbon public transport options in their region. Significant individual-level links with high-carbon travel are with those exhibiting low levels of “carbon sensitivity,” and household links tend to be strongest with the more vulnerable outer suburban middle-income single parent residents’—groups that <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0013916510390494">Dodson and Sipe (2008)</xref> suggested were most at risk from mortgage and gasoline price hikes—who also indicated that they were not able to pay more for their energy and water use.</p>
<p>There are several messages to emerge from this study for demand-side environmental and urban policy:</p>
<list id="list1-0013916510390494" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>Our models indicate that the key intervention points will vary for the different categories of urban resource consumption under consideration. Consequently, policies and programs related to regulation, pricing, or incentive-based schemes for behavior change will need to be tailored accordingly.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Notwithstanding the fact that the key dependent variables all related to per person consumption, household and dwelling context, and to a lesser extent location, emerged as significant determinants of the consumption of water, energy, housing space, appliances, and urban travel.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Small or single-person higher income households constitute the group that consumes all four categories of dwelling-centered resources to a much higher level than other sociodemographic groups. Their disposable income is likely to be higher and their consumption cannot be spread across the members of larger more traditional families (that provide economies of household scale for consumption). To the extent that demographic trends suggest growth in both small households and incomes, there is a clear target—and tension—for both conservationists and marketers here.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Older age groups tend to be higher consumers across the board of dwelling-centered resources—a reflection of the fact that the 60 plus group exhibit significant levels of underoccupancy of housing in Australia. Given the looming reality of an ageing population, policies that would make it easier for older households to adjust their housing space needs by moving to smaller properties within the same suburb (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0013916510390494">Newton, 2010</xref>) could also contribute to a reduction in resource consumption.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Individual attitudes that align more closely to a specific environmental domain (e.g., refer to the water, carbon, and energy sensitivity scales) appear to be more influential in foreshadowing actual consumption outcomes than are the broader “environmental values” scales developed for this and other studies (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0013916510390494">Kahn, 2007</xref>). Opportunities for the communications or social marketing arms of the major utilities to develop messages around these domain-specific environmental attitude arenas would seem to offer some prospect of traction.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Where people live in Australian cities tends to feature significantly as a determinant of consumption for travel-related activity. This is due to the fact that all post-1950 residential development has been car dependent—the worst possible scenario for energy use and greenhouse gas emissions.</p></list-item></list>
<p>Urban policy is currently struggling to develop and implement planning strategies for a resource and carbon-constrained world.</p>
