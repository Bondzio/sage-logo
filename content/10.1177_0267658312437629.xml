<abstract>
<p>It has been proposed that external interfaces are vulnerable to residue optionality, whereas pure syntax and internal interfaces are acquirable in second language (L2) acquisition (Sorace, 2005, 2011; Sorace and Filiaci, 2006). The proposal was tested in this article through the interpretation of overt and null embedded arguments in L2 Chinese grammars. The article identifies two types of null elements in Chinese: Ø<sub>ziji</sub> and Ø<sub>topic</sub>. Ø<sub>ziji</sub> is a purely syntactic category, whereas Ø<sub>topic</sub> is a syntax–discourse interface category. Being a D-pronoun, <italic>ta</italic> ‘he/him’ can refer to either the matrix subject or a discourse entity in the embedded argument position. Its interpretation involves lexicon–syntax and syntax–semantics internal interfaces. Results from a picture judgment task showed that external interfaces were acquired as well as pure syntax and internal interfaces, which supports the claims of Ivanov, 2009; Iverson et al., 2008; Kraš, 2008; Rothman, 2007, 2009; Slabakova and Ivanov, 2011. In addition, Ø<sub>topic</sub> was acquired at different states in different sentence positions. This supports the claim that interface categories should not be considered holistically (Yuan, 2010). The article further speculates that cross-linguistic influence and the nature of the possible positive evidence may have contributed to the difference here in terms of representation and/or processing.</p>

<title>I Introduction</title>
<p>The interface categories have been researched extensively in recent second language (L2) studies. Some researchers propose that while L2 learners have no trouble acquiring categories that are internal to the computational system of syntax proper and those that belong to internal interfaces such as the syntax–semantics and lexicon–syntax interfaces, categories that involve an external interface such as the syntax–discourse interface are vulnerable to residual optionality (see, amongst others, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0267658312437629">Sorace, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0267658312437629">Sorace and Filiaci, 2006</xref>). This proposal is referred to as the Interface Hypothesis (IH).</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0267658312437629">Sorace (2011)</xref> summarizes that the interface vulnerability are either explained through representational accounts (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0267658312437629">Tsimpli et al., 2004</xref>) or processing resources account (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0267658312437629">Sorace and Filiaci, 2006</xref>). The representational account was proposed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0267658312437629">Tsimpli et al. (2004)</xref> in a study of first language (L1) attrition of Greek and Italian. The L1–L2 divergence is argued to underlie the attrition effects at the syntax–discourse interface. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0267658312437629">Hopp (2004)</xref> argues that persistent L1 influence underlies L2 learners’ target-deviant behaviours on interfaces in a study of L2 acquisition of German. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0267658312437629">Montrul (2010)</xref> also points out that interfaces are vulnerable to transfer, and it is likely that L1 transfer contributes to the non-convergence of interfaces in the L2 acquisition of Spanish by heritage speakers.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0267658312437629">Sorace (2005)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0267658312437629">Sorace and Filiaci (2006)</xref> suggest that the fated vulnerability of interfaces is due to processing difficulties. The acquisition of interface categories requires not only the relevant syntactic and discourse knowledge but also learners’ ability to integrate the two types of knowledge, which may be beyond L2 learners’ processing resources.</p>
<p>The IH has been tested in simultaneous bilingual development (see, amongst others, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0267658312437629">Serratrice et al., 2004</xref>), L1 attrition (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0267658312437629">Tsimpli et al., 2004</xref>) and L2 ultimate attainment (see, amongst others, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0267658312437629">Sorace and Filiaci, 2006</xref>). Supporting evidence for the IH has also been reported in L1 attrition and incomplete acquisition of heritage speakers (see, amongst others, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0267658312437629">Montrul, 2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0267658312437629">2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0267658312437629">Montrul and Polinsky, 2011</xref>) and in L2 development (see, amongst others, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0267658312437629">Belletti and Leonini, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0267658312437629">Pérez-Leroux and Glass, 1999</xref>).</p>
<p>Although some work of L2 development is referred to as ‘unwarranted extensions’ of the IH by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0267658312437629">Sorace (2011)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0267658312437629">White (2011</xref>: 109) points out that there is no reason to assume that L2 learners should not ‘experience similar interface problems to those experienced by bilingual children in the course of their language development, an area encompassed by the IH’. White argues convincingly that interface problems should exist in L2 development and cannot possibly emerge out of the blue in near-native grammars. It is argued that whatever (representation or processing) is difficult at the near-native level will be even more difficult at less proficient levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0267658312437629">Lardiere, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0267658312437629">Slabakova, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0267658312437629">White, 2011</xref>). L2 development should be considered as well as ultimate attainment to fully test the hypothesis that residue problems in L2 acquisition lie in external interfaces exclusively.</p>
<p>The inevitability of fossilization at external interfaces has been questioned by a number of studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0267658312437629">Ivanov, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0267658312437629">Iverson et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0267658312437629">Kraš, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0267658312437629">Rothman, 2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0267658312437629">2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0267658312437629">Slabakova and Ivanov, 2011</xref>). Based on different empirical evidence, these studies claim that syntax–discourse interfaces are ultimately acquirable despite possible delays.</p>
<p>In a study of L2 acquisition of the relation between various types of licensing elements and the interpretation of <italic>wh-</italic>variables as existential polarity words, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0267658312437629">Yuan (2010)</xref> finds that the licensing relation is acquired for some licensors but not for others. He proposes that L2 learners’ success or failure in acquiring interfaces (in particular, the syntax–semantics interface) is not domain-wide. They are likely to be affected by a number of variables, such as ‘the categorical nature of elements involved in the interface relationship, the status of these elements in the target language speakers’ grammar, the input the learners are exposed to, the cross-linguistic influence, etc.’ (p. 258).</p>
<p>The current article presents an empirical study of L2 acquisition of the interpretation of <italic>ta</italic> ‘he/him’ and the null element in the embedded argument positions by English-speaking learners. I propose that the null element in these positions is not a phonetically null version of <italic>ta</italic>. Two types of null elements are identified: Ø<sub>ziji</sub> and Ø<sub>topic</sub>. The former is a purely syntactic category, whereas the latter is a syntax–discourse category.</p>
<p>The results provide additional evidence to the claim that grammatical aspects at the syntax–discourse interface are acquirable despite possible developmental delays (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0267658312437629">Rothman, 2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0267658312437629">2009</xref>). The article also reports differences between the embedded subject position and the embedded object position regarding the acquisition of Ø<sub>topic</sub>. L1 transfer and the nature of input may have contributed to the differences in terms of representation and/or processing.</p>
<p>The article is organized as follows. I provide a new analysis for embedded null arguments in Chinese in Section II. Relevant L2 studies are reviewed in Section III. Section IV introduces the current study, whereas Section V discusses the results. Section VI contains a conclusion.</p>

<title>II Theoretical background</title>
<p>One of the well-noted differences between Chinese and English is that Chinese allows both a null element and an overt pronoun in the subject position of a finite clause and the object position of a transitive verb, whereas English allows the latter but not the former in these positions, as in (1)–(4).</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>(1) John<sub>i</sub> says that *<italic>e</italic>/he<sub>i/j</sub> likes Tom.</p>

</disp-quote></p>
<p>The English pronoun <italic>he</italic>/<italic>him</italic> in (1) and (2) can refer to either the matrix subject <italic>John</italic> or a discourse entity. <italic>Ta</italic> and the null element in (3) can both refer to either the matrix subject <italic>Xiao Zhang</italic> or a discourse entity. <italic>Ta</italic> in (4) allows both readings, whereas the null element can only refer to a discourse entity. Let us analyse the interpretation of the null elements in (3) and (4) by considering what they are.</p>
<p>The null elements in (3) and (4) have been analysed as <italic>pros</italic> and variables within the Government and Binding (GB) theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0267658312437629">Huang, 1984</xref>). However, it has been noted that the GB proposals of empty categories are incompatible with the Minimalist Program (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0267658312437629">Holmberg, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0267658312437629">Hornstein, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0267658312437629">Manzini and Roussou, 2000</xref>), and have to be reconsidered.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0267658312437629">Roberts (2010)</xref> proposes that the phonological silence of a pronoun results from deletion at Phonetic Form (PF). A pronoun deletes from the subject position in Romance null-subject languages such as Italian, as its formal features are a subset of those of its probe T: it is the defective goal of T. Italian differs from English in that the Italian T has a D(efiniteness) feature, whereas the English T does not. The D feature on T makes it possible for the subject pronoun to become its defective goal, as the pronoun intrinsically has a D feature. Roberts postulates that the presence of a D feature on T is associated with rich agreement.</p>
<p>The Chinese null subject cannot be analysed as a deleted pronoun by applying Roberts’ proposal directly. For such an analysis to hold, it would be obligatory to assume that the Chinese T has a D feature like the Italian T. To start with, this assumption is inconsistent with Roberts’ original postulation that the D feature exists on T only in languages with rich verbal inflections. Second, such an assumption cannot explain the subject–object asymmetry in the interpretation of null elements illustrated in (3) and (4) above (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0267658312437629">Zhao, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>I propose that one type of Chinese embedded null subject results from deletion of the bare reflexive <italic>ziji</italic> ‘self’ (hence Ø<sub>ziji</sub>). Let us consider this possibility in (5), which is schematized in (6).</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>(5) Zhangsan shuo <italic>e</italic> renshi Lisi.</p>

<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0267658312437629">Chomsky (2008)</xref> suggests that only phase heads (i.e. C and v) have phi-features. In some languages such as English, the phi-features of C are transmitted to T. Chomsky further suggests that phi-feature inheritance by T from C is parameterized across languages. Accordingly, I assume that the Chinese C does not transmit its unvalued phi-features to T. C rather than T probes <italic>ziji</italic> in the embedded clause in (6) and values its case feature as nominative. I assume that <italic>ziji</italic> is an N-head with unvalued phi-features, which can move from head to head and attach to heads such as C by adjunction during computation (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0267658312437629">Cole and Sung, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0267658312437629">Reinhart and Reuland, 1993</xref>). The unvalued φ-features of <italic>ziji</italic> trigger it to move upwards and head-adjoin to C<sub>embedded</sub>. According to the Phase-Impenetrability Condition (PIC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0267658312437629">Chomsky, 2001</xref>), C is still accessible to vP<sub>matrix</sub>. The matrix subject at Spec-vP is active, as it still has an unvalued case feature. The matrix subject probes <italic>ziji</italic> and values its unvalued φ-features.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0267658312437629">1</xref></sup></p>
<p>The crucial thing is that deletion takes place at PF, after the computation of the whole sentence is completed. At PF, <italic>ziji</italic> has the same phi-features as the matrix subject. Both of them have a nominative case feature. As an N<sup>0</sup> category, <italic>ziji</italic> has a [N] feature. In addition to the [N] feature, the matrix subject has a [D] feature, which is the definiteness feature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0267658312437629">Longobardi, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0267658312437629">Roberts, 2010</xref>). The features of <italic>ziji</italic> are properly included in those of the matrix subject as in (6). <italic>Ziji</italic> deletes as a defective goal of the matrix subject in line with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0267658312437629">Roberts (2010)</xref>, and Ø<sub>ziji</sub> is derived.</p>
<p>An embedded null subject in Chinese can also refer to a discourse entity given proper discourse conditions, as in (7):</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>(7) <italic>Q</italic>: (Lisi<sub>i</sub> qu guo Lundun ma?)</p>
<p>    Lisi  go EXP London Q<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0267658312437629">2</xref></sup></p>
<p>    ‘Has Lisi<sub>i</sub> been to London?’</p>
<p>  <italic>A</italic>: Zhangsan shuo <italic>e</italic><sub>i</sub> qu guo Lundun.</p>
<p>    Zhangsan say go EXP London</p>
<p>    ‘Zhangsan says that <italic>e</italic><sub>i</sub> has been to London.’</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Given a discourse in the form of a question, the null element in (7A) refers to the discourse prominent <italic>Lisi</italic>, whereas <italic>ziji</italic> in the same position cannot. This indicates that there is another type of embedded null subject in Chinese other than Ø<sub>ziji</sub>. (7A) is schematized in (8).</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>(8) <graphic position="anchor" xlink:href="10.1177_0267658312437629-img2.tif"/></p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p><italic>Lisi</italic> moves from Spec-CP<sub>embedded</sub> phase by phase until it reaches the outermost Spec-CP<sub>matrix</sub>, attracted by the Edge feature of each phase head. Note that the uppermost specifier position is a left edge position for fronted elements, which is different from the specifier position where an external argument originates or moves into (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0267658312437629">Chomsky, 1995</xref>). All the lower copies are suppressed in compliance with chain-reduction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0267658312437629">Chomsky, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0267658312437629">Nunes, 2004</xref>). Chinese allows a Topic NP Deletion Rule (TNPDR), which operates across discourse to delete the topic of a sentence under identity with a topic in a preceding sentence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0267658312437629">Huang, 1982</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0267658312437629">1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0267658312437629">Tsao, 1977</xref>). The result of such a deletion process is a ‘topic chain’. In line with the TNPDR, <italic>Lisi</italic> in (8) is deleted and (7A) is formed.</p>
<p>We showed above that the embedded subject position allows both Ø<sub>ziji</sub> and Ø<sub>topic</sub>. Below we will look at the embedded object position. The embedded null object in (9) cannot refer to <italic>Zhangsan</italic>, whereas <italic>ziji</italic> can. This indicates that the embedded null object cannot be Ø<sub>ziji</sub>.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>(9) Zhangsan<sub>i</sub> shuo Lisi bu renshi <italic>e</italic><sub><italic>*i</italic>/<italic>j</italic></sub>/<italic>ziji</italic><sub><italic>i</italic>/<italic>*j</italic></sub>.</p>
<p>  Zhangsan say Lisi not know</p>
<p>  ‘Zhangsan<sub>i</sub> says Lisi does not know <italic>e</italic><sub><italic>*i</italic>/<italic>j</italic></sub>/<italic>ziji</italic><sub><italic>i</italic>/<italic>*j</italic></sub>.’</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Let us consider why <italic>ziji</italic> cannot be deleted in the embedded object position. The unvalued φ-features of <italic>ziji</italic> are valued by the embedded subject <italic>Lisi</italic>. However, the embedded object <italic>ziji</italic> can never be a defective goal of <italic>Lisi</italic>, as the accusative case of the former conflicts with the nominative case of the latter. Therefore, <italic>ziji</italic> cannot delete.</p>
<p>There is nothing to exclude Ø<sub>topic</sub> from the embedded object position in Chinese. The embedded object can be topicalized and deleted in accordance with the TNPDR. When this happens, we have an embedded null object referring to a discourse entity, as in (10A) below.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>(10) <italic>Q</italic>: Lisi renshi Lao Wang<sub>i</sub> ma?</p>
<p>    Lisi know Lao Wang Q</p>

<p>    Zhangsan say Lisi not know</p>
<p>    * ‘Zhangsan says Lisi does not know <italic>e</italic><sub>i</sub>.’</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>English does not have bare reflexives, let alone Ø<sub>ziji</sub>. English does not allow the TNPDR, which is crucial to the derivation of Ø<sub>topic</sub>. Therefore, Ø<sub>topic</sub> does not exist in English.</p>
<p>The English <italic>he</italic>/<italic>him</italic> and the Chinese <italic>ta</italic> are both D-pronouns in terms of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0267658312437629">Noguchi (1997)</xref>, which can refer to either the matrix subject – referential as in (3) above or quantified as in (11) below – or a discourse entity.</p>

<title>III L2 acquisition of overt and null arguments: Existing studies</title>
<p>The interpretation of overt and covert embedded subjects has been investigated in Spanish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0267658312437629">Lozano, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0267658312437629">Pérez-Leroux and Glass, 1997</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0267658312437629">1999</xref>) and Japanese (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0267658312437629">Kanno, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0267658312437629">Marsden, 1998</xref>). An important focus of these studies is the acquisition of the Overt Pronoun Constraint (OPC): i.e. the overt pronoun can take a referential matrix subject as a possible antecedent but not a quantified one. Treated as a universal principle, the OPC is used to test Universal Grammar access in second language acquisition in these studies. Several subsequent studies raise doubts about the universality of the OPC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0267658312437629">Gürel, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0267658312437629">Ojima, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0267658312437629">Yamada, 2005</xref>). These studies indicate that the overt pronoun in an embedded argument position cannot refer to the matrix subject in Turkish or Japanese, whereas the null element can, whether the matrix subject is quantified or referential. The null element in these studies is analysed as <italic>pro</italic>. The interpretation of the overt pronoun and <italic>pro</italic> in native grammars and L2 grammars are explained through parameterized governing categories or Distributed Morphology. I note that the OPC does not hold in Chinese. Like the English <italic>he</italic>, the Chinese pronoun <italic>ta</italic> can refer to both a referential matrix subject (as in (3)) and a quantified matrix subject (as in (11)). This makes Chinese different from the languages discussed in the studies above. The distinction between the referential matrix subject and the quantified one is not important to the L2 study of the interpretation of <italic>ta</italic> and the null element in Chinese. Most of the studies above only research the subject position except for <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0267658312437629">Yamada (2005)</xref>. Nonetheless, the subject–object asymmetry in Chinese noted in this article is not reported in Yamada’s study. I will not introduce these studies in detail here, as they do not inform the current study directly.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0267658312437629">Yuan (1993)</xref> researches if null arguments are allowed in L2 Chinese grammars of English speakers at different states through an Acceptability Judgment task. The results indicate that English-speaking learners accept both null subjects and null objects from a very early stage onwards.</p>

<title>IV The experiment</title>

<title>1 Research questions and hypotheses</title>
<p>To the best of my knowledge, there is no study investigating if overt and covert arguments are properly represented and interpreted in L2 Chinese. This study aims to go some way in addressing this lacuna. It focuses on the embedded argument positions. In line with the proposal in Section II, null elements in these positions are either Ø<sub>ziji</sub> or Ø<sub>topic</sub>. With Ø<sub>ziji</sub> being a purely syntactic category, Ø<sub>topic</sub> involving syntax–discourse external interface and the interpretation of <italic>ta</italic> involving lexicon–syntax and syntax–semantics internal interfaces, it is an interesting study for the IH. Specifically, this article intends to answer the following questions:</p>
<list id="list1-0267658312437629" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Can English-speaking L2 learners interpret <italic>ta</italic> in the embedded argument positions in the same way as native Chinese speakers?</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Can they acquire Ø<sub>ziji</sub> as a defective goal?</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Can they acquire Ø<sub>topic</sub> and represent it as deletion of the topicalized subject/object under identity with the chain topic of the topic chain (i.e. as a piece of old information in the discourse)?</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>The Chinese <italic>ta</italic> is a D-pronoun that can refer to either the matrix subject or the discourse entity. Such interpretation results from the lexical–syntactic structure of <italic>ta</italic>. The study is not concerned with any pragmatic constraint for the interpretation of <italic>ta.</italic> Therefore, its interpretation does not involve external interfaces here (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0267658312437629">Tsoulas and Gil, 2011</xref>). At most it involves lexicon–syntax and syntax–semantics internal interfaces. According to the IH, internal interfaces are acquirable. English-speaking learners are expected to have no problem interpreting <italic>ta</italic>.</p>
<p>Null pronouns are syntactically impossible in Chinese. L2 learners are expected to acquire this purely syntactic knowledge. Similarly, Ø<sub>ziji</sub> is expected to be acquirable, as its derivation is purely syntactic.</p>
<p>An important prediction of the IH is that the syntax–discourse interface categories may never be completely acquired by L2 learners. If this prediction holds, Ø<sub>topic</sub> should be subject to incomplete acquisition, because its derivation involves the syntactic computation of topicalization as well as the discourse notion of topic chain and thus is a syntax–discourse interface category. The acquisition of Ø<sub>ziji</sub> and the incomplete acquisition of Ø<sub>topic</sub> should hold true of both the embedded subject position and the embedded object position.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0267658312437629">
<title>2 Participants</title>
<p>Thirty-nine English-speaking learners and 16 native speakers of Chinese participated in the experiment. None of the native speakers had a high level of English proficiency. English-speaking learners were chosen for the following reasons. The English <italic>he</italic>/<italic>him</italic> and the Chinese <italic>ta</italic> can both refer to the matrix subject and a discourse entity due to its lexical–syntactic structure. If the IH about internal interfaces holds, English-speaking learners will have no problem interpreting <italic>ta</italic> in a native-like manner. If it is not borne out, they will not interpret <italic>ta</italic> correctly despite the similarity between English and Chinese in this regard. Unlike Chinese, English does not allow null elements in the sentence positions under investigation. With Ø<sub>ziji</sub> belonging to pure syntax and Ø<sub>topic</sub> to the syntax–discourse interface, it is interesting to see if both are acquirable by English-speaking learners. The learners were mainly from universities in Beijing, attending Mandarin Chinese programmes. All the L2 learners started learning Chinese in a non-Chinese environment and had spent a certain period in China by the time of the experiment. They were divided into two groups based on the results of a cloze test: high-intermediate (HI) and advanced (AD). Detailed information on each group is presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0267658312437629">Table 1</xref>. A one-way ANOVA test reveals significant group effects in terms of proficiency (<italic>F</italic>(2, 52) = 153.878, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001). Post-hoc Games–Howell tests show that the learner groups differ significantly from each other and from the native Chinese group. Although the IH was proposed with near-native L2 speakers in mind, it has been argued above that L2 development should also be considered to fully test the hypothesis that long-term and residue problems of L2 learners exclusively lie in external interfaces.</p>

<title>3 Materials</title>
<p>The participants were required to complete three tasks: a proficiency cloze test, a written interpretation task (WIT) and a picture judgment task (PJT). Although the results from the WIT are not reported, it is worth noting that they are generally consistent with those from the PJT.</p>
<p>The PJT consisted of 36 context-providing pictures, each accompanied by four sentences to be marked on a scale ranging from –2 to 2 (from ‘completely untrue to the picture’ to ‘completely true to the picture’). The option ‘I don’t know’ was used in place of the number ‘0’ on the scale, for the consideration that ‘0’ might cause confusion between ‘I don’t know’ and ‘neither good nor bad’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0267658312437629">White, 2003</xref>). An option ‘incorrect sentence’ was also included. The participants were instructed to choose this option if they thought the sentence was unacceptable. It was useful in detecting if a subject accepted the use of null elements in the embedded argument position. If null elements were not even accepted, their interpretation was out of the question. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0267658312437629">Yuan (1993)</xref>, L2 learners allow null arguments from a very early stage onwards. This option only served as a precaution. As reported in the following section, it was rarely chosen.</p>
<p>Among the 36 pictures, 12 were concerned with the current study. Two types of pictures were designed: One illustrated a situation in which the embedded argument referred to the matrix subject (termed ‘coreferential pictures’, as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0267658312437629">Figure 2</xref>); the other type illustrated a situation in which the embedded argument referred to someone other than the matrix subject (termed ‘disjoint pictures’, as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0267658312437629">Figure 1</xref>). The study reported here was part of a larger-scale study. There were a balanced number of coreferential and disjoint pictures in the task. The number of appropriate and inappropriate sentences was also balanced in the task. Both the pictures and sentences were randomized.</p>

<p>Two of the four sentences accompanying these pictures were test sentences, one of which has a null element in the embedded argument position, whereas the other one has <italic>ta.</italic> The other two sentences were distractors for the current study. Some of them had <italic>ziji</italic> in the embedded argument position. Some were simply wrong descriptions of the picture. This article will analyse eight sentence types (as in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0267658312437629">Table 2</xref>), each having three tokens. These eight sentence types were formed through the interaction of the following variables: sentence position (subject vs. object); NP type: (<italic>ta</italic> vs. null element); and reading (i.e. the type of picture: coref vs. disj). Test sentences accompanying a coreferential picture were either the same with or minimally different from those accompanying the corresponding disjoint picture. At the most, the differences between them were the names of the cartoon figures, which were given in the pictures in both English and Chinese, as shown in the sentences accompanying <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0267658312437629">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0267658312437629">2</xref>.</p>

<p>I will analyse the data from the subject position and the object position respectively to see if learners acquire the interpretation of <italic>ta</italic> and the null element in different sentence positions. I will also analyse the data of the coreferential null element and the disjoint null element respectively with sentence position as a variable to see if interfacing with discourse is the sole reason for incomplete acquisition of Ø<sub>topic</sub>, and if purely syntactic knowledge is acquirable as predicted. The sentence position should not matter in either case if IH holds.</p>

<title>a The subject position:</title>
<p>A factorial ANOVA with repeated-measures comparing NP type and reading by group shows significant effects for group (<italic>F</italic>(2, 52) = 6.204, <italic>p</italic> = .004); NP type (<italic>F</italic>(1, 52) = 31.532, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001), with higher scores for <italic>ta</italic> than the null element regarding the disjoint reading and similar scores for the two regarding the coreferential reading; and reading (<italic>F</italic>(1, 52) = 9.371, <italic>p</italic> = .003), with higher score for the coreferential reading than the disjoint reading regarding the null element and similar scores for the two regarding <italic>ta</italic>. Pairwise comparisons reveal that native speakers’ responses are significantly different from the high-intermediate learners, but not from the advanced learners. There are also significant interactions between NP type and group (<italic>F</italic>(2, 52) = 5.578, <italic>p</italic> = .006), reading and group (<italic>F</italic>(2,52) = 2.199, <italic>p</italic> = .010), NP type and reading (<italic>F</italic>(1, 51) = 26.948; <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001) and between NP type, reading and group (<italic>F</italic>(2, 52) = 6.295; <italic>p</italic> = .004).</p>
<p>The results indicate that the high-intermediate group interpret <italic>ta</italic> and the null element in a significantly different way from the native speakers, whereas the advanced learners interpret them in a native-like way. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0267658312437629">Table 3</xref> shows that both L2 groups correctly interpret <italic>ta</italic> as referring to either the matrix subject or someone else. They have no problem interpreting the embedded null subject as referring to the matrix subject. The lack of difference between the learner groups and the NS (native speaker) group regarding the readings of <italic>ta</italic> and the coreferential reading of the null element is confirmed statistically by one-way ANOVA tests. Although L2 learners do not distinguish <italic>ta</italic> and the null element regarding the coreferential reading, they do so regarding the disjoint reading at the HI state. The difference between HI and NS noted above seems to lie in the disjoint reading of the null element. A one-way ANOVA test yields significant group effects (<italic>F</italic>(4, 86) = 7.410, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001) for Type <italic>Subj+disj Null</italic>, with post-hoc Tukey tests revealing a significant difference between NS and HI. The results indicate that learners do not acquire native-like competence until the advanced state in allowing an embedded null subject to refer to a discourse entity.</p>
<p>This is supported by individual results. I follow <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0267658312437629">Akiyama (2002)</xref> in assuming that consistency can be postulated if there are two acceptances/rejections out of three.

The other patterns are classified as ‘no acceptance’. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0267658312437629">Table 4</xref> shows that over half of the HI learners show ‘no acceptance’. The HI group does not perform at a native-like level in accepting the disjoint reading of the embedded null subject. By contrast, the majority of the advanced learners consistently accept it.</p>

<title>b The object position</title>
<p>A repeated-measures ANOVA test reveals significant main effects for group (<italic>F</italic>(2, 52) = 4.264, <italic>p</italic> = .019); NP type (<italic>F</italic>(1, 52) = 207.547, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001), with higher scores for <italic>ta</italic> than the null element regarding the coreferential reading and similar scores for the two regarding the disjoint reading; and reading (<italic>F</italic>(1, 52) = 126.167, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001), with higher scores for the disjoint reading than the coreferential reading regarding the null element and similar scores for the two regarding <italic>ta</italic>. Pairwise comparisons indicate that native speakers’ responses are significantly different from the high-intermediate learners’ (<italic>p</italic> = .001), but not from the advanced learners’. Interactions between NP type and group, reading and group, NP type and reading, and between NP type, reading and group also reach significance (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .001 for all the interactions).</p>
<p>The above results indicate that the three groups distinguish the interpretations of the null element and <italic>ta</italic> differently. The HI learners differentiate their interpretations in a way different from the other two groups. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0267658312437629">Table 3</xref> shows that the HI learners, like the AD learners and the native speakers, allow <italic>ta</italic> to refer to the matrix subject or a discourse entity. All the three groups allow the null element to refer to a discourse entity. In particular, 84.6% of the L2 learners (i.e. 22 out of 26) consistently allow the disjoint reading of the embedded null object at the HI state already. One-way ANOVAs tests produce no significant difference between the three groups on Type <italic>Obj+coref ta, Obj+disj ta</italic> or <italic>Obj+disj Null</italic>.</p>
<p>The HI group differs from the other groups concerning the coreferential reading of the null element. A one-way ANOVA test reveals significant group effects for Type *<italic>Obj+coref Null</italic> (<italic>F</italic>(2, 52) = 21.836, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001), with group differences found between HI and AD, HI and NS, and also between AD and NS. As shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-0267658312437629">Table 5</xref>, the ‘no rejection’ rate is 69.2% among HI learners, whereas 84.6% of the advanced learners consistently reject this type of sentence. The native speakers unanimously reject it. These results indicate that learners have improved significantly in rejecting the coreferential reading of the embedded null object by the AD state, although they are still not as confident as the native speakers.</p>

<p>The hypothesis made in line with the IH is borne out for the interpretation of <italic>ta</italic>. L2 learners do not have any problem interpreting <italic>ta</italic> correctly. The interpretation of <italic>ta</italic> tested here stems from the D-pronoun nature. At the most it involves lexicon–syntax and syntax–semantics interfaces (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0267658312437629">Tsoulas and Gil, 2011</xref>). It does not involve external interfaces, as no pragmatic constraint is concerned. It is also possible that transfer plays a positive role here, as <italic>ta</italic> is a D-pronoun like <italic>he</italic>/<italic>him</italic> in learners’ native language.</p>
<p>L2 learners do not have any problem relating the embedded null subject to the matrix subject. It is argued in Section II that the Chinese embedded null subject that refers to the matrix subject results from deletion of <italic>ziji</italic> as a defective goal of the matrix subject. It is possible that learners correctly represent Ø<sub>ziji</sub> in the embedded subject position from the HI state onwards. However, we cannot deny the possibility that learners may perceive the embedded null subject as a phonetically null equivalent of an English pronoun. If this is the case, we have no clear evidence to show the state at which the coreferential embedded null subject is represented as Ø<sub>ziji</sub>. As argued later, it is possible that learners are not fully aware until the advanced state that null pronouns are not allowed in Chinese. Then it is likely that only advanced learners correctly represent the coreferential embedded null subject as Ø<sub>ziji</sub>. In either case, the data support the IH that purely syntactic knowledge is acquirable. As argued in Section II, null pronouns are syntactically impossible. In addition, Ø<sub>ziji</sub> is a purely syntactic category. We may make the following assumption of the representation of embedded Ø<sub>ziji</sub> subject at least in advanced L2 Chinese grammars in line with my proposal in Section II. The bare reflexive <italic>ziji</italic> with unvalued φ-features moves and head-adjoins to C to have its φ-features valued. Its φ-features are valued at C by agreeing with the matrix subject. At PF, the features of <italic>ziji</italic> constitute a subset of those of the matrix subject and thus <italic>ziji</italic> is phonetically suppressed.</p>
<p>I argued in Section II that Ø<sub>topic</sub> contributes to the disjoint reading of the embedded null subject. This type of null element is derived from the deletion of a topicalized embedded subject under identity with the chain topic of the topic chain. As its derivation involves both the syntactic computation and the discourse notion of topic chain, it is a syntax–discourse interface category and is hypothesized to be vulnerable to fossilisation according to the IH. This hypothesis is not supported by the data here: The L2 learners successfully take a discourse entity as the referent of the embedded null subject at the advanced state. However, they fail to do so at the HI state. This supports the claim that syntax–discourse interfaces may be prone to delays but they are ultimately acquirable (see, amongst others, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0267658312437629">Rothman, 2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0267658312437629">2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0267658312437629">Slabakova and Ivanov, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>In line with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0267658312437629">Sorace (2011)</xref>, there may be two accounts for the difficulties L2 learners have with Ø<sub>topic</sub>: the processing resources account and the representational account. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0267658312437629">Sorace and Filiaci (2006)</xref> propose that the acquisition of interface categories requires not only the relevant syntactic and discourse knowledge but also learners’ ability to coordinate the two. Thus it may be argued that it is too demanding in terms of processing for high-intermediate learners to integrate the syntactic computations of the sentence and the discourse knowledge of the topic chain. I will come back to a possible representational account later.</p>
<p>L2 learners do not correctly reject the coreferential reading of the embedded null object until the advanced state. L2 learners may have considered the embedded null object as a null <italic>ziji</italic> or <italic>ta</italic> at earlier states (for details, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0267658312437629">Zhao, 2008</xref>). At the HI state, L2 learners are still in the process of acquiring the knowledge that a null <italic>ziji</italic> or <italic>ta</italic> is not allowed in the embedded object position, resulting in the optionality. I argued in Section II that case clash rules out the possibility of Ø<sub>ziji</sub> in the embedded object position. Null pronouns are not allowed in Chinese, as Chinese T/v does not have a D feature. Thus the disallowance of Ø<sub>ziji</sub> or null pronouns here is due to purely syntactic reasons. The fact that L2 learners eventually reject the coreferential reading of the embedded null object are consistent with the IH that pure syntax is acquirable.</p>
<p>Learners allow the embedded null object to refer to a discourse entity at both HI and AD states. This shows that learners have acquired Ø<sub>topic</sub> in the embedded object position by the HI state. As discussed above, Ø<sub>topic</sub> is not acquired in the embedded subject position until the advanced state. The fact that Ø<sub>topic</sub> as a syntax–discourse interface category is eventually acquired in both positions supports <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0267658312437629">Yuan’s (2010)</xref> claim that problems with interface categories may not be domain-wide. More importantly, sentence position is an important factor in the acquisition of Ø<sub>topic</sub>. It is acquired later in the subject position than in the object position. Why is this so? The processing account alone as proposed above obviously cannot account for this, as the processing of Ø<sub>topic</sub> involves the integration of multiple types of information in both positions. I argue below that the divergence between the two positions further supports <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0267658312437629">Yuan’s (2010)</xref> claim that interface vulnerability may not be domain-wide. Rather, we need to consider different variables, such as crosslinguistic influence and input. In this case, we even need to take a variable-dependent approach in dealing with the same interface category.</p>
<p>As proposed in Section II, Ø<sub>topic</sub> is derived from deletion of the topicalized element as a piece of old information in the discourse in compliance with TNPDR. In this sense, the successful representation of Ø<sub>topic</sub> takes topicalization and TNPDR as two prerequisites. The derivational difference of Ø<sub>topic</sub> in the two positions lies in the element that is topicalized: the embedded subject vs. the embedded object.</p>
<p>Both English and Chinese allow the topicalization of the embedded object, as in (12).</p>

<p>    Zhangsan, Lisi thinks that Wangwu knows.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>By contrast, Chinese diverges from English regarding subject topicalization. Chinese allows the matrix subject <italic>Zhangsan</italic> to be topicalized as in (13a), whereas the topicalization of <italic>John</italic> crashes the English sentence in (13b). This difference between English and Chinese can be explained in line with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0267658312437629">Rizzi and Shlonsky (2007)</xref>, who propose that an element cannot be moved out once it has been moved to the subject position (i.e. Spec- TP in the framework adopted in this article) during computation. As assumed in this article, the Chinese subject moves to a position (i.e. Spec-CP) other than the usual subject position and thus allows subject topicalization. This is also true with Chinese embedded subjects, as in (13c).</p>

</disp-quote></p>
<p>The <italic>that</italic>-trace effect exists in the topicalization of English embedded subjects. The embedded subject can only be topicalized when there is no complementizer <italic>that</italic>, as in (14). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0267658312437629">Zhao (2008)</xref> argues that the embedded subject moves to Spec-CP when <italic>that</italic> does not exist. It moves to Spec-TP otherwise, where it gets frozen.</p>

</disp-quote></p>
<p>The comparison between English and Chinese regarding topicalization points to a possibility that crosslinguistic influence may have contributed to the difference between the subject position and the object position in the acquisition of Ø<sub>topic</sub>.</p>
<p>It is possible that L1 transfer may have positively influenced L2 grammars in terms of the embedded object topicalization. Consequently, L2 learners allow the topicalization of the embedded object from the very beginning. This speculation is supported by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0267658312437629">Yao (2007)</xref>, who finds that English-speaking learners are aware that an embedded object in Chinese can be topicalized as early as the beginners’ state.</p>
<p>In comparison with object topicalization, the influence L2 learners possibly get from their native language is more complex and thus may be more confusing regarding subject topicalization. An English subject moves from Spec-vP to Spec-TP, and thus cannot be topicalized either when it appears in a matrix clause or when it appears in an embedded clause with the complementizer <italic>that</italic>. An English subject moves from Spec-vP to Spec-CP, and can be topicalized only when it appears in an embedded clause without <italic>that</italic>. In this sense, the Spec-vP to Spec-CP movement prevalent in the target language is restricted in learners’ native language. It may be possible that learners initially only move the subject from Spec-vP to Spec-TP, and this is not fully expunged until the advanced state. This is possibly due to L1 transfer, as the Spec-vP to Spec-TP movement exists in English, but not in Chinese. However, restricted as it is, the Spec-vP to Spec-CP movement exists in English. It is not clear why this type of movement is not transferred to L2 Chinese grammars. Alternatively, the Spec-vP to Spec-TP movement of the embedded subject may be a developmental stage that all L2 learners of Chinese go through. Learners of different language origins need to be tested in order to see if this assumption holds. The Spec-TP position freezes the subject, and further extraction becomes impossible (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0267658312437629">Rizzi and Shlonsky, 2007</xref>). Therefore, learners may initially disallow the topicalization of the embedded subject, which leads to delay in their acquisition of Ø<sub>topic</sub> in the embedded subject position.</p>
<p>Processing difficulties may also contribute to the later acquisition of Ø<sub>topic</sub> in the embedded subject position. Even after learners become aware that the Chinese subject occupies Spec-CP, they may be still faced with added difficulty in processing Ø<sub>topic</sub> in this position, as they need to integrate a newly established syntactic derivation and discourse information. By contrast, the acquisition of Ø<sub>topic</sub> in the embedded object position requires the integration of discourse information and syntactic derivation that is acquired early due to positive L1 transfer. It is not surprising that Ø<sub>topic</sub> is easier to acquire in the embedded object position than in the embedded subject position.</p>
<p>I argued above that crosslinguistic difference may have contributed to the representational and/or processing difficulties of Ø<sub>topic</sub> in the embedded subject position. Below I argue that the nature of input may be another factor that causes the delay.</p>
<p>Two types of positive evidence may possibly trigger the awareness of subject movement from Spec-vP to Spec-CP. First, learners may notice that matrix subjects can be topicalized in Chinese – as in (13a) above – which may trigger learners to become aware that the matrix subject is not in Spec-TP in Chinese. Second, the following evidence may also serve as a trigger. Unlike English, Chinese allows complex reflexives to appear in embedded subject positions, as in (15):</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>(15) Zhangsan renwei <italic>taziji</italic>  shi ge tiancai.</p>
<p>  Zhangsan think  himself be  CL genius</p>
<p>  * ‘Zhangsan thinks that <italic>himself</italic> is a genius.’</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The word <italic>taziji</italic> ‘himself’ in (15) refers to the matrix subject <italic>Zhangsan</italic>. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0267658312437629">Chomsky (2008)</xref> suggests that the Binding Principle A can be explained as a case of Agree. Although I do not go into details about Agree between <italic>Zhangsan</italic> and <italic>taziji</italic>, I argue that in order for <italic>Zhangsan</italic> to probe <italic>taziji</italic>, the latter has to be seen by the former; <italic>taziji</italic> cannot be seen by <italic>Zhangsan</italic> if it is at Spec-TP. It can be seen only if it is at Spec-CP according to the PIC. It is possible that the use of <italic>taziji</italic> in the embedded subject position may provide positive evidence that the Chinese subject moves from Spec-vP to Spec-CP.</p>
<p>Neither the topicalization of matrix subjects nor the use of complex reflexives in embedded subject positions appears very frequently in Chinese. In addition, the topicalized matrix subjects can be easily mistaken for subjects. In written Chinese, although a comma as in (13a) above or a topic marker such as <italic>a</italic> in (16) below can be used to mark <italic>Zhangsan</italic> as a topic, not all topics are followed by them. In spoken Chinese, some Chinese speakers use a pause or a topic marker to mark the topic of the sentence. Nonetheless, not everybody does so. Even when a pause or topic marker is used, learners may not be able to detect it, because of its subtlety or its lack of phonological prominence.</p>

<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0267658312437629">Carroll’s (1999)</xref> proposes that adult L2 learners are not equally sensitive to every type of evidence in the input from the beginning (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0267658312437629">Yuan, 2007</xref>). Not all cues are ‘good’ cues for the L2 acquisition mechanism at a particular state. Input needs to be differentiated from intake (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0267658312437629">Corder, 1967</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0267658312437629">Carroll (2001)</xref> proposes that intake is contingent on L2 grammars. Learners’ perception of the target language is constrained not only by their conceptual models of the environment, but also by their linguistic systems. L2 language forms cannot be acquired unless they are noticed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0267658312437629">Schmidt, 1993</xref>). Although the above positive evidence exists from the very beginning, L2 grammars may not be sophisticated enough to allow learners to perceive or perceive enough of it to fully expunge their initial grammars until the advanced state.</p>

<title>VI Conclusions</title>
<p>The current study has shown that while purely syntactic categories such as Ø<sub>ziji</sub> and the internal interfaces such as the interpretation of <italic>ta</italic> are acquirable, some syntax–discourse external interface categories such as Ø<sub>topic</sub> are also acquirable, contra the IH. The findings are consistent with those of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0267658312437629">Ivanov, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0267658312437629">Iverson et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0267658312437629">Kraš, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0267658312437629">Rothman, 2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0267658312437629">2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0267658312437629">Slabakova and Ivanov, 2011</xref>. Ø<sub>topic</sub> is acquired earlier in the embedded object position than in the embedded subject position. This study provides supporting evidence to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0267658312437629">Yuan’s (2010)</xref> claim that the interfaces should not be treated holistically, and that variables such as L1 transfer and input should be considered in their acquisition. Empirically, it finds that <italic>ta</italic> and the covert element do not always share the same meaning in embedded argument positions in either the native Chinese grammar or English-speaking learners’ L2 grammars.</p>
<p>Although the present study provides some useful data regarding the acquisition of interpretation of overt and covert arguments in Chinese, a number of issues have to be investigated further in order to gain a deeper insight. The acquisition of the null elements can be further investigated by including more sentence positions, such as matrix argument positions. The current study only includes English-speaking learners, whose L1 does not allow null elements in the subject position of a finite clause or the object position. Future research might include L2 learners whose L1 allows null elements in these positions, for a deeper understanding about developmental problems and L1 transfer in this respect.</p>
