<abstract>
<p>New approaches to the definition and treatment of hypertension have increased emphasis on reducing overall cardiovascular risk and on targeting the underlying mechanisms of cardiovascular disease. During the past several decades, renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system (RAAS) activation has emerged as an important factor in the pathophysiology of endothelial dysfunction and cardiovascular disease (CVD). Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) have well-established efficacy for treating CVD, but their use may be limited by intolerable side effects, such as cough and angioedema. Angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs), a different class of RAAS inhibitors, are considered a viable alternative to ACEIs. Clinical trials have further elucidated the role of ARBs in CVD. This article reviews the mechanism of action of ARBs and selected clinical trials of ARBs in CVD.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the most prevalent cause of morbidity and mortality in the developed world, causing about one-third of all deaths in the United States,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1470320312443910">1</xref></sup> and hypertension is one of the major risk factors for CVD.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1470320312443910">2</xref></sup> Although advances in medical interventions have lowered CVD-related death rates,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1470320312443910">1</xref></sup> CVD remains a major public health concern.</p>
<p>The development and progression of CVD takes years and occurs as a continuum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1470320312443910">Figure 1</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1470320312443910">3</xref></sup> At each point within the continuum, there are opportunities to arrest or slow the progression toward CVD. The renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system (RAAS) is centrally involved in cardiovascular (CV) function along this continuum and chronic activation produces adverse pathophysiologic effects. Therefore, RAAS blockade has become a pivotal strategy to reduce adverse effects of RAAS activation in an effort to improve CVD outcomes.</p>

<title>RAAS overview</title>
<p>The RAAS involves a series of enzymatic pathways which regulate vascular tone and salt and water metabolism. Angiotensin II is the main effector peptide of the RAAS and the initiator of many pathogenic processes associated with RAAS activation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1470320312443910">4</xref></sup> RAAS inhibition can be accomplished through inhibition of angiotensin II formation as done by angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) or more distally in the cascade as done by angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs).</p>
<p>The main pathway to angiotensin II formation begins with the cleavage of the glycoprotein angiotensinogen by the enzyme renin to form angiotensin I. Angiotensin I is then cleaved by an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) to form angiotensin II, and this is the pathway targeted by an ACEI. However, after initial suppression, angiotensin II levels eventually rise during ACEI therapy because alternative pathways involving chymases and other tissue-based proteases also produce angiotensin II.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1470320312443910">5</xref></sup> In addition to preventing formation of angiotensin II, some benefits of ACEIs may be derived from the integral role of ACE in the events leading to the breakdown of bradykinin, a vasodilator with antiproliferative properties.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1470320312443910">6</xref></sup> Bradykinin acts through nitric oxide utilizing a cyclic guanosine 3′,5′ monophosphate-dependent pathway to cause smooth muscle cell relaxation. ACEIs reduce bradykinin degradation, which may have positive effects on the vasculature.</p>
<p>In contrast, ARBs act on the RAAS at the receptor level. The effects of angiotensin II are mediated through the AT (angiotensin-type) receptors, mainly AT<sub>1</sub> and AT<sub>2</sub>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1470320312443910">7</xref></sup> Stimulation of the AT<sub>1</sub> receptor is associated with the pathologic effects of angiotensin II, such as vasoconstriction, hypertrophy, inflammation, and cellular growth and proliferation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1470320312443910">7</xref></sup> Within the RAAS, AT<sub>1</sub>-receptor stimulation also inhibits renin release (by feedback inhibition) and induces aldosterone release from the adrenal gland. Further, the AT<sub>1</sub> receptor affects the sympathetic nervous system, principally by modulating norepinephrine release. In contrast, the AT<sub>2</sub> receptor appears to induce effects that counterbalance those of the AT<sub>1</sub> receptor; these favorable effects include vasodilation, inhibition of cell growth, and production of nitric oxide.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1470320312443910">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1470320312443910">8</xref></sup> ARBs selectively block angiotensin II binding at the AT<sub>1</sub> receptor, thereby reducing the negative effects associated with its stimulation, but leave the AT<sub>2</sub> receptor open to stimulation. Animal studies suggest that both of these mechanisms may contribute to the cardioprotective effects of ARBs in hypertension.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1470320312443910">9</xref></sup></p>
<p>The aldosterone receptor also plays a role in the RAAS. Initially believed to regulate only salt, water, and potassium excretion, the aldosterone receptor is now known to promote myocardial fibrosis and stimulation of the sympathetic nervous system.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1470320312443910">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1470320312443910">11</xref></sup> The aldosterone receptor can be blocked by aldosterone receptor antagonists, such as spironolactone or eplerenone.</p>
<p>ACEI therapy has been associated with favorable outcomes in CV disease.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1470320312443910">12</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1470320312443910"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1470320312443910">14</xref></sup> However, this therapy is not tolerated in 10–40% of patients, depending on disease and ethnicity. Further, the conceptual benefit of direct AT<sub>1</sub> receptor blockade, either alone or in combination with an ACEI, has led to extensive clinical trial investigation. Major clinical trials in CV disease with ARB therapy are reviewed in this paper.</p>

<title>Heart failure trials (summarized in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1470320312443910">Table 1</xref>)</title>
<p>As ACEI agents were becoming established therapy in heart failure (HF) with a reduced ejection fraction (HF-REF) at the time of ARB introduction into the market, clinical trials involving ARBs were conducted under the following clinical settings: comparisons with placebo in ACEI intolerant patients or patients not otherwise on an ACEI, direct comparisons with ACEI, or comparisons as additive therapy with ACEI. In contrast, as no evidence-based therapy exists for heart failure with a preserved ejection fraction (HF-PEF), trials comparing ARB with placebo have been performed in this patient population.</p>

<p>The first outcome comparisons of ARB and placebo were made in a subgroup of The Valsartan Heart Failure Trial (Val-HeFT)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1470320312443910">15</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1470320312443910">Table 1</xref>). Overall, Val-HeFT enrolled 5010 patients with New York Heart Association (NYHA) class II-IV HF and evidence of left ventricular (LV) dysfunction and dilation. Patients were randomized to valsartan or placebo in addition to standard therapy, and the trial included a subgroup who were not taking ACEIs (<italic>n</italic>=366, 7% of the overall cohort). In these patients, valsartan treatment was associated with non-significant 33% reduction in mortality (relative risk (RR) 0.67; 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.42–1.06) and a significant 44% reduction in the primary end point of mortality and morbidity (RR 0.56; 95% CI: 0.39– 0.81).</p>
<p>A larger comparison was undertaken in the CHARM-Alternative trial, which enrolled 2028 HF patients with ejection fraction (EF) ≤ 40% with documented ACEI intolerance (cough, 72%; symptomatic hypotension, 13%; renal abnormalities, 12%)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1470320312443910">16</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1470320312443910">Table 1</xref>). During a median follow-up of approximately 34 months, candesartan treatment significantly decreased the risk of the combined end point of CV-related deaths and HF hospitalizations by 23% compared with placebo (hazard ratio (HR) 0.77; 95% CI: 0.67–0.89, <italic>p</italic>=0.0004).</p>
<p>These two studies established that ARBs were effective therapy in HF, particularly in reducing the combined outcomes of morbidity and mortality and HF hospitalizations.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1470320312443910">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1470320312443910">16</xref></sup> Favorable effects were seen at high doses—average doses of valsartan and candesartan were 270 mg and 24 mg, respectively—and these trials were not designed to test efficacy between high and low doses. All-cause mortality effects were modest—present in the small Val-HeFT substudy but not present in the larger CHARM-Alternative study—raising concern that the benefits of ARB therapy were not equivalent to ACEI therapy since marked mortality benefit was seen in the ACEI versus placebo comparisons of CONSENSUS and SOLVD.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1470320312443910">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1470320312443910">17</xref></sup> However, there were substantial differences between the Val-HeFT substudy or CHARM-Alternative and the older studies comparing ACEI with placebo; the ACEI-intolerant patient population differed in characteristics from the overall HF population—with more females and older subjects with less atherosclerotic disease. Additionally, background therapy differed with a higher use of beta-blocker (BB) in CHARM (55%) and Val-HeFT (34%) versus SOLVD (20%), likely making a mortality effect more difficult to obtain.</p>

<p>A direct comparison of an ARB and an ACEI was undertaken in The Evaluation of Losartan in the Elderly study (ELITE I)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1470320312443910">18</xref></sup> and Losartan Heart Failure Survival Study (ELITE II)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1470320312443910">19</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1470320312443910">Table 1</xref>). Both compared the ARB losartan with the ACEI captopril. The ELITE I trial was designed to assess the effects of losartan versus captopril on renal outcomes in older patients with HF (≥ 65 years of age). While the trial did not show a difference in that primary endpoint, an unexpected significant reduction in all-cause mortality was observed with losartan. The larger ELITE II trial was conducted to replicate the mortality findings of ELITE I, using the same drugs at the same doses, but included participants with HF and EF ≤ 40% who were ≥60 years of age. However, ELITE II reported no significant difference in all-cause mortality between the groups, (HR 1.13; 95.7% CI: 0.95–1.35, <italic>p</italic>=0.16). Also, there was no significant difference in the secondary outcome of sudden death or resuscitated arrest (HR 1.25; 95% CI: 0.98–1.60, <italic>p</italic> =0.08). Of note, the average losartan in ELITE II dose was only 45mg, potentially raising concern that the losartan group did not achieve adequate levels of RAAS inhibition.</p>

<title>High dose versus low dose ARB therapy in HF</title>
<p>The results of Val-HeFT and CHARM suggested that high ARB doses were effective HF therapy. The results of ELITE II prompted concern that the dose of losartan (less than 50 mg/day) was too low to be effective, although this was a different moiety and the comparison in the former studies was with placebo. To address this potential dosing issue, the Heart Failure Endpoint evaluation of Angiotensin II Antagonist Losartan (HEAAL) study compared losartan 150 <italic>vs.</italic> 50 mg/day in subjects with a history of ACE intolerance with a primary outcome of all-cause mortality or HF hospitalization<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1470320312443910">20</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1470320312443910">Table 1</xref>). Over an average of 4.7 years’ follow-up, HEAAL demonstrated a favorable effect of the high dose losartan on the primary outcome (HR 0.90; 95% CI: 0.82–0.99, <italic>p</italic>=0.027), largely driven by a reduction in HF hospitalizations. There was an increase in renal impairment, hypotension, and hyperkalemia in the higher dose group, though the discontinuation rates were similar between the higher and lower dose groups. The results of HEAAL reinforced the need for higher ARB dosing as suggested by the CHARM and Val-HeFT trials.</p>

<title>ARB added to an ACEI in HF-REF</title>
<p>The pathophysiology of the RAAS encouraged the design of dual blockade studies as experimental data suggested that “angiotensin II escape” or “ACEI breakthrough” might be a clinically important phenomenon.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1470320312443910">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1470320312443910">6</xref></sup></p>
<p>The Val-HeFT trial examined valsartan as an additive to existing therapy versus placebo. Of the overall 5010 patient cohort, 4664 patients were treated with an ACEI<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1470320312443910">15</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1470320312443910">Table 1</xref>). Patients were randomized to valsartan or placebo in addition to ACEIs (93%), BBs (34%), diuretics, and digoxin. After a mean follow-up of 23 months, for the total cohort, the addition of valsartan did not affect mortality but significantly reduced the combined end point of morbidity and mortality by 13.2% (<italic>p=</italic>0.009). The majority of the morbidity effect was attributed to a 24% reduction in first hospitalization for HF.</p>
<p>An echocardiographic substudy of Val-HeFT reported a modest reversal of LV remodeling in patients treated with valsartan, with an average reduction in the end-diastolic diameter of 0.12 cm/m<sup>2</sup> (compared with a reduction of 0.05 cm/m<sup>2</sup> in the placebo arm).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1470320312443910">21</xref></sup> Furthermore, in a Val-HeFT neurohormonal substudy, valsartan had favorable effects on brain natriuretic peptides and norepinephrine,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1470320312443910">22</xref></sup> and sustained suppression of aldosterone was noted in patients treated with valsartan regardless of the level of background therapy.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1470320312443910">23</xref></sup> These pathophysiologic data were consistent with the hypothesized benefits from dual RAAS inhibition.</p>
<p>The CHARM-Added trial was similar in design to Val-HeFT and evaluated combination treatment with candesartan and an ACEI in 2548 patients with HF and reduced LV function.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1470320312443910">24</xref></sup> All patients were receiving treatment with an ACEI, and 55% were also receiving a BB. At 41 months, candesartan was associated with a significant reduction in the primary outcome of CV-related death or HF-related hospitalization (HR 0.85; 95% CI: 0.75–0.96, <italic>p</italic>=0.011).</p>
<p>The results from Val-Heft and CHARM-Added demonstrated benefit on combined morbidity and mortality, but not for mortality alone.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1470320312443910">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1470320312443910">24</xref></sup> Of some concern, Val-HeFT showed that the addition of dual RAAS blockade to patients receiving a BB produced detrimental effects.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1470320312443910">15</xref></sup> However, this finding was not replicated in CHARM-Added, where a benefit occurred whether or not patients were on a BB.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1470320312443910">24</xref></sup> Also, no indication of detrimental effect with triple therapy of valsartan, ACEI, and BB was found in the large post-MI VALIANT study.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1470320312443910">25</xref></sup> Whether the Val-HeFT findings of harm with triple therapy were due to chance and not a difference between different ARBs is unclear. In both Val-HeFT and CHARM, the principal beneficial effect of additive therapy was reduction in HF hospitalizations, raising the hypothesis that these events may be a marker for incomplete blockade of the RAAS.</p>
<p>A more recent study examined the addition of the ARB to ACEI therapy in patients with HF-REF on hemodialysis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1470320312443910">26</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1470320312443910">Table 1</xref>). The design compared telmisartan with placebo in a 332 patient cohort treated with either enalapril or ramipril for a mean follow-up of 35 months. The results demonstrated a strong statistical reduction for all three primary outcomes in the telmisartan group: all-cause mortality (HR 0.51; 95% CI: 0.32–0.82; <italic>p</italic> = 0.004), cardiovascular deaths, and HF hospitalization. Benefit was consistent in patients treated with a BB and was coupled with favorable remodeling data. While the size of the study would make this a preliminary result, the magnitude and consistency of the benefit should spur further research efforts to confirm the findings in a larger cohort.</p>

<title>ARBs in HF-PEF</title>
<p>Approximately half of the HF population has HF with a preserved LV ejection fraction. These patients commonly have a history of hypertension and often resulting LV hypertrophy and myocardial fibrosis. Angiotensin II is a modulator of both these processes and thus RAAS inhibition was viewed as a potentially useful therapeutic target. Two large randomized trials have compared an ARB with placebo in patients with HF-PEF. The CHARM-Preserved Trial enrolled 3023 patients with NYHA Class II through IV HF and an EF &gt; 40%<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1470320312443910">27</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1470320312443910">Table 1</xref>). Patients, with an average EF of 54%, were randomized to candesartan or placebo with a primary outcome of CV death or HF hospitalization. Concomitant medications included BBs in 85% and ACEI in 20%. Originally, this trial was designed to exclude patients on ACEI therapy since ACEI therapy was not established standard of care for patients with HF-PEF. However, after the results of the HOPE<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1470320312443910">14</xref></sup> study demonstrated benefit of ramipril in high risk patients, ACEI use was allowed and 20% of patients in CHARM-Preserved were exposed to ACEI. At a median follow-up of 37 months, there was a non-significant trend toward improvement in the primary outcome in the candesartan group (HR 0.89; 95% CI: 0.77–1.03, <italic>p</italic>=0.118), largely driven by a reduction in HF hospitalization (HR 0.85; 95% CI: 0.72–1.01, <italic>p</italic>=0.072).</p>
<p>The irbesartan in HF with preserved EF trial, I-PRESERVE, enrolled 4128 patients comparing irbesartan with placebo<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1470320312443910">28</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1470320312443910">Table 1</xref>). One-third of patients in the study were receiving an ACEI if they had compelling indications at enrollment. During a mean follow-up of 49.5 months, the primary outcome and secondary outcomes (all-cause mortality, a primary HF composite and primary CV composite) were not improved by adding irbesartan at a mean dose of 275 mg, with event rate of 100.4 per 1000 patient-years the irbesartan group and 105.4 events per 1000 patient-years in the control group (HR 0.95; 95% CI: 0.86–1.05; <italic>p</italic>=0.35). Thus, the addition of ARB therapy to other CV risk reducing medications was not beneficial in either the CHARM-Preserved or the I-PRESERVE cohort.</p>

<p>Two post-MI trials examined the direct comparison of an ARB with an ACEI.

Losartan was better tolerated with significantly fewer discontinuations compared with in the captopril group (17% <italic>vs</italic>. 23%). The mean comparison doses in OPTIMAAL were 45 mg/day of losartan and 132 mg/day of captopril.</p>
<p>The Valsartan in Acute Myocardial Infarction Trial (VALIANT) also compared an ARB (valsartan) with an ACEI (captopril) as well as both agents together with captopril alone in a three-arm study<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1470320312443910">25</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1470320312443910">Table 2</xref>). Overall VALIANT enrolled 14,808 post-MI patients with evidence of LV dysfunction, overt HF, or both with a primary endpoint of all-cause mortality. The direct ARB–ACEI comparison was valsartan 160 mg b.i.d. versus captopril 50 t.i.d. The trial included a pre-specified non-inferiority analysis as part of the statistical analysis if the superiority of valsartan compared with captopril could not be demonstrated. For the comparison of valsartan with captopril, VALIANT demonstrated that valsartan was non-inferior to captopril for the primary end point (HR 1.00; 97.5% CI: 0.90–1.11; <italic>p</italic>=0.98, <italic>p</italic> value for pre-specified non-inferiority <italic>p</italic>=0.004). There was also no difference in other CV endpoints including CV death or multiple secondary hospitalization endpoints.</p>
<p>The VALIANT study also tested whether additive therapy with valsartan 80 mg b.i.d. to captopril 50 mg t.i.d. would be superior to captopril 50 mg t.i.d. alone for all-cause mortality.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1470320312443910">25</xref></sup> The results demonstrated that combination therapy was not superior to captopril alone (HR 0.98; 97.5% CI: 0.89–1.09, <italic>p</italic>=0.73) and the combined RAAS blockade produced a higher incidence of side effects, including hypotension and renal dysfunction. Substantial doses of both ARBs and ACEIs were used in VALIANT. The average dose was 247 mg for the valsartan group, 117 mg for the captopril group, and 116 mg/107 mg for the valsartan/captopril group respectively.</p>
<p>An echocardiographic substudy of VALIANT revealed that the changes from baseline in ventricular size and ventricular function were similar for all groups.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1470320312443910">30</xref></sup> These post-MI remodeling results mirrored the clinical finding and suggested that combination therapy with valsartan and captopril offers no significant benefit over captopril alone.</p>
<p>Overall, it is reasonable to conclude that for high risk post-MI patients, as for HF-REF patients, an ARB, at least valsartan, is effective therapy when used at a substantial dose.</p>

<title>ARBs in atrial fibrillation (summarized in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1470320312443910">Table 3</xref>)</title>
<p>Basic science research has implicated angiotensin II in facilitating atrial remodeling, thereby increasing the risk of atrial arrhythmias, and experimental data suggested that RAAS inhibitors can therefore modulate the electrical and structural remodeling of the atrium. Initial trial evidence for the clinical benefit in RAAS inhibition on the prevention of atrial fibrillation prevention came from post-hoc analysis of randomized clinical trials of ACEIs for other indications. ACEIs, including enalapril in SOLVD and trandalopril in TRACE, were associated with significant reductions in atrial fibrillation, and meta-analyses including these and other ACEI trials supported RAAS inhibition for the prevention of atrial fibrillation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1470320312443910">31</xref></sup> Likewise, early clinical trials involving ARBs suggested a favorable effect on atrial fibrillation (AF).

This outcome was largely driven by a 25% risk reduction in fatal or non-fatal stroke. There was an 11% reduction in mortality and a slight excess of MI events in the losartan-treated patients. The reductions in systolic blood pressure <bold>(</bold>SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) were similar in both arms, 30.2/16.6 and 29.1/16.8 mmHg in the losartan- and atenolol-based groups respectively, suggesting that a RAAS inhibitor based therapy was more effective on outcomes than a sympathetic nervous system inhibitor based therapy independent of BP-lowering. Losartan was used in a high dose with a goal of 100 mg/day with an average dose of 82 mg. The results of LIFE were tempered to some extent by a meta-analysis noting that atenolol did not have favorable effects on outcomes in large hypertension trials.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1470320312443910">37</xref></sup></p>

<p>The Prevention Regimen for Effectively Avoiding Second Strokes (PRoFESS) trial was a 2 × 2 factorial designed trial to investigate the role of aggrenox versus clopidogrel and of telmisartan versus placebo in reducing the risk of recurrent stroke in patients who had just experienced stroke (median time from stroke, 15 days)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1470320312443910">38</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-1470320312443910">Table 4</xref>). It was the largest trial to evaluate recurrent stroke, with 20,332 patients. Patients were randomized to telmisartan 80 mg or placebo and to either aggrenox or clopidogrel and followed for 2.5 years. After two years, the telmisartan group had a non-significant lower rate of recurrent stroke versus placebo: 8.7% with telmisartan versus 9.2% with placebo (HR 0.95; 95% CI: 0.86–1.04; <italic>p</italic>=0.23). However, in a post-hoc analysis, while the event rates between telmisartan and placebo appeared similar for the first six months, the event rates appeared to diverge in favor of telmisartan after the first six months of treatment, potentially suggesting that longer term treatment with telmisartan may be needed to show clinical benefit.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1470320312443910">38</xref></sup></p>
<p>The Ongoing Telmisartan Alone and in Combination with Ramipril Global Endpoint Trial (ONTARGET)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1470320312443910">39</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-1470320312443910">Table 4</xref>) was designed to compare the ARB telmisartan, and a combination of telmisartan and ramipril, with the ACEI ramipril in patients with vascular disease or high-risk diabetes. Ramipril was chosen as the comparator drug due to its proven efficacy in a similar population in the HOPE study. The design of ONTARGET allowed for a non-inferiority comparison of telmisartan with ramipril and a superiority comparison of combination therapy and the ARB alone with ramipril. The results demonstrated that neither combination therapy nor telmisartan alone were superior to ramipril, and telmisartan met the prespecified non-inferiority criteria compared with ramipril (RR 1.01; 95% CI: 0.94–1.09; non-inferiority <italic>p</italic>=0.004). For the tolerability of the agents, permanent discontinuation occurred in 24.5% of the ramipril group, 23% of the telmisartan group, and 29.3 % of the combination therapy group. Adverse events including increased risk of hypotensive symptoms, syncope, and renal dysfunction were greater in the combination treatment group versus the ramipril group.</p>
<p>These data do not support the use of ACEI/ARB combination therapy to decrease CV events in high-risk patient populations without clinical evidence of HF. The lack of a significant benefit with the combination was similar to the VALIANT trial results, but did differ from the modest benefit seen in CHARM and Val-HeFT. The difference may be attributable to the disease state and underlying cardiovascular risk within these populations. BP was lower in the combination therapy group although outcomes did not differ, reflecting growing questioning about the benefit of lowering BP in the normotensive or only slightly hypertensive patient.</p>
<p>The Telmisartan Randomized AssessmeNt Study in ACE iNtolerant subjects with cardiovascular Disease (TRANSCEND)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1470320312443910">40</xref></sup> compared ARB therapy with placebo in a high CV risk (CVD or diabetes with end-organ damage) ACEI intolerant patient cohort (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-1470320312443910">Table 4</xref>). The primary outcome was the composite of CV death, MI, stroke, or hospitalization for HF. A secondary outcome was composite of CV death, MI, or stroke as in the HOPE study.</p>
<p>After a median duration follow-up of 56 months, there was no significant difference in the primary outcome between the groups (HR 0.92; 95% CI: 0.81–1.05, <italic>p</italic>=0.216), although the mean BP was lower with telmisartan by a mean of 4/2.2 mmHg. For the secondary outcome, which was similar to the HOPE trial, a composite of CV death, MI, or stroke, there was a nominally significant 13% reduction in the telmisartan group compared with placebo (unadjusted HR 0.87; 95% CI: 0.76–1.00, <italic>p</italic>=0.048). There were fewer discontinuations with telmisartan (21.6%) than placebo (23.8%).</p>
<p>Surprisingly, telmisartan was not superior to placebo in this ACE-intolerant group for CV outcomes. A possible explanation of these findings is that patients in the TRANSCEND trial differed from those in HOPE: ACEI intolerant populations have more females and are more ethnically diverse (particularly of Asian origin) than patients in other trials. This may contribute to a difference in outcome compared with other populations. There were other important differences between the HOPE and TRANSCEND populations, particularly in the intensity of the concomitant medications use, including BBs, antiplatelet agents, and statins. This may reflect the event differences of the placebo arm of HOPE (17.8%) versus TRANSCEND (14.8%), making it more difficult to find a favorable effect of therapy on top of considerable baseline medication usage. A possible conclusion from both ONTARGET and TRANSCEND is that while evidence exists for the effectiveness of telmisartan compared with placebo for the outcome of CV death/MI/stroke, ACEIs would, however, continue to be recommended as front-line therapy for reduction of CV events. Additionally, while the overall tolerability of ARBs remains quite good when used in target doses which have shown the best relation to reduction of CV events, the side effect profile is only modestly better than for ACEIs.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>The available evidence suggests ARBs are effective in improving CV outcomes. Their efficacy is most clearly established in congestive HF, with the strongest benefits seen in reducing hospitalizations. Combination therapy with an ACEI imparts modest additional efficacy in this group. The benefits from ARB therapy in post-MI and in high risk CVD populations are also present but additional benefit has not been proven with combined ARB/ACEI use. To obtain optimal efficacy, ARBs need to be used at high doses and when used as such, have a small tolerability advantage over ACEIs. A population of ACE intolerant patients clearly exists and benefits from ARB therapy. Overall, the benefits of ARB therapy approach those of an ACEI for CV outcomes, but ACEI should remain first-line therapy for most.</p>
