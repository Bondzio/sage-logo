<p>With the biggest sporting event in the world, the Olympic games, due to be held in the UK this year, all eyes will be on London during July and August, but of the millions of spectators watching the 10,500 athletes taking part in 26 sports, how many will appreciate the role that tribology has to play? Engineers, designers and technologists responsible for the development of cutting edge sports apparel, surfaces and equipment use their understanding of the tribology involved to enhance performance, even if they do not come from the world of more traditional tribology science. Many of these interactions include contacts with human skin, involving factors such as non-linear strain behaviour, large deformations and effects due to temperature and moisture; but other interactions such as ball–equipment and shoe–surface bring their own challenges. Generally speaking, the focus of these sports products is on high performance, especially at elite level, but other issues such as comfort, safety and cost, both economic and environmental, all have a part to play.</p>
<p>We are very pleased to have been given the opportunity to be Guest Editors on this Special Issue, which includes a variety of fascinating studies that demonstrate the impact that tribology engineering has on improving the understanding of how different products perform in a sports environment and how enhanced performance can be delivered.</p>
<p>Olga Troynikov et al. present a study on the tribological interactions between sportswear and skin, looking specifically at textiles used in apparel that has a negative fit, inducing high strains in the material and causing pressure to be applied to the skin. The issues here are further complicated due to the presence of sweat and moisture in the contacting areas.</p>
<p>Two connected studies by Franz Fuss et al. also consider human skin, but it is the interaction between the human hand and a rugby ball which is of interest; the rugby ball surface being made up of a rubber pimpled pattern. The authors examine the non-linear effects of force and velocity in the finger–ball contact, as well as how performance is related to the topography of the pimpled patterns. This research can easily be extended to other types of ball, so is of wide relevance.</p>
<p>Matt Carré et al.'s paper is the final one to address the tribology of human skin, this time in assessing different products that are thought to enhance grip in different sporting environments, such as climbing, weightlifting and throwing events. These agents work in a variety of ways to change the moisture present or alter the contact area.</p>
<p>Haake et al. consider how the frictional properties of tennis strings effect their interaction with a tennis ball in different playing situations (top spin, back spin etc.) and ultimately how the ball rebounds off the racket.</p>
<p>Finally, Clarke et al. examine another tennis-related problem, the interaction between shoes and surfaces, and specifically how roughness properties of acrylic surfaces (hard courts) affect the frictional forces on the shoe, which lead to changes in playing performance and the likelihood of injury.</p>
<p>We hope you agree that these papers show how the diverse range of tribology issues and theories can be applied to world of sport, and that you enjoy reading them as much as we have. They certainly indicate that the potential is there for researchers from a more traditional tribology background to collaborate with those working in the area of human/object interactions related to sports equipment and, indeed, across all spheres of life.</p>
