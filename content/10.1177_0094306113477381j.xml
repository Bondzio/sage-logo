<p>For over a decade, the Contested Illnesses Research Group has conducted groundbreaking research on struggles over environmental health. This volume collects their previously published research on movements targeting Gulf War-related illness, asthma, breast cancer, and toxics exposure. <italic>Contested Illnesses</italic> also adds several new introductory and concluding chapters on theory and methods. Over the years, the researchers have increasingly engaged with the advocacy groups they study through community-based participatory research. They look back on this trajectory and offer practical suggestions for researchers seeking to engage with communities and influence policy.</p>
<p>Compiling these studies in a single volume reveals several important theoretical contributions of this stream of research. The studies shed light on why scientists tend to ignore environmental causes of disease, the hurdles facing movements that challenge this tendency, and how movements can successfully shift the scientific and policy focus toward environmental health.</p>
<p>Several chapters reveal how professionals’ interests and positions contribute to a “dominant epidemiological paradigm” (DEP) that tends to neglect environmental explanations for illness. For instance, one study finds that when soldiers returned from the Gulf War with a complicated array of symptoms, researchers and clinicians initially assumed that the problems were psychological at root. This happened in part because the Department of Defense had sent many psychiatrists to the Gulf to treat PTSD; these doctors were more likely to attribute causality to psychological issues. Other researchers ignored the possibility that veterans’ symptoms might be caused by multiple exposures because their research methods were not well suited to document interacting causal factors (Chapter Six). Similarly, public health professionals designing asthma reduction programs tend to focus on the things they can change: risk factors in individuals’ homes. By ignoring air pollution and other causes beyond individuals’ control, these interventions fail to challenge structural inequalities (Chapter Seven). In both cases, professionals’ interests and positions create a DEP focused on individual factors.</p>
<p>Activists can counter this trend, shifting the DEP to include a focus on environmental causes of disease. Activists collaborated with allies in the media, scientific, and government establishment to push scientists to focus on environmental causes of Gulf War Illness (Chapter Six). Asthma activists successfully deployed grassroots organizing and environmental justice frames (Chapter Seven). Breast cancer activists secured funding for scientific studies of environmental causes of breast cancer (Chapter Nine).</p>
<p>These activists’ efforts are often hindered by scientific uncertainty surrounding environmental causes of disease. In most cases, insufficient research has been conducted. Moreover, most of these theories must be studied observationally rather than experimentally, making the results less conclusive. Lacking conclusive proof of environmental health effects, activists document exposures and draw on the precautionary principle which argues that “in the face of uncertain but suggestive evidence of adverse environmental or human health effects, regulatory action should be taken to prevent future harm” (p. 65). For instance, the authors collaborated on a study showing that students in Los Angeles schools were being exposed to potential toxins from air pollution. Although they could not conclusively prove that these exposures were harming students’ health, the research team successfully pushed the school district to change its school location and construction procedures to protect students from potential harm (Chapter Five). Similarly, scientific uncertainty made it difficult to agree on how to evaluate another school district’s switch to green cleaning products—should it be considered a failure if asthma rates did not decrease? The precautionary principle allowed researchers to “sidestep problems of demonstrating improved health outcomes in the absence of quantifiable data” (p. 184). Exposure studies and the precautionary principle are strong advocacy tools because they allow action to be taken in the face of scientific uncertainty.</p>
<p>However, collecting data in the face of this uncertainty raises ethical challenges for researchers. In one study, researchers measured people’s exposure to potentially harmful chemicals and shared the data with study participants. The lack of scientific consensus on what levels should be considered dangerous, where exposures might be coming from, and what actions should be taken, left participants unsure what to make of their results (Chapter Eight). Chapter Thirteen explicitly discusses the ethical issues associated with sharing exposure data with study participants, and Chapter Fourteen discusses the reluctance of IRBs to allow this type of data sharing. Taken together, these chapters document the power of exposure research and the precautionary principle as advocacy tools, and wrestle with the ethical implications for researchers collecting exposure data.</p>
<p>These themes arise across the chapters but are somewhat neglected in the opening section of the book. Instead, Chapters One and Two develop a typology for all health social movements, not just the contested environmental illnesses studied in the empirical chapters. This choice leaves less room to link the empirical cases together and elaborate on meso-level theories arising from the case studies. The authors argue that health social movements can be classified as access movements, constituency-based movements, and embodied health movements (EHMs). However, since they only study EHMs, the discussions of access and constituency-based movements do not draw on their data, and it is unclear how well the typology describes the field of health social movements. Moreover, the definitions of categories sometimes incorporate too many variables. When defining EHMs, they argue that these movements tend to focus on environmental causes, challenge structural inequality, and contest the DEP (Chapter Two). Building these goals and activities into the definition of EHMs discourages the researchers from treating them as variables. For instance, they do not ask why some EHMs challenge the DEP and others do not, or why a group’s focus might move toward or away from environmental causes. The choice to focus on expansive typologies is a missed opportunity in this otherwise excellent volume, and an important area for future work by this groundbreaking research group.</p>
<p>The Contested Illnesses Research Group is to be commended for their long tradition of rich empirical studies of environmental health struggles. This compilation of their research offers valuable insights for medical sociologists, scholars of social movements, and anyone seeking to engage with the communities they study.</p>
