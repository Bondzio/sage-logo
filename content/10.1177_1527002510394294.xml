<abstract>
<p>The authors use data that are collected from the 2007 season to study attendance at Nippon Professional Baseball (NPB) games. Like Major League Baseball (MLB) teams, Japanese teams set price in the inelastic portion of the demand curve, but standard explanations for low prices do not apply. The authors also find some evidence that the visiting team’s fans play a greater role in NPB than in MLB. Games in domed stadiums or between teams in different leagues also draw more fans. Finally, attendance is greater at games between better teams and games that the home team is more likely to win.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>These are the best of times and the worst of times for baseball in Japan. In 2009, Japan’s national team won its second consecutive World Baseball Championship, beating All Star teams from the United States, Cuba, and Korea. Japanese players now commonly appear on Major League Baseball (MLB) rosters. Japanese players have also won many of the major awards that MLB has to offer, and at least one, Ichirō Suzuki, is sure to win election to MLB’s Hall of Fame.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-1527002510394294">1</xref></sup>
</p>
<p>Despite the success of Japanese players on the international stage, baseball’s future in Japan is not bright. Over the past decade, attendance at a typical ballgame (<italic>yakyushiai</italic>) has stagnated, and TV viewership for the Yomiuri Giants, Japan’s most popular team, has fallen from 20% of all Japanese households to single digits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1527002510394294">Whiting, 2007</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-1527002510394294">1</xref></sup> Teams regularly lose money, and, in 2004, the losses became so severe that Nippon Professional Baseball (NPB) briefly contracted when the Orix Blue Wave merged with the Kintetsu Buffaloes. The contraction was only temporary, as the NPB added a new team, the Rakuten Golden Eagles, after a 2-day strike by players, the first and only strike in NPB’s history. This state of affairs led long-time player and manager Masaaki Mori to declare that Japanese baseball was “at a precipice” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1527002510394294">Fitts, 2005</xref>, p.151).</p>
<p>This article addresses one of the problems facing Japanese baseball—stagnant attendance—using a unique data set for the 2007 season. We analyze the data with a linear regression model adapted from studies of MLB attendance. In particular, we show that NPB teams set their ticket prices in the inelastic segment of the demand curve despite the fact that many of the reasons for doing so do not hold in Japan.</p>
<p>We also confirm the popular perception (see, e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1527002510394294">Editorial, 2004</xref>)—supported by research by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1527002510394294">LaCroix and Kawaura (1999)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1527002510394294">Yamamura and Shin (2009)</xref>—that teams in the Central League are more popular than teams in the Pacific League. Contrary to popular perception, however, the Central League’s Yomiuri Giants no longer attract unusually large crowds to opposing teams’ stadiums. Unlike <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1527002510394294">Yamamura and Shin (2008)</xref>, who use an earlier data set to show that the popularity of the Giants has driven the attendance of other teams, we show that the Giants have a relatively small impact on other teams’ home attendance. Instead, attendance rises much more when the Hanshin Tigers are the visiting team. The impact of the Tigers on attendance and the fact that the distance of the visiting team does not affect attendance suggests that visiting teams’ fans play a greater role in attendance at NPB games than at MLB games.</p>
<p>Our results show the success of two innovations. While domed stadiums have lost favor in North America, in Japan, they attract more fans than do open-air facilities. In addition, as is the case for MLB, interleague play attracts more fans to NPB games than do regular games.</p>
<p>We also show that the quality of the competing teams affects attendance. Attendance rises the closer the home team is to first place. It also rises with the winning percentage of the visiting team. Contrary to our expectations, the winning percentage of the home team and the position of the visiting team in the standings have no impact on attendance.</p>
<p>Finally, we use two different measures to analyze how the likelihood of a victory by the home team affects attendance. The first measure estimates the probability of a home-team win using an algorithm developed by the noted sabermetrician Bill James. The second measure uses the difference between the home and visiting teams’ winning percentages, as calculated in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1527002510394294">Meehan, Nelson, and Richardson (2007)</xref>. Both metrics show that attendance rises with the likelihood of a win by the home team.</p>
<p>In the next section of this article we discuss some relevant differences between baseball in Japan and baseball in North America, and we summarize earlier studies of baseball attendance. In the section on Empirical Model and Data, we present our empirical model and describe our data. Results section contains the results, and the Conclusion section concludes.</p>

<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1527002510394294">Table 1</xref> identifies the teams that make up the Central and Pacific Leagues in NPB along with some characteristics of the teams and their locations. One major difference from MLB teams is that NPB teams are identified by the company that owns them and not by the city or prefecture (roughly equivalent to a state in the United States) in which they are located. For example, the Yomiuri Giants are part of the Yomiuri media conglomerate. The Chunichi Dragons and Yokohama Bay Stars are owned by rival media companies, while a food processing company owns the Nippon Ham Fighters.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-1527002510394294">3</xref></sup></p>

<p>NPB faces several problems similar to those confronting MLB. Like MLB, NPB must deal with disparities in on-field and off-field performance. The data in the sixth column of <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1527002510394294">Table 1</xref> indicate that Tokyo’s Yomiuri Giants and Osaka’s Hanshin Tigers are by far the most popular teams in NPB, as they alone account for more than one fourth of total attendance at NPB games. Surveys cited in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1527002510394294">Yamamura and Shin (2009)</xref> show that Giant fans predominate in most of the prefectures in Japan. Yamamura and Shin use this finding as evidence that attendance at NPB games is driven by the popularity of the Giants. Because of the Giants’ greater popularity and deeper pockets, Whiting claims that the Giants have often dictated policy to the rest of NPB.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-1527002510394294">4</xref></sup></p>
<p>Adding up attendance by league shows that teams in the Central League drew almost 6,500 more fans per game than teams in the Pacific League. This amounts to almost a half million more customers over the course of a season. This supports earlier work by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1527002510394294">LaCroix and Kawaura (1999)</xref>, who claim that the Central League drew 45–50% more fans each season from 1958 to 1993. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1527002510394294">Yamamura and Shin (2008)</xref> attribute the Central League’s popularity to the fact that the Giants play in the Central League.</p>
<p>While Central League teams, particularly the Giants and Tigers, are generally more popular, they are not necessarily better. Pacific League teams have won half the Japan Series championships, the Japanese equivalent of the World Series, since 1980. Moreover, when one measures competitive balance by comparing the actual dispersion of winning percentages with the “ideal” dispersion (if all teams had an equal chance of winning each game), the Pacific League has been far more balanced in recent years.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-1527002510394294">5</xref></sup> The fact that the Central League draws so many more fans despite winning no more championships and having worse competitive balance reinforces the claims of earlier papers that loyalty to a particular team—and not just the desire to see well-played or competitive baseball—might be driving attendance in Japan.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1527002510394294">
<title>Previous Studies of Attendance</title>
<p>Economic studies of North American sports have shown that a variety of factors affect attendance at sporting events. These factors include the presence of superstars (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1527002510394294">Berri &amp; Schmidt, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1527002510394294">Hausman &amp; Leonard, 1997</xref>), the fallout from work stoppages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1527002510394294">Schmidt &amp; Berri, 2004</xref>), the construction of a new stadium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1527002510394294">Clapp &amp; Hakes, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1527002510394294">Leadley &amp; Zygmont, 2005</xref>), and changes in competitive balance.</p>
<p>“Competitive balance” exists when competing teams are equally likely to win. Balance is typically measured in one of two ways.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-1527002510394294">6</xref></sup> One can view balance as an equal chance of winning a league or division championship. Imbalance exists when one team consistently emerges as champion, even if the teams had very even records. Alternatively, one can view balance as an equal chance of winning a given game. Here, a league would be balanced if teams had very even records, even if one team consistently emerged as champion. Since <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1527002510394294">Neale (1964)</xref>, most studies of attendance have used the latter measure of competitive balance, which has developed into the uncertainty-of-outcome hypothesis. This hypothesis states that fans prefer to see a game when the result is not a foregone conclusion. According to the hypothesis, while home-team fans want to see their team win, they are less likely to attend a game when a victory is certain.</p>
<p>Studies of game attendance, however, do not uniformly support the uncertainty-of-outcome hypothesis. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1527002510394294">Borland and MacDonald’s (2003)</xref> survey of sports attendance notes that “there is little evidence to support the idea that attendance is higher when a ‘close’ contest is expected.” For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1527002510394294">Buraimo and Simmons (2009)</xref> find no support for the hypothesis in their study of the Spanish Football League.</p>
<p>In contrast, the studies of baseball confirm the uncertainty-of-outcome hypothesis. The four studies of MLB that Borland and MacDonald cite all show that attendance peaks when the home team has about a 60% chance of winning. The finding that MLB home attendance peaks at this point is robust to a variety of specifications of this probability. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1527002510394294">Knowles, Sherony, &amp; Haupert (1992)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1527002510394294">McDonald and Rascher (2000)</xref> both use ex-ante betting odds to estimate the probability of a home win. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1527002510394294">Whitney (1988)</xref> predicts a team’s likelihood of winning with a simulated winning percentage derived from regressing winning percentages in a given month on winning percentages in previous months.</p>
<p>In a study of MLB game attendance, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1527002510394294">Meehan et al. (2007)</xref> use a slightly different metric of outcome uncertainty. They measure the uncertainty of an outcome for game <italic>t</italic> with two variables. They compute the degree to which the home team will dominate a given contest as the difference between the home teams’ and visiting teams’ winning percentages prior to the game.<disp-formula id="disp-formula1-1527002510394294">

</disp-formula>Consistent with previous studies, Meehan et al. find that WINDIFP% has a negative impact on home attendance. That is, a game that the home team will almost certainly win will draw fewer fans than a game with an uncertain outcome. To their surprise, Meehan et al. find that WINDIFN% does not have a statistically significant effect, meaning that fans are not turned off by the increasing likelihood that the home team will lose. They attribute this asymmetry to the home teams’ fans being attracted by the opportunity to watch a good visiting team even if it means that the home team will probably lose. They admit that their measure confounds the absolute quality of the teams with the likelihood of the home team’s winning.</p>
<p>The models detailed above, however, might not apply to attendance at NPB games. To see why, one can observe the behavior of fans at an NPB game. The crowd at a NPB game resembles a crowd at an NCAA football game. NPB fans typically occupy distinct sections of the stadium, with the home team’s fans seated along the first-base line and the visiting team’s fans located along the third-base line. The corresponding outfield seats contain each team’s <italic>ōendan</italic>, an organized cheering section that follows the team from city to city.</p>
<p>The existence of formal groups of fans who accompany the team from city to city and the relatively small size of Japan, which is about the size of California, suggest that a different model of attendance might exist in Japan. In particular, it is possible that visiting teams play a greater role in attendance than is the case in MLB. Thus, models that focus on the <italic>home</italic> team and its fans might misspecify the driving forces behind attendance at NPB games.</p>

<p>Any study of attendance faces problems with measuring quantity demanded. One potential problem stems from capacity constraints. Excess demand could exist for stadiums that cannot accommodate all the fans who are willing and able to pay for tickets. The downsizing of MLB ballparks in the last two decades has helped make sellouts—and hence capacity constraints—more common. In our sample of NPB games, only 17 of 748 possible games sold out. With only 2.25% of our observations constrained by capacity, censored variable bias is not a major problem.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-1527002510394294">8</xref></sup> We therefore use ordinary least squares (OLS) to estimate the determinants of attendance.</p>
<p>Price is also difficult to measure in studies of baseball attendance, as fans choose from a variety of seating options, each with its own quality and price. We minimize heterogeneity by choosing a particular seating option. Using individual team websites, we found the price of a reserved seat behind first base. While the configurations of facilities are not identical, and so the output is still not uniform, using one seating option makes prices comparable across facilities. An additional problem with measuring price stems from differences in the local cost of living. The price that residents of Hokkaido regard as high might seem cheap to residents of Tokyo. We account for such differences by discounting each team’s ticket price by an index that reflects local prices. Because local measures of the overall cost of living were not available, we constructed a regional price index based on the average cost of housing in the home team’s prefecture.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-1527002510394294">9</xref></sup> We set the index to 1.0 in Miyagi Prefecture, home of the Rakuten Golden Eagles, so that all prices are measured relative to Miyagi.</p>
<p>Our income measure is the income per capita in the home team’s prefecture, in thousands of Japanese yen, which we again discount by our regional price index. We measure the size of the market by including the population of the home team’s prefecture. We use prefecture-level data because they are more readily available and more relevant for a study of attendance than city-level data. As is the case with many North American teams, some Japanese teams play in stadiums that are in relatively small towns that draw fans from larger cities nearby. For example, the Hanshin Tigers play in Nishinomiya, just outside of Osaka. The final variable in <italic>X<sub>F</sub>
</italic> is the distance between the home and visiting teams’ stadiums, which we use as a proxy for the cost of traveling to see a local team’s away game.</p>
<p>The remaining sets of variables (<italic>X<sub>S</sub>, X<sub>A</sub>
</italic>, and <italic>X<sub>W</sub>
</italic>) all affect the desirability of watching a particular game. The first variable in <italic>X<sub>S</sub>
</italic> is a trend term that captures changes in interest by fans as the season progresses. If fans believe games to grow in importance as the season progresses, they will be more likely to attend games late in the season than early in the season. Alternatively, if fans become less interested, the trend term could have a negative impact. Our trend variable starts with 1 on the first day of the season and increases by 1 with each day on which a game is played.</p>
<p>The second element of <italic>X<sub>S</sub>
</italic> is a dummy variable indicating whether the game was between a Central League team and a Pacific League team. Since 2005, NPB has scheduled a limited number of interleague games each season. Because interleague games provide a rare chance to see a team from the other league, we expect the novelty these games to make them more attractive. We therefore include a dummy variable designating all interleague games. Our third element is a dummy variable that denotes whether the game was played on a weekend. We expect weekend games to be more convenient and to draw more fans.</p>
<p>
<italic>X<sub>S</sub>
</italic> also includes three variables that capture the nature of the home team’s stadium. The first one is a dummy variable to identify domed stadiums. Domes could be a particularly strong factor in Japan, as much of the summer is divided into the “rainy” and “hot” seasons. The frequent downpours of the rainy season and the extreme heat and humidity of the hot season could reduce attendance at open-air stadiums. The second variable captures the age of the stadium. Ideally, we would also include the square of the stadium’s age to capture increasing or diminishing effects of age, but the two variables are so highly correlated (.98) that we could include only the linear term. The last variable is the capacity of the stadium. Because so few NPB games sell out, capacity should not affect the ability to attend most games. It could, however, alter the availability of seats that are particularly desirable or affordable and thus affect attendance.</p>
<p>Three variables in <italic>X<sub>A</sub>
</italic> are based on <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1527002510394294">Borland and MacDonald’s (2003)</xref> claim that fans identify with successful teams. We include the winning percentage (expressed as a whole number) for both the home and visiting teams and the number of games by which each of the two teams trails the first-place team. Finally, we account for prior success by including two dummy variables that show whether the home team and visiting team made the 2006 playoffs.</p>
<p>The next variable captures the fact that fans might be attracted by individual stars rather than by successful teams. Each year, NPB names a “Best Nine” squad for each league.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-1527002510394294">10</xref></sup> We include the number of players on the visiting team who made NPB’s Best Nine team for 2006.</p>
<p>The next three variables in <italic>X<sub>A</sub>
</italic> reflect the popularity of the Central League and of its two dominant teams, the Yomiuri Giants and the Hanshin Tigers. To pick up any differences between the two leagues that might not be captured by the above variables, we include a dummy variable equal to 1 for all home games played by a Central League team. Because the Yomiuri Giants have dominated fan interest for decades, they could draw fans in other teams’ home cities. The Hanshin Tigers do not have the nationwide appeal of the Giants, but they are renowned throughout Japan for the loyalty and enthusiasm of their <italic>ōendan</italic>. We therefore include dummy variables to account for higher attendance when the Giants or Tigers appear as a visiting team.</p>
<p>We also add two variables to capture competition for fans’ time and money. The first variable is the number of other NPB teams located within a 50-km radius of the home team’s stadium. We anticipated that more teams competing for fans’ attention would, all else equal, reduce attendance for any one team.</p>
<p>The second variable is the number of J-League teams within 50 km. For many years, soccer was no more popular in Japan than it was in the United States. That began to change after FIFA named Japan as cohost of the 2002 World Cup finals. While the “J-League,” Japan’s top professional soccer league, still trails NPB in popularity, it has grown steadily and is now a serious alternative for the sports fan’s money and time.</p>
<p>The final set of variables, <italic>X<sub>W</sub>
</italic>, captures the uncertainty of the game’s outcome. We measure this uncertainty in two ways. The first measurement is the estimated probability that the home team will win the game (expressed as a whole number rather than a decimal). Because we do not have access to betting odds, we use a transformation developed by Bill James (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1527002510394294">Tippet, 2002</xref>—we refer to this specification as “James”) that converts the home and visiting teams’ winning percentages as of the <italic>t</italic>th game (WP<sub>
<italic>Ht</italic>
</sub> and WP<sub>
<italic>Vt</italic>
</sub>) into an estimate of the probability that the home team will win the <italic>t</italic>th contest of the year (Pr(<italic>H<sub>t</sub>

</disp-formula>Again, we wanted to include the estimated probability squared, but the linear term and quadratic term are too highly correlated (.96) to permit it.</p>
<p>The second measure of outcome uncertainty (which we call “Meehan”) uses <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="disp-formula1-1527002510394294">Equations 1a</xref> and <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="disp-formula3-1527002510394294">1b</xref> to compare the winning percentages of the home and visiting teams. This measure does not compute a probability per se. Instead, it compares statistics that are readily available to a baseball fan. As a result, the Meehan measure might guide fan behavior more than the probability estimated in <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="disp-formula7-1527002510394294">Equation 4</xref>. Because the Meehan measure is highly collinear with the teams’ winning percentages, we delete the home team’s winning percentage when we include it.</p>
<p>Several unique features of Japanese baseball complicate the estimation. Our first problem is that, although there are 726 observations in our data set, the team-specific variables take only 12 values, just over one third the number of values for MLB. Moreover, the teams are located in only 10 prefectures, further limiting the prefecture-specific variables. Thus, multicollinearity presents a problem. (In fact, the problem might actually be one of clustering. Unfortunately, there is no one criterion by which the observations are clustered.) Multicollinearity is particularly severe for population in the home and visiting teams’ prefectures, the number of NPB within 50 km of the home team, and the number of J-League teams within 50 km of the home team.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-1527002510394294">11</xref></sup> While multicollinearity results in biased standard errors, the estimates themselves are consistent, so we run two sets of regressions, one with the four multicollinear variables and one without them.</p>
<p>Several complications lead us to delete a number of observations from a data set that originally exceeded 800 observations. The first one results from the 2004 merger of the Orix Blue Wave, located in Kobe, and the Kintetsu Buffaloes, located in Osaka, to form the Orix Buffaloes. The team now splits its home games between Kobe (26 games) and Osaka (48 games). We thus treat Kobe as the Buffaloes’ home city for 26 games and Osaka as the home city for 48 games. Because the Buffaloes now have two home cities, there is no clear way to calculate how far Buffaloes’ fans travel for away games. As a result we omit the team’s away games from the sample (68 observations in all).</p>
<p>In addition, NPB teams play several “home” games each season in remote cities. For example, the Yomiuri Giants sometimes play home games in the Sapporo Dome, home of the Nippon Ham Fighters on the northern island of Hokkaido, and in Yahoo Dome, home of the Softbank Hawks in Fukuoka on the southern island of Kyushu. These games are a vestige of an earlier era, when teams were largely located in Tokyo and Osaka prefectures. During this period, the Giants were an even more dominant franchise than they are today. To solidify their status as “Japan’s Team,” the Giants would play several regular-season games in cities throughout Japan. As a gesture to their remaining fans in these outlying areas, the Giants still play some home games in other teams’ stadiums. In addition, the Fighters play a few “home” games in Tokyo, where they played before moving to Hokkaido. Finally, several teams play home games in cities that have no NPB teams at all. Because these games, of which there are 28 in our sample, involve demographics that are completely divorced from the teams’ standard games, we delete them from our data set.</p>
<p>The estimation uses a data set that we created for the 2007 NPB season. To our knowledge, this is one of the few data sets to chart an entire year of NPB contests. Data on attendance and team performance come from daily reports in Japanese language newspapers. Our measure of prefectural income is from the <italic>Japan Statistical Yearbook</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1527002510394294">Statistics Bureau, 2008</xref>). Information on the individual stadiums comes from “Stadiums in Japan” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1527002510394294">World Stadiums, 2009</xref>). Means of the variables appear in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1527002510394294">Table 2</xref>.</p>

<p>The parsimonious results show no price effects and negative income effects for both the James and the Meehan specifications. The full results show negative price effects and positive income effects, which indicates that the parsimonious specification suffers from omitted variable bias. Using the mean values for ticket prices and attendance, the price coefficients translate to an own-price elasticity of demand that ranges from −0.13 to −0.14. At first glance, this seems to defy economic logic, as basic theory predicts that firms should never set their prices in the inelastic range. These estimates, however, are close to those estimated by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1527002510394294">Fort and Rosenman (1999)</xref> and greater than those in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1527002510394294">Winfree, McCluskey, Mittelhammer, and Fort (2004)</xref> for MLB. Estimates of demand for attendance at MLB have consistently been in the inelastic range since <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1527002510394294">Noll (1974)</xref>.</p>
<p>As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1527002510394294">Fort (2004)</xref> notes, the marginal costs associated with staging a baseball game are so low that the optimal ticket price should be roughly where the elasticity of demand equals −1.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn14-1527002510394294">12</xref></sup> Fort points out that teams might have an incentive to charge ticket prices that are “too low” if they have substantial media revenues or if they have other revenue streams that are closely related to attendance, such as parking or concessions. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1527002510394294">Coates and Humphreys (2007)</xref> amplify and empirically verify that concession revenue can lead teams to set prices in the inelastic region of the demand curve.</p>
<p>Neither of the above explanations justifies the low elasticity of demand for attendance at NPB games. NPB merchandising lags badly behind MLB, in part because the teams cannot agree on a league-wide merchandising strategy. Aside from the Giants and Tigers, teams do not generate much concession revenue. Furthermore, because Japanese fans largely use mass transit, parking revenue is essentially zero. Finally, only the Giants have ever made significant television revenue, and—as noted above—their audience is lower than it once was.</p>
<p>The explanation for NPB teams’ setting prices below the profit-maximizing level more likely stems from the organizational structure of the sport. The teams are subsidiaries of their parent organizations and, by and large, have been treated as a form of advertising. The goal of the team is thus not to generate profits but to generate exposure, which, in part, comes from maximizing attendance rather than gate revenue.</p>
<p>A less positive explanation comes from Robert Whiting, who notes that, “[T]he franchises were operated largely by officials temporarily dispatched from the parent company who knew little about baseball and, in some cases, even disliked the sport.” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1527002510394294">Whiting, 2004</xref>, p. 90) It is thus possible that the pricing decisions might not be part of any overarching strategy, such as profit maximization.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn15-1527002510394294">13</xref></sup></p>
<p>Finally, one should bear in mind that this elasticity is an overall market measure that might not apply to any one team. Estimating a team-specific elasticity requires a longitudinal study of the relationship between attendance and price for that team.</p>
<p>Income has an insignificant impact on attendance in columns 1 and 3 and a small, positive effect in columns 2 and 4. Again evaluating the full specifications at the mean, the income elasticity of demand for attending a baseball game is about 0.14, which suggests that attending a baseball game is a normal good in Japan. Population in the home team’s prefecture has a negative impact on attendance. This could reflect the greater availability of competing leisure activities in large prefectures, but a conclusive evaluation of this impact is beyond the scope of this article. The population in the visiting team’s prefecture has no effect.</p>
<p>The home team’s distance from the visiting team’s stadium does not affect attendance, though the findings for the Meehan specification in columns 3 and 4 are very close to significant at the 10% level. If the demand for baseball (as measured by attendance) is downward sloping, then the coefficient should be negative and significant because attending nearby visiting games is less costly. We see three possible explanations. First, the result could reflect the loyalty of the teams’ <italic>ōendans</italic>, which accompany their teams wherever they play. Second, the distances between franchises in Japan are not as large as in North America, so the cost of travel might be lower. Finally, the Tokyo and Osaka areas are both dominated by a single franchise, the Giants and the Tigers. The other teams in the area might not have a large enough <italic>ōendan</italic> to affect attendance.</p>
<p>The trend variable, which tracks the progress of the season, consistently adds about 30 fans per game, regardless of the specification. Interleague and weekend games also have a similar impact across specifications. Interleague games typically add a little over 2,000 fans, while weekend games add in excess of 5,000 fans.</p>
<p>The impact of domed stadiums varies with specification. They do not affect attendance in the smaller specifications but add about 2,000 fans in the full specifications. The age of a stadium does not affect attendance. This finding runs counter to the “honeymoon” effect detected in MLB, probably reflecting the fact the Tigers, who drew the most fans in 2007, played in 87-year-old Koshien Stadium, the oldest stadium in NPB, while the Giants, who drew the second-most fans, play in the Tokyo Dome, which is 20 years old. Capacity has a consistently positive effect, adding from 0.6 to 0.9 fans per additional seat.</p>
<p>Winning percentage has a consistent impact on attendance across the different specifications. The home team’s winning percentage has no impact on attendance in the James specification. Because the positive and negative winning differentials at the center of the Meehan specification are linear functions of the home and visiting winning percentages, we cannot include all four variables. Based on our result for the James specification, we deleted the home team’s winning percentage. The visiting team’s winning percentage increased attendance by 19 to 24 additional fans per percentage point increase in winning percentage. This means a team’s improving from winning 50% of its games to 60% of its games (an increase of 100 points as winning percentages are expressed) increases attendance by about 2,000 fans.</p>
<p>The impact of a team’s relative position in the standings has a very different pattern. An increase in the number of games by which the home team trails the first-place team reduces attendance by 180 to 280 fans. In contrast, the relative position of the visiting team has no impact on attendance.</p>
<p>Our final measure of team performance, whether the teams played in the 2006 postseason, is almost uniformly significant. The home team drew 5,500–6,500 more fans if it had made the 2006 playoffs. It drew over 1,000 more fans if the visiting team did so. In contrast, individual stars do not affect attendance. The number of “Best Nine” players on the visiting team has no statistically significant impact in any specification.</p>
<p>The results confirm the greater popularity of the Central League. Between 4,000 and 5,000 more fans attend a Central League team’s home game than a Pacific League team’s game. We are surprised that the Hanshin Tigers have replaced the Yomiuri as the dominant road attraction. Because the Tigers do not have the nationwide following of the Giants (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1527002510394294">Yamamura &amp; Shin, 2008</xref>), we attribute their impact on attendance to the team’s <italic>ōendan</italic>, which follows the team from stadium to stadium.</p>
<p>The impact of alternative sporting events does not have the expected effect. An additional franchise within 50 km increases attendance by 900–1,000 fans in both specifications, though the significance was borderline for the Meehan specification. An additional J-League team has no significant impact in either specification. These results could reflect population effects, as both baseball and (successful) soccer teams both tend to locate in major population centers. Additional teams would thus compete with one another over a larger pool of potential customers.</p>
<p>Both measures of the expected game outcome indicate that attendance rises with the likelihood of a win by the home team. Both the parsimonious and the full specification for the James measure show that 125–135 more fans attend with each percentage-point increase in the estimated probability that the home team will win. For example, an increase of 20 percentage points, taking a team from a 40% to a 60% chance of winning the game, results in an increase of 2,500–2,700 fans. A similar result holds for the Meehan specification. A larger “positive win differential,” which indicates that the home team is more likely to win, increases attendance, while a larger “negative win differential,” which indicates that the home team is less likely to win, reduces attendance.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Unlike MLB, which has seen unmatched prosperity in recent years, NPB faces significant dangers. Its best players are leaving for the United States, and interest in baseball, as measured by attendance and TV viewership, has declined over the last decade. The precarious state of baseball in Japan calls for careful analysis of NPB’s cost and revenue structure. This study is one step in that process, providing an analysis of attendance at NPB games.</p>
<p>Previous studies of attendance at MLB games provide a framework for analyzing attendance. Like MLB teams, NPB teams set their prices in the inelastic portion of the demand curve, but the standard explanations for why MLB teams set their prices so low do not apply to NPB teams. We identify two possible motivations for NPB teams to set prices so low. A relatively benign reason is that teams serve as advertising for the teams’ parent companies, so attendance, rather than gate revenue, is the driving factor. A more problematic explanation is that NPB teams are not competently run.</p>
<p>As expected, we find that fans want to see games between good teams. This is bad news for franchises like the Hiroshima Carp and Yokohama Bay Stars, which have regularly finished low in the standings. If the Carp and the Bay Stars were more competitive, the difference in attendance between the Central League (where the Carp and Bay Stars play) and the Pacific League would be even greater.</p>
<p>We also find that good visiting teams draw more fans. While it is possible that home fans like to see good visiting teams, it is also likely that better visiting teams bring more fans with them as part of their <italic>ōendan</italic>. The importance of the <italic>ōendan</italic> is further reinforced by the fact that the proximity of the visiting team causes attendance to increase. The results for distance provide some support for this conclusion, as more games against more distant franchises do not draw fewer fans.</p>
<p>Our results suggest several strategies that the teams and NPB as a whole could follow to increase attendance. In the short term, the league can schedule more interleague games, as interleague games have succeeded in drawing 2,000–3,000 more fans. In the long term, teams could stimulate attendance by building more domed stadiums. The positive impact of domed stadiums indicates that climatic factors play a greater role in Japan than in North America and that domes are a more viable alternative for NPB than they are for MLB. In addition, NPB could encourage secondary teams in a single market, such as the Orix Buffaloes in Osaka and nearby Kobe, to move to another city.</p>
<p>Such strategies, however, do not solve the larger problems facing NPB, such as the departure many of Japan’s top stars for MLB, the resulting decline in interest among fans, and the inability of teams to cooperate. One result of our estimation, the insignificant impact of the Giants on other teams’ attendance, might actually be good news for NPB. In the past, the importance of the Giants to other teams’ revenues, and their resulting power over other teams, has often stymied leaguewide action to promote revenues and reduce costs. If the rest of NPB no longer depends on the Giants, it might at last be able to formulate coherent leaguewide policies to deal with the threats and opportunities facing baseball in Japan.</p>
