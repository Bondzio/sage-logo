<abstract>
<p>While the literature on party switching identifies the reasons that politicians switch parties and the negative electoral consequences of doing so, it does not adequately explore why these consequences exist. To accomplish this task the authors look at citizen responses to party switching. The authors explore perceptions of Arlen Specter and his change in party affiliation during the 2010 midterm election by using original survey data gathered from residents of Pennsylvania’s 3rd Congressional District. The authors posit that the information environment created by the parties, candidates, interest groups, and the media during the election frames the switch as both principled and opportunistic. The authors find that partisanship plays a large role in the frame that is accepted by citizens and that those frames subsequently influence their views of the candidate’s favorability.</p>

<p>Arlen Specter’s decision to switch parties in April 2009 was greeted with cheers and jeers from his Washington colleagues. Democrats welcomed his arrival as the crucial 60th member of the caucus, while Republicans attempted to minimize the impact of losing a long-time member by deriding Specter as a desperate opportunist (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1532673X12439886">Kane, Cilliza, &amp; Murray, 2009</xref>). Specter’s explanation for the decision was two-fold, as he focused on ideological and electoral considerations: “Since my election in 1980, as part of the Reagan Big Tent, the Republican Party has moved far to the right. . . I now find my political philosophy more in line with Democrats than Republicans. . . I am not prepared to have my 29-year record in the United States Senate decided by the Pennsylvania Republican primary electorate” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1532673X12439886">Hulse &amp; Nagourney, 2009</xref>). Of course, the decision to leave his future in the Senate up to the Democratic primary electorate was ill-fated as well. In May 2010, Specter lost the nomination struggle to Rep. Joe Sestak by a 54-46 margin.</p>
<p>The 2010 midterm elections provided a rare and important opportunity to study a pivotal party switch. Specter’s failure to gain the nomination is consistent with literature suggesting that there is a political cost to switching parties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1532673X12439886">Aldrich &amp; Bianco, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1532673X12439886">Grose &amp; Yoshinaka, 2003</xref>). Our goal is to unpack those political costs from an unexplored angle in the literature. We examine voter response to a politician’s decision to switch parties and whether it provides some explanation for the finding that incumbent members who switch parties suffer from a loss of electoral support. In short, we address the following question: How are voter perceptions of candidates affected by party switching?</p>
<p>Our study fills a void in the literature by seeking to explain <italic>why</italic> incumbent members of Congress suffer at the polls in elections following a change in party affiliation. To accomplish this task we developed and implemented an original survey of registered voters in Pennsylvania’s 3rd Congressional District during the 2010 general election that examines attitudes toward Specter. To our knowledge this is the first survey designed by political scientists to look at perceptions of party switching in the public. Our findings show that Pennsylvania residents generally believed Specter’s decision was driven by a self-serving motivation to get reelected. Few were persuaded by his other claim that he was acting on a principled belief and could no longer remain in a party whose ideology had drifted too far from his own. However, this effect was conditioned by partisanship, with Republicans and independents more likely to believe his behavior was opportunistic rather than principled when compared to Democrats. In addition, attitudes toward Specter were tied to their beliefs about his underlying motivations, with those who believed he was engaging in opportunistic behavior having less favorable opinions of him. The results offer a more nuanced understanding of why reelection is such a difficult task for candidates who adopt a new party.</p>
<sec id="section1-1532673X12439886">
<title>A Gap in the Party Switching Literature</title>
<p>The majority of literature on party switching behavior focuses on the question of why members choose to do so. While members of Congress are typically conceived of as having multiple goals, including policy and influence, the proximate goal of reelection drives much of their behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1532673X12439886">Fenno, 1973</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1532673X12439886">Mayhew, 1974</xref>). Political parties are central to the success of members by providing a “brand name” that can be used by citizens as a heuristic to make easy voting decisions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1532673X12439886">Cox &amp; McCubbins, 1993</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1532673X12439886">2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1532673X12439886">Snyder &amp; Ting, 2002</xref>). When the brand name becomes a detriment, the member must make a calculation to abandon it in favor of the other party. Evidence of increased party switching during periods of realignment illustrates the appeal of party switching when shifting coalitions of voters change the electoral incentives of members back home in their districts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1532673X12439886">Canon &amp; Sousa, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1532673X12439886">Rothenberg, 1985</xref>).</p>
<p>While these electoral incentives increase the likelihood of party switching, others have noted the costs of leaving the party. The localized nature of the American political system makes it difficult to disconnect from a member’s district constituency. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1532673X12439886">Holt (1967)</xref> asserts, members must rely on the same group of voters, regardless of what party they belong to, in order to get reelected. Thus, members cannot avoid the potential backlash from voters in the district. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1532673X12439886">Cox and McCubbins (2005)</xref> elaborate on the list of likely costs that potential switchers must consider and find that the effect of switching parties is on average three fewer terms in the House. Among these costs, the ability to communicate the decision to constituents and the loss of campaign donors are likely to give members pause; they must also consider the strategic behavior of potential challengers in the new party. The combined potential effect of these costs is in line with the empirical evidence provided by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1532673X12439886">Grose and Yoshinaka (2003)</xref>, who find a loss of approximately 7 percentage points in all post-switch elections.</p>
<p>Of course, general election prospects are only one part of the equation. Specter’s own words suggest that he was more confident of winning in November than in the May primary. Aldrich and Bianco’s game theoretic study of party switching behavior suggests that the calculus must include consideration of both election cycles. Their work clearly fits Specter’s conundrum: “With a sufficiently strong challenger . . . the prospect of a tough nomination contest can be enough to motivate an incumbent to switch to a different party, even if it lowers his chances of winning the general election” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1532673X12439886">Aldrich &amp; Bianco, 1992</xref>, p. 109). This certainly seemed to be the case in Pennsylvania when Patrick Toomey, whom Specter narrowly defeated in 2004, announced his intention to run for the Republican nomination. Early polls suggested that Specter was in serious trouble and 2 weeks later, Specter became a Democrat.</p>

<title>Framing the Decision</title>
<p>While the literature is informative with regard to why members switch (or stay put) and the effects of the change on electoral success, a gap still exists in understanding the cause of what appears to be poorer performance in subsequent elections. While there are many potential factors, including the loss of donors and the strategic behavior on the part of challengers, we focus on voter perceptions. If voters learn of the decision to switch parties, does this alter perceptions of the candidate in a detrimental way? On what basis will voters judge the member?</p>
<p>One important factor is the way in which Specter’s decision to leave his party was portrayed, or framed, in the media. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1532673X12439886">Iyengar’s (2005)</xref> definition of framing, which “refers to the way in which opinions about an issue can be altered by emphasizing or de-emphasizing particular facets of that issue,” can easily be adapted to how campaigns might frame candidate behavior or traits. In fact, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1532673X12439886">McGraw (1998)</xref> states explicitly, “Moral justification can be considered a type of frame because the politician is attempting to redefine the parameters along which the controversy is evaluated” (p. 132). Specter’s own words defined two clear “frames” through which voters could choose to judge his choice. On the one hand, he said, “The Republican party has moved far to the right” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1532673X12439886">Hulse &amp; Nagourney, 2009</xref>), suggesting a poor ideological fit and a principled decision. On the other hand, he admitted, “My change in party will enable me to be reelected”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1532673X12439886">1</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1532673X12439886">Philips, 2010</xref>). This frame, one Specter likely regretted using, clearly demonstrates his actions were opportunistic in nature.</p>
<p>The extent to which these frames matter to voters is dependent on whether the media uses them in the coverage of the race (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1532673X12439886">Iyengar, 2005</xref>). Indeed, much of the coverage leading up to the race continued to focus on Specter’s motives. Some common descriptors in newspaper stories included: raw opportunism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1532673X12439886">Kane, 2010</xref>), naked self-interestedness, and pragmatism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1532673X12439886">Lane, 2010</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1532673X12439886">Shah, Domke, and Wackman (1996)</xref> suggest that that media-chosen frames can be important determinants of voter perceptions and vote choice. Thus, by selecting and emphasizing this particular aspect of Specter’s candidacy, as they did in this race, it is plausible that Specter’s decision cost him at the ballot box. Part of our analysis explores whether the acceptance of one frame over the other had an effect on voter perceptions of Specter. Of course, whether a frame is accepted is driven in part by the receivers (voters) predisposition to accept the frame. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1532673X12439886">Entman (1993</xref>, p. 53) notes, people willingly accept frames if it is line with their belief systems, and it can become highly salient to the voters even if it is “an obscure part” of the coverage. Upon observation of the media coverage of the campaign, the use of the opportunistic frame was anything but obscure, thus increasing the likelihood that it would be highly salient to some voters.</p>
<p>Beyond media coverage, the candidates themselves made clear use of the frames in advertising and speeches. Arlen Specter initially cited both principles and opportunism as his motivations for changing parties, but his campaign quickly dispatched with the opportunism frame as election season neared. Specter’s initial candidness came back to haunt him when his primary opponent Joe Sestak ran blistering campaign ads that contained a clip of Specter speaking in the opportunism frame. In these television commercials Specter is twice seen saying, “My change in party will enable me to be reelected” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1532673X12439886">Gibson, 2011</xref>). The commercial concludes with the indictment, “Arlen Specter changed parties to save one job . . . his . . . not yours” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1532673X12439886">Gibson, 2011</xref>). Sestak blanketed the airwaves with this advertisement and “The Switch,” as the commercial was called, won a national award from <italic>Campaigns &amp; Elections</italic> magazine in the “Toughest TV Advertisement” category (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1532673X12439886">Gibson, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>Specter’s decision to abandon the opportunistic frame may seem the logical choice, but it was not the only one available to him. Perhaps voters simply value truth and would find it refreshing for Specter to openly admit his desire to remain in office. According to McGraw, an appeal to the moral (principled) justification “can have the double-barreled benefit of persuading the public to accept an initially disliked decision as well as to shore up support for the official linked to the decision” (1998, p. 134). McGraw’s work suggests that Specter might have been able to succeed in using the principled frame to enhance voter evaluations if not for the fact that he appeared to be deceptive. While she asserts that the “suspicion [of deceptive intent] must be prompted by other people” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1532673X12439886">McGraw, 1998</xref>, p. 137), Specter played at least as large a role in fostering suspicion of himself as Sestak did, through his clear statement of the opportunistic frame when the decision occurred. By itself, this suspicion has the potential to lower evaluations by creating uncertainty about his character (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1532673X12439886">McGraw, Lodge, &amp; Jones, 2002</xref>). Also, if voters view the action as an opportunistic decision to ensure reelection as opposed to a principled decision based on ideological views, it will have differential effects on voters’ views. Given the clear choice presented by Specter, and reinforced by Sestak and the media, the survey was designed to examine the degree to which voters chose to view Specter’s decision as either principled or opportunistic.</p>

<title>Expectations About Citzen Responses to Party Switching</title>
<p>This sort of framing did not just occur in the Specter–Sestak race but can be found in many cases of party switching in which the switcher runs for reelection. Our close observation of party switching events has revealed that political parties, candidates, interest groups, and the media primarily characterize the motivations for the switch as being based on principles (ideology) or opportunism (political survival). When Representative Griffith (D-AL) became Representative Griffith (R-AL) in late 2009, a spokesman for the National Republican Congressional Committee said, “Nancy Pelosi’s decision to move her extreme agenda against the will of the American people has alienated a number of members within her own caucus. . .” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1532673X12439886">Hulse, 2010</xref>). In other words, the Democratic Party had moved to the Left and away from Representatives like Mr. Griffith. Republicans tried to cast a vision of Rep. Griffith leaving the Democrats on the matter of ideological principle. Griffith used the same reasoning in a Fox News interview discussing his switch. During the interview he declared, “The far-left tilt of the Democratic Party no longer welcomed me. I feel more comfortable in the Republican Party” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1532673X12439886">Griffith, 2009</xref>, also see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1532673X12439886">Doyle, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1532673X12439886">Kraushaar, 2009</xref>). This came immediately after a long list of bills from the Democrats’ legislative agenda that Griffith did not agree with on ideological grounds.</p>
<p>On the other side of the aisle, Representative Chris Van Hollen (D-MD), chairman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, was quoted as saying, “People don’t like finger-to-the-wind politicians” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1532673X12439886">Hulse, 2010</xref>). This is simply another way of framing Griffith as an opportunist. In addition, The <italic>Huntsville Times</italic> ran an opinion piece entitled, “Parker Griffith’s Party Switch About Self-Preservation, Not Conviction,” immediately following the switch (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1532673X12439886">Wendt, 2009</xref>). Mo Brooks, the strongest Republican challenger in the primary and eventual winner, took this theme and ran with it, much in the same vein as Sestak in Pennsylvania. Brooks’ key advertisement ended by clearly trying to frame Griffith as an opportunist by saying, “It’s time for a Congressman we can trust” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1532673X12439886">Kleefeld, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>All of this leads us to what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1532673X12439886">Christopher Beam (2010)</xref>, a journalist at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://Slate.com">Slate.com</ext-link>, called an “iron law of party-switching.” Beam warns switchers, “Make sure your switch looks ideological, not opportunistic.” While calling this an iron law is probably in the realm of hyperbole, we feel that it is key to understanding how citizens respond to party switching and the negative electoral effects seen in subsequent elections.</p>
<p>On the basis of these observations, we propose that the information environment of the election following a switch is one in which citizens are exposed to two competing frames by political parties, candidates, interest groups, and the media—a principled frame and an opportunistic frame. The switcher, the new political party, and others sympathetic to their cause (select interest groups and media outlets), advocate the principled frame. On the other hand, the abandoned party, challengers in either the primary or general election, and others sympathetic to their cause, adopt the opportunistic frame.</p>
<p>As a result of this dynamic, the general public is presented with two dominant themes, or cues, which they can use as cognitive shortcuts in the decision-making process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1532673X12439886">Downs, 1957</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1532673X12439886">Lupia, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1532673X12439886">Popkin, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1532673X12439886">Sniderman, Brody, &amp; Tetlock, 1991</xref>). In conjunction with a voting population dependent on shortcuts and frames, news media tend to cover high-profile elections using a strategic frame that attributes candidate behavior to strategic electoral concerns rather than issue and policy concerns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1532673X12439886">Patterson, 1993</xref>). To the extent that this was the case with the Specter–Sestak race, voters were sifting for cues from a confluence of attack ads and news commentary framing Specter’s switch (on balance) as opportunistic.</p>
<p>In addition to the advantages that the opportunistic frame has in this situation, the frames voters accept and the cues upon which they rely will also depend on their partisanship. When given a selection of frames, individuals have a strong tendency to engage in motivated reasoning; people accept the frame, or argument, that aligns with their prior political attitudes and party affiliation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1532673X12439886">Lodge &amp; Taber, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1532673X12439886">Taber &amp; Lodge, 2006</xref>). Republicans, viewing the event through their partisan lens, should have a strong tendency to accept the opportunism frame, despite a possibly long voting history with Specter. Conversely, Democrats have a cognitive incentive to view Specter’s change as him “seeing the light.” Theoretically, in the results of our survey concerning Arlen Specter’s party switch, we expect to see that</p>
<list id="list1-1532673X12439886" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p><italic>Hypothesis 1:</italic> Citizens identified with the Republican Party will view Specter’s switch as more opportunistic in nature.</p></list-item>

<list-item><p><italic>Hypothesis 3:</italic> Citizens who are pure independents will view Specter’s switch as more opportunistic than Democrats but less so than Republicans.</p></list-item></list>
<p>Last, we expect that these varying views on a principled-opportunistic scale will have an impact on the way that citizens evaluate the candidate. This leads us to the following expectation:</p>

<title>Data</title>
<p>The data for this analysis were generated from a random sample survey of registered voters in Pennsylvania’s 3rd Congressional District in the fall of 2010.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1532673X12439886">2</xref></sup> The phone survey was conducted at the Mercyhurst Center for Applied Politics,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-1532673X12439886">3</xref></sup> with the goal of measuring preelection public opinion on engagement, political trust, prominent issues, and voting choice heading in to the congressional election. The 635 completed surveys were conducted between September 22 and October 5, with student researchers calling from 6.00 p.m. to 9.00 p.m. on weeknights and 2.00 p.m. to 6.00 p.m. on Sundays.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-1532673X12439886">4</xref></sup> For each registered voter in the sample, a minimum of four calls were made in an attempt to reach unresponsive respondents and respondents categorized as “soft refusals” were called back.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-1532673X12439886">5</xref></sup></p>
<p>The data serve the dual purpose of public polling research for popular consumption as well as batteries that lend themselves to political science analysis.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-1532673X12439886">6</xref></sup> In addition to engagement, issues, political figure favorability, and partisanship, we also develop an original survey battery to evaluate perceptions of Arlen Specter in lieu of his party switch. The four-question battery is designed to capture whether voters attribute Specter’s behavior to principled decision making or political opportunism. The questions were prefaced with the following filter read by the interviewer:
<disp-quote>
<p>As you may have heard, Senator Arlen Specter switched from the Republican to the Democratic Party in 2009. I’m going to read a few statements about Specter. Please tell me if you agree, somewhat agree, somewhat disagree, or disagree with the following statements about Specter.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The first two survey items ask respondents to attribute whether Specter makes decisions independent of party and whether he makes decisions based on political survival. The second set of survey items focuses specifically on why Specter changed parties; respondents were asked to agree or disagree with the notion that Specter changed parties because he was principled or because he was concerned about reelection. In each case, a response of “neither” was coded when volunteered by the respondent. In order to avoid question order effects, the first two items were randomized, so that respondents had an equal chance of receiving either the independent item or the political survival item.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-1532673X12439886">7</xref></sup> Then, the second two survey items directly addressing the party switch were randomized.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-1532673X12439886">8</xref></sup></p>

<p>One potential criticism of the battery is that agree–disagree questions are somewhat unpopular with scholars of public opinion because they can lead to response acquiescence, a tendency to agree in general to most questions. Yet for our purposes this is less of a problem because we are using the questions to build a larger scale of opportunism rather than analyzing the individual items. In sum, the data from the Pennsylvania’s 3rd Congressional District provide us an opportunity to gain leverage on Specter’s party switch from a population of voters in his home state of Pennsylvania.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-1532673X12439886">9</xref></sup> Moreover, the data contain classic political science components like partisanship, political interest, and favorability of political figures to help us gain a picture of how constituents view Specter.</p>

<title>Key Variables</title>
<sec id="section6-1532673X12439886">
<title>Principled-Opportunism Scale (P-O Scale, hereafter)</title>
<p>The primary variable in this analysis is whether registered voters perceive Specter to be principled or opportunistic in the face of his publicized party switch. The four-question Specter battery provides multiple options to tap the dimensions of interest. In this analysis, we build a 17-point scale<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-1532673X12439886">10</xref></sup> from the 4 questions where −8 corresponds to perceiving Specter as most principled and +8 corresponds to most opportunistic. Each agree–disagree item is coded from <italic>disagree</italic> (1) to <italic>agree</italic> (5) with <italic>neither agree nor disagree</italic> (3) as the middle category. For the purposes of our analysis, nonresponses are treated as missing.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-1532673X12439886">11</xref></sup> We construct the scale by adding together the values on the two opportunism items and subtracting the responses for the principled items. For example, a most opportunistic score of +8 would correspond to a respondent answering <italic>agree</italic> to the two opportunism items, while disagreeing with the two principled items ((5 + 5) − (1 +1)=8).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-1532673X12439886">
<title>Specter favorability</title>
<p>Certainly a major question about public opinion regarding party switching is the voters’ general evaluation of the party switcher. In order to estimate a general favorability of Specter, the survey contained a favorability item for Specter as one part of a larger battery on political figures.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-1532673X12439886">12</xref></sup> Respondents were asked to give their opinion on Specter in the following closed-answer categories: “strongly favorable, somewhat favorable, somewhat unfavorable, or strongly unfavorable.” In order to remove the party cue in favorability and to reduce guessing by inattentive respondents, we asked favorability of political figures without the figures’ party affiliation and we prefaced the battery with the following filter: “If you don’t recognize the name, simply tell me that and we’ll move on to the next one.” Specter favorability runs from 1 (<italic>strongly unfavorable</italic>) to 5 (<italic>strongly favorable</italic>) with 3 (<italic>neither favorable nor unfavorable)</italic> as the middle category.</p>

<p>Respondent partisanship is crucial for understanding perceptions of the party switcher (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1532673X12439886">Nicholson, 2005</xref>).

<title>Addressing Hypotheses 1 to 3: The Influence of Partisanship on the P-O Scale</title>
<p>One of the simplest ways to begin exploring the influence of partisanship on registered voters’ perception of the P-O Scale is to look at a simple cross-tabulation of these variables. In this analysis, the P-O Scale is broken down into three categories. “Principled” is categorized as −8 to −2, “Mixed Motives” runs from −1 to 1, and “Opportunist” for a ranking of 2 to 8. The partisanship variable is also split into three categories from a traditional seven-category partisanship question. “Republicans” and “Democrats” include independent leaners, leaving “Pure Independents” as the third category.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1532673X12439886">Table 1</xref> reveals several interesting patterns regarding the influence of partisanship on the respondent’s perceptions of Specter as either principled or opportunist. First, Republicans are least likely to view Specter as being motivated by principles (~4% vs. ~12% for pure independents and ~23% for Democrats). Almost all Republicans in the survey fall in the mixed-motives and opportunist categories with the bulk (~64%) falling into opportunist. Second, Specter seems to have lost the framing battle among pure independents. This group actually has the highest percentage of respondents placing Specter into the opportunist category (~65%). Last, Democrats are much more likely to see Specter as principled in his action (~23%) when compared to the other groups, but still fall overwhelmingly in the mixed-motives or opportunist side of the spectrum. In the simplest of ways, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1532673X12439886">Table 1</xref> supports our first three hypotheses concerning the impact of partisanship on perceptions of Specter as being motivated by principles or opportunism.</p>

</table-wrap>
<p>In order to take into account the impact of other variables and clarify the relationship among partisanship and the P-O Scale we turn to ordinary least squares regression. Our dependent variable in the model is the 17-point P-O Scale, and our main independent variables of concern are two dummy variables—Republican and independent. This leaves Democrat as the excluded category; thus, coefficients are interpreted as the effects relative to being a Democrat. We also control for a variety of factors that are commonly thought to impact opinion (age, gender, education, income, and interest in political campaigns). There is a fair amount of missing data dropped from the model; while this is not ideal there is reason to believe that it is not affecting our results much. For more information on the missing data please see Appendix 1 where we use multiple imputation to recover approximately 50 cases dropped due to our education variable (appendices are posted by the publisher online).</p>
<p>The results shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1532673X12439886">Table 2</xref> reveal the impact of partisanship and political independence on views about Specter. It is clear from the statistically significant results for both <italic>Republican</italic> and <italic>Independent</italic> that these two groups viewed Specter as more opportunistic in his actions when compared to Democrats. Being a Republican instead of a Democrat shifts a respondent ~1.8 units up the scale toward viewing Specter as more opportunistic. Likewise, being an independent instead of a Democrat shifts a respondent ~1.4 units up the scale toward viewing Specter as more opportunistic.</p>

<p>This model provides strong support for the first two hypotheses and weak support for Hypothesis 3. The size of the coefficients suggest that independents are slightly less likely to view Specter as opportunistic when compared to Republicans (as suggested by Hypothesis 3), but a Wald test (<italic>p</italic> = .55) reveals that they are not statistically distinguishable from one another. In sum, it seems that views of Specter are strongly influenced by partisanship and that he did not fair well in the framing battle among a crucial group of swing voters—pure independents.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section17-1532673X12439886">
<title>Addressing Hypothesis 4: The Influence of the P-O Scale on Favorability</title>
<p>The last hypothesis asserts that the more a respondent views Specter as opportunistic, the less favorable he or she will perceive him to be. In order to observe the consequences of viewing Specter as self-serving we use an ordered logistic regression. The dependent variable in the model is a five-category ordered favorability scale. The main independent variables of interest in the model are the P-O Scale and partisanship. Here we use a three-category measure of partisanship, where 1 = Republican (including leaners), 2 = pure independent, and 3 = Democrat (including leaners). Accordingly, we expect that the model should produce (a) a positive coefficient for partisanship—indicating that Democrats view Specter more favorably, and (b) a negative coefficient for the P-O Scale—indicating that those who view Specter as more opportunistic will also view him less favorably. Last, the controls remain the same as the previous model.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1532673X12439886">Table 3</xref> shows that both of our main independent variables are statistically significant and the signs of the log-odds coefficients are in the hypothesized direction. An increase in the P-O Scale (viewing Specter as more opportunistic) leads to respondents being more likely to view Specter less favorably. In addition, moving up the partisanship scale toward Democrats yields more favorable ratings.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn17-1532673X12439886">17</xref></sup> This finding is consistent with our expectations and with prior findings of the influence of partisanship on favorability toward party switchers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1532673X12439886">Nicholson, 2005</xref>). In addition, those with more political interest view Specter less favorably, while those with more education view Specter more favorably (all else constant). In total, being viewed as opportunistic does not do the candidate any favors.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn18-1532673X12439886">18</xref></sup></p>

<title>Discussion and Conclusion</title>
<p>How are voter perceptions of candidates affected by party switching? While studies have identified many of the costs of switching parties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1532673X12439886">Aldrich &amp; Bianco, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1532673X12439886">Castle &amp; Fett, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1532673X12439886">Cox &amp; McCubbins, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1532673X12439886">Grose &amp; Yoshinaka, 2003</xref>), none has systematically explored how voter perceptions of the party switcher are influenced by the event. The 2010 midterm elections presented a rare and important opportunity to fill this glaring gap in the literature. By surveying registered voters in the 3rd Congressional District of Pennsylvania we sought to answer this important question for understanding the negative electoral consequences seen by candidates who change their party affiliation. The answer that the data reveal is that respondents overwhelmingly view Specter as opportunistic in his actions. However, those views are heavily influenced by partisanship or lack thereof. Republicans and independents see Specter as much more opportunistic when compared to Democrats. Democrats are much more willing to see Specter as having made his decision based on principles, which has a more positive connotation. The data also show that as respondents viewed Specter as more opportunistic rather than principled individual ratings of his favorability declined. In addition, lower favorability is associated with Republicans and independents.</p>
<p>So what is the more general lesson that can be taken from this pivotal party switch during the 2010 midterm election? We tread carefully here because of the limitations of our research (see Appendix 1 and 2 in the online supplement), but it should be no surprise to students of congressional behavior that switching political parties and running for reelection is perilous in American politics. The cards are stacked against party switchers in a variety of ways. Our study helps clarify the environment of party switching that generally makes the party switcher’s electoral viability limited at best. First, as suggested by our theory, the information environment after a switch seems to be split into two dominant themes that paint the candidate as either opportunistic or principled. Because of the strategic focus of many news organizations, the opportunistic frame will be dominant since the motivations for reelection are lurking just below the surface of many changes in affiliation. And, as our survey results have shown, the opportunism frame can be damaging to the way that citizens view candidates. Second, independents, who can be crucial swing voters, appear to be just as likely as the abandoned party to accept the more negative opportunistic frame. This finding is likely tied to the media environment. The combination of Specter’s candid admission about his switch being partially motivated by electoral concerns, the strategic focus of the media in reporting political news, and the aggressiveness with which the Sestak campaign developed the opportunistic frame through their advertisements helped to push independents toward the same kind of feelings about Specter that were held by Republicans. Elements of this scenario certainly create difficulties for most switchers. Overall, our research sheds light on the underlying framing battle that plays a role in voter attitudes.</p>
<p>As with most research designs, our analysis comes with a few caveats and limitations. Future research in this area should focus on implementing survey designs that allow for a more direct linkage between perceptions of party switchers and voting behavior. Including questions about generic candidates might also help establish a baseline against which switchers can be compared to normal candidates.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn19-1532673X12439886">19</xref></sup> Our research is limited by studying the specific electoral context of Arlen Specter’s party switch and subsequent defeat. Future studies can build upon the logic of our analysis by broadening the electoral context and avoiding some of the limitations to our research design in population and survey timing (see Appendix 2 posted online). Also, a deeper historical exploration of the public justifications for changes in affiliation and the subsequent framing by parties, candidates, interest groups, and the media would be helpful for more fully understanding the extent to which these competing frames shape the behavior of citizens.</p>

<p>The quote comes from a television advertisement aired by the Sestak campaign during the primary. The footage used was in response to a question by local television station WGAL. The full quote was, “My change in party will enable me to be reelected, and I have heard that again and again and again on the street. ‘Senator, we're glad you'll be able to stay in the Senate and help the state and the nation’” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1532673X12439886">Bellantoni, 2010</xref>).</p></fn>

Aristotle’s voter database contains a bevy of extra data that have been matched for microtargeting by political organizations and candidates. While we generally only use data that we gathered, certain demographic variables like income and education were not asked and must be taken from the Aristotle data.</p></fn>

<p>Despite the survey practices to limit sample bias, our sample does differ from the district population in female respondents (58.9% vs. 52% in the district). The sample does have a good balance of partisans with a slight plurality for Republicans (36.7%) over Democrats (34.9%) and independent leaners (28.4%).</p></fn>

<p>Interviewers were provided the following phrase if respondents needed the response categories again: “Please tell me if you agree, somewhat agree, somewhat disagree, or disagree with the following statement about Specter.” Interviewers were trained to record “neither” responses if volunteered by the respondent.</p></fn>

<p>We are sensitive to the fact that our survey is limited to one congressional district and not the entire state of Pennsylvania.

<p>We ran all of our analyses using different codings of the dependent variable to make sure that there was not a better way to construct it. We created variables that broke the Principled-Opportunism Scale into broader categories, aggregated only certain questions, and conducted factor analysis to make sure that the questions were in fact measuring distinct dimensions. All of the models that are presented in the analysis section were also run with these different codings. The dominant thrust of these findings is that our substantive results were robust regardless of how we chose to code the P-O Scale. It was also encouraging to see that the survey questions tap into two distinct dimensions in the manner we expected when designing the survey. Ultimately, we use the 17-point scale to maintain as much variation as possible.</p></fn>

<p>Interviewers started the battery with the following instructions: “Now I am interested in your evaluations of some people and groups in government and public affairs. For each figure or groups, I would like to know if your opinion is strongly favorable, somewhat favorable, somewhat unfavorable, or strongly unfavorable.” When interviewers reached Specter in the random list of figures, the interviewer read: “How about Arlen Specter?” The interviewer also had a prompt available on the computer screen to repeat the initial answer categories if necessary.</p></fn>

<p>The first question stays with the classic formulation: “Generally speaking, do you consider yourself to be a Republican, Democrat, or independent?”</p></fn>

<p>Recent research shows that “independent leaners” tend to vote much like weak partisans rather than being equally likely to vote for each of the parties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1532673X12439886">Sides, 2009</xref>); thus, we include them in the partisan categories, rather than in the independent category.</p></fn>

<p>Another version of the favorability model (not reported here) was run with an interaction between partisanship and the P-O Scale. This interaction is not statistically significant.</p></fn>

<label>18.</label>
<p>One concern is that the P-O Scale might simply be a measure of cynicism toward politicians in general or some kind of proxy measure of partisanship. If this were true we would expect that the P-O Scale would have significant results for the favorability scales of other candidates. This was not the case. We ran many models (not reported here) with the favorability scales of other candidates and with the difference between Specter’s favorability and the mean favorability of all other candidates as the dependent variable. The results of these models indicate that the P-O Scale is tapping into the underlying dimension that we intended to uncover.</p></fn>
<fn fn-type="other" id="fn19-1532673X12439886">
<label>19.</label>
<p>We attempt to account for this by taking the difference between Specter’s favorability and the mean favorability of all other candidates as our dependent variable in some of our unreported models. Nevertheless, a better baseline can be established in future survey work by including questions about politicians in general.</p></fn>
