<abstract>
<p>School nurses, as vaccination advocates, need to be aware of parents’ common concerns regarding vaccines, so the nurse can develop strategies to communicate with parents. The purpose of this cross-sectional, descriptive study was to identify common reasons parents in Utah seek exempting rather than vaccinating their children. Data were collected from a convenience sample of 801 parents responding to a 16-item questionnaire about why they exempted their children from receiving vaccinations. The most commonly reported reason for seeking a personal exemption included vaccines conflicting with philosophical beliefs. Parents exempting from one vaccine most commonly exempted the hepatitis series. Most parents communicated their vaccine concerns with their health care provider prior to seeking exemption. The majority of exempting parents did not use the Internet when researching vaccines even though they had Internet access. Considering the common vaccine-related perceptions of parents may be helpful when developing strategies to overcome these barriers to vaccination.</p>

<p>Since the beginning of the 19th century, vaccinations have saved millions of lives (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1059840512455365">Calandrillo, 2004</xref>). Now implemented worldwide, vaccination is regarded as one of the most important life-saving measures of all time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1059840512455365">Public Health Agency of Canada, 2009</xref>). In U.S. history, vaccinations became common with the mandate of the small pox vaccine in 1827 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1059840512455365">Hinman, Orenstein, Williamson, &amp; Darrington, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1059840512455365">Kennedy, Brown, &amp; Gust, 2005</xref>). Since then, laws have continued mandatory school vaccinations to prevent outbreaks of communicable diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1059840512455365">Hinman et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1059840512455365">Omer et al., 2006</xref>). However, an unforeseen consequence of successful vaccinations has been that most people lack firsthand experience with serious communicable diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1059840512455365">Salmon et al., 1999</xref>). Lack of experience with vaccine preventable diseases (VPD) has led to parents focusing less on the overwhelming benefits of vaccinations and more on possible adverse events (AEs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1059840512455365">Gust et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1059840512455365">Opel, Diekema, Lee, &amp; Marcuse, 2009</xref>). For these parents, the risk of AEs from vaccinations is more worrisome than their child contracting a VPD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1059840512455365">Gust et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1059840512455365">Opel et al., 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>As the perceived benefits of vaccines decrease, parental requests for school vaccination exemptions increase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1059840512455365">Salmon et al., 2005a</xref>). All states in the United States allow parents to claim medical exemptions from school vaccinations while 48 states allow exemptions for religious reasons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1059840512455365">Kennedy et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1059840512455365">Salmon et al., 1999</xref>), and 20 states, like Utah, allow parents to exempt any or all vaccinations based on their personal beliefs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1059840512455365">Berlinger, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1059840512455365">National Conference of State Legislatures [NCSL], 2011b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1059840512455365">Salmon et al., 2006</xref>). Consequently, high immunization rates which lead to fewer community VPD outbreaks have been compromised in Utah communities, resulting in outbreaks of measles and pertussis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1059840512455365">Stewart, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1059840512455365">Utah Department of Health, 2001</xref>).</p>
<sec id="section1-1059840512455365">
<title>Background</title>
<p>School vaccination requirements, while individually defined by each state, are largely based on the recommendations of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1059840512455365">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC], 2011a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1059840512455365">Kroger, Sumaya, Pickering, &amp; Atkinson, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1059840512455365">NCSL, 2011a</xref>). Because school-age children typically have the highest rates of VPDs, it is important that parents vaccinate them on time in order to promote optimum immunity against these diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1059840512455365">American Academy of Pediatrics, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1059840512455365">CDC, 2011b</xref>).</p>
<p>The issue of parents refusing childhood vaccinations may be more prominent than one might think. Nationwide, state vaccination exemption rates for Kindergarteners range from &lt;1% to 6.2% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1059840512455365">CDC, 2011c</xref>). However, during 2010, 12% of American parents were reported as refusing at least one vaccine for their child (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1059840512455365">Asaithambi, 2012</xref>). This discrepancy between the two groups may be attributable to differences in state requirements for school vaccines, as well as not accounting for parents who initially refuse a vaccine for their child, yet tend to allow their child to receive the same vaccine, just later in life. Regardless, vaccination exemptions are on the rise, doubling in states like California over the last two decades from &lt;1% in 1990 to 2.3% in 2010 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1059840512455365">Crowe, 2011</xref>). In fact, more than half of the states have seen an increase in exemption rates over the past 5 years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1059840512455365">Stobbe, 2011</xref>). With this rise in exemption rates, the integrity of the herd effect has been compromised, especially when considering that highly virulent diseases, such as measles and pertussis, require a 95% vaccination rate in order for the herd effect to work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1059840512455365">Offit, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>In states that allow vaccination exemptions for nonmedical reasons, exemption rates increase. For example, in one Arkansas school district that implemented a nonmedical exemption process in 2003, nonmedical exemptions steadily increased over the following 4 years. By the fourth year, nonmedical exemptions constituted 95% of exemptions granted in the year (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1059840512455365">Thompson et al., 2007</xref>). In addition, the rate of vaccination exemption for Kindergarteners in states such as Mississippi, which does not allow for religious or philosophical exemptions, is less than 1%. In contrast, the vaccination exemption rate among Kindergarteners in Washington State, where both religious and philosophical exemptions are allowed, is more than 6 times higher, at 6.2% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1059840512455365">Asaithambi, 2012</xref>). Concurrently, an increase in nonmedical exemptions results in an increase in VPD outbreaks, such as measles or pertussis, which are commonly observed in geographically clustered areas of exemption (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1059840512455365">Rota et al., 2001</xref>). Without question, low vaccination rates increase the risk for a VPD outbreak (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1059840512455365">Cochran, Smith, Reid, Morrow, &amp; Ramirez, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1059840512455365">Luman, Barker, McCauley, &amp; Drews-Botsch, 2005</xref>), thus jeopardizing the health and welfare of both individuals and the public as a whole (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1059840512455365">Hinman et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1059840512455365">Omer et al., 2008</xref>).</p>
<sec id="section2-1059840512455365">
<title>Why Parents Exempt</title>
<p>Parents exempting children from vaccinations for personal reasons do so because they have concerns regarding vaccine safety, have a preference for natural immunity, or because of the ease of the exemption process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1059840512455365">Fredrickson et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1059840512455365">Kennedy et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1059840512455365">Salmon et al., 2005a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1059840512455365">2005b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1059840512455365">Thompson et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1059840512455365">Wharton, Hogan, &amp; Segal-Freeman, 2005</xref>). Generally, the most common concern of vaccine-hesitant parents is vaccine safety (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1059840512455365">Dempsey et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1059840512455365">Luthy, Beckstrand, &amp; Peterson, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1059840512455365">Smith, Chu, &amp; Barker, 2004</xref>). One of the main safety concerns is that vaccine-hesitant parents believe vaccinations overload their child’s immune system, especially when they are infants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1059840512455365">Luthy et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1059840512455365">Salmon et al., 2004</xref>). As such, these parents exempt vaccinations while their children are younger, but later consent to vaccination after the child reaches school age. Sometimes vaccine-hesitant parents can be convinced to consent to childhood vaccinations for school entry, but then request alternative vaccination schedules such as those recommended by Dr. Bob Sears, author of <italic>The Vaccine Book: Making the Right Decision for Your Child</italic>, or instead request the administration of only one shot per month to give their child’s immune system time to “adapt.” Unfortunately, children whose vaccinations are perpetually delayed or refused present a health risk to other children at school (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1059840512455365">Salmon et al., 2005b</xref>).</p>
<p>Parents with vaccination safety concerns also express a strong distrust of the government and vaccine manufacturers which may then equate to a distrust of conventional preventative medicine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1059840512455365">Offit, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1059840512455365">Salmon et al., 2005a</xref>) and tend to seek medical advice from homeopathic practitioners and use complementary alternative medicine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1059840512455365">Gust et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1059840512455365">Salmon et al., 2009</xref>). These parents even believe that vaccine companies and government agencies only promote vaccination to make a profit on vaccines sales and do not, necessarily, care for the safety of their children (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1059840512455365">Salmon et al., 2009</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-1059840512455365">
<title>Preference for Natural Immunity</title>
<p>Sometimes parents vaccinate for some diseases and yet exempt from others. These parents express a strong preference for their children to develop natural immunity from the various diseases rather than active immunity from vaccinations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1059840512455365">Offit, 2011</xref>). For example, parents may refuse varicella vaccine because they believe having chicken pox provides lifelong protection whereas the vaccine’s immunity wanes with time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1059840512455365">Immunization Action Coalition, 2010</xref>). Generally speaking, the immune response following a single natural infection is more effective than protection provided with vaccines; however, immunity resulting from a natural infection of the chicken pox places a child at an unnecessary risk for a myriad of disease-related complications such as encephalitis, pneumonia, meningitis, and necrotizing fasciitis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1059840512455365">Offit &amp; Moser, 2011</xref>). Furthermore, the vaccine is extremely effective, providing immunity in 97% of young children following a single dose (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1059840512455365">Immunization Action Coalition, 2010</xref>). In addition, the chance of a vaccinated child suffering a shingles outbreak later in life is much lower in vaccinated children rather than after natural chicken pox infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1059840512455365">Offit &amp; Moser, 2011</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1059840512455365">
<title>Ease of Exemption Process</title>
<p>Currently, 20 states allow exemptions to school-required vaccines for reasons other than those contraindicated for medical reasons or religious observances (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1059840512455365">Berlinger, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1059840512455365">Salmon et al., 2006</xref>). There is a direct and positive correlation between the ease of the personal exemption process and the request for vaccine exemptions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1059840512455365">Hinman et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1059840512455365">Omer et al., 2006</xref>). Mean exemption rates increased approximately 6% per year in states that easily allowed personal belief exemptions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1059840512455365">Omer et al., 2006</xref>). In contrast, states that had a difficult exemption process, such as intricate paperwork and extensive administrative processes, or offered religious exemptions only saw no statistically significant change in exemption rates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1059840512455365">Omer et al., 2006</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1059840512455365">
<title>Exemptions and School Nurses</title>
<p>As some states allow personal exemptions from vaccines, it is important to understand why parents choose personal exemptions, thus preparing health care providers with the ability to anticipate common parental concerns and to address these concerns with parents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1059840512455365">Gust et al., 2009</xref>). In particular, school nurses need to be aware of a parent’s common concerns so they can develop appropriate communication and educational strategies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1059840512455365">Luthy, Beckstrand, Callister, &amp; Cahoon, 2011</xref>). As providers of health care services to children, school nurses have important roles in obtaining and maintaining vaccination compliance among children from prekindergarten to high school (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1059840512455365">Luthy, Thorpe, Dymock, &amp; Connely, 2010</xref>). Accordingly, the purpose of this study was to identify reasons parents in Utah requested a personal exemption from childhood vaccinations.</p>

<title>Research Question</title>
<p>What are the vaccine-related perceptions of Utah parents who choose to exempt vaccination of their children for personal reasons?</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-1059840512455365" sec-type="methods">
<title>Method</title>
<p>Following institutional board approval, a review of the literature was conducted searching the databases: MEDLINE, MEDLINEPlus, CINAHL, EBSCO, PubMed, Web of Science, Biomedical Reference Collection-Basic, Health Source-Nursing/Academic Edition, and the Cochrane Library online. Search terms included<italic> immunization, vaccination, exemption, exemption form, philosophical exemption, parents, philosophical belief, personal belief, childhood, </italic>and <italic>pediatrics</italic>. In addition, current recommendations and guidelines regarding childhood vaccination and exemptions were obtained from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention website.</p>
<sec id="section8-1059840512455365">
<title>Design and Sample</title>
<p>To assess why parents refused to give their child at least one vaccination, a 16-item questionnaire was adapted, with permission, from a previously distributed Utah State Department of Health (USDOH) exemption questionnaire. The 16-item questionnaire included multiple choice, fill in the blank, and open-ended comment sections. The original USDOH questionnaire was developed with a team of vaccination experts and then piloted with parents to establish face validity. Prior to distribution of the updated version, experts including school nurses, public health nurses, members of local and state agencies, health care providers specializing in pediatrics, and members of a local immunization coalition reviewed the adapted questionnaire for face validity.</p>
<p>The questionnaire was distributed to all county health departments in Utah. Using a descriptive, cross-sectional mixed-method study design, parents seeking to exempt their children from vaccinations were identified as subjects. In Utah, exemption forms can only be obtained from vaccination clinics at local health departments and are required to be turned into the school nurse before children without vaccinations can attend public school. As such, health department vaccination clinics seemed an appropriate location to question exempting parents regarding their personal vaccination perceptions.</p>
<p>County health department nurses working in the vaccination clinics were responsible for identifying eligible participants. To be eligible, parents needed to request and complete an exemption form for at least one child in the family. Parents seeking a vaccination exemption form were given an informed consent document for review and asked if they would like to participate in the study. Upon agreeing to participate, most parents took about 15 minutes to complete the questionnaire. A $1 gift certificate for food was given to parents as compensation for their time.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-1059840512455365">
<title>Instrument</title>
<p>The Vaccination Exemption Questionnaire was developed to identify attitudes and perceptions of parents seeking a personal exemption for their children. The questionnaire included a question about why the parent was seeking a personal exemption for their child. Participants could choose from 10 listed items and were directed to choose all items that applied. Additionally, parents were asked whether they had discussed vaccinations with their child’s health care provider, if they were only exempting their child from one vaccine, if they had access to the Internet and if they used the Internet to obtain information on immunizations. Open-ended questions regarding which vaccine was exempted and why, specific concerns about vaccine safety, and websites utilized for obtaining vaccination information were included. Parents could also share any other comments on why they claimed a personal exemption. There were seven demographic questions: age, gender, annual income, education, race, vaccination status of parent, and grade of the child for whom the exemption was sought.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-1059840512455365">
<title>Data Analysis</title>
<p>Responses were entered into an SPSS database (SPSS, Inc., Chicago, IL). The accuracy of data was confirmed by two researchers. When there was a question about a marked response, the primary investigator personally examined the item to determine the correct response to enter. Frequencies and measures of central tendency were calculated for all items. Open-ended item responses were transcribed and analyzed for themes. A nurse researcher with expertise in qualitative inquiry then verified the findings by conducting an independent analysis of data and generated themes. Both quantitative and qualitative results are presented.</p>

<sec id="section11-1059840512455365">
<title>Results</title>
<p>The sample consisted of 801 parents with 646 (83.4%) females and 129 (16.6%) males.

<p>Parents were first asked why they were seeking a personal exemption for their child and could check any or all of the 10 listed choices that related to seeking an exemption. The 801 parents selected a total of 1,203 choices. The most frequently chosen response was that vaccinations conflicted with their philosophical beliefs (<italic>n</italic> = 303, 25.2%; see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1059840512455365">Table 2</xref>). Parents also cited concern about overloading or weakening their children’s immune systems (<italic>n</italic> = 269, 22.3%), while another 176 parents (14.6%) reported they had heard vaccines could cause chronic diseases such as Autism. Other reasons for seeking exemption were concerns that the vaccine caused the illness it was supposed to prevent (<italic>n</italic> = 150, 12.5%) or the possibility of a recurrence of an adverse reaction similar to that of a previous vaccination (<italic>n</italic> = 141, 11.7%). A few participants reported other, less common, reasons for seeking a personal exemption, such as losing the vaccination record and not wanting to repeat any vaccinations, reporting a lack of health insurance, declining vaccinations because of any associated cost, and stating the lack of convenient access to vaccination clinics (<italic>n</italic> = 164, 13.6%).</p>

<p>Ninety-one parents wrote comments regarding why they were asking for an exemption from one specific vaccine (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-1059840512455365">Table 4</xref>). Not believing in the vaccine (35.2%) was the most common theme. One parent, exempting her child from receiving the Hepatitis B vaccination stated, “[It] starts too young. Hep B is usually contracted due to a person’s lifestyle choices. I believe we all should live a drug free life and have only one sexual partner, to whom we are married.” Another parent exempting her child from receiving varicella vaccination said, “I would prefer she build her immunity naturally.” Other reasons for refusing a specific vaccination included parents wanting a longer period of time over which to vaccinate their children (19.8%), having an adverse reaction to the same vaccination given previously (13.2%), not wanting to repeat a vaccination series (11%), worrying that the vaccination may cause Autism (11%), and following the counsel of their health care provider (9.8%).</p>

<p>Many parents stated they had communicated their concerns with their health care provider prior to seeking a personal exemption from vaccination. When questioned about whether they had specific concerns regarding vaccine safety, 404 (60.3%) had no concerns while 261 (39.2%) affirmed they did have vaccine safety concerns. Of those reporting safety concerns, 159 parents wrote comments about their specific safety concerns. Danger of vaccine ingredients was the most commonly listed concern (<italic>n</italic> = 34, 21.3%; see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-1059840512455365">Table 5</xref>). As expressed by one parent, “I’m concerned that [vaccines] contain mercury, neurotoxins, and other harmful substances.” Others expressed concern that vaccinations could cause chronic diseases, such as Autism or diabetes. Ethical concerns regarding vaccinations were expressed by 22 parents as shown by one parent who wrote, “Some [vaccines] are cultured/produced with the bio material of fetuses.” Also listed as vaccine safety concerns were parental perceived reactions to a previous vaccine (10%), distrust of government and vaccine manufacturers (5.6%), and general information issues (2.5%).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The demographic findings in this study are consistent with similar studies regarding parents who exempt vaccinations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1059840512455365">National Network for Immunization Information [NNII], 2010</xref>). Indeed, parents who exempt their children from receiving vaccinations are primarily White females, have some college or are a college graduate, and have an annual household income of over $75,000 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1059840512455365">NNII, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>Conflict with parents’ philosophical beliefs was the most common reason parents exempted their children. <italic>Philosophical/parental beliefs</italic> is a broad category, especially considering that these parents were available as subjects specifically because they were seeking an exemption from vaccinations for personal reasons. Most of the parents who cite philosophical objection to compulsory vaccination, however, also often express secondary concerns, some of which may actually be the root of the philosophical belief. As such, some parents should be asked additional questions to elicit very specific vaccination concerns. For example, a parent reporting a philosophical objection to vaccinations may, in all actuality, have more specific concerns directly related to vaccine ingredients or a lack of understanding regarding the need for a specific vaccination. Once the specific concern is identified, the school nurse can inform and then direct the parent to the appropriate resource, thus taking a more effective and targeted approach to vaccine education (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1059840512455365">Luthy, Sperhac, Faux, &amp; Miner, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>It was interesting to note that when parents exempted only one vaccine, most often they exempted the hepatitis vaccines. The majority of these parents also directly related Hepatitis A and B infections with lifestyle choices such as number of sexual partners, mistakenly believing that exposure to these viruses can be avoided by observing abstinence from sexual contact. Because of these specific parental beliefs, the parents did not understand the need for children, who were not sexually active, to be vaccinated against hepatitis infections. Similarly, parents who exempted their child from tetanus vaccine believed that it was only necessary following an injury. Because none of these parents mentioned the pertussis component of the diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis (DTaP) vaccine when exempting from tetanus, they may not have been aware of the prevalence of pertussis disease in the community or the health risks associated with this potentially devastating disease. For hepatitis and tetanus vaccinations, additional information regarding transmission of these diseases as well as the incidence of these diseases in the community may help parents understand the importance of these vaccinations and encourage parents to vaccinate their children.</p>
<p>As the third most common vaccine exemption in this study, MMR vaccine was still exempted because of concern regarding a possible link between vaccinations and Autism. This myth continues to perpetuate despite eight review panels by the Institute of Medicine conclusively disproving any such link (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1059840512455365">Immunization Safety Review Committee, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1059840512455365">Kimmel, Burns, Wolfe, &amp; Zimmerman, 2007</xref>). Often, parents base their Autism-vaccination beliefs upon personal advice or recommendations from friends or family members (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1059840512455365">Sporton &amp; Francis, 2001</xref>), never fully realizing the history behind this erroneous connection. The school nurse may want to summarize the history regarding Wakefield’s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1059840512455365">Wakefield et al., 1998</xref>) infamous study for these parents. For example, the school nurse could communicate facts such as (1) the tiny sample size of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1059840512455365">Wakefield’s 1998</xref> study wherein he reported a correlation between MMR vaccine and Autism which has been disproven in multiple subsequent studies with thousands of subjects; (2) Wakefield’s publication was officially retracted from the <italic>Lancet </italic>in 2010; (3) Wakefield received payments (about $750,000) from an attorney who intended to sue the MMR vaccine manufacturer; (4) Wakefield patented a new vaccine as a competitor to MMR hoping to profit, given he could establish the original MMR vaccine as unsafe; and (5) Wakefield’s involvement in the study was deemed unethical, dishonest, and he was found guilty of abusing developmentally challenged children which directly resulted in the revocation of his medical license in 2010 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1059840512455365">Deer, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1059840512455365">Myers &amp; Pineda, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1059840512455365">Offit, 2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1059840512455365">2011</xref>).</p>
<p>When asked, exempting parents stated they had specific concerns relating to vaccine safety. Of these parents, vaccine ingredients, namely mercury, was the most commonly cited concern regarding vaccine safety. With the exception of some flu vaccine, mercury-containing preservatives were removed from all vaccines in 2001, although parental worry regarding this ingredient continues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1059840512455365">Offit, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1059840512455365">Offit &amp; Moser, 2011</xref>), a concern that has been further propagated by Dr. Bob Sears in his book <italic>The Vaccine Book: Making the Right Decision for Your Child</italic> and numerous anti-vaccination websites. School nurses need to become familiar with common vaccine ingredient concerns so as to provide honest responses to these parents. Furthermore, school nurses may want to refer the parents requesting Dr. Sears’ alternate vaccine schedule to the article, <italic>The Problem with Dr. Bob’s Alternative Vaccine Schedule </italic>or a few selected websites, such as chop.edu, to assist in vaccine ingredient conversations with parents.</p>
<p>Reliance upon the Internet for health-related information has become a global phenomenon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1059840512455365">West &amp; Miller, 2009</xref>). With this in mind, it was surprising to find that more than half of our participants reported not using the Internet to obtain vaccination information. It is unclear which vaccination resources these parents are utilizing, although possibilities may include health care providers, books, and family members or friends. Our sample did report Internet use to acquire vaccination information from government-based and health-related websites, so, it is a bit perplexing that reputable websites were accessed for vaccine information and yet some of these parents still sought exemptions. Perhaps the effectiveness of vaccine information should be further researched among exempting parents to measure the saliency of individual messages.</p>
<p>The majority of parents stated they had communicated with their health care provider prior to seeking a personal exemption yet, apparently, that communication was ineffective in overcoming the parent’s concerns. There is evidence that the time a health care provider can spend discussing vaccination concerns with parents may be severely limited due to rigorous clinic schedules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1059840512455365">Luthy et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1059840512455365">Luthy et al., 2010</xref>). Nevertheless, contact between health care providers and parents has been believed to be the single-most important opportunity to convince exempting parents they need to vaccinate their children (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1059840512455365">Luthy et al., 2010</xref>). School nurses have a crucial role in serving as the liaison between the health care provider and the family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1059840512455365">National Association of School Nurses [NASN], 2011</xref>) and provide “promotion of health education” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1059840512455365">NASN, 2011</xref>, ¶1). Consequently, the school nurse may be in a unique position to further address parental vaccination concerns that the health care provider did not have time to address.</p>
<p>While it is true that most childhood vaccinations are administered in the first 2 years of life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1059840512455365">United States Department of Health and Human Services, n.d.</xref>), school nurses still have an active role when interacting with exempting parents. During admission to the school system, parents must provide proof of their child’s vaccinations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1059840512455365">CDC, 2012</xref>) which, for some parents, is the first time they have been required to prove vaccination status. Thus, the vaccine conversation with the school nurse may be the first communication regarding required vaccines. Additionally, while it is ideal that all children have access to the health care system, unfortunately this may not be the case. There were, in fact, 7.3 million children in the United States with no health insurance in 2010 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1059840512455365">DeNavas-Walt, Proctor, &amp; Smith, 2011</xref>), which could pose a formidable barrier to regular interactions with a health care provider and access to vaccines. Finally, even children covered by health insurance may not be adequately vaccinated, especially if the child changes health care providers frequently or if the vaccination record is lost.</p>
<sec id="section13-1059840512455365">
<title>Recommendations for Future Research</title>
<p>Parents who exempt their children from receiving vaccinations have many questions regarding product safety, rationale for administering vaccinations at specified intervals, vaccine ingredients, and vaccines and Autism. With an identifiable knowledge gap in these areas, effective communication regarding vaccinations with these parents is imperative. However, to date, it is unknown as to which educational strategies are most effective with this group of parents. As such, it is recommended that future research evaluate the effectiveness of educational materials with this specific population.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section14-1059840512455365">
<title>Limitations of the Study</title>
<p>The convenience sample was from one state and may not be representative of other populations of parents residing in a different location in the United States. Findings of this study cannot be generalized to other populations. Moreover, the questionnaire utilized to collect data was not piloted using parents, although the tool was an adaptation of another similar tool that was validated with parents prior to distribution.</p>

<title>Conclusion and Recommendations</title>
<p>As one of the most important life-saving measures of all time, vaccines have proven to be successful in reducing the incidence of VPDs. However, with the lack of experience with VPDs has come the unintended consequence of a lower perceived need for vaccines by some parents. For these exempting parents, the potential for vaccine AEs outweighs the perceived risk for VPDs. As the perceived benefits of vaccines decrease, parental requests for personal exemption from school-required vaccines may continue to increase.</p>
<p>Parents identify specific reasons for requesting personal exemption from vaccinations and need to be questioned as to the root cause of this type of request. Such questioning may reveal identifiable knowledge gaps that the school nurse can then address with focused educational messages. For example, parents who exempt hepatitis vaccines may not understand the need for such vaccinations in children if they also believe these diseases are only spread by sexual contact. Additionally, parents exempting tetanus unless the child has sustained an injury may not be aware that the tetanus vaccine is combined with pertussis vaccine, a potentially devastating disease that is prevalent in many communities.</p>
<p>It is disappointing to note that parental concern regarding a possible link between MMR vaccinations and Autism continues to negatively affect compulsory vaccination. Further circulating among exempting parents is worry there is a correlation between mercury-based preservatives in vaccines and Autism. However, it is important for school nurses to participate in education efforts to inform parents on the truth of the MMR vaccine–Autism debate. Additionally, parents should be informed that mercury-based preservatives are no longer used in childhood vaccines, with the exception of flu, as well as the reasons for the removal of this ingredient from vaccines.</p>
<p>Parents are concerned about vaccine ingredients. Therefore, it would be helpful for school nurses to become familiar with common ingredient concerns so as to provide an appropriate response to these parents. In preparation for vaccine ingredient discussions, school nurses may want to review available resources found in print, as well as online.</p>
<p>While the majority of parents do not obtain their vaccination information from the Internet, those who do commonly visit government-based and health-related websites. As a result, it may be helpful to further research the saliency of various vaccination messages with parents who sought a personal exemption despite their review of vaccination information on reliable websites. Also concerning is the fact that the vast majority of exempting parents reported they had communicated with their health care provider prior to seeking a personal exemption. While the health care provider may not have the time to adequately address the vaccination concerns of these parents, the school nurse may play a pivotal role in providing additional vaccination information to these parents and in answering their questions.</p>
