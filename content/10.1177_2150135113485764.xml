<p>Off-label drug use in pediatrics has challenged the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Historically, pharmaceutical companies have been willing to fund pediatric safety and efficacy trials but only for medications with a large market (vaccines and antibiotics). In the field of pediatric cardiac intensive care, the small number of patients and the widely varying physiologies challenge prospective clinical drug trials. There is a limited, if any, return on investment for the pharmaceutical company. However, in the past decade, there has been an increase in pediatric safety and efficacy trials as a result of the 1997 FDA Modernization Act (FDAMA) that was extended in 2002 under the Best Pharmaceutical for Children Act. The FDAMA allows companies performing an FDA-approved pediatric drug trial to extend their patent for an additional six months. Unfortunately, even well-run exclusivity clinical trials under the FDAMA do not necessarily result in a FDA-approved pediatric drug label. An example is milrinone, that has been shown to decrease low cardiac output syndrome in young infants following biventricular repair<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-2150135113485764">1</xref>
</sup> but remains off-label. Of perhaps greater challenge are drugs that are available in generic form (dopamine for example), where the incentives of the FDAMA do not apply.</p>
<p>Maltz and associates, in a study published in this issue of <italic>World Journal for Pediatric and Congenital Heart Surgery</italic>, investigated off-label drug use in a pediatric cardiac intensive care unit (PCICU).<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-2150135113485764">2</xref>
</sup> They found that 36% of the prescribed drugs were off-label, with 94% of the patients receiving at least one off-label drug and 46% of the patients receiving greater than three off-label drugs. This is an important educational point, as most practitioners are likely unaware of which pharmaceutical agents are FDA approved for pediatrics. Not surprising, patients at higher risk were shown to receive more medications and more off-label medications.</p>
<p>Other publications have described the off-label drug use in pediatric anesthesia and intensive care<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-2150135113485764">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-2150135113485764"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-2150135113485764">5</xref>
</sup> and in hospitalized children with congenital and acquired heart disease.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-2150135113485764">6</xref>
</sup> Off-label drug use is not confined to the pediatric critical care population but has also been described in adult critical care units.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-2150135113485764">7</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>The report by Maltz and associates offers a description of the frequency of off-label drug use in one PCICU. It is important to discount any conclusion that off-label drug use was a causative factor for increased length of stay. Increased length of stay has been shown to be a surrogate for complexity of disease and intensity of care. In the study by Maltz and associates, there are far too many risk variables that were not included in the analysis. In addition, the number of patients enrolled in their study was small. It is primarily an observational study. The descriptive analysis does not control for severity of illness and complexity of disease. One should not conclude that the off-label drug use was unsafe or contributed to harm.</p>
<p>The field of pediatric cardiac critical care has evolved since its infancy three decades ago. Due in part to advancements in pharmaceutical options, survival following neonatal heart surgery has improved, hospital length of stay has become shorter, and our ability to recover a patient from a significant event has improved. Many drugs used in pediatric cardiac critical care are brought into our environment through the expertise of other specialties (pediatric critical care, neonatology, adult critical care, anesthesiology), with modifications in their dosage and indications over time. A current example is the rapidly increasing use of dexmedetomidine, despite limited trials evaluating dose ranging or efficacy, complications, or potential drug interactions. Thus, safety and efficacy for many drugs used in pediatric cardiac critical care are a result of years of experience rather than clinical trials.</p>
<p>The use of off-label medications is to benefit the individual patient, and the FDA is very clear that practitioners are able to use their professional judgment to determine these uses. Off-label drug use is therefore common in both pediatric and adult critical care settings. Does this mean patients are at risk? There is no plausible data to support such a contention. Obviously, we all want to prescribe drugs that have been adequately tested so that we understand their safety and efficacy. We also want protection from litigation if there is an adverse event perceived to be related to off-label use of a medication. How do we get this data? Clinical trials are the gold standard for changes in practice as they are prospective, randomized (often blinded), with a defined patient population and statistically sound outcomes. However, clinical trials in pediatric cardiac critical care are challenged by cost, practice variation among centers, age-dependent variables, anatomical and physiologic variances, and difficulties with parental consent. In addition, there is appropriate concern and perhaps equipoise with a placebo control, as there is often extensive experience with the drug under question.</p>
<p>Maltz and associates conclude their study with a take-home message, “further safety, efficacy, and pharmaceutical trials are warranted to optimize the use of these drugs to improve outcomes.” We ask ourselves whether clinical trials truly represent the best and most pragmatic approach to addressing the unknowns associated with current off-label drug use in PCICUs. In light of the heterogeneity of the patient population, the number of drugs to be evaluated and the relevant end points worthy of consideration, the logistics will be too difficult and costly to develop large controlled trials to answer safety and efficacy concerns. Variables will not be controllable, long-term-follow-up nearly impossible, and the entire process far too slow to achieve meaningful results.</p>
<p>The linking of registries and large administrative databases may be one way to determine safety and efficacy for many of the off-label pharmaceutical agents used in the PCICUs. Even so, it will be difficult to establish the cause and effect relationships, pharmacodynamics, and kinetics. A better real-time method is to capture and store the large streams of continuous physiologic data from patients, match this with clinical decisions, events, and outcomes. Capturing and storing these data enable not only analysis but also sharing among institutions. Using real-time prospective shared data capture and analysis, we may be able to tease out the pharmacodynamics and potential effects of many of the drugs that we prescribe on a daily basis. Software platforms have now been developed, which will allow for the continual capture of relevant data to undertake meaningful modeling and analysis. Although funding remains a question, real-time data collection should be an expectation of critical care clinicians. Prospective data collection and data sharing will enable the most informative use of medication.</p>
<p>As clinicians, we need to understand a medication’s mechanism and site of action, potential interactions, metabolism, and excretion. We also need to understand the underlying pathophysiology that may affect pharmacokinetics and dynamics, such as end organ dysfunction and the impact of low cardiac output state. In short, the intensive care physician needs to be a pharmacologist and a physiologist. An experienced pediatric cardiac intensive care clinician can predict which patient will develop renal failure with enalapril, hemodynamically significant myocardial depression with amiodarone, ventricular fibrillation with epinephrine, respiratory depression with fentanyl, or hypotension with a milrinone bolus. However, the pediatric cardiac intensive care physicians should not rely solely on their experience or limited published data. It is important to utilize the expertise of other specialties. Incorporating pharmacists on work rounds and with real-time decision making is an obvious example. Anesthesiologists have extensive understanding of the pharmacology of neuromuscular blocking drugs, analgesics, and anxiolytics. We should collaborate more closely with clinicians from other specialties with expertise, who can help improve the way in which we are prescribing and using certain classes of drugs. It is incumbent on our field to provide the bedside clinician with the best information regarding age-dependent dosing ranges, situational (anatomic or physiologic) dose adjustments, and specific concerns.</p>
