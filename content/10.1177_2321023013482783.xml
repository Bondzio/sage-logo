<p>After forty years of pouring over Rajni Kothari’s writings in search of blinding insights that always emerge, I never imagined that I could underestimate his work. But I was mistaken. For this symposium I re-read his 1970 book, <italic>Politics in India</italic> and drafted a commentary on it. But when I turned to his <italic>Memoirs</italic> (which appeared 32 years later) for a few additional ideas, I discovered that while my initial draft was largely accurate, it was also inadequate—far too limited and one-dimensional. It focused on only one level: on events in India’s political system. The <italic>Memoirs</italic> reminded me that Kothari operates at multiple levels. A second look at <italic>Politics in India</italic> revealed that he had done so even in that early work.</p>
<p>A hasty reading of that book might lead us to conclude that in writing it, Kothari was guilty of the same error that I committed in my first draft: an inordinate preoccupation with political parties, institutions and leaders’ actions. We might conclude that his horizon broadened only in his later writings. But if we read it more closely, with his later writings and his <italic>Memoirs</italic> in mind, we see that even in <italic>Politics in India</italic> (1970), his first book—which was written before the political system slipped into crisis—the themes and concerns that emerged in his later analyses are present in depth. They are not stressed because the crisis was still brewing when the book was written, but they are there. To overlook them is to underestimate Kothari.</p>
<p>The best way to illustrate this is to summarize my accurate but inadequate first reading of his book, and then to explain how a more careful examination, in the light of his later work, reveals subtleties and depths in <italic>Politics in India</italic> which were missed the first time round.</p>
<sec id="section1-2321023013482783">
<title>An Inadequate Assessment</title>
<p><italic>Politics in India</italic> is a crucially important guide to the first of three phases in India’s post-independence history—the period in which democratic institutions and a somewhat limited culture of political acco-mmodation were constructed and took root, a process that was both enabled and constrained by the Congress Party’s dominance. But it also helps mightily to frame analyses of the second phase—in which Indira Gandhi radically centralized power and undermined both the formal institutions of state and (astonishingly) her own party’s organization in pursuit of personal (and latterly, dynastic) rule.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-2321023013482783">1</xref></sup> It even offers a useful guide to the study of the third phase, since 1989 when it became impossible for any single party to win a majority in the Lok Sabha—during which power has flowed massively away from the Prime Minister’s Office (PMO), to other institutions at the national level, to the federal system and to governments and forces at the state level.</p>
<p>This becomes clear when we consider the topics in the first phase which Kothari examines—all of which were about to change. Diverse forces and ideas had been incorporated into the political system ‘not by imposing the dominant centre as a different and alien system but as an <italic>establishment</italic> in which diverse groups and individuals should try to find a place’. The national elite achieved this by:
<disp-quote>
<p>… seeking a consensus at various levels, respecting rival claims on the basis of electoral and competitive criteria, and structuring the diversity of Indian society into a network of linkages … (so that) the very concept of ‘dominance’ involved diversity and dissent. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-2321023013482783">Kothari, 1970</xref>, p. 429).</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In the second phase, Indira Gandhi’s assertive, uncompromising and destructive attempts at homogenization put paid to this. And yet the third phase since 1989 has been marked by a struggle to reconstruct something like this system, in the face of a more awakened electorate and greatly increased demands.</p>
<p>The first phase also witnessed the development of a ‘penetration and incorporation model of political integration’ (<italic>ibid</italic>., p. 430)—with much of the penetration into arenas at lower levels being accomplished by the formidable organization of the Congress Party. In phase two, Mrs Gandhi’s destruction of her own party’s organization made it unable to sustain its ‘penetration’ into society. And the tendency towards impositions and <italic>diktat</italic> from the apex of power undermined the system’s capacity for ‘integration’. In the third phase, this problem has remained acute because the Congress Party’s organization has not been rebuilt and nearly all other parties (including the Bharatiya Janata Party or BJP) lack organizations that can penetrate downward effectively.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-2321023013482783">2</xref></sup></p>
<p>The successes achieved in the first phase were possible partly because ‘the revolution of rising  expectations has hit no more than a tiny and dispossessed class of urban intellectuals’ (<italic>ibid</italic>., p. 431). This too changed—as a result, both, of a broad political awakening that was gradually occurring, and of Mrs Gandhi’s ‘tall promises’ which inspired expectations even among poor people. When she left those expectations largely unfulfilled, the awakening accelerated and turned truculent. That compounded the difficulty of governing, a problem that has been vividly apparent in the third phase since 1989.</p>
<p>Kothari then noted that in the first phase, India had avoided a tendency often seen in other developing countries towards ‘a single monolithic force, a personality or an ideology, seeking to collapse everything that stands in its way’ (<italic>ibid</italic>., p. 432). But this phrase—minus the ideology—is a good description of what was to emerge in phase two.</p>
<p>When crises arose in phase one,
<disp-quote>
<p>A mediatory style operated in (response to) each but the mediators were each time different. Functions and powers were shifted; new bargaining structures and formulae for resolution of crisis were instantly created … The dominant feature of crisis resolution is bargaining between actors (<italic>ibid</italic>., pp. 434–35).</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In phase two, the politics of bargaining was discarded. In phase three, it had become inescapable.</p>
<p>In phase one, Kothari found that ‘Firm and unwavering allegiances are not expected or demanded … Retribution and reprisal are not frequently used as sanctions’. (<italic>ibid</italic>., pp. 435–436). In the second phase, loyalty to the leader became the main criterion for political advancement, far more important than intelligence or political skills—as second—and then third and fourth rate people were promoted. Retribution was common. In the third phase, we have seen little of this at the national level as coalitions require accommodations. But ironically, in many states, power has been centralized and regional parties which are dominated by individual leaders follow something akin to the logic that Indira Gandhi introduced.</p>

<title>A More Adequate Assessment</title>
<p>If we consider Kothari’s writings in the period after the publication of <italic>Politics in India</italic>, we see things in that first book which the comments above—preoccupied as they are with events at the apex of the political system—largely overlook. As fundamental changes occurred in the political system after 1970, his focus and role changed accordingly. He still produced formidable political analyses. For example, in most years, he produced a seminal paper in the January issue of seminar. This writer looked forward eagerly to these since they always contained startling insights. But Kothari offered readers, and public affairs in India, much more than that.</p>
<p>There was a major shift in the tone of his writings. In <italic>Politics in India,</italic> it was apparent that he was passionately engaged with the great Indian drama, but in much of the book we hear the voice of a social scientist—standing back from the action, rather detached. He explained the young democracy’s achievements, but also provided telling comments on the ambiguities and problems that the political system faced, in great detail. And yet the former predominated, which the evidence from those years warranted. In the second phase, as he witnessed the destructive reversal of many earlier trends, his concern deepened and his tone acquired a much sharper critical edge and greater urgency. He offered warnings about unhealthy consequences—intentional or, often, blunderingly unintentional—of deinstitutionalization and the abandonment of the politics of bargaining and accommodation under Indira Gandhi. And increasingly, he searched for alternatives to the over-centralized state which was emerging.</p>
<p>This search was apparent in his writings, but it also impelled him to take action in order to identify constructive, humane alternatives and to help them to make an impact. Anyone who doubts his passionate engagement with the democratic process in <italic>Politics in India</italic> should consider what he did in that second phase. He worked to promote rights and civil liberties under an overweening state—before and amid the Emergency (during which he was briefly driven overseas), and thereafter. He sought to connect with, and to integrate the efforts of enlightened civil society organizations, by mounting the <italic>Lokayan</italic> project— which documented their efforts, and sought to integrate them and to facilitate their work— in what he called the ‘non-party political process’.</p>
<p>When non-Congress state governments in West Bengal (after 1977) and Karnataka (after 1983) began imaginative experiments with democratic decentralization (<italic>panchayati raj</italic>), he lent practical advice and explained the promise of this new trend in print. But this was not new. Democratic decentralization had long been one of his interests. In the early 1960s, he was a member of a discussion group that met occasionally with Prime Minister Nehru and dealt with (among other things) <italic>panchayati raj</italic>. Kothari was pleasantly surprised to discover that Nehru, the architect and pre-eminent figure of the central government, was an enthusiast for democratic decentralization—at a time when ‘few beyond Nehru and S.K. Dey were convinced of it’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-2321023013482783">Kothari, 1989</xref>, p. xxx). His advocacy of <italic>panchayati raj</italic> in the decades after <italic>Politics in India</italic> was published (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-2321023013482783">Kothari, 2002</xref>, pp. 131–132) and can be found in that book (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-2321023013482783">Kothari, 1970</xref>, pp. 130–133), if we read it carefully, without focusing (as the inadequate assessment above does) mainly on high politics.</p>
<p>We also find in <italic>Politics in India</italic> insights into other themes which gained great importance in his later writings, and more generally in Indian public life—themes which might have been omitted by a lesser analyst who knew that his main task was to explain the core elements of the political process. In more recent times, we have become accustomed to studies which examine social and political exclusion, especially in rural areas. But in <italic>Politics in India,</italic> there is a clear eyed acknowledgement that the Congress Party’s comparatively quite impressive penetration into rural areas before 1970 lacked depth in that ‘large masses were unaffected’ (<italic>ibid</italic>., p. 81).</p>
<p>In recent years, an incongruous cluster of three ideas has become more evident, accepted and discussed than before, but once again they are all there in <italic>Politics in India.</italic> Kothari argues that certain elements of India’s cultural tradition enabled elites (i) to ‘interpret tradition in a selective and creative fashion’, (ii) to impose their interpretation on the masses, and yet despite the imposition (iii) ‘Change and adaptation was … constantly possible …’ (<italic>ibid</italic>., p. 85). This resonates with reality today in which elite impositions persist—often invidiously—but structures are sufficiently adaptive to bend without breaking, so that some constructive change can occur.</p>
<p>We also find in that book another theme that has acquired depressing salience in recent times. Kothari writes: ‘The most important institutional rigidities were in the structure and orientations of the administrative bureaucracy, in the educational system, and in the attitudes towards law, legislation, and implementation’ (<italic>ibid</italic>., p. 87). These comments and others in that vein resonate powerfully with findings from extensive recent research by Rob Jenkins and this writer on the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act. It is a remarkably progressive piece of legislation, the design of which shows the Indian state at its best. But its implementation has revealed an acute allergy, especially below the state level, among bureaucrats (and many elected representatives) to transparency and downward accountability. Some of India’s most progressive and accomplished civil society leaders regard that allergy as the defining feature of the Indian state. That is putting it a little strongly, but it is certainly a prime example of the state at its worst—which deserves more attention from researchers since it may do as much damage as corruption.</p>
<p>Kothari’s observations on the complex interaction between caste and politics (<italic>ibid</italic>., pp. 230–237)<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-2321023013482783">3</xref></sup> also provide subtle insights that have shaped this writer’s recent work on the implications for power dynamics of the decline in the power of caste hierarchies over the thinking and action of many people in rural areas. And his discussion of ‘the Indian propensity for plural identities rather than a single overriding identity with central authority’ (<italic>ibid</italic>., p. 263) is highly relevant to much of the literature on Indian politics over the last two decades. It raises timely doubts about arguments that religious or caste (or more confusedly and confusingly, ‘ethnic’) identities were somehow taking over—arguments which have become less persuasive over the last eight or so years. Kothari’s insights are remarkable given both the early stage at which that book was written, and his preoccupation in it with core elements of the political process. It should be apparent by now that <italic>Politics in India</italic> is much more than mere introduction of the political system.</p>
<p>Most people become more conservative with age, but Kothari has—for good reasons, rooted in careful empirical study—grown (and that is the appropriate word) more radical (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-2321023013482783">Kothari, 2002</xref>, p. 114). We saw above that in the years after <italic>Politics in India</italic> was published, he became one of the most trenchant critics of politicians and the Indian state. He became, in some ways, deeply disaffected—not only in the era of PMO dominance (most of the years between 1971 and 1989), but in the less discouraging period thereafter. For example, in his <italic>Memoirs</italic>, he recalls that in 1999 (10 years after dominance from the apex of the political system became impossible), ‘we may already be reaching the limits of representative democracy in our efforts to bring about any real social change’. And three years later, in the <italic>Memoirs</italic>, he continues in that vein: ‘… we are witnessing a growing dichotomy between representation and participation-cum-citizenship’. He then quotes Benjamin Barber approvingly: ‘Representation destroys participation and citizenship even as it serves accountability and private rights’ (<italic>ibid</italic>., pp. 165–166).</p>
<p>At first glance, these comments appear to imply a profound, bleak disillusionment. Many other writers across the world who suffered a dramatic loss of confidence in the promise of central governments utterly rejected states and even democratic politics. But Kothari is too subtle and realistic to go down that road. He understands that governments will not go away, and that alternatives to them cannot—on their own—provide a sufficient way out of the dilemmas faced by societies. And crucially, he sees that governments and democratic processes retain some promise. Immediately after the quotations noted just above, he adds:
<disp-quote>
<p>With growing disillusionment with prevailing models of democracy, in particular representative democracy, and the slowly emerging aspirations for what could be called ‘genuine democracy’… there is taking place a newly inspired aspiration for transformative politics <italic>of which democracy could well become a legitimate instrument</italic>. (<italic>ibid</italic>., p. 166, <italic>emphasis added</italic>)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>So his disaffection is far from total. Some of the alternatives to centralized governance which he supports exist within the state—most notably <italic>panchayati raj</italic>. As he says elsewhere in the <italic>Memoirs</italic>, he arrived at:
<disp-quote>
<p>a combination of being a strong critic of the system as it operated and a strong believer in the possibilities of the political process throwing up a more truly liberating and emancipatory set of responses from the bottom of society and from oppressed sections within it … .(<italic>ibid</italic>., p. 26)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In other words, even though Kothari has written some of the most perceptive studies of the potential of civil society, and many of the most damning critiques of India’s dysfunctional political system, he has not joined less subtle commentators (including many enthusiasts for civil society) in turning their backs on democratic politics and on patent political realities. He has retained the baby while disposing of the bath water. What we see, both in <italic>Politics in India</italic> and thereafter, is a restless, imaginative, humane mind who never loses sight of solid evidence of the complex political realities in India—which inspires both distaste and hope.</p>
