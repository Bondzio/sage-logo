<sec id="sec1-0265691411428783x"><title>Glenda Dawn Goss, <italic>Sibelius: A Composer’s Life and the Awakening of Finland</italic>, University of Chicago Press: Chicago IL, 2009; 549 pp., 32 figures, 12 plates; 9780226304779, £38.00 (hbk)</title>
<p>Sibelius scholarship has grown over the past two decades. The narrative style in this study is accessible and rather compelling in that Goss tells a story that begins with an ‘unsolved mystery’ (why did Sibelius stop composing?) and a visit to the ‘scene of the crime’, Finland (4). Part one of the book outlines the historical context centred on Finland as an autonomous Grand Duchy of the Russian Empire. Part two considers the nationalist movement. Part three discusses social developments and modern art for ‘all the people’. Various themes are raised ranging from Lutheranism in Finland to the literary figures of Runeberg and Topelius. All the right ingredients are here, including Snellman’s political philosophy, Lönnrot’s compilation of Finnish folk texts that became the national epic, life in the garrison town of Hämeenlinna, nineteenth-century industrialization, and Sibelius’s studies and development as a composer. Goss discusses works such as the <italic>Kullervo Symphony</italic> and <italic>En Saga</italic> within the frameworks of the nationalist movement and other artistic activities in this era. She contextualizes <italic>En Saga</italic> in relation to Topelius’s use of the word ‘saga’ to refer to the ‘ancient history’ of the Finns and notes that the painter, Akseli Gallen-Kallela referred to sagas in his sketchbooks (176).</p>
<p>Taking up themes of industry and technology nods in the direction of social historical approaches within musicology that have highlighted the economic and institutional conditions for musical activities. A focus on the legacy of being part of the Russian Empire dominates the historical interpretation. Russian emperors are described in terms of their economic benevolence and even Sibelius benefits in acquiring from his uncle a violin that had travelled via St Petersburg. Chapter four explores imperial Helsinki and introduces one of Sibelius’s teachers, a Russian violinist called Mitrofan Wasiljeff. Through his influence the Franco-Belgian repertoire and the techniques of violinists such as Rode and Vieuxtemps, who had held posts in St Petersburg, shaped Sibelius’s violin playing and perhaps led to his change to the French form of his first name (72). This chapter concludes with another influential figure in Sibelius’s life, the Italian composer Busoni, who introduced the Finn to a world beyond the Russian Empire. But later in Sibelius’s life story we return to St Petersburg and to the third symphony, which is ‘out of sync’ with the creative work of Strauss or Mahler, but ‘fully in tune’ with Russian currents (341).</p>
<p>The emphasis on the creative conditions provided by Russian influence is tempered by a consideration of Finland’s geographic and cultural location between East and West (chapter five). Nevertheless, the book tends to represent Finland as ‘exotic’, though still a place where cultural life is created by external influences, including from central Europe (in relation to Sibelius’s studies in Vienna, for example). Goss repeats well-rehearsed views of Finland as a bridge between Russia and Sweden and of Finnish nationalism situated within broader intellectual currents in Europe. Despite constant references to the national epic, the <italic>Kalevala</italic>, the longer histories of cultural expressions in the Finno-Ugric region that also shaped the nationalist enterprise remain largely unexplored. In the concluding sections Goss returns to three pillars on which Finnish artists had constructed their identities: ‘mother Russia’, the Swedish language and the <italic>Kalevala</italic>. For Sibelius, religion also provided a pillar resulting in his two last symphonies. Restating the foundations of artistic life in Finnish nation-building is a way of returning to the mystery that Goss outlines at the start, but her responses regarding the reasons why Sibelius stopped composing are ultimately unconvincing. By the 1940s, he had become an institution, his self-image bound to the nation (437) and by the 1950s, the <italic>Kalevala</italic> was being theorized anew, which ‘must have fallen like hammer blows’ on Sibelius (441). There is probably still more to be said about creative processes and composers’ motivations.</p>
<p>In its portrait of Sibelius and Finnish nationalism this book provides broad brushstrokes rather than detailed historical, musical or political analysis. As such it is particularly appealing to the general reader as it gives an informative introduction to the contexts in which Sibelius composed. There are fascinating details for specialists too, though any study focused on Sibelius will be read with Tawaststjerna’s biography in mind, which still provides the first port of call for considering the life, work and historical background of this composer.</p>
