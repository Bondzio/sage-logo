<title>561 nm Laser Option for Gallios Flow Cytometers</title>
<graphic position="anchor" xlink:href="10.1177_1087057112469931-fig1.tif"/>
<p>A 561 nm laser option, available for new 561 nm laser–ready Gallios flow cytometers from Beckman Coulter Life Sciences, provides the ability to analyze a greater range of fluorescent proteins and to more efficiently excite PE/PE tandems. Optimal excitation is offered for red fluorescent proteins, such as mCherry and DsRed. Yellow-green excitation provided at 561 nm produces less autofluorescence in cells, increasing the signal-to-noise ratio for PE and DsRed detection. Because 561 nm excitation is well separated from fluorescein and green fluorescent protein (GFP) emission, there is virtually no crossover contamination in the green detection channel, allowing simultaneous fluorescein, or GFP detection, without blocking optics.</p>
<p>The new laser is externally coupled through an optical fiber and can be field installed on new Gallios 561 nm laser–ready analyzers. The 561 nm laser will be passed to the flow cell collinearly with the 488 nm laser during acquisition. Available configurations for the Gallios flow cytometers are 6 color/2 laser, 8 color/2 laser, 10 color/3 laser, and 10 color/4 laser, with the last configuration reflecting the 561 nm option. Six fluorescence detectors provide simultaneous acquisition of up to six fluorescence signals. Concurrent measurements of integral, peak, and width are available for all parameters, including scatter and fluorescence signals.</p>

<title>INFINITYHD 2 Megapixel Color Microscopy Camera</title>
<graphic position="anchor" xlink:href="10.1177_1087057112469931-fig2.tif"/>
<p>Lumenera’s second-generation version of the INFINITY<italic>HD</italic> camera now features three on-camera buttons for effortless access to power, white balance, and image capture. According to FRAMOS, the INFINITY<italic>HD</italic> high-definition scientific imaging solution offers full 1080p60 preview with superb color reproduction and fast frame rates. Engineered with a high-resolution 1/3″ CMOS sensor, this camera provides streaming video output over an HDMI connector, without the need for a computer. Real-time live video enables accurate focus and specimen placement, allowing for quicker slide reviews without any lag. Lumenera’s INFINITY<italic>HD</italic> digital camera is equipped with an on-board auto intensity compensation that automatically adjusts the video stream as the microscope objective or the light intensity regulates.</p>
<p>One key feature of the INFINITY<italic>HD</italic> is that the image capture (via USB) can be controlled either from the image-processing/storage PC or by the push button on the front of the camera, allowing a simple and effective combination of truly live video feed and image capture without the need for an expensive additional PC capture hardware.</p>

<title>MicroSpy Topo DT</title>
<graphic position="anchor" xlink:href="10.1177_1087057112469931-fig3.tif"/>
<p>According to Fries, this surface-measuring device combines a confocal microscope and a white light interferometer in a new compact design. Using the MicroSpy Topo DT, both flat and structured test pieces, which are either weakly or highly reflective, can be characterized in the same manner: on a noncontact and nondestructive basis within a few seconds. The optical measuring device images roughness, contour, and 3D topography with micro-resolution and nanometer resolution.</p>
<p>The new generation of the MicroSpy Topo DT possesses an adjustment range of 50 mm in height and 100 mm × 100 mm in area. Its rotating turret makes it possible to rapidly switch between different lenses with different magnifications. The turret can be equipped with up to six lenses at the same time for flexible deployment of the measuring device. Consequently, structures in the sub-nanometer range can be characterized with high lateral resolution.</p>
<p>Flat test piece surfaces such as lenses, glass, or wafers can be measured in white light interferometer mode. More markedly, structured surfaces can be analyzed in confocal mode. The device’s image analysis software allows analysis of the measurement results with regard to geometry, roughness, and evenness characteristics. Both modes are convincing in their variable measuring field size without any losses of resolution or high measuring speed. Large test pieces can also be measured precisely owing to the stitching function.</p>

<title>MetaXpress 5.0 High-Content Image Acquisition and Analysis Software</title>
<graphic position="anchor" xlink:href="10.1177_1087057112469931-fig4.tif"/>
<p>This new software is designed to improve the ease and speed of custom analysis using Molecular Device’s ImageXpress Micro and Ultra Systems. It enables user-created analysis to be run on MetaXpress PowerCore Soft-ware, which harnesses the speed of parallel processing and cuts analysis time from hours to minutes. An interactive tool incorporated into the software allows users to create custom analysis easily, without resorting to dedicated programming expertise. The system includes a total of 19 predesigned analysis routines, with the ability to freely add in custom steps to create a tailored analysis. MetaXpress 5.0 also features object click-to-find, allowing scientists to rapidly identify objects of interest within their images. Investigators can easily import data from third-party hardware and export measurements to a variety of formats with the new MDCStore Xchange Service plug-in.</p>

<title>VENTANA iScan HT Slide Scanner</title>
<graphic position="anchor" xlink:href="10.1177_1087057112469931-fig5.tif"/>
<p>According to Ventana, its new VENTANA iScan HT slide scanner is the most powerful high-throughput brightfield scanner in the anatomic pathology market today. With new optical focus and slide-handling technologies, the VENTANA iScan HT features include unprecedented throughput (the new system holds up to 360 slides and scans up to 80 slides per hour), superior quality images at 20× and 40× (580 and 1160 times actual magnification, respectively), and intuitive, efficient, and flexible workflow management, enabling a lab manager to load and unload slides while the scanner is in active operation.</p>
<p>The VENTANA iScan HT slide scanner is considered ideal for high-throughput, high-volume applications and complements the VENTANA suite of digital pathology solutions. The VENTANA iScan HT is integrated with VIRTUOSO for complete workflow management software functionality.</p>
