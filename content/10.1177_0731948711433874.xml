<abstract>
<p>Because high stakes are now attached to standardized assessments of student progress, policy makers, administrators, practitioners, and parents must understand how to most effectively and accurately measure the performance of all students, including students with learning disabilities (LD). To accomplish this, test accommodations are provided on an individual basis that are intended to mediate the impact of a student’s disability. The purpose of this article was to examine policy and guidelines related to accommodations among states and to review research related to the effectiveness of accommodations for students with LD. Findings showed that there continues to be large variability among states regarding allowed testing accommodations and that although there has been an increase in research conducted related to the effectiveness of accommodations for students with LD in the past decade, empirical evidence remains sparse and findings are often inconclusive. Implications are discussed.</p>

<body>
<p>Historically, students with disabilities were excluded from standardized testing and thereby from general education accountability systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0731948711433874">Tindal &amp; Fuchs, 1999</xref>). Concerns that students with disabilities would not receive the same intended benefits from these systems as their nondisabled peers resulted in the 1997 Amendments to the Individuals With Disabilities Education Act (IDEA), which required for the first time that students with disabilities be included in state testing programs. In 2004, IDEA was reauthorized as the Individuals With Disabilities Education Improvement Act, and additional language required that testing accommodations be provided to ensure that students with disabilities were appropriately included in testing programs originally designed without these students in mind (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0731948711433874">Thurlow, Lazarus, Thompson, &amp; Morse, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>Test accommodations are changes in standardized test conditions intended to lessen the impact of disabilities so that more accurate test score information can be obtained (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0731948711433874">Elliott, McKevitt, &amp; Kettler, 2002</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0731948711433874">Thurlow et al. (2005)</xref> identified five major accommodation categories: (a) <italic>timing</italic>—alternate test schedules (e.g., extended time), (b) <italic>response—</italic>alternative options for responding to the assessment (e.g., marking directly in the test booklet), (c) <italic>setting—</italic>changes to test surroundings (e.g., testing in a private room), (d) <italic>equipment and materials—</italic>the use of additional devices or references (e.g., calculators), and (e) <italic>presentation</italic>—alternate presentation of testing materials (e.g., reading the test aloud). When developing a student’s Individualized Education Program (IEP), teachers, parents, school administrators, related services personnel, and students (when appropriate) determine methods to improve educational results for the individual student, including needed testing accommodations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0731948711433874">Erickson &amp; Thurlow, 1996</xref>). For such accommodations to “level the playing field” for the student with a disability, the appropriate accommodation must be accurately determined. This task can be challenging, particularly when determining accommodations for students with learning disabilities (LD).</p>
<sec id="section1-0731948711433874">
<title>Students With LD</title>
<p>Since establishing LD as a category of special education in 1977, there has been a more than 200% increase in students identified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0731948711433874">Vaughn, Linan-Thompson, &amp; Hickman, 2003</xref>); as a result, it is currently the largest disability category with more than 2.5 million students served (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0731948711433874">U.S. Department of Education, 2007</xref>). The <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0731948711433874">National Center for Learning Disabilities (2009)</xref> described a <italic>learning disability</italic> as the “unexplained difficulty a person of at least average intelligence has in acquiring basic academic skills” (para. 1). An LD can affect listening, speaking, reading, writing, and mathematics. These skills, particularly math and reading, are directly measured on large-scale assessments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0731948711433874">Fuchs, Fuchs, Eaton, Hamlett, Binkley, et al., 2000</xref>). In addition, LD is often exhibited with underlying problems that are intertwined (e.g., deficits in written expression and reading) or comorbid with other disabilities (e.g., attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder).</p>
<p>Although accommodations are not assigned based on disability category, there are many accommodations that might be beneficial for students with LD who have specific learning challenges. For example, for a student who has deficits in processing speed, extending the length of time allowed to complete an assessment might be considered (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0731948711433874">Cohen, Gregg, &amp; Deng, 2005</xref>), whereas a student with visual motor deficits might be allowed to mark answers directly on the test booklet instead of a separate answer sheet (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0731948711433874">Tindal, Heath, Hollenbeck, Almond, &amp; Harniss, 1998</xref>). In addition, calculators may be considered for students with an LD that impedes basic calculations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0731948711433874">Bouck &amp; Bouck, 2008</xref>), whereas graphic organizers may be considered for students with deficits in written expression that make it difficult to organize ideas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0731948711433874">Berninger, Abbott, Augsburger, &amp; Garcia, 2009</xref>). Finally, using screens to reduce visual distractions might help mediate attention issues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0731948711433874">Fuchs, Fuchs, &amp; Capizzi, 2005</xref>), whereas reading a test aloud might help a student compensate for deficiencies in decoding and/or fluency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0731948711433874">Crawford &amp; Tindal, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>Determining accommodations for students with LD is especially difficult because of the heterogeneous nature of this population, which makes it difficult to group these students by characteristics of their disability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0731948711433874">Elbaum, Arguelles, Campbell, &amp; Saleh, 2004</xref>). As a result, it is not uncommon for teachers to overaccommodate or assign unprofitable accommodations for these students. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0731948711433874">Fuchs and Fuchs (2001)</xref> investigated the effectiveness of accommodations assigned by teachers for students with and without LD and found that teacher judgments about which students required accommodations did not correspond well to the students who actually profited from them. Accommodations were awarded to large percentages of students (reading [73%], math computations [65%], math applications [93%], and math problem solving [93%]); however, the percentages of students who actually profited from them was much lower (reading [41%], math computations [20%], math applications [32%], and math problem solving [42%]).</p>

<sec id="section2-0731948711433874">
<title>Accommodation Validity</title>
<p>In addition to accurately assigning accommodations that benefit students, IEP teams need to be cognizant of threats to validity associated with accommodations so that test scores of students with LD are interpreted accurately. Because an accommodation has the potential to falsify the product of standardized tests (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0731948711433874">Thurlow, Scott, &amp; Ysseldyke, 1995</xref>) and/or contribute to the misrepresentation of the resulting scores (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0731948711433874">Fuchs &amp; Fuchs, 2001</xref>), evidence is needed to determine whether scores from assessments administered with accommodations are valid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0731948711433874">Elliott et al., 2002</xref>). Therefore, it is important for IEP teams to consider whether a testing accommodation is likely to change the constructs being measured rather than measuring the same constructs as students tested in standard setting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0731948711433874">Fuchs, Fuchs, Eaton, Hamlett, Binkley, et al., 2000</xref>).</p>
<p>One way to determine the general validity of an accommodation is through well-controlled studies where results for students with and without disabilities are compared on standard versus accommodated administrations of parallel test forms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0731948711433874">Fuchs &amp; Fuchs, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0731948711433874">Tindal, 1998</xref>). When accommodations lead to greater score improvements for students with disabilities than for students without disabilities, it is referred to as “differential boost” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0731948711433874">Thompson, Blount, &amp; Thurlow, 2002</xref>). A well-controlled accommodation study supports validity if results indicate a differential boost for students with disabilities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0731948711433874">Fuchs &amp; Fuchs, 2001</xref>). It should be noted that even in well-controlled research studies, findings provide insight only to expected average performance and may not apply to each individual student. In fact, some researchers (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0731948711433874">Fuchs et al., 2000</xref>) have begun to investigate the effectiveness of data-based decision rules for accommodation assignments for students with LD. However, because typical IEP teams often make idiosyncratic decisions following vague decision-making rules and superficial variables (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0731948711433874">Erickson &amp; Thurlow, 1996</xref>), well-controlled studies can help inform decision makers about accommodations that are likely to provide a differential boost or, conversely, that should be considered with caution.</p>

<sec id="section3-0731948711433874">
<title>State Accommodation Policies</title>
<p>Although all states provide test accommodations for students with disabilities as required by federal law (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0731948711433874">IDEA, 2004</xref>), the amount and types of test accommodations provided are determined at the state level, and therefore, vary (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0731948711433874">Fuchs et al., 2005</xref>). In 2005, Thurlow et al. reviewed states’ testing accommodation policies, focusing on restricted and controversial accommodations (e.g., read-aloud, calculator, scribe), and tracked changes each state made between 1999 and 2001. Specifically, researchers examined how states made decisions about which accommodations should be allowed or prohibited and which groups of students should be eligible. Findings showed large variability. Some states allowed <italic>all</italic> students access to <italic>all</italic> test accommodations (e.g., Oregon), some states required that students have IEPs, 504 plans, or qualify as Limited English Proficiency to be eligible to receive accommodations (e.g., Minnesota), and some states allowed <italic>all</italic> students access to <italic>some</italic> accommodations while providing students with disabilities access to <italic>all</italic> allowable accommodations (e.g., California). This work provided a broad-sweep view of state participation and accommodation policies.</p>

<title>The Current Review</title>
<p>States rely on accountability systems that include standardized tests to monitor education outcomes of students. These tests are commonly referred to as “high stakes” because funding for schools is now dependent on assessment outcomes and also because increasingly, student graduation eligibility is being attached to performance on student performance on these measures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0731948711433874">Heubert &amp; Hauser, 1999</xref>). With such high stakes involved, it is especially important that policy makers, administrators, practitioners, and parents understand how to most effectively and accurately measure the performance of all students while preserving the validity of the test scores. For many students with disabilities, accommodations to standard testing are necessary to accurately measure the performance of these students. The purpose of this study was to (a) conduct a comprehensive review of the research literature on the effectiveness of testing accommodations for students with LD, and (b) review each state’s testing manual to determine the frequency of accommodations allowed among states throughout the country. Conducting these reviews simultaneously will illustrate the relationship between research findings of accommodation effectiveness and state policy related to allowed accommodations.</p>

<sec id="section5-0731948711433874" sec-type="methods">
<title>Method</title>
<p>This investigation was conducted in two phases. First, a literature review of research related to the effectiveness of test accommodations for students with LD was conducted. Next, state manuals were reviewed to determine the frequency of allowed test accommodations.</p>
<sec id="section6-0731948711433874">
<title>Literature Review Procedures</title>
<p>Studies were located using the PsychINFO, ERIC, EBSCO, and Google Scholar databases with systematic variations of the terms <italic>learning disability, high stakes testing, standardized test</italic>, and <italic>test accommodation</italic>. Ancestry and descendent searches were conducted using relevant studies and literature reviews (i.e., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0731948711433874">Chiu &amp; Pearson, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0731948711433874">Fuchs &amp; Fuchs, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0731948711433874">Gregg &amp; Nelson, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0731948711433874">Johnstone, Altman, Thurlow, &amp; Thompson, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0731948711433874">Koenig &amp; Bachman, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0731948711433874">Sireci, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0731948711433874">Sireci, Li, &amp; Scarpati, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0731948711433874">Thompson et al., 2002</xref>). Studies were included if (a) students were in grades 1 to 12, (b) students were identified as LD, and (c) studies focused on effectiveness of specific testing accommodations. If other students with disabilities were included in the sample, the majority of students needed to be identified as LD. As such, studies were not included if numbers of students with LD were not reported or findings for these students were not disaggregated (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0731948711433874">Tindal et al., 1998</xref>). Studies were excluded if the primary purpose was to (a) investigate classroom accommodations (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0731948711433874">MacArthur &amp; Haynes, 1995</xref>), (b) investigate multiple accommodations where a specific one could not be determined (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0731948711433874">Elliott, Kratochwill, &amp; McKevitt, 2001</xref>), or (c) investigate changes to the construct being measured (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0731948711433874">Lindstrom &amp; Gregg, 2007</xref>). Studies were reviewed for information about subjects (e.g., disability, grade), accommodation, measures (e.g., state test), methodology (e.g., well-controlled studies with comparisons between standard and accommodated administrations of parallel test forms, inclusion of students with and without disabilities), and findings (e.g., evidence of differential boost). Studies were then categorized by accommodation type.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-0731948711433874">
<title>State Manual Review Procedures</title>
<p>All state manuals were obtained from the National Center of Educational Outcomes website. Test accommodations allowed by each state were classified into five categories (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0731948711433874">Thurlow et al., 2005</xref>): <italic>timing, response, setting, equipment and materials</italic>, and <italic>presentation</italic>. If states used these categories, state classifications were used. If states did not use these categories (e.g., no equipment/materials), the accommodation was recategorized (e.g., spell checker recategorized as equipment/materials). Each accommodation was coded as follows: allowed (A), prohibited (P), or not specified (N). Restrictions on accommodations (e.g., read-aloud of the directions only during the reading section) were also recorded. A second researcher checked 10% of the state manuals for interrater reliability and had 90% agreement.</p>

<title>Timing Accommodations</title>
<sec id="section10-0731948711433874">
<title>How effective were timing accommodations?</title>
<p>Timing accommodations were studied in seven investigations (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0731948711433874">Table 2</xref>). Only two investigated effects of multiple testing sessions. In the first study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0731948711433874">Walz, Albus, Thompson, &amp; Thurlow, 2000</xref>), middle school students with and without LD were randomly assigned to take two different forms of the <italic>Minnesota Basic Standard Test</italic>. All students took the test twice, once in a 1-day administration and once in 3-day administration. Multiple sessions did not improve the test scores of students with LD; however, it negatively affected the test performance of general education students. In a second study, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0731948711433874">Crawford, Helwig, and Tindal (2004)</xref> investigated the effects of test administration over multiple days on the writing performance of elementary and middle school students with and without disabilities (LD = 48, mental retardation = 2). Students took two writing assessments. The first was the <italic>Oregon Statewide Assessment Test–Writing</italic>, which consisted of 50-min sessions on three consecutive days (Day 1: prompt selection and prewriting; Day 2: first draft; Day 3: draft editing using a state-provided list of editing/revising questions). The second was a researcher-developed writing prompt based on this state test. It consisted of one 30-min session. Results indicated that fifth-grade students with disabilities gained significantly more than general education students in the 3-day condition; however, in eighth grade, testing condition did not result in performance differences for either group of students. The remaining studies investigated extended time for tests of reading, math, and aptitude.</p>

<title>Reading</title>
<p>The effects of unlimited or fixed amounts of extended time during a test of reading were the focus of three investigations. The first two studies evaluated the performance of elementary school students with and without disabilities on the <italic>Iowa Test of Basic Skills</italic> (ITBS). In one study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0731948711433874">Munger &amp; Loyd, 1991</xref>), students took parallel versions of the ITBS under standard and accommodated conditions. Results from the Language and Usage section indicated no differences between student outcomes on timed versus untimed testing for students with or without LD. In another study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0731948711433874">Huesman &amp; Frisbie, 2000</xref>), students took the ITBS for the standard amount of time, their stopping point was marked, and then they were allowed additional testing time to complete the test. Difference scores between standard time and extended time were analyzed. Both groups of students improved with 20 min of extended time, but gains for students with disabilities were larger. A third study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0731948711433874">Lewandowski, Lovett, &amp; Rogers, 2008</xref>) evaluated the effects of extended time for high school students with and without LD on the <italic>Nelson–Denny Reading Test</italic> (NDRT). The NDRT was administered for standard time (13 min), students were asked to change pen colors, and then they were allowed extended time (50% additional time) to complete the exam. Although students with LD increased in number of items attempted and number of items correct, students without disabilities benefited more.</p>

<title>Mathematics</title>
<p>Two studies investigated fixed or unlimited amounts of extended time in math. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0731948711433874">Munger and Loyd (1991)</xref> investigated the effects of unlimited extra time on the performance of the Mathematics Concept test of the ITBS. In a well-controlled study (described in “Reading” section), no differences in performance were found when the accommodation was provided to either group of students. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0731948711433874">Cohen and colleagues (2005)</xref> used a standard differential item functioning analysis to detect accommodation-related differences in student performance for individual items on the <italic>Florida Comprehensive Assessment Test</italic> for ninth-grade math. Researchers randomly sampled students with LD who received extended time only and students without disabilities who received the standard administration. The accommodation was only marginally related to group differences in item-level performance suggesting that differences were related to student difficulty with the math concepts assessed.</p>

<title>Aptitude tests</title>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0731948711433874">Camara, Copeland, and Rothschild (1998)</xref> evaluated the effects of extended time for high school students on the <italic>Scholastic Aptitude Test</italic> under four conditions: (a) students without disabilities took the test twice under standard administration, (b) students with LD took the test twice with extended time, (c) students with LD first took the test under standard administration then with extended time, and (d) students with LD first took the test with extended time then under standard administration. Scores for students without disabilities were used to estimate score gains for students with LD. The increase in overall scores for students with LD was proportionate to the amount of extended time. Furthermore, students with LD profited the most when taking up to 76 min of extended time (double the amount of standard time).</p>

<sec id="section14-0731948711433874">
<title>How often were timing accommodations allowed?</title>
<p>Across all states, seven different timing accommodations were mentioned in state manuals. Extended time (<italic>n</italic> = 32) and frequent breaks were the most frequently allowed timing accommodations allowed by states (<italic>n</italic> = 35).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section15-0731948711433874">
<title>Relationship between research and policy</title>
<p>Although states allow seven types of timing accommodations, only studies that examined testing over multiple sessions or the use of extended time were located. Despite being one of the most frequently allowed accommodations, a majority of studies in our review found that a differential boost did not occur for students with disabilities. In addition, although one study examined the effects of multiple sessions, students with LD did not benefit, and further, the performance of general education students suffered. This suggests that IEP teams should be cautious when assigning this accommodation.</p>

<p>Only one response accommodation study was found (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0731948711433874">Table 3</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0731948711433874">MacArthur and Cavalier (2004)</xref> examined the effects of dictation to a scribe and a computer (using speech recognition software) compared with scores from standard administration of researcher-developed writing prompts. High school students with and without LD took the writing assessment under all three conditions. There was no significant interaction between students with and without LD regardless of test administration condition. However, for students with LD, results showed that gains from speech recognition software produced moderate effects, and gains from dictating to a scribe produced large effect.</p>

<title>How often were response accommodations allowed?</title>
<p>Thirteen different response accommodations were allowed across states. Nearly all states allowed assistive technology (<italic>n</italic> = 35), answers to be marked directly on the test booklet (<italic>n</italic> = 30), or the use of scribes without restrictions (<italic>n</italic> = 37). A few states (<italic>n</italic> = 4) allowed scribes with restrictions, such as allowing scribes only for multiple-choice items or specifically prohibiting scribes for writing sections.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section19-0731948711433874">
<title>Relationship between research and policy</title>
<p>Although states allow 13 types of response accommodations, research on their effectiveness is limited. In general, they tend to be labor intensive. For example, because students who are provided scribes need individual test settings, demands on school resources are particularly high (both in personnel and space). Therefore, more research on the effectiveness and validity of this accommodation is particularly needed as findings may help schools make decisions about how best to utilize resources.</p>

<p>Sixteen setting accommodations were mentioned across state manuals. Most states allowed individual or small group (<italic>n</italic> = 34) testing.

<title>Relationship between research and policy</title>
<p>Although setting accommodations have not currently been examined in the research, most states allow numerous setting options.

Students were given a series of researcher-developed writing tasks under standard or accommodated conditions: alphabet writing, sentence composing, and essay composing. Findings showed that students with and without LD did not differ in performance as a function of transcription modality (keyboard vs. pen) on any of the measures.</p>

<p>Three additional studies investigated the effects of calculators for middle school students with and without LD. Researchers developed parallel assessments with problem-solving questions from the Number and Operations Strand of the Principles and Standards for School Mathematics that were given in standard or accommodated conditions. In the first study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0731948711433874">Bouck &amp; Yadav, 2008</xref>), classes of students were randomly assigned to the accommodated condition during either the first or second test administration, whereas in the next two studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0731948711433874">Bouck, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0731948711433874">Bouck &amp; Bouck, 2008</xref>) no students used calculators during the first test administration, and classes of students were randomly assigned to a standard or accommodated condition for the second test administration. Graphing calculators were used in two of the studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0731948711433874">Bouck, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0731948711433874">Bouck &amp; Yadav, 2008</xref>), and a four-function calculator was used in the other (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0731948711433874">Bouck &amp; Bouck, 2008</xref>).

Twenty-six states allowed calculators with or without restrictions and 35 states allowed the use of keyboards; however, researchers in all studies reviewed concluded that calculators and keyboards may not be valid accommodations because they did not increase the performance of students with disabilities to a greater extent than for students without. These findings represent expected outcomes for the average student with LD, which does not mean that the use of these accommodations might not be appropriate for an individual student. Nevertheless, research findings suggest that caution should be used when interpreting student data when these accommodations have been assigned.</p>

<title>How effective were presentation accommodations?</title>
<p>Thirteen studies investigated presentation accommodations (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-0731948711433874">Table 5</xref>). The majority examined the effects of the read-aloud accommodation, whereas only two studied other types of presentation accommodations. One study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0731948711433874">Abedi et al., 2010</xref>) investigated the impact of breaking reading comprehension passages into shorter segments to maximize students’ working memory capacity and reduce fatigue during a long test. The reading comprehension test was created from reading passages from released state assessments. Students with and without LD were randomly assigned to take the test either with standard administration or with the accommodation (in addition to extended time when part of an individual student’s IEPs). After controlling for prior reading/language arts scores on the state test (<italic>California Achievement Test</italic> [CAT]), neither groups of students showed performance differences. In another study, Elbaum and colleagues (2004) examined the effects of allowing middle and high school students with and without LD to read a reading comprehension test aloud at their own pace. All students first took the test silently in their language arts period (group administered) and then took the accommodated test 2 to 3 weeks later individually in the school library. Overall performance did not differ between an accommodated and nonaccommodated condition for either groups of students. The remaining studies investigated the effectiveness of the read-aloud accommodation in reading, math, and other subjects (e.g., science).</p>

<title>Reading</title>
<p>Four studies were located that investigated the effects of the read-aloud during reading assessments. One study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0731948711433874">Fletcher et al., 2006</xref>) examined a package of accommodations: extending the test session into two blocks, reading of proper nouns, and reading of stems and possible responses from comprehension questions to students after students read the passages independently. Third graders with average reading ability or with dyslexia participated. Half of each group was randomly assigned to either the accommodated or nonaccommodated condition of the <italic>Texas Assessment of Knowledge and Skills</italic>. Accommodations improved performance in students with dyslexia but did not affect average decoders.</p>
<p>Three additional studies investigated the effect of the read-aloud when delivered using technology. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0731948711433874">Crawford and Tindal (2004)</xref> examined the effects of the read-aloud accommodation for elementary school students with and without disabilities (primarily LD) who were self-selected to participate. Every student took two parallel tests in the accommodated and nonaccommodated conditions. The read-aloud was delivered via video administration where a research assistant read each reading passage, question, and answer choices on television as the students followed along in their test booklets. Although all students benefited, students with disabilities improved significantly more than general education students and Title 1 students. In another study, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0731948711433874">Kosciolek and Ysseldyke (2000)</xref> conducted a small study with elementary school students with and without disabilities (LD = 9, emotional/behavioral disorder = 4, speech/language = 1). Students took two equivalent forms of the CAT in small groups, once with the read-aloud via audiocassette (with marking in the test booklet) and once without. Neither groups of students significantly benefited from the read-aloud accommodation. Finally, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0731948711433874">Laitusis (2010)</xref> investigated the effectiveness of the read-aloud in a study in which students used CD players with headphones and marked their answers directly in the test booklet during test administration. Elementary (fourth grade) and middle school (eighth grade) students with and without specific reading-based LD took the <italic>Gates–McGinitie Reading Tests</italic> once during a standard administration and once with accommodations. Both groups of students showed a significant performance gain at both grade levels, with students with LD having greater gains than students without disabilities even when controlling for fluency and ceiling effects.</p>

<sec id="section31-0731948711433874">
<title>Mathematics</title>
<p>Six studies were located that evaluated effects of the read-aloud on math tests which, unlike reading tests, do not attempt to directly measure reading ability. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0731948711433874">Weston (2003)</xref> examined the effects of the read-aloud for elementary school students with and without LD on the math section of the <italic>National Assessment of Educational Progress</italic>. Students took parallel versions of the test under standard and accommodated conditions. Both groups of students significantly benefited from the read loud, but the gains for students with LD were much larger. However, findings also showed that when evaluating students with LD and general education students as a whole, students with higher reading abilities (determined by performance on a pretest) gained less under the read-aloud condition. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0731948711433874">Johnson (2000)</xref> also evaluated the effects of the read-aloud for elementary school students. Parallel versions of the <italic>Washington Assessment of Student Learning</italic> were used in three conditions: (a) general education students took the test twice without accommodations, (b) general education students took the test first under standard administration and then with the read-aloud, and (c) students with LD first took the test with the read-aloud and then under standard administration. Results indicate that reading the math test to students without disabilities had no effect on performance, and students with LD performed better with the read-aloud. In another study, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0731948711433874">Elbaum (2007)</xref> sampled middle and high school students with and without LD to evaluate the effectiveness of read-aloud. All students took parallel versions of the test (created by the researchers based on fifth-grade state standards) under standard and accommodated conditions in which test forms and order of test conditions were counterbalanced. Results indicated that both groups of students benefited from the accommodation with general education students profiting more than students with LD.</p>
<p>Three other studies investigated the effects of the read-aloud delivered using technology. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0731948711433874">Helwig, Rozek-Tedesco, and Tindal (2002)</xref> investigated read-aloud via video in which words were simultaneously displayed on the monitor. Elementary (fourth and fifth grades) and middle (seventh and eighth grades) school students with and without LD participated. Researchers developed two assessments from seventh-grade math state test items that students took under standard or read-aloud conditions. Elementary students with LD who took the test first under standard administration and then with read-aloud performed better than general education students when they received the read-aloud; however, there were no differences between groups of students when they took the test first with read-aloud and then under standard administration. In contrast, regardless of test administration order, seventh-grade general education students performed better than students with LD when they received the read-aloud, and at eighth grade, there were no differences between groups. Another study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0731948711433874">Hollenbeck, Rozek-Tedesco, Tindal, &amp; Glasgow, 2000</xref>) investigated two technology-based versions of the read-aloud: (a) a teacher-paced video in which the teacher controlled the read-aloud for the entire class while the students watched a video screen for instructions, and (b) a student-paced computer in which the students accessed the read-aloud independently at their own computers. Middle school students with and without LD took parallel versions of a multiple-choice math test (based on the items from a state test) under standard and accommodated conditions. Although performance improved for students with LD, general education students outperform them under both accommodated conditions. Finally, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0731948711433874">Calhoon, Fuchs, and Hamlett (2000)</xref> conducted a study with high school students with LD. Researchers used alternate problem-solving performance assessments based on third-grade curriculum to compare standard test administration with three read-aloud administrations: (a) teacher-read text, (b) computer-read text, and (c) computer-read text with video. All three methods were beneficial over standard administration for students with LD, but there were no differences between types of read-aloud.</p>

<title>How often were presentation accommodations allowed?</title>
<p>Across states, 23 presentation accommodations were mentioned. The majority of states allowed presentation accommodations like low vision aids (e.g., magnifying devices) and colored overlays to reduce glare, but there was large variability related to the read-aloud with the most frequently mentioned restrictions in reading. Specifically, a few states allowed read-aloud for all subject areas without restrictions (<italic>n</italic> = 8), whereas others prohibited the accommodation on the reading section only (<italic>n</italic> = 21), reported the results as “nonstandard” (<italic>n</italic> = 2), or allowed the accommodation on the reading section only with specific restrictions (e.g., test questions read-aloud; <italic>n</italic> = 2). Read-aloud in other subject areas was more consistent, where the majority of states allowed it without restrictions (<italic>n</italic> = 39).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section34-0731948711433874">
<title>Relationship between research and policy</title>
<p>Although numerous presentation accommodations are allowed across states, current research has focused primarily on the read-aloud. These studies have resulted in inconclusive findings about the effectiveness of the read-aloud in general. However, because the read-aloud is one of the most complex accommodations, there may be other plausible explanations for these seemingly mixed findings, including methodological differences between studies, reading demands of the test items, reading skill of participating students, how proficiently the tester reads aloud, and/or type of technology used. Additional research on this controversial accommodation is needed. Research on other types of presentation accommodations is limited, and as such, more research in this area is also needed.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Research on accommodation effectiveness has steadily increased since the 1997 amendments to IDEA; yet, our search yielded a relatively small number of studies. In general, accommodations that have been more widely investigated (e.g., the read-aloud) have generated a lack of conclusive findings related to effectiveness. The review of state manuals, like earlier reviews (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0731948711433874">Thurlow et al., 2005</xref>), showed great variability in testing accommodations allowed among states. Although all states allow test accommodations for students with disabilities, there is a lack of general consensus about which specific ones to allow, restrict, or prohibit. As a result, students with disabilities do not necessarily have access to the same types of accommodations from state to state. Together, these findings have important implications for practice.</p>
<p>First, our findings show that states often allow accommodations for which research is currently very limited or nonexistent. For example, all states allow numerous types of setting accommodations (e.g., alternate test location); however, there is not an evidence base to support these accommodations. States also allow numerous types of response accommodations (e.g., dictate responses into recorder); however, only one study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0731948711433874">MacArthur &amp; Cavalier, 2004</xref>) that investigated the use of scribes was located. These findings illustrate the need for researchers to investigate the efficacy of accommodations that are frequently permitted throughout the country.</p>
<p>Next, research findings may be difficult for schools to interpret when results across studies are mixed. For example, on the surface, findings for the read-aloud accommodation seem inconsistent. However, the research on this accommodation is especially diverse. In addition to investigating the efficacy of this intervention for both tests that assess reading (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0731948711433874">Crawford &amp; Tindal, 2004</xref>) and those that assess other content areas such as math (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0731948711433874">Elbaum, 2007</xref>), researchers have investigated a variety of modalities for delivering the read-aloud including, audio (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0731948711433874">Kosciolek &amp; Ysseldyke, 2000</xref>), video (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0731948711433874">Helwig et al., 2002</xref>), and computer administration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0731948711433874">Calhoon et al., 2000</xref>). These study characteristics, and the quality of the research design, need to be considered when evaluating results. Although more studies have been conducted on the read-aloud than on other accommodations, many questions remain. Until this body of research develops, IEP teams should reference evidence on the effectiveness of this accommodation for an individual student in classroom-testing situations before making a determination whether to provide it to the student in a high-stakes testing situation.</p>
<p>In addition, schools need to be particularly aware that in some studies the scores of a small portion of students with LD were negatively impacted by IEP accommodations provided. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0731948711433874">Elbaum et al. (2004)</xref> found that the read-aloud was detrimental to performance during a reading test where 20% of students with LD performed worse under the accommodated condition, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0731948711433874">Elbaum (2007)</xref> found that about 8% of students with LD performed significantly poorer when provided the read-aloud during a math test. Findings like these are significant because they contradict the common assumption of practitioners that accommodations benefit all children who received them. Although it is plausible that such accommodations might help an individual student, IEP teams need to take caution before awarding these types of accommodations.</p>
<p>Finally, findings from research also have implications at the broader state level. For example, several studies investigated the effectiveness of calculators for students with LD and found that this accommodation did not increase the performance of students with disabilities to a greater extent than for students without. Similarly, the majority of existing research showed that extended time did not improve performance for students with LD. In fact, one study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0731948711433874">Lewandowski et al., 2008</xref>) found that general education students benefited more than students with LD on a norm-referenced reading test. When these types of results occur, instead of “leveling the playing field” for these students, the gap in achievement will appear to increase between students with and without disabilities. Findings like these also have implications for the validity of the accommodation itself which in turn impacts the interpretation of student performance data. Given the high-stakes nature of state tests in particular, it is imperative to have confidence in the interpretation of student results.</p>
<sec id="section36-0731948711433874">
<title>Future Research</title>
<p>To better align state policy with research, future research should continue to carefully examine the effectiveness of accommodations that are already allowed by states through well-controlled studies. Although research on the effects of accommodations has increased over the past decade, there continue to be some test accommodations widely offered across states for which no research at the K–12 level is available. Even for accommodations such as scribes and spell checkers that are considered controversial (i.e., accommodations that are suspected to alter the construct being measured), there is currently a lack of research. In addition to research on effectiveness and validity of accommodations, cost-benefit analyses are also needed for accommodations that are particularly demanding on school resources. For example, setting accommodations (e.g., individual testing) typically require more personnel and allocated testing locations. Although states do not rely solely on research to make accommodation decisions for individual students, research can certainly be used to help inform such decisions. Therefore, researchers should examine the effectiveness of accommodations frequently used by states, thereby creating a bidirectional relationship between research and practice.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section37-0731948711433874">
<title>Implications for Practice</title>
<p>Best practice requires that students be allowed to use the same accommodation on formal assessments as they use on a regular basis in classroom settings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0731948711433874">Elliott et al., 2001</xref>). However, IEP teams generally make accommodation decisions based on vague policy rules or focus on superficial variables (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0731948711433874">Fuchs &amp; Fuchs, 2001</xref>). Furthermore, research indicates that students are often overaccommodated, meaning that they receive accommodations that do not benefit them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0731948711433874">Fuchs &amp; Fuchs, 2001</xref>). A possible explanation for these ineffective decisions is the discrepancy between the large number of accommodation options available and the relatively small amount of research about accommodation effectiveness to inform their use. Because students and schools are being held accountable for student outcomes, IEP teams need to be current in knowledge of accommodations and how they impact students on tests that are high stakes. Results of the current review indicate that caution should be taken when determining appropriate testing accommodations. IEP team members need to be aware that for some students, accommodations may not be beneficial or could even hinder performance, making a student’s results less valid. Conversely, if awarded accommodations cause students with disabilities to obtain inflated scores, appropriate pressure will not be placed on the school system to improve instruction for these students.</p>
