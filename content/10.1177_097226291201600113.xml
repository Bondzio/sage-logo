<p>What is the return on investment (ROI) of training programmes that are conducted? Is there really a way in which the ROI could be measured? How do we know that learning happened and how do we know that the business performance has improved?</p>
<p>All efforts in an organization should lead to a competitive advantage. A competitive advantage implies either an increase in the ability to charge a higher price or lowering costs. Training efforts are an investment, unlikely to reduce costs in the short term but can significantly increase the ability to charge a higher price even in the short term. Therefore, the ROI of the training effort is critical to understand.</p>
<p>Every professional, whether in Human Resources or otherwise, intuitively understands the power of training in building the capability of an employee. However, the impact of any interventions in the actual change in capability as well as the cost-benefit analysis, though a subject matter of great research and study, has always been mystifying in rupee terms.</p>
<p>There is a significant literature available on resources consumed by training and its effectiveness. Many training managers would believe that they are on trial from the businesses to show the return on investment.</p>
<p>The most popular of the existing models is the Kirkpatrick model (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.kirkpatrickpartners.com">www.kirkpatrickpartners.com</ext-link>) which has attempted to define a framework for measuring training effectiveness.</p>
<p>This book by Ron Stone is a significant addition to the available literature. It helps us understand the key aspects of measuring ROI of training and improving it. It is an important contribution to understanding and dealing of changing paradigms in human resources management.</p>
<p>Business decisions are made on the ROI of an effort. ROI is a single metric for indicating the value of the effort. <italic>Per se</italic>, training can have multiple benefits. Beyond capability building, training efforts enhance engagement of the employee.</p>
<p>However, Stone in this book is focused on improving this key metric of ROI. He has made a great effort in listing out the steps and key drivers at each step of the entire process. Each step of the engagement between the business and the HR business partner is carefully analyzed. Each conversation is of immense value in understanding the actual problem that needs to be addressed. The focus on understanding the problem and the effect of the training solution and subsequent interventions to enhance performance leading to an improved ROI has been underscored throughout the book in every chapter.</p>
<p>The essence is captured very well in the first two chapters where Stone builds the case for measuring ROI. He points out that training professionals spend too much of their attention on learning and not enough on performance. Throughout the book he writes about how training professionals can avoid the pitfalls of getting excessively focused on the process of learning rather than the end outcomes. He explains it lucidly through the use of examples. For trained professionals, there is a lot of learning in the way. Stone describes the process of collecting and analyzing the project data, measuring the training results and evaluating and communicating business outcomes.</p>
<p>In the initial chapters, he makes a key point that a training solution should focus on the design for performance, with learning being a central key but not the only contributor. He focuses on partnering with the sponsor of the project to clarify expectations and conducting front end performance analysis. He makes the point regularly that training alone has limited potential to influence performance settings in the workplace and therefore other strategies which he terms as companion strategies essential to build and influence the desired execution. In a sense, he encourages training managers to go beyond training and look at the picture at a macro level. Training is essentially only a subset of the entire intervention that needs to be worked to get the desired outcome in the target audience.</p>
<p>This detailed root cause analysis would force training managers to look at their role as much more than just designing and executing a training programme. It is now understood and widely accepted that development of individuals is a function of mentoring/coaching, projects or assignments and training, with training being the least influential in terms of its immediate impact.</p>
<p>The power of Stone’s arguments is compelling as many training managers end up developing solutions which are limited in the scope of their impact.</p>
<p>Stone’s subsequent chapters detail out the steps in designing in great detail. He discusses in the great detail the process of clarifying stakeholder expectations and analyzing the current performance data. This is a process which is often ignored by training managers. Asking the right questions is essential to understand the root causes beyond what is articulated by the client.</p>
<p>Once this concept is understood, Stone further makes the distinction between causal influence and sustained impact. This is an imperative to come up with the right design. He then moves on to assigning a monetary value to the business outcome that would be achieved through the outcome.</p>
<p>In essence, Stone is pushing for designing interventions through training or other strategies which would make the question of ROI of training programmes irrelevant though he does not specifically mention it in so many words. The fact is that the question of ROI comes up when decision makers do not see a distinct cost-value equation favourably of training solutions. The point of the book is that a properly designed solution could impact business performance in such a significant way that the ROI question could be superfluous.</p>
<p>This book is a must read for training and human resources professionals engaged in the design and delivery of training programmes. It goes beyond Kirkpatrick’s model. It would help the reader move from simple training to delivery to viewing training as an effective intervention leading to a very different result for the business.</p>
