<abstract>
<p>Government representation of public opinion is a central component of democracy. Previous studies have documented a robust congruence between aggregated public opinion and public policies in the American states. However, an equally important question for evaluating the quality of democracy is “Who does government respond to when formulating public policies?” I investigate differential policy representation based on citizens’ household incomes and find that citizens with low incomes receive little substantive political representation (compared with more affluent citizens) in the policy decisions made by their state governments. This unequal policy representation occurs for both the general liberalism of state policies and on specific social issues like the death penalty and abortion. These findings suggest that examining the variation in political inequality across the 50 states can help scholars to better understand and explain “unequal democracy” in the United States.</p>

<p>Government representation of public opinion is the cornerstone of American democracy. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1532673X11416920">Key (1961)</xref> put it, “Unless mass views have some place in the shaping of policy, all the talk about democracy is nonsense” (p. 7). Over the past 50 years, political scientists using various research techniques have compiled strong empirical evidence that government policies tend to correspond to the aggregated political opinions of the public at both the national (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1532673X11416920">Erikson, MacKuen, &amp; Stimson, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1532673X11416920">Monroe, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1532673X11416920">Page &amp; Shapiro, 1983</xref>) and state levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1532673X11416920">Erikson, Wright, &amp; McIver, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1532673X11416920">Hill &amp; Hinton-Anderson, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1532673X11416920">Nice, 1983</xref>; for a review, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1532673X11416920">Burstein, 2003</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1532673X11416920">1</xref></sup></p>
<p>However, an equally important question for evaluating the quality of democracy is “Who do elected officials respond to when making public policy decisions?” While the robust congruence between aggregate public opinion and policy is encouraging from a democratic theory standpoint, it is also likely that some citizens tend to have their political opinions better represented than others. If so, then concerns that the United States is increasingly an “unequal democracy” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1532673X11416920">Bartels, 2008</xref>) may be quite warranted. This article uses the variation in citizens’ opinions and public policies across the American states to examine whether state governments respond to their citizens as political equals. Specifically, I ask whether citizens with low incomes are underrepresented by the policy decisions made by state governments when compared with more affluent citizens.</p>
<sec id="section1-1532673X11416920">
<title>Background</title>
<p>Political scientists and political observers more generally have long warned that political representation in the United States is tainted by an upper-class bias such that wealthier citizens have more influence over government policy decisions than the poor (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1532673X11416920">Dahl, 1961</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-1532673X11416920">Schattschneider, 1960</xref>). The most common theoretical explanation for unequal political representation is the fact that the more affluent tend to participate more in politics—whether it be voting, contributing to or volunteering for a campaign, contacting elected officials, or any other participatory act—compared with disadvantaged citizens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-1532673X11416920">Rosenstone &amp; Hansen, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-1532673X11416920">Verba &amp; Nie, 1972</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-1532673X11416920">Verba, Schlozman, &amp; Brady, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-1532673X11416920">Wolfinger &amp; Rosenstone, 1980</xref>). If elected officials are more responsive to citizens who actively get involved in politics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1532673X11416920">Griffin &amp; Newman, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1532673X11416920">Martin, 2003</xref>) and affluent citizens are significantly more likely to get involved than citizens with low incomes, then the fact that elected officials are more responsive to the political opinions of their high-income constituents should come as no surprise.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1532673X11416920">2</xref></sup> As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-1532673X11416920">Verba et al. (1995)</xref> predicted in their seminal study of political participation, “inequalities in activity are likely to be associated with inequalities in governmental responsiveness” (p. 14).</p>
<p>However, as the American Political Science Association Taskforce on Inequality and American Democracy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1532673X11416920">Jacobs &amp; Skocpol, 2005</xref>) recently lamented, “Unfortunately, political scientists have done surprisingly little to investigate the extent of actual inequalities of government responsiveness to public opinion—that is, whether distinct segments of the country exert more influence than others” (p. 124). Although political scientists have devoted considerable attention to documenting unequal political participation, or “inputs” into the political system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1532673X11416920">Hill &amp; Leighley, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-1532673X11416920">Piven &amp; Cloward, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-1532673X11416920">Verba, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-1532673X11416920">Verba et al., 1995</xref>), most have tended to shy away from actually assessing whether elected officials equally weigh their constituents’ opinions when making important policy decisions.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-1532673X11416920">3</xref></sup> As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1532673X11416920">Bartels (2008)</xref> aptly points out, “For the most part, scholars of political participation have treated actual patterns of government responsiveness as someone else’s problem” (p. 253).</p>
<p>A series of very recent studies have sought to correct this problem and more fully understand unequal political representation in the United States. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1532673X11416920">Jacobs and Page (2005)</xref> use parallel opinion surveys of the public and political elites to show that internationally oriented business leaders leverage more influence over American foreign-policy decisions than the opinions of the general public. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1532673X11416920">Gilens (2005)</xref> collects data from nearly 2,000 individual public opinion poll questions and finds that subsequent federal government policy decisions disproportionately reflect the views of the affluent, and this is especially true when the preferences of the rich and poor diverge. He concludes that congruence between the political opinions of the poor and government policy tends to arise only in instances where the poor share similar attitudes with the wealthy. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1532673X11416920">Bartels (2008)</xref> examines the link between political factors and growing economic inequality and demonstrates that the opinions of affluent constituents strongly predict the voting behavior of their Senators (both their revealed general voting ideology and specific roll-call votes), whereas the opinions of those with low incomes display little or no relationship. In short, this emerging literature points to “unequal democracy” in American politics.</p>
<p>Amid growing evidence at the national level, scholars are only beginning to identify and investigate unequal political representation at the state level.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-1532673X11416920">4</xref></sup> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-1532673X11416920">Rigby and Wright (2011)</xref> uncover evidence that the general ideological tone of state economic policies tend to be most responsive to the opinions of the rich and hardly at all to the poor.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-1532673X11416920">5</xref></sup> In contrast, they find more egalitarian political representation using a summary measure of state policy on social issues such as abortion, the death penalty, and laws intended to combat discrimination based on sexual orientation. One shortcoming of their study is that it fails to assess the equality of political representation on <italic>specific policy issues</italic>, instead opting to assess the correspondence between aggregated measures of both opinion and policy. This current study improves on Rigby and Wright’s findings by (a) assessing unequal political representation for specific state policies and (b) subjecting the differences in responsiveness to each income group to more rigorous statistical scrutiny.</p>
<p>That we know so little about the equality of political representation in the states is surprising when one surveys the expansive American state politics literature (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1532673X11416920">Gray &amp; Hanson, 2008</xref>). Many state government policy decisions have an immediate and direct impact on citizens’ daily lives and, moreover, the policymaking process in the states presents a narrower arena of political conflict which (potentially) provides greater opportunity for powerful economic interests to dominate the legislative process and bias policy responsiveness toward the opinions of the wealthy. So there are compelling reasons to further examine the equality of political representation in the American states and investigate if the political inequality documented at the national level extends similarly to the states.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-1532673X11416920">
<title>Do Citizens With Different Incomes Have Different Political Opinions?</title>
<p>Studies that assess unequal political representation are built on the fundamental premise that the “haves” and “have-nots” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1532673X11416920">Key, 1949</xref>) possess different opinions about what the government should do in concrete policy areas like health care, education, tax policy, and income assistance to the poor. This expectation of differences in opinion across income groups and social classes has been the guiding premise for the recent studies of unequal political representation in the United States discussed above (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1532673X11416920">Bartels, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1532673X11416920">Gilens, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1532673X11416920">Jacobs &amp; Page, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-1532673X11416920">Rigby &amp; Wright, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>Why would we expect citizens with different incomes to have different political opinions? First, people with different incomes have, by definition, different material circumstances and, therefore, different interests in regard to how the government can assist them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1532673X11416920">Hacker, 2002</xref>). For example, whereas in a wealthy household there is likely little concern about day-to-day survival and purchasing basic consumer goods, this can become a persisting and daily anxiety for people further and further down the nation’s income distribution. As a consequence, people with lower incomes are likely to support more active government intervention into the economy to reduce this anxiety by providing a social safety net and protections against joblessness, food insecurity, or losing one’s health insurance. Economic self-interest, then, likely leads people with low incomes to adopt policy opinions that call for an expanded role for government in ensuring a basic standard of living. Put simply, different life experiences between the affluent and the poor likely lead them to adopt different opinions on basic political questions about the government’s role in the economy.</p>
<p>A second reason that political opinions likely vary across income groups derives from the fact that, in general, a person’s social networks are closely tied to their own economic status. Living in an affluent neighborhood and socializing in an environment primarily made up of others from affluent backgrounds helps to crystallize similar political views (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1532673X11416920">Baldassarri &amp; Bearman, 2007</xref>). In the same way, living in a low-income neighborhood composed largely of people from disadvantaged backgrounds will have the same crystallizing effect on opinions. If so, then the increasing economic segregation in housing patterns in the United States (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1532673X11416920">Dreier, Mollenkopf, &amp; Swanstrom, 2001</xref>) may lead to increasing consolidation of opinions among citizens with similar economic situations as citizens essentially “sort” themselves by socioeconomic status (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1532673X11416920">Bishop, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1532673X11416920">Gimpel &amp; Schuknecht, 2001</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1532673X11416920">2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1532673X11416920">Jargowsky, 1996</xref>).</p>
<p>Third, the two major political parties in the United States at least partly target their policy messages and mobilization efforts based on demographic characteristics like income status. Given that Democrats traditionally receive greater support among citizens with low incomes while more affluent individuals tend to give greater support to the Republican Party (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1532673X11416920">Bartels, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1532673X11416920">Gelman, Park, Shor, Bafumi, &amp; Cortina, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1532673X11416920">McCarty, Poole, &amp; Rosenthal, 2006</xref>), the two parties do what we would expect vote-maximizing agents to do by identifying this preexisting support and targeting their electoral messages accordingly. To the extent that the political signals sent by campaigns and elected officials help to shape and inform the political preferences of the public (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1532673X11416920">Hill &amp; Hurley, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1532673X11416920">Hurley &amp; Hill, 2003</xref>), these targeted efforts by political parties may serve to further reinforce and even exacerbate preference differences across income groups.</p>
<p>Despite these reasons to expect citizens with different incomes to adopt different political opinions, the premise has recently come under increased scrutiny. In an article appropriately titled “On the Limits to Inequality in Representation,” <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-1532673X11416920">Soroka and Wlezien (2008)</xref> compare citizens’ opinions on government spending and find that “differences in preferences across income brackets are in fact small and insignificant” (p. 319), especially when compared with differences across education levels and partisan identification. Using General Social Survey (GSS) data from 1973 to 2004, they show that across income terciles, roughly the same proportion of respondents think the government is spending “too little” (compared with “too much”) on defense, foreign aid, education, health, cities, crime, and the environment.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-1532673X11416920">6</xref></sup> They do, however, find rather large differences in opinion about welfare spending (an area where one might expect income to strongly predict preferences), with citizens in the lowest income tercile much less supportive of cuts to welfare compared with the middle and upper terciles. In general, however, they conclude that concerns about unequal representation that arise from the premise that the rich and poor have different political opinions are exaggerated.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-1532673X11416920">7</xref></sup></p>
<p>In contrast, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1532673X11416920">Gilens (2009)</xref> takes advantage of nearly 2,000 individual polling items and finds substantial “preference gaps” between the rich and the poor (defined as citizens at the ninetieth and tenth income percentiles, respectively). These differences in opinion are especially large for welfare spending and the government’s role in income redistribution. For example, Gilens documents differences of over 30% points between the rich and poor for opinions on welfare spending, the generosity of unemployment benefits, and employer health insurance mandates (with poor citizens favoring increased government spending/intervention for each issue). Given these findings, Gilens concludes that “preferences across income groups do differ by significant amounts on a large range of issues. Consequently, it is hard to escape the conclusion that public policy in the United States would look rather different if poor Americans had the influence over government policy that affluent Americans appear to enjoy” (p. 340).</p>
<p>The following analysis evaluates the extent to which state policies are differentially representative of the ideology and opinions of citizens with different incomes. Before conducting the analysis, however, I also illustrate the extent to which political ideology and policy opinions differ across income groups within each state. These differences are central for the study of income inequality and political representation because if the rich and poor have similar ideologies and policy preferences, there would be little reason to be concerned about an upper-class bias in policymaking. In short, if political opinions do not differ, then assessing unequal political representation is of little normative or practical consequence.</p>

<title>Evaluating the Equality of Political Representation</title>
<p>Although political representation is central for American democracy, there is little consensus on how best to measure the concept. Accordingly, political scientists have experimented with a variety of different ways of assessing the link between the people and their government (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1532673X11416920">Achen, 1978</xref>). One crucial distinction is whether public opinion is compared with the roll call voting behavior of individual elected officials (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1532673X11416920">Achen, 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1532673X11416920">Bartels, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1532673X11416920">Clinton, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1532673X11416920">Miller &amp; Stokes, 1963</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-1532673X11416920">Powell, 1982</xref>) or with public policy outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1532673X11416920">Erikson et al., 1993</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1532673X11416920">2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1532673X11416920">Page &amp; Shapiro, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-1532673X11416920">Wlezien, 2004</xref>). In this article, I focus on the latter, <italic>policy representation</italic>, because government policy is the final link of the chain that begins with citizens’ inputs (their political opinions and behaviors) into the political system. In the political representation literature, this type of political representation is commonly referred to as <italic>collective</italic> representation. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-1532673X11416920">Weisberg (1978)</xref> writes, “Whether or not a particular legislator follows his or her constituency is an important question, but this question is not necessarily the most appropriate one if we ask ‘do representatives represent?’”(p. 547). Accordingly, I examine not whether a particular state legislator’s roll call votes match up with his or her constituents’ opinions but whether the content of the public policies implemented by state governments are, in general, more responsive to the opinions of some citizens as compared with others.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-1532673X11416920">8</xref></sup></p>
<p>To assess the opinion–policy linkage, I use a “responsiveness” method that uses spatial variation across political units (in this case, the states) to assess the relationship between public opinion and public policy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1532673X11416920">Achen, 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1532673X11416920">Ansolabehere, Snyder, &amp; Stewart, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1532673X11416920">Bartels, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1532673X11416920">Burden, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1532673X11416920">Erikson et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1532673X11416920">Griffin &amp; Newman, 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1532673X11416920">2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1532673X11416920">Lax &amp; Phillips, 2009a</xref>). This method examines whether as public opinion becomes more liberal across the states, public policies also become more liberal (and, of course, whether as opinion becomes more conservative, policy also becomes more conservative). To assess unequal political representation, I examine whether the opinions of citizens with low, middle, and high incomes predict policy across the states when all three opinion measures are included as predictors simultaneously in a single regression model. Doing so allows me to evaluate the relative influence of each income group’s opinions and compare it with the others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1532673X11416920">Bartels, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>To measure public opinion, I combine data from the 2000 and 2004 National Annenberg Election Surveys (NAES), two random digit dialing rolling cross sectional surveys conducted in the months leading up to the 2000 and 2004 presidential elections.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-1532673X11416920">9</xref></sup> For years, scholars of public opinion in the states have wrestled with the problem of not having enough respondents in public opinion polls to make reliable state-level estimates and inferences. One way to address this problem is to pool surveys over a long period of time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1532673X11416920">Erikson et al., 1993</xref>). Another way is to simulate state opinion by using national polls and multilevel modeling to derive estimates for the states based on demographic characteristics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1532673X11416920">Lax &amp; Phillips, 2009a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1532673X11416920">2009b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1532673X11416920">Park, Gelman, &amp; Bafumi, 2006</xref>). The major advantage of these two NAES surveys is their sheer sample size (nearly 130,000 respondents when they are pooled together) which allows a large enough sample without having to aggregate across years or simulate state opinion. This large sample size is especially important because I disaggregate the opinion data by state and then again into three separate income groups.</p>
<p>As income is a continuous variable (as compared with race/ethnicity or gender) that is artificially divided into discrete categories in most public opinion surveys, any researcher assessing unequal representation is forced to make a decision on how to split up survey respondents into groups. To assess whether state public policies are more responsive to some segments of the population compared with others, I split the sample into three groups based on self-reported <italic>household income</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-1532673X11416920">10</xref></sup> These groups are low income (US$0-US$35,000), middle income (US$35,000-US$75,000), and high income (US$75,000 or greater).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-1532673X11416920">11</xref></sup> As a share of the national sample of respondents, the income groups are, respectively, 35.8%, 37.8%, and 26.4% of the population. Breaking citizens into three groups based on household income is a common technique used in other recent studies of unequal political representation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1532673X11416920">Bartels, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1532673X11416920">Erikson &amp; Bhatti, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-1532673X11416920">Rigby &amp; Wright, 2011</xref>) and these specific income cutoffs were chosen because they most closely divide the national sample into three equally sized groups. By dividing citizens into these three income groups, I am able to evaluate differential government responsiveness while still maintaining large enough sample sizes within states and within income groups to reliably estimate public opinion.</p>
<p>One issue that arises using this method is that the median household income varies widely across the states, so different proportions of households will fall into each of the three income categories depending on the state in question. For example, averaging across 2002-2004, the U.S. Census Bureau reported West Virginia had the lowest median household income at US$32,589 while New Hampshire had the highest at US$57,352.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-1532673X11416920">12</xref></sup> Combining the 2000 and 2004 waves of the NAES, the breakdown of the percentage of the state sample that falls into the low-income, middle-income, and high-income category for West Virginia versus New Hampshire is, respectively, 50% versus 27%, 36% versus 37%, and 14% versus 36%. These differences in group size are important for the study of representation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1532673X11416920">Griffin &amp; Newman, 2008</xref>), as we would expect government to be more responsive to the opinions of a demographic group if it makes up a larger proportion of the population. To econometrically account for differences in the distribution of household income across the states, I weight the opinion measure for each income group by its proportion of the total state population in the same way as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1532673X11416920">Clinton (2006)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1532673X11416920">Bartels (2008)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1532673X11416920">Erikson and Bhatti (2011)</xref>, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-1532673X11416920">Rigby and Wright (2011)</xref>.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-1532673X11416920">13</xref></sup></p>
<p>I measure citizens’ general political ideology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1532673X11416920">Erikson et al., 1993</xref>) as well as their opinions for specific issues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1532673X11416920">Gilens, 2005</xref>). Both general political ideology and specific issue preferences vary, often considerably, across income groups within states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1532673X11416920">Gilens, 2009</xref>; but see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-1532673X11416920">Soroka &amp; Wlezien, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-1532673X11416920">Ura &amp; Ellis, 2008</xref>). To measure citizens’ general political ideology, I use the following item from the NAES: “Generally speaking, would you describe your political views as very conservative, conservative, moderate, liberal, or very liberal?” I then collapse the data to derive a mean of this −2 to +2 scale for each of the three income groups within each state.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn14-1532673X11416920">14</xref></sup> Measures of citizens’ self-reported political ideology have been commonly used to measure public opinion in previous studies of political representation (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1532673X11416920">Bartels, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1532673X11416920">Erikson et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1532673X11416920">Gray, Lowery, Fellowes, &amp; McAtee, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1532673X11416920">Griffin &amp; Flavin, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>Measuring opinions for specific political issues is more difficult, especially because the NAES was primarily designed as a national survey to examine the dynamics of presidential campaigns. As such, several of the policy items ask specifically about what the federal government should or should not do on a particular issue. However, because this is the best source of data with a sample size large enough to make reliable state-level opinion estimates, I proceed on the assumption that preferences on what the national government should do will, generally, extend to preferences about state government action as well (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1532673X11416920">Brace, Sims-Butler, Arceneaux, &amp; Johnson, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1532673X11416920">Norrander, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1532673X11416920">Park et al., 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>I examine unequal policy responsiveness on three salient social issues: (a) the death penalty, (b) abortion, and (c) gun control laws. These three particular issues were chosen because they are “easy” issues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1532673X11416920">Carmines &amp; Stimson, 1980</xref>) that are salient among citizens but not particularly complex. Although the details of welfare expenditures or the progressivity of the tax code may be too technical for most citizens to pay much attention to, citizens can reasonably be expected to hold coherent opinions on the death penalty, abortion, and gun control without extensive knowledge about politics. Previous research has argued and empirically demonstrated that elected officials are most likely to follow public opinion on these types of “easy” issues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1532673X11416920">Gormley, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1532673X11416920">Hagen, Lascher, &amp; Camobreco, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1532673X11416920">Hurley &amp; Hill, 2003</xref>). Below, I list the question wording used for each issue, along with the response coding and sample size that was asked the question. All responses are collapsed to derive a mean opinion value for each income group within each state.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn15-1532673X11416920">15</xref></sup></p>

<p>As discussed above, there is some question about to what extent the political opinions of citizens with low, middle, and high incomes differ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1532673X11416920">Erikson &amp; Bhatti, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-1532673X11416920">Soroka &amp; Wlezien, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-1532673X11416920">Ura &amp; Ellis, 2008</xref>). These differences are central for the study of income inequality and political representation because if the rich and poor have similar ideologies and policy preferences, policy decisions that represent the opinions of the rich would necessarily also represent the opinions of the poor. To evaluate differences in political ideology by income, I generate three graphs that show, respectively, the difference in mean ideology within each state between (a) low- and middle-income citizens, (b) low- and high-income citizens, and (c) middle- and high-income citizens. For each graph, more liberal mean ideology is coded higher, so a state where the bar is above zero indicates that the first group listed in the graph’s title is more liberal than the second group listed using the five-point ideological scale (−2 to +2). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1532673X11416920">Figure 1a</xref> reveals that citizens in the low-income group report being more liberal than citizens in the middle-income group in 37 out of the 48 states in the analysis. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1532673X11416920">Figure 1b</xref> reveals that citizens in the low-income group report being more liberal than citizens in the high-income group in 38 out of the 48 states. In contrast, the difference in the mean reported ideology between citizens in the middle- and high-income group reveals no clear pattern, with roughly half of the states having more liberal citizens in the middle-income group and the other half more liberal citizens in the high-income group (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1532673X11416920">Figure 1c</xref>). In sum, the largest difference in self-reported ideology appears to be between citizens in the low-income group when compared with the other two income groups, with citizens in the low-income group consistently more liberal than their more affluent state counterparts.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn18-1532673X11416920">18</xref></sup></p>

</fig>
<p>For the three social issues, the same pattern (citizens with low incomes holding the most distinct political opinions) generally holds. For the death penalty, low-income citizens report more liberal attitudes. Averaging values across the states, citizens in the low-income group are 6% points more likely to be against the use of the death penalty compared with citizens in the middle-income group and 4% points more likely to be against the death penalty compared with citizens in the high-income group. In contrast, for attitudes on abortion, citizens in the low-income group report more conservative attitudes compared with their more affluent state counterparts. Again, averaging values across the states, citizens in the low-income group are 4% points more likely to think abortion should be banned compared with citizens in the middle-income group and 6% points more likely to think abortion should be banned compared with citizens in the high-income group. For both issues, these differences are larger than the difference between the middle- and high-income groups (citizens in the middle-income group are, on average, 1% point more supportive of the death penalty and 3% points more likely to think abortion should be banned).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn19-1532673X11416920">19</xref></sup> In sum, there are substantive differences in general political ideology and opinions on specific issues between citizens in different income groups within states, and the largest differences are between citizens with low incomes and their more affluent state counterparts in the middle- and high-income categories.</p>
<p>I then turn to assessing the relationship between citizens’ opinions and public policy. To measure public policy, I require both general measures of the “liberalism” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1532673X11416920">Klingman &amp; Lammers, 1984</xref>) of policy outputs and data on death penalty, abortion, and gun control policies across the states. In their seminal book on state opinion and policy, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1532673X11416920">Erikson et al. (1993)</xref> developed a composite index of state policy liberalism using eight policy areas for which liberals and conservatives typically disagree. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1532673X11416920">Gray et al. (2004)</xref> updated this policy liberalism measure for 2000 using the following five policy items: (a) state regulation of firearms as measured by state gun laws, (b) scorecard of state abortion laws in 2000, (c) an index of welfare stringency that accounts for Temporary Assistance to Needy Families (TANF) rules of eligibility and work requirements for 1997-1999, (d) a dummy measure of state right-to-work laws in 2001, and (e) a measure of tax progressivity calculated as a ratio of the average tax burden of the highest 5% of a state’s earners to the average tax burden of the lowest 40% of a state’s earners.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn20-1532673X11416920">20</xref></sup> These five components are then standardized and summed in an additive index such that more liberal state policies are coded higher. I use this index as my first measure of the general ideological tone of state policy.</p>
<p>Second, a recent article by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-1532673X11416920">Sorens, Muedini, and Ruger (2008)</xref> provides a rich source of data on state policies in 20 different areas ranging from public assistance spending to gun control to campaign finance laws to health insurance regulations.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn21-1532673X11416920">21</xref></sup> In addition to specific statutes and spending data, the authors provide a summary index of policy liberalism for each state that they derive by factor analyzing their entire range of policies. I use this composite score as a second measure of general policy liberalism.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn22-1532673X11416920">22</xref></sup> Together, the two policy liberalism measures represent the unidimensional liberal/conservative ideology of state policy decisions that correspond well to the measure of citizens’ general political ideologies described above.</p>
<p>I also use measures of specific state policies that are intended to match up as closely as possible with the opinion measures on the three social issues described above. This allows me to assess whether state policy on a particular issue is responsive to opinion on that same particular issue. The policy measures and the data source they are drawn from are described below:<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn23-1532673X11416920">23</xref></sup></p>

<p>To measure policy representation, I use a “responsiveness” model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1532673X11416920">Bartels, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1532673X11416920">Burden, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1532673X11416920">Erikson et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1532673X11416920">Griffin &amp; Newman, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1532673X11416920">Lax &amp; Phillips, 2009a</xref>) which assesses whether states with more liberal public opinion have more liberal public policies (and whether states with more conservative opinion have more conservative policies). By including a separate measure of opinion for each income group, the model measures the relative influence of each on state policy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1532673X11416920">Bartels, 2008</xref>). A positive and statistically significant coefficient for an income group’s population-weighted opinion measure indicates that, across the American states, an income group’s mean ideology is a significant predictor of state policy. Moreover, I am then able to evaluate unequal policy representation by assessing whether the coefficients for each income group are statistically different <italic>from one another</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn24-1532673X11416920">24</xref></sup></p>
<p>I also include a variable for the proportion of a state’s residents in each income category (with the high-income category as the reference category). This allows each income group its own separate intercept instead of artificially forcing a similar opinion intercept across all three income groups (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1532673X11416920">Erikson &amp; Bhatti, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-1532673X11416920">Rigby &amp; Wright, 2011</xref>). Stated in equation form, using ordinary least squares regression, I model policy representation as follows:</p>

<p>The bottom panel of <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1532673X11416920">Table 1</xref> reports the results of three Wald tests that assess, respectively, whether the regression coefficient for low-income ideology is significantly less in magnitude than the coefficient for middle- and high-income ideology and whether the coefficient for middle-income ideology is significantly less in magnitude than the coefficient for high-income ideology (using a one-tailed test). For column 1, the coefficient for low-income ideology is not statistically different from the middle- or high-income ideology coefficients. However, for column 2, the low-income ideology coefficient is statistically smaller (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .10) compared with the coefficients for both middle- and high-income ideology.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn25-1532673X11416920">25</xref></sup> From this initial analysis, the political inequality that others have found at the national level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1532673X11416920">Bartels, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1532673X11416920">Gilens, 2005</xref>) appears to extend to the states as well.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn26-1532673X11416920">26</xref></sup></p>
<p>To test the robustness of these results, I use entirely different data for both citizens’ political ideology and states’ policy liberalism. To measure citizens’ ideology, I pool data from the 1988-1990-1992 Senate Election Study conducted by the American National Election Studies (also see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1532673X11416920">Bartels, 2008</xref>, chapter 9). This data set is useful because it was stratified to include roughly an equal number of respondents from each state (a minimum of 150 and an average of 185). Respondents are divided by state into those with a household income below US$20,000, those between US$20,000 and US$40,000, and those above US$40,000. Citizens’ general liberal/conservative political ideology is again used to measure public opinion.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn27-1532673X11416920">27</xref></sup> Like before, I weight the opinion data by the proportion of respondents in each state that fall into that income category and include separate terms for the proportion of citizens in the low- and middle-income groups to allow each group its own intercept in the regression model.</p>
<p>To measure the general ideological tone of state policies, I use the original state policy liberalism index created by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1532673X11416920">Erikson et al. (1993</xref>, pp. 75-77). The index is a composite of eight different policy areas including level of education spending, the scope of Medicaid eligibility, the scope of Aid to Families with Dependent Children eligibility, consumer protection laws, liberal criminal justice approaches, legalization of gambling, Equal Rights Amendment ratification, and tax progressivity. The results of this regression are displayed in column 3 of <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1532673X11416920">Table 1</xref>. Again, both the coefficients for middle- and high-income ideology are positive and statistically significant. However, most importantly, the coefficient for low-income opinion is again not statistically different from zero (in fact, the estimate is negative) and is significantly smaller (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .10) than the coefficients for both middle- and high-income opinion. Using alternative data from over a decade earlier, the same result holds: the general political ideologies of citizens with low incomes do not predict the policy decisions made by state governments.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn28-1532673X11416920">28</xref></sup></p>
<p>I next examine differential political representation on specific policy issues by assessing the relationship between citizens’ opinions and state policy on three social issues: the death penalty, abortion, and gun control laws. All policies are coded such that more liberal preferences and policies are coded higher.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1532673X11416920">Table 2</xref> displays the results from regressing these three measures of policy on population-weighted measures of opinion for low-, middle-, and high-income citizens (items used to construct the opinion and policy measures are described above). For the death penalty, the opinions of citizens in both the middle- and high-income categories strongly predict policy.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn29-1532673X11416920">29</xref></sup> For abortion, only the opinions of citizens in the high-income group significantly predict state policy. For gun control laws, the opinion measures for middle and high income are both positively signed, but the coefficients are not bounded above zero. Most importantly, similar to the analysis for general political ideology presented above, the mean opinion of citizens in the low-income group does not predict any of the three state policies (the coefficient estimate is actually negative for gun control policy but not statistically different from zero) and is significantly smaller (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .10) than the coefficient for high-income opinion for all three policy areas. In sum, whether measured as general state policy liberalism or state policy on specific social issues, citizens with low incomes receive little substantive political representation in the policy decisions made by state governments.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn30-1532673X11416920">30</xref></sup></p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>The correspondence between citizens’ opinions and public policy is the “bottom line” for American democracy. A large political science literature has been dedicated to demonstrating that citizens’ aggregated opinions strongly predict the tone of public policy in both state (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1532673X11416920">Erikson et al., 1993</xref>) and national politics (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1532673X11416920">Erikson et al., 2002</xref>). Far less attention has been paid to the question “Are citizens’ opinions represented equally?” Recent studies at the national level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1532673X11416920">Bartels, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1532673X11416920">Gilens, 2005</xref>) report that the opinions of the poor are especially underrepresented in the policymaking process across a wide array of policy domains.</p>
<p>This article extends this new line of inquiry to the American states and uncovers similar results. Assessing the relationship between citizens’ general political ideology and state policy, the opinions of citizens in the middle- and high-income groups are reflected in state public policies while the opinions of the poor are consistently underrepresented. If “a key characteristic of a democracy is the continued responsiveness of the government to the preferences of its citizens, considered as political equals” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1532673X11416920">Dahl, 1971</xref>, p. 1), the democratic process in the American states appears to fall short of this standard. This finding is especially disconcerting in light of growing evidence that economic inequality and political inequality interact and exacerbate one another (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1532673X11416920">Bartels, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1532673X11416920">Kelly, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1532673X11416920">McCarty et al., 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>Unequal political representation applies not just to the general ideological tone of state policy but also to specific social issues as well, “easy” issues where we might expect more equal representation to occur as rich and poor constituents alike are more likely to formulate coherent and consistent preferences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1532673X11416920">Gormley, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1532673X11416920">Hagen et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1532673X11416920">Hurley &amp; Hill, 2003</xref>). Whereas the correspondence between citizens’ general political ideology and the general ideological tone of state policy might be murky, there should be little cloudiness in the relationship between citizens’ opinions and policy for specific and salient issues like abortion or the death penalty. Even so, on the types of issues where we might expect disadvantaged citizens to fare the best, I find little evidence that their opinions are reflected in the policy decisions made by state governments when compared with more affluent citizens.</p>
<p>Recent studies of unequal political representation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1532673X11416920">Bartels, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1532673X11416920">Gilens, 2005</xref>) have documented wide disparities between the rich and the poor but stop short of explaining <italic>why these disparities occur</italic>. Although political scientists and pundits have speculated for decades about the underlying causes of unequal political influence (including inequalities in rates of voting, contacting elected officials, and contributing to campaigns), empirical investigation of this topic remains startlingly limited. As a result, we still have an inadequate understanding and little concrete evidence about the precise mechanisms by which economic inequality is reproduced as political inequality. To further our understanding, future studies should attempt to measure and take advantage of the variation in the equality of political representation across the American states to explain why it occurs.</p>

<p>Another possible explanation for unequal political representation is a “selection effect” of those who are elected to serve in government (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1532673X11416920">Bartels, 2008</xref>, p. 281).

<p>One reason for the large literature on unequal levels of political participation is that it is relatively easy to measure in a way that inequalities in political representation are not. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-1532673X11416920">Verba and Orren (1985)</xref> point out, “Political equality cannot be gauged in the same way as economic inequality.

Aggregating spending preferences from the General Social Survey (GSS) for ten issue areas, they compute a separate “policy mood” measure for each income quartile from 1974 to 2004. In general, wealthier Americans are more ideologically conservative than poorer citizens, but the difference in opinion liberalism between each income quartile is rather modest. Moreover, they find that the policy mood of each income quartile moves in a similar direction over time. They conclude that because political opinions do not significantly differ, “it may be simply impossible for elected officials to perceive and react differently to the ‘scope of government’ preferences of different income groups” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-1532673X11416920">Ura &amp; Ellis, 2008</xref>, p. 791).</p>

<p>One concern with this data is that respondents were selected from a random <italic>national</italic> sample and not a random sample from <italic>each state</italic>, which may introduce measurement error for state public opinion and lead to underestimating the relationship between opinion and policy. However, as respondents were selected randomly at the national level, each state sample is also randomly generated which is evidenced by the proportion of respondents in the sample residing in each state very closely approximating that state’s actual share of the national population.</p>

<p>The question wording for household income in the 2000 National Annenberg Election Surveys (NAES) is “Last year, what was your total household income before taxes? Just stop me when I get to the right category. Less than US$10,000; US$10,000 to less than US$15,000; US$15,000 to less than US$25,000; US$25,000 to less than US$35,000; US$35,000 to less than US$50,000; US$50,000 to less than US$75,000; US$75,000 to less than US$100,000; US$100,000 to less than US$150,000; or US$150,000 or more?” The 2004 wave has identical income categories but the question begins with “Last year, what was the total income before taxes of all the people living in your house or apartment?

<p>One possible explanation for perceived unequal policy representation for different income groups is that there are substantial differences in the variance of ideology within groups. For example, if the ideologies of citizens in the middle- and high-income groups were more stable and consistent than the ideologies of citizens in the low-income group, we would expect the coefficients for the middle- and high-income groups to be more precise because there is more reliability and less “error” in the measurement of mean ideology. This might lead a researcher to conclude unequal policy representation exists when, in reality, the result is simply a byproduct of measurement error. To investigate this concern, I first examined the variance of each income group’s self-reported ideologies within each state. The average within-state variances for each income group are not statistically different from one another. A second way to investigate this concern is to calculate the reliability for each income group’s ideology measure. The reliability estimates for the low-, middle-, and high-income ideology measures across the states using the 2000 and 2004 NAES are .91, .96, and .96, respectively. Reliability was calculated using the following equation: (total variance – error variance) / total variance. For each income group, the higher the proportion of variance that comes from across the states as opposed to within each state, the higher the reliability and more confident we can be that the mean ideology estimate is measuring actual differences in political ideologies across the states and not random “noise” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1532673X11416920">Jones &amp; Norrander, 1996</xref>). When I use an errors-in-variables regression model that accounts for the slightly different reliability of the ideology measure for each income group, the results are substantively identical to those reported in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1532673X11416920">Table 1</xref>.</p>
</fn>
<fn fn-type="other" id="fn19-1532673X11416920">
<label>19.</label>
<p>The same pattern in differences in opinions between income groups holds for opinions on gun control policy as well (measured on a 1-4 scale with higher values indicating a preference for more stringent gun control policies). Across the states, citizens in the low-income group prefer more stringent gun control laws compared with citizens in both the middle- and high-income groups. These differences are again larger than the difference in opinion between citizens in the middle- and high-income groups (with citizens in the high-income group preferring more stringent gun control laws at a rate slightly higher than citizens in the middle-income group).</p>

<p>As income and education are correlated at a fairly high level across the American public, focusing on inequalities in political representation based on citizens’ income might actually be picking up inequalities in political representation based on citizens’ level of education. To investigate if the results displayed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1532673X11416920">Table 1</xref> are merely a proxy for unequal political influence based on level of education, I replicate the same analysis by splitting citizens into three groups based on level of education (high school diploma or less, some college, 4-year college degree or more) and weight each group’s political ideology by its proportion of the total state population. I find no clear pattern of unequal political representation based on citizens’ level of education (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1532673X11416920">Table A1</xref> in the appendix). In fact, this analysis suggests that citizens with a high school diploma or less enjoy the same level or even more political influence when compared with citizens with at least a 4-year college degree. In short, citizens with low incomes appear to be more politically disadvantaged than citizens with low levels of education (also see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1532673X11416920">Gilens, 2005</xref>).</p>

<p>The National Election Studies (NES) ideology item is asked on a 1-7 scale. I flipped and rescaled the variable to run from −3 (<italic>very conservative</italic>) to +3 (<italic>very liberal</italic>). The question wording is as follows: “We hear a lot of talk these days about liberals and conservatives. Think about a ruler for measuring political views that people might hold, from liberal to conservative. On this ruler, which goes from one to seven, a measurement of one means very liberal political views, and a measurement of seven would be very conservative. Just like a regular ruler, it has points in between, at 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6. Where would you place yourself on this ruler, remembering that 1 is <italic>very liberal</italic> and 7 is <italic>very conservative</italic>, or haven’t you thought much about this?”</p>

<p>Each income group’s mean political ideology is included in a single regression model to allow them to compete with one another for influence. However, one concern with including measures of the mean ideology for low-, middle-, and high-income groups in a single model is the possibility that high collinearity among the three measures may inflate the standard errors for the coefficients and lead to imprecise estimates. Indeed, low-income ideology is correlated with middle-income ideology at .76 and with high-income ideology at .79 (middle- and high-income ideology are correlated at .90). To investigate this concern, I regressed the three measures of state policy liberalism on each income group’s mean ideology separately. This modeling strategy reveals (as expected, given the ideology measures are moderately to highly correlated with one another) that each income group’s ideology is a statistically significant predictor of the liberalism of state public policies (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-1532673X11416920">Table A2</xref> in the appendix). However, the analysis also reveals that the coefficient for the high-income group is consistently larger than the coefficient for the low-income group, indicating that state public policy liberalism is more sensitive to the opinions of citizens in the high-income group even when each income group’s ideology is modeled separately.</p>

<p>As the death penalty is the only dichotomous policy measure (0 = <italic>death penalty is legal</italic>, 1 = <italic>no death penalty</italic>), a probit estimator is used in column 1 of <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1532673X11416920">Table 2</xref>.</p>

<p>I also modeled each social policy as a function of each income group’s opinion separately (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-1532673X11416920">Table A3</xref> in the appendix). Much like the analysis for political ideology and state policy liberalism, all three income groups’ opinions strongly predict policy (because group opinions are correlated with one another). However, for the death penalty and gun control policy, citizens in the low-income group appear to have the smallest influence over state policy when compared with the other groups. For abortion policy, the low-income group appears to have roughly the same influence as citizens in the middle-income group when each income group’s opinion is modeled separately.</p>
