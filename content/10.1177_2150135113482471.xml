<abstract>
<p>A 10-year-old girl with unbalanced atrioventricular septal defect and aortic arch interruption with interrupted inferior vena cava and dextrocardia had undergone a modified Norwood procedure followed by a Kawashima operation in 2002 and 2005, respectively. In 2012, she underwent Fontan operation with diversion of hepatic veins to left pulmonary artery. Intraoperative transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) was used. She was noted to have an esophageal perforation, diagnosed on the 10th postoperative day. She was managed with thoracic drainage, cervical esophagostomy, and feeding jejunostomy. Esophageal perforation is a rare complication of TEE and requires very aggressive treatment.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Residual cardiac lesions after corrective surgery add to mortality, morbidity, and cost. The use of intraoperative transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) has been recommended as a means to avoid this scenario in all pediatric patients who undergo cardiac surgery.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-2150135113482471">1</xref>
</sup> The safety of TEE for patients undergoing cardiac surgery is well established, and serious complications following intraoperative TEE are rare.<sup>

</sup> We present one such complication (esophageal perforation) following a Fontan operation.</p>

<sec id="section2-2150135113482471">
<title>Case Report</title>
<p>A neonate with unbalanced atrioventricular septal defect and arch interruption with interrupted inferior vena cava and dextrocardia underwent a Norwood operation followed by a Kawashima operation three years later. She developed pulmonary arteriovenous fistulae and progressive cyanosis and consequently underwent Fontan completion at 10 years of age and with weight of 23 kg.</p>
<p>After induction of anesthesia, a 15-mm TEE probe (Omniplane Philips IE33, NED) was inserted but resulted in desaturation. It was exchanged for a pediatric probe (8 mm). An extracardiac Fontan operation was completed using cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB; 32°C) and an 18-mm polytetrafluoroethylene graft (Goretex; WL Gore &amp; Associates, Inc, Flagstaff, Arizona) conduit to connect the hepatic veins to the left pulmonary artery. The surgery was uneventful and Fontan hemodynamics were satisfactory. The TEE probe remained in situ for the duration of the procedure (76 minutes). The patient was extubated on the first postoperative day. She however required inhaled oxygen by nasal prongs at 2 L/kg/min with fraction of inspired oxygen of 60% to maintain saturation of more than 90% on pulse oximetry.</p>
<p>On the second postoperative day, she developed a milky hydropneumothorax on the right suggestive of chylothorax, which was managed with intercostal chest tube drainage. A chest x-ray demonstrated a complete reexpansion of the lung with no air leak. She however continued to drain a large amount of fluid. She continued to take oral fluids during this time and required the insertion of an additional chest tube 48 hours later. The development of high-grade pyrexia prompted culture of the milky pleural fluid, which demonstrated <italic>Candida albicans</italic>, <italic>Streptococcus anginosus</italic>, and <italic>Enterococcus</italic> on the 7th postoperative day. A subsequent computed tomography (CT) scan of the chest showed a right hydropneumothorax located posterior to the heart, therefore not visible on chest x-ray (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-2150135113482471">Figure 1</xref>). The patient underwent emergency right thoracotomy for decortication of the lung and drainage of an empyema. The patient continued to have copious drainage in the chest tubes and high-grade fever with increased leukocyte count and C-reactive protein levels. A Gastrografin study was performed on the 11th postoperative day, confirming the diagnosis of esophageal rupture. Further revaluation of the earlier CT scan demonstrated a 2-cm tear in the lower esophagus with an empyema (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-2150135113482471">Figure 2</xref>). The patient required a repeat thoracotomy for persistent right pleural collection. The thoracic cavity was irrigated, and multiple drains were placed near the esophagus, in the diaphragmatic recess and in the retrocardiac region.</p>

</fig>
<p>The patient’s clinical condition gradually improved, but there was continued copious pleural drainage. A cervical end esophagostomy was performed (20th postoperative day) with closure of the distal end and a gastrostomy. The patient was extubated seven days later, and the intercostal drains were sequentially removed over the next few weeks. She is presently hemodynamically stable without evidence of infection awaiting restoration of gastroesophageal continuity.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Life-threatening complications of transesophageal echocardiographic examination are rare, and the safety and utility of TEE in pediatric patients undergoing cardiac surgery has been well established. The reported incidence of complications in pediatric patients is low (3.2%) and has included inadvertent endotracheal tube displacement or extubation, upper airway obstruction, bronchial obstruction, hypotension, and gastric lacerations. Although well documented in adults, there are very few reports of esophageal perforation in pediatric patients. To our knowledge, there is no report of a patient having undergone Fontan operation having sustained and survived an esophageal perforation following Fontan operation.</p>
<p>Greene et al<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-2150135113482471">3</xref>
</sup> performed postoperative flexible esophagoscopy on 50 children in whom TEE had been performed for congenital heart surgery and found abnormal results in 64%. The esophageal abnormalities detected were erythema (54%), edema (24%), hematoma (22%), mucosal erosion (14.1%), and petechiae (4.1%).</p>
<p>The mechanism of injury to the esophagus by the TEE probe varies and includes mechanical injury during insertion, probe manipulation, thermal mucosal injury due to repeated examinations, and mucosal necrosis during prolonged scope flexion.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-2150135113482471">3</xref>
</sup> Additionally, factors such as low body weight, hypoxemia, prolonged procedure time, local pressure affect, vascular insufficiency, and impaired blood supply during CPB may all be involved.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-2150135113482471">4</xref>
</sup> Cases have been reported in the literature in which electric burns have occurred to the esophagus due to alternate return of radiofrequency diathermy current from the electrode tip through the esophageal temperature probe tip.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-2150135113482471">5</xref>
</sup> The mechanism of injury in our case is not clear. The management of esophageal injuries recognized early is through primary surgical closure with or without muscle flap reinforcement, although there may be a role for nonsurgical management as well. Adequate management of cases involving delayed presentation or recognition may be with drainage of the pleural space and mediastinum, but prevention of continued soilage of the pleural space may require esophageal exclusion and diversion.<sup>

</sup>
</p>
<p>We report a case of delayed presentation of esophageal rupture by TEE probe in a 10-year-old patient undergoing cardiac surgery. The diagnosis was delayed because of lack of suspicion and was missed on radiological examination. In retrospect, in the early postoperative period, there were multiple potential indicators of esophageal injury. Also, there was a history of dysphagia requiring repeated presentations to the emergency department during the past year, which had been neglected. It is likely that this child had some degree of underlying pathology, which could have increased the risk of esophageal injury during instrumentation as may occur with esophagitis or stricture. A high index of suspicion is required for the diagnosis of such injuries in the absence of clear clinical features. Delay in diagnosis may lead to extensive morbidity and risk of mortality.</p>
