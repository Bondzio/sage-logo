<abstract>
<p>Hepatitis B is a significant public health challenge within some subpopulations in Australia, including Chinese and Vietnamese migrants. There has been limited research on hepatitis B knowledge and actions in these communities. The authors conducted a self-administered survey among 442 Chinese and 433 Vietnamese in Brisbane. Generally, the knowledge is best described as “moderate.” One in 2 could not identify the sexual transmission risk and less than one third knew that sharing foods or drinks did not spread the disease. The majority of Vietnamese (80%) and 60% of Chinese respondents indicated prior testing. Vaccination was reported in 60% of the Vietnamese and in 52% of the Chinese. Knowledge was better among Chinese people who had been tested and vaccinated compared with those who were nontested and nonvaccinated. Only 3.5% of the Chinese, but 11.6% of the Vietnamese, indicated having a positive test result hepatitis B virus. This study helps identify strategies for programs targeting both communities and practitioners.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Despite the widespread availability of vaccination for hepatitis B virus (HBV) in Australia and its overall low prevalence in the general population (&lt;1%),<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1010539510390205">1</xref></sup> chronic hepatitis B (CHB) remains a serious public health challenge within some subpopulations. Estimates of the number of people living with CHB in the country range from 91 500 to 163 500 persons (0.49% to 0.87%).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1010539510390205">1</xref></sup> A large proportion of these infections are known to occur among migrants born in the Asia-Pacific region where HBV infection is highly prevalent.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1010539510390205">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1010539510390205">2</xref></sup> While constituting approximately 5% of the Australian population, people born in the Asia-Pacific make up more than 50% of the estimated population living with CHB,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1010539510390205">3</xref></sup> the largest proportions of whom are Chinese and Vietnamese migrants.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1010539510390205">4</xref></sup> As a consequence, these groups have also been shown to have the highest risks of hepatocellullar carcinoma compared with Australia-born people (relative risk of 10.0 and 11.6, respectively).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1010539510390205">5</xref></sup></p>
<p>Despite the high burden of HBV in these Australian ethnic communities, there has been little research that may inform prevention and care programs. A self-reported HBV infection rate of 7% was found among a sample of 499 Vietnamese Australian men in Sydney.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1010539510390205">6</xref></sup> In that study, some sex-related risk practices, including commercial sex, were particularly common,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1010539510390205">7</xref></sup> although their knowledge about sexually transmitted infections and blood-borne viruses, including hepatitis B and C, was very low.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1010539510390205">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1010539510390205">8</xref></sup> Only 44% of the men knew that hepatitis B infection could be transmitted sexually. This was much lower than the 59% (for men) found in a recent national survey on knowledge of sexually transmissible infections in Australia.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1010539510390205">9</xref></sup></p>
<p>A number of studies have been conducted in the United States and Canada regarding HBV among migrant populations. Suboptimal levels of knowledge about HBV have been found among Chinese<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1010539510390205">10</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1010539510390205">14</xref></sup> and Vietnamese migrants.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1010539510390205">15</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1010539510390205">18</xref></sup> Misconceptions about sharing food items with, or eating foods prepared by, HBV carriers were quite common. Only 40% to 65% of Chinese adults were aware of the sexual risk for HBV transmission, whereas half to more than 80% knew about other transmission modes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1010539510390205">10</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1010539510390205">14</xref></sup> Awareness of sexual transmission risk was found to be as low as 14% to as high as 70% among Vietnamese migrants.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1010539510390205">15</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1010539510390205">18</xref></sup></p>
<p>Among Chinese people in North America, estimates of HBV testing (ever) ranged between 35% and 60% and vaccination between 30% and 40%.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1010539510390205">12</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1010539510390205">14</xref></sup> Some studies have found very low levels of testing and vaccination among Vietnamese migrants (around 6% to 8%),<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1010539510390205">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1010539510390205">19</xref></sup> whereas others reported much higher rates (approximately 60% to 70% testing and 30% to 40% vaccination rate).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1010539510390205">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1010539510390205">21</xref></sup> This wide variation in estimates highlights the need for further research with migrant populations.</p>
<p>Thus, much uncertainty remains in the estimates of HBV-related knowledge and practices of Asian migrants in North America and Australia. In addition, there is apparently a lack of evidence from community-based research in Australia. The aim of this study was to assess the current state in knowledge and preventive vaccination and testing in Chinese and Vietnamese communities in the city of Brisbane, Australia. This should facilitate the development of responsive interventions to tackle the disproportionate CHB burden among these groups.</p>

<title>Methods</title>
<sec id="section3-1010539510390205">
<title>Respondents and Recruitment</title>
<p>A cross-sectional survey was administered through convenience sampling at 6 Chinese and 1 Vietnamese community settings and events identified as key meeting points in the Brisbane metropolitan region. Research assistants employed from each of the target communities approached people of Chinese and Vietnamese background at these locations and invited them to complete an anonymous self-administered survey in their respective language. Persons older than 18 years who could read and speak Chinese or Vietnamese were recruited. Respondents received a small gift on completion of the questionnaire. The study was coordinated and supervised through the HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis and Sexual Health Program of the Ethnic Communities Council of Queensland with the support of Queensland Health, Hepatitis Council of Queensland, and Queensland University of Technology. Institutional ethics approval was obtained from Queensland Health.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1010539510390205">
<title>Survey Instrument</title>
<p>The survey instrument was adapted from previous questionnaires used in similar studies internationally.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1010539510390205">10</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1010539510390205">18</xref></sup> It was first prepared in English, then translated and back-translated from English to Chinese or Vietnamese. It was tested in a pilot study among a small sample of Chinese (n = 50) and Vietnamese people (n = 50) in the same areas before it was finalized for the main study.</p>
<p>Knowledge was assessed by asking the respondents whether each of 11 statements concerning hepatitis B was correct. Each question had 3 possible answers as yes, no, and unsure. A testing and vaccination history for each participant was also recorded. Information on place of vaccination and testing, reasons for not being vaccinated, and reasons for testing were explored in open-ended questions. Respondents were also asked to anonymously identify the results of any previous HBV testing, and if positive, whether they were under any current medical management if relevant. Reasons for not receiving medical care were then sought. Demographic information included age, gender, length of time in Australia, and language spoken at home.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1010539510390205">
<title>Data Analysis</title>
<p>Data were entered into a Microsoft Access database and analyzed in SPSS 16.0. Chi-square tests and <italic>t</italic> tests were used to assess differences between groups, and odds ratios (ORs) adjusted for age and sex were calculated for dependent variables, including testing and vaccination. A total knowledge score was calculated by summing all correct answers.</p>

<sec id="section6-1010539510390205" sec-type="results">
<title>Results</title>
<p>A total of 931 respondents from the Chinese (n = 487) and Vietnamese (n = 444) communities completed the questionnaire. We excluded those respondents with place of birth from countries other than China or Vietnam, resulting in the final sample for analysis of 875 respondents (442 Chinese and 433 Vietnamese). Sociodemographic characteristics of the respondents are summarized in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1010539510390205">Table 1</xref>. Although average age was similar between the 2 groups, there were more people from Vietnam aged 40 years and older than from China (61% vs 47%, <italic>P</italic> &lt; .001). Vietnam-born respondents had lived in Australia for a significantly longer period compared with China-born respondents (14.5 vs 9.0 years, <italic>P</italic> &lt; .001).</p>

<p>Approximately 1 in 4 people reported testing but no vaccination (or they could not recall) in both ethnic groups (24% in each). Having been vaccinated but not tested (or were unsure) was more common among the Chinese (15%) compared with the Vietnamese (5%). The proportions who had been neither tested nor vaccinated (or were unsure) were 24% and 15% in the Chinese and Vietnamese groups, respectively.</p>
<p>Among those ever tested, 9 Chinese respondents (3.5%) and 38 Vietnamese respondents (11.6%) indicated that they received a positive HBV test result (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1010539510390205">Table 1</xref>).

<p>Age was negatively correlated with vaccination among Chinese respondents, but not for Vietnamese (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1010539510390205">Table 3</xref>). Among the Chinese, vaccination uptake also appeared to correlate with time living in Australia, although this was not significant after adjusting for age and sex (OR = 0.7, 95% CI = 0.4-1.2). No associations were found between vaccination and gender or language spoken at home.

<title>Current Knowledge About HBV</title>
<p>The mean knowledge scores were similar among the Chinese and Vietnamese groups (approximately 6.6 items correct out of 11; <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1010539510390205">Table 1</xref>). However, the proportions of respondents with correct HBV knowledge on each knowledge item varied considerably (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1010539510390205">Figure 1</xref>). Approximately 50% of Chinese and Vietnamese respondents were unaware that hepatitis B could be transmitted through unprotected sex. Within the Chinese group, males had lower knowledge about the sexual transmission risk than females (41% vs 56%, <italic>P</italic> = .001) and those younger than 40 years were less likely to be aware of this risk than the older people (44% vs 55%, <italic>P</italic> = 0.02).</p>

Awareness about the nature and progression of the disease was higher. Significantly more Vietnamese than Chinese knew that HBV infection could be asymptomatic or could lead to cancer, whereas more Chinese than Vietnamese identified the disease as life-long and that treatments were available.</p>
<p>Among the Chinese sample, there was a trend for those with a history of testing to have better knowledge than those who had never been tested for HBV (mean knowledge score difference 0.38, <italic>P</italic> = .06). Similarly, Chinese respondents who had been vaccinated demonstrated a significantly better knowledge score than the nonvaccinated Chinese (mean knowledge score difference 0.77, <italic>P</italic> &lt; .001).

<title>Preferences in Accessing HBV-Related Information</title>
<p>When asked about language preferences for receiving HBV information, 54% of the Chinese respondents indicated Chinese, 39% both Chinese and English, and 7% English. Among Vietnamese respondents, 70% preferred Vietnamese, 20% both Vietnamese and English, and 10% English. In the Chinese group, the most commonly cited sources used to seek HBV information were the Internet (57%), doctor (17%), hospital/clinic/health services (9%), and newspaper/magazine (9%).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Despite the importance of HBV to the health of Chinese and Vietnamese groups in Australia, knowledge of this virus within the affected communities could best be described as moderate regarding most aspects of HBV and quite poor in some areas. Of particular concern was the low awareness of sexual transmission, with only 1 in 2 (52%) correctly identifying this as a risk. This is at the lower end of the range of estimates reported by similar studies of migrant populations in the United States and Canada,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1010539510390205">12</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1010539510390205">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1010539510390205">22</xref></sup> though somewhat higher than the 44% found in one recent survey of Vietnamese men in Sydney.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1010539510390205">6</xref></sup></p>
<p>The study has generated insights that may be useful for community education and disease prevention campaigns. A minority of Chinese (1 in 4) and Vietnamese people (1 in 3) correctly identified that sharing food and drinks would not spread hepatitis B. This finding is quite consistent with other studies among migrant populations in North America.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1010539510390205">12</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1010539510390205">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1010539510390205">16</xref></sup> Such misinformation was also reported among HBV patients in the National Hepatitis B Needs Assessment in Australia.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1010539510390205">23</xref></sup> It appears that many Asia-born people associate HBV with sanitation conditions, sharing foods and drinks, and thus there is confusion with hepatitis A and E infections.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1010539510390205">23</xref></sup></p>
<p>Approximately 1 in 3 respondents was not aware of the severity of HBV infection as a cause of liver cancer. This confirms patterns found in other studies conducted among Vietnamese populations.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1010539510390205">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1010539510390205">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1010539510390205">18</xref></sup></p>
<p>However, knowledge of this aspect of HBV in the current Australian sample was comparatively lower than that reported in studies among Chinese in North America.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1010539510390205">12</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1010539510390205">14</xref></sup> Furthermore, fewer respondents in this study knew that hepatitis B infection can be asymptomatic compared with many other studies.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1010539510390205">11</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1010539510390205">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1010539510390205">22</xref></sup> The consequences of these misconceptions and the confusion between hepatitis B and less life-threatening, nonchronic hepatitis conditions are important. Such misunderstandings may reduce the likelihood of people seeking preventive actions such as testing, vaccination, or monitoring and treatment if they are infected.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1010539510390205">24</xref></sup></p>
<p>Over two thirds of the vaccinated respondents in the Chinese sample had received their vaccination in mainland China, Taiwan, or Hong Kong, whereas less than one fifth of the vaccinated Vietnamese respondents received this in Vietnam. This difference might reflect the history of immigration of the Vietnamese and Chinese people to Australia. The majority of Vietnamese migrants were refugees between 1975 and 1995. During this time, HBV vaccination was relatively unavailable in Vietnam. Conversely, many Chinese migrants have come to Australia more recently (within the past 10 years) and received vaccination before departure.</p>
<p>It is interesting that self-reported testing and vaccination rates in our sample appear somewhat higher than those reported in North America.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1010539510390205">12</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1010539510390205">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1010539510390205">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1010539510390205">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1010539510390205">22</xref></sup> For example, self-reported rates of both testing and vaccination are around 20% lower in one survey of North American Vietnamese.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1010539510390205">20</xref></sup> However, another household survey reported a testing rate of 67% in this subpopulation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1010539510390205">22</xref></sup> For Chinese people surveyed in Australia, the reported rates were above the upper bound of estimates on testing (60% vs 37% to 57%) and especially for vaccination (52% Australia versus 31% to 38% North America).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1010539510390205">12</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1010539510390205">14</xref></sup> The apparently higher testing and vaccination uptake among Vietnamese and Chinese in the current Australian sample might be a result of more extensive government efforts to deliver public health care services for migrants in this country.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1010539510390205">25</xref></sup></p>
<p>Despite these generally positive findings regarding preventive actions, nearly 1 in 4 Chinese and 1 in 7 Vietnamese respondents did not recall either having been tested or vaccinated. Clearly, there is a need for further efforts by health professionals to assess the risk of HBV infection among Asia-born people, and give appropriate testing and vaccination information. This is especially the case for those who reported prior vaccination but not testing and those without either previous testing or vaccination, which together account for between 20% and 40% of the Vietnamese and Chinese respondents. As expected, respondents who had been tested or vaccinated demonstrated better knowledge about the disease than those without these actions, although this was only significant in the Chinese sample.</p>
<p>The marked difference in the rate of self-reported HBV infection between the Chinese and Vietnamese group in this study seems inconsistent with the current estimates of prevalence in these two ethnicities in the literature (approximately 10% to 11% for both Vietnam-born and China-born community in Australia<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1010539510390205">4</xref></sup>). The self-reported rate of Vietnamese respondents in the current study (11.6%) was similar to this estimate, though lower than the prevalence found in some studies among communities living in Vietnam.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1010539510390205">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1010539510390205">27</xref></sup></p>
<p>For the Chinese respondents, the prevalence of 3.5% was half that of a recent national estimate in China (7.2%)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1010539510390205">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1010539510390205">29</xref></sup> and also lower than the self-reported rates in other countries.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1010539510390205">12</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1010539510390205">14</xref></sup> It is possible that some Chinese respondents were unwilling to disclose their HBV-positive status because of a fear of discrimination and stigma as suggested elsewhere,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1010539510390205">30</xref></sup> although there is no apparent reason to consider why such factors might differentially influence disclosure by Chinese compared with Vietnamese respondents. Another possibility may be a greater reluctance by Chinese people to access health services for testing and diagnosis, a behavior noted for other medical conditions such as cerebrovascular disease.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1010539510390205">31</xref></sup></p>
<p>This study has several implications for public health interventions. It seems clear that most Vietnamese people surveyed in this Australian city prefer their home language and prefer their doctors as main providers of HBV information. This was also indicated in a qualitative study among Vietnamese women in Brisbane who were reliant on their Vietnamese doctors for general health information.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1010539510390205">32</xref></sup> This finding emphasizes the responsibility of physicians to provide accurate and sufficient HBV-related information for the patients during their consultations. Certainly, these practitioners should be equipped with appropriate training or supplementary information. For the Chinese respondents, the Internet was the most common source of information, although this trend might have been partly influenced by the fact that more Chinese were in the younger age band compared with the Vietnamese. Nevertheless, this suggests a potential opportunity for web-based education campaigns on HBV targeting young Chinese migrants, as suggested in the area of HIV prevention and sex education.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1010539510390205">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1010539510390205">34</xref></sup> Online health resources can be very effective for people with limited English proficiency,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1010539510390205">35</xref></sup> particularly for sensitive issues such as hepatitis B and sexual transmission.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1010539510390205">36</xref></sup></p>
<p>One significant limitation of this study was the use of convenience sampling, which raises questions about the generalizability to the population.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1010539510390205">37</xref></sup> Because of the sensitive nature and stigmatization of being HBV positive, it could be anticipated that some people with HBV infection would have been reluctant to participate in filling out a questionnaire in an open community setting. As a result, the HBV infection prevalence may be inaccurate. There may be similar inaccuracies concerning testing and vaccination rates as these relied on self reported recall. It is reasonable to expect that respondents may be mistaken as to the nature of previous blood tests or injections.</p>
<p>Another weakness was that the (necessarily brief) questionnaire did not include a number of important sociodemographic variables that are known to be potential confounders in analysis of health knowledge and practices, such as education level, marital status, or socioeconomic status.</p>
<p>The lack of an Australia-born control group restricted us in making comparisons between the Vietnamese and Chinese sample and a third European-based population. Consequently, we are unable to make definitive statements as to levels of knowledge and awareness compared with the overall population.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>The considerably high risks of hepatocellular carcinoma among people in Australia who were born in China and Vietnam<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1010539510390205">5</xref></sup> underscore the need for evidence-based health promotion and health services for these communities. This study adds to the scant local information for identifying potential guides for intervention. Certainly, better factual education for people with HBV and their communities, continued efforts to promote testing and vaccination, and enhanced support for general practitioners are warranted to improve awareness and practices for prevention, care, and treatment.</p>
