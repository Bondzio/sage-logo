PEEK composites with various amounts of BGF (10, 20, 30 and 40 wt%) were prepared as PEEK-BGF10, PEEK-BGF20, PEEK-BGF30 and PEEK-BGF40. Afterward, PEEK and PEEK-BGF40 specimens were treated with hydrofluoric acid, sulfuric acid (H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>), silica coating and polishing, respectively. Acrylic hollow cylinders were luted with Dentex dual-curing resin cement to the specimens. Finally, SBS measurements were conducted with a universal testing machine. The introduction of BGFs greatly enhanced SBS of PEEK to resin cement. After simply polishing with 150 grit silicon carbide papers (G150), PEEK-BGF40 exhibited the SBS value up to 19.73 ± 4.30 MPa, similar to the PEEK treated with H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> etching. Scanning electron microscopy and x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy were used to investigate the surface morphological and chemical changes in PEEK and PEEK-BGF composites before and after surface treatment. The results indicate that the introduction of BGF particles plays a key role in improving the adhesion between PEEK and resin cement. This study provides a new method to enhance the adhesion to PEEK without breaking its surface structure, which encourage further research in PEEK composite application in dentistry.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>PEEK</kwd><kwd>barium-containing glass</kwd><kwd>bonding</kwd><kwd>dual-curing resin cement</kwd><kwd>shear bond strength</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="section1-0954008312474031"><title>Introduction</title><p>Poly(ether ether ketone) (PEEK), a semicrystalline high performance thermoplastic, was commercialized 30 years ago for industrial usage.

It was well known that PEEK could not be damaged by any solvents except for concentrated H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0954008312474031">1</xref></sup> So, HF could only etched out exposed BGF particles without changing PEEK bonding property, which has been proved by XPS and SEM characterizations. It is clear that BGF fillings play a key role in improving the adhesive property of PEEK. Such improvement could be owing to (1) reaction between BGF and resin cement and (2) the improvement of superficial energy and wettability.</p><fig id="fig4-0954008312474031" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><p>Bar chart representation of shear bond tests.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0954008312474031-fig4.tif"/></fig><p>Silica coating was able to establish an adhesion to PEEK surface with the bond strength of 4.39 ± 1.17 MPa, whereas it decreased the adhesion to PEEK-BGF40 by 23.26% with the bond strength of 7.71 ± 1.57 MPa (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05). After silica coating, the coupling agent could penetrate into the surface structure of PEEK and PEEK-BGF composites. The coupling agent could hydrolyze to silanols and further condense and deposit, which then form a continuous siloxane film on the surface.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0954008312474031">34</xref></sup> Chemically, silane coupling agents could copolymerize with the carbon–carbon double bonds of resin cement monomers. As a result, the silica coating was helpful to adhesion of PEEK to cement with the bond strength of 4.39 ± 1.17 MPa. This result is in agreement with previously published results.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0954008312474031">9</xref></sup> However, due to the fact that the coupling agent could obstruct the reaction between BGF and resin cement concluded from XPS and SEM analyses, the bond strength between silica-coating PEEK-BGF40 and resin cement decreased to 7.71 ± 1.57 MPa (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05), which is about 23% decrease when compared with untreated one.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0954008312474031">35</xref></sup></p><p>After 98% H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> etching, PEEK and PEEK-BGF40 showed high SBS of 17.77 ± 2.86 MPa and 19.70 ± 3.12 MPa, respectively (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05). H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> etching led to a highly porous and permeable surface structure of PEEK and PEEK-BGF40, which would facilitate the cement penetration.

The SBS between PEEK and resin cement is dramatically increased by BGF reinforcement.
