<abstract>
<p>This conceptual study examines the importance of relationships between teachers and students in court-mandated adult education settings. Although research has been done on the importance of relationships between teachers and incarcerated students, there have been no outstanding studies on the relationships developed between teachers and students who attend court-mandated adult education programs. This research suggests that an educational alliance is formed between teachers and students in community corrections settings, and this relationship is an important aspect in teaching this special population of adult learners. Suggestions for practitioners on forming relationships with court-mandated students are discussed.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The term <italic>educational alliance</italic> is used to describe the relationship that develops between teachers and court-mandated community corrections students (students who are on probation or parole) in adult education settings. This term is used because of its similarity to the relationships that develop between therapists and clients, that is, the therapeutic alliance. The therapeutic alliance is often considered the most important aspect of the therapeutic relationship. Similarly, it is suggested here that the educational alliance is the most important part of the educational relationship between teachers and community corrections students in adult education.</p>
<p>Based on research by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1045159512452409">R. D. Mottern (2011)</xref>, it is suggested that this educational alliance creates a relationship chiasm (“chiasm” comes from the Greek word, “chi,” or χ) between teachers and correctional students who are mandated to attend adult education classes. The term, chiasm, was described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1045159512452409">Merleau-Ponty (1964)</xref>: “I can feel myself touched as well and at the same time as touching” (p. 142). Young and Davis (as cited in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1045159512452409">Thomas, 2005</xref>) described chiasm as “the wave when it breaks and curls over. It is the place in the wave where the water touches itself” (p. 68). It suggests that the experiences of teachers and students are intertwined, crossed, and “there is a circle of the touched and the touching” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1045159512452409">Merleau-Ponty, 1964</xref>, p. 143). In R. D. Mottern’s phenomenological research, the phenomenon of teachers’ experiences is grounded in this chiasm between teachers and students.</p>
<p>With the number of individuals in community corrections programs (probation and parole) reaching 5.1 million (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1045159512452409">Pew Center on the States, 2009</xref>) and states looking at research that suggests that General Educational Development (GED) attainment reduces recidivism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1045159512452409">Brewster &amp; Sharp, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1045159512452409">Case, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1045159512452409">Steurer &amp; Smith, 2003</xref>), more and more individuals are being court mandated to attend adult education classes to work on their GED diploma. This means that GED teachers working in community settings are seeing more students who are court mandated to attend their classes. In 2003, 30.6% of community corrections clients did not have a high school diploma or equivalency diploma (U.S. Department of Justice, Bureau of Justice Statistics, 2003), representing 1.6 million people, all of whom were potential adult education students.</p>
<p>This article suggests that teachers working in adult education will see an increase in community corrections students, students on probation or parole who are court mandated to attend educational programs within the community, a population they may be ill prepared to deal with. Court-mandated community corrections students are a special population that is understudied and, therefore, misunderstood. This article provides information about this special population so that teachers may be better prepared to form educational alliances with these adult students and, thereby, better facilitate educational goals. Because correctional education is a foreign field for many, and the practices within correctional education often seem at odds with traditional adult education values, this topic will be reviewed at some length.</p>

<title>Literature Review</title>
<p>The term <italic>educational alliance</italic> is used to indicate that a special type of relationship is formed in the educational setting between teachers and court-mandated students. This term intentionally denotes a similarity to the therapeutic alliance that develops between therapists and clients and is often viewed as the most efficacious factor in the counseling relationship (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1045159512452409">Asay &amp; Lambert, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1045159512452409">Connors, Carroll, DiClemente, Longabaugh, &amp; Donovan, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1045159512452409">Kurtz &amp; Grummon, 1972</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1045159512452409">Meier, Barrowclough, &amp; Donmall, 2005</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1045159512452409">Fleckles (1972)</xref> used educational alliance to describe the relationship between psychiatric residents and their supervisory mentors and stated its significance in no uncertain terms: “When the opportunity exists for an active mutual educational alliance, he [the resident] experiences professional growth, maturation, and individuation. Where it does not, he is likely to stagnate” (p. 1111). The concept of educational alliance is similarly used in other medical research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1045159512452409">de la Torre &amp; Appelbaum, 1974</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1045159512452409">Frances &amp; Clarkin, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1045159512452409">Frankel &amp; Beckman, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1045159512452409">Mishne, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1045159512452409">Tiberius, Sinai, &amp; Flak, 2002</xref>) to describe the relationship between student and mentor in these educational settings.</p>

<title>Differences Between Correctional and Noncorrectional Students</title>
<p>The importance of forming an educational alliance with community corrections students becomes especially important when teachers meet adult students where they are as court-mandated learners. Correctional students think and, therefore, behave differently than noncorrectional students (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1045159512452409">Abel et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1045159512452409">Andrews et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1045159512452409">Chavaria, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1045159512452409">Gendreau, Little, &amp; Goggin, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1045159512452409">Hubbard &amp; Latessa, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1045159512452409">Landenberger &amp; Lipsey, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1045159512452409">Mandracchia, Morgan, Garos, &amp; Garland, 2007</xref>). Criminal thinking is considered to be a criminogenic need, that is, a dynamic risk factor that is alterable and affects the risk of recidivism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1045159512452409">Crime and Justice Institute at Community Resources for Justice, 2009</xref>). The body of research dealing with the thinking and behaviors of correctional clients and how to go about changing the thinking and behavior is known as the <italic>what works</italic> or <italic>evidence-based</italic> literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1045159512452409">Andrews &amp; Dowden, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1045159512452409">Chavez &amp; Dawe, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1045159512452409">Harper &amp; Chitty, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1045159512452409">Hollin, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1045159512452409">Kennedy, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1045159512452409">MacKenzie, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1045159512452409">Pearson, Lipton, Cleland, &amp; Yee, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1045159512452409">Sherman et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1045159512452409">Vennard, Sugg, &amp; Hedderman, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1045159512452409">Wilson, Bouffard, &amp; MacKenzie, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>Evidence from the research (cited above) on correctional clients indicates that students within the correctional system often do not share the same values, morals, and beliefs of the teachers who instruct them. This is what defines them as antisocial, here defined not as a personality disorder but as the propensity to harm people, places, and things, and it is this thinking—and the choice to act on it—that places them within the correctional system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1045159512452409">Truthought, 2003</xref>). This view that students do not share the same values, morals, and beliefs of those who are educating them is somewhat alien in the world of adult education. Adult educators often expect to interact with adult students in an egalitarian manner, and they may find their ideological feathers ruffled when it is suggested that their students may not be on an equal moral footing. This, however, is the situation in which adult education teachers often find themselves when teaching correctional clients. The teachers are expected, by the same system that views the students as antisocial, to behave in a prosocial manner and act as models of behavior for the students (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1045159512452409">Dowden &amp; Andrews, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1045159512452409">Latessa, Cullen, &amp; Gendreau, 2002</xref>). <italic>Prosocial</italic> here means ethically and legally conducting one’s life and respecting the lives of others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1045159512452409">Truthought, 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>To treat correctional students in the same manner as one would treat noncorrectional students would, in fact, be to deny the research (previously cited) that suggests that very real differences exist in the way correctional students view and interpret the world, and it would be expecting correctional students to come to the educational table with something they do not possess at the time—a prosocial way of thinking and behaving. This expectation is neither useful nor empathetic. Compassion would dictate that teachers realize the cognitive differences of correctional students and teach in a manner that acknowledges those differences, meeting students where they are on a cognitive level. In addition, although adult education teachers are not social workers or forensic counselors, teaching is a very broad practice. Teachers working with correctional students often interpret the educational mandate to include mentoring students in prosocial thinking and behaviors and not strictly to impart educational facts such as the Pythagorean Theorem. This type of mentoring relationship between teachers and court-mandated students is the educational alliance.</p>

<title>Differences Between Community Corrections and Incarcerated Students</title>
<p>Teaching community correctional students is also different from teaching incarcerated students on the basis of the compulsory nature of attendance. Correctional students within the community have different pressures affecting their educational attendance than those who are incarcerated. When incarcerated, for example, being allowed to attend education classes may be seen as a privilege, allowing students to get out of their pod and socialize to some degree (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1045159512452409">Tolbert, 2002</xref>). Community-based programs are somewhat different in that students must maintain a life in the community while meeting requirements of community supervision. Students no longer have their basic needs (e.g., food, clothing, shelter, medical attention) provided by city, county, or state government, and they must engage in the normal day-to-day business of living by providing these necessities for themselves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1045159512452409">Haney, 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>Gone, as well, is the vast amount of free time one has while incarcerated. Time in the free world is spent in finding and maintaining employment and meeting the conditions of release, which may include paying program fees, court costs, and performing community service restitution (i.e., work done in the community, such as picking up trash along highways, and so on). All these demands on the outside compete with time for education, which may also be required as a condition of release from incarceration. The difference between life in prison and life on the outside has been acknowledged as a serious concern for offender reentry and reintegration programs (programs that help offenders adjust to the differences between life in prison and life in the community), and US$100 million was granted to states by the federal government in 2002 to help establish effective reentry programs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1045159512452409">Visher &amp; Travis, 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>Although previous research with this population of court-mandated students indicated that, at some level, they appreciated being coerced to attend educational classes, it also indicated initial resistance to this intrusive mandate and resentment toward it (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1045159512452409">Davis, Mottern, &amp; Ziegler, 2010</xref>). This intrusiveness may create a classroom environment different from that of typical GED/Adult Basic Education (ABE) instruction, an environment where students are influenced by the mandate to attend classes and are, overtly or covertly, resistant to instruction. Rather than being self-directed in their studies, students may grudgingly attend classes they perceive as interference in other aspects of their lives as they adjust to life on the outside. This attitude may, in turn, affect the way teachers experience coerced students in the GED/ABE classroom. It is axiomatic in adult education that adult students <italic>vote with their feet</italic> (i.e., leave the classroom if they are dissatisfied with some aspect of the educational experience). This tendency is mediated in correctional education by the fact that students are mandated to attend classes by the court and consequences may be applied if students do not follow the court orders. Although the courts can mandate attendance at educational classes, they cannot make students learn. This resistance to the educational process manifests itself in various ways that teachers must use their resourcefulness and ingenuity to overcome. Although this sort of challenge may or may not be part of a teacher’s job, those who work with correctional students are often called on to tap these resources.</p>
<p>The lack of research on adult education teachers working with community corrections students would seem to indicate that these teachers have somehow been lumped into general community-based GED/ABE programs, without taking into account that they are working with a special population (that of correctional clients) and without the normal power structures of a correctional environment to mediate the experience. (A Google Scholar search <italic>for community corrections adult education</italic> yielded two hits, one of which dealt with emerging partnerships within communities and the other was <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1045159512452409">R. D. Mottern’s 2011</xref> study.) Teachers’ experiences working in prisons and other correctional institutions have been researched, but, as suggested above, it is believed that there is a very large gap between teachers working inside in jails and prisons and teachers working outside in community programs with coerced students.</p>

<title>Similarities Between Correctional Students and Alternative School Students</title>
<p>Although a lack of research on community corrections adult education leaves us in a theoretical lurch, we may turn to research in K-12 education dealing with similar populations. Even though some differences may exist between adult and nonadult populations, as has been previously stated, examination of the similarities may prove useful. K-12 education has realized that certain students do not benefit from the same type of structure and instruction as other students. These students tend to do better in alternative schools (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1045159512452409">Bland, Church, Neill, &amp; Terry, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1045159512452409">Quinn &amp; Poirier, 2006</xref>). Although a comprehensive definition of an alternative school does not exist throughout the educational system, a general definition includes schools that serve at-risk populations who are not likely to complete high school (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1045159512452409">Lehr &amp; Lange, 2003</xref>). Special types of alternative education, such as Disciplinary Alternative Education programs, may exist for those students who have “violated local or state-mandated rules of conduct or have been determined to be disruptive to the education of other students in their assigned schools” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1045159512452409">Texas Education Agency, 2007</xref>, p. 1). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1045159512452409">Lehr and Lange (2003)</xref> reported on findings from the Alternative Schools Research Project (which included data from 48 states) that
<disp-quote>
<p>nearly 65% of the respondents indicated that students were placed in alternative schools as a result of a decision made by someone other than the student or the parent (usually school staff). Students are often placed in alternative schools as an alternative to or following suspension or expulsion. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1045159512452409">Lehr &amp; Lange, 2003</xref>, p. 4)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Characteristics of students who attend alternative K-12 schools often closely match those who attend court-mandated adult education programs. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1045159512452409">Bland et al. (2012)</xref> investigated students’ thinking about reasons students are at risk for dropping out of school and found that dropout students talked about “the lack of care by high school staff, their own feeling of being uncomfortable in the high school setting, and the fact that teachers in the high school didn’t help them” (p. 34). Court-mandated students reported similar reasons for not finishing high school and the research found students’ experiences in court-mandated adult education were grounded in previous school experiences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1045159512452409">Davis et al., 2010</xref>). Students in successful alternative schools reported their experiences in those schools as positive, citing “school size, flexibility, and teacher relationships characterized by care and concern” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1045159512452409">Lange &amp; Sletten, 2002</xref>, p. 17). Adult students in the Davis et al. study included two of the four characteristics of their experiences in the court-mandated program,
<disp-quote>
<p>(3) “There should be somebody in there helping you out” (the teacher should be there to aid learning, what they expect and how they expect to learn), and (4) “I applied myself and he [the instructor, in the original] helped me apply myself” (I need the teacher). (p. 4)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The relationship with the teacher is a significant part of the success for alternative school students and court-mandated adult students.</p>
<p>Research on teachers in alternative schools suggests that the teacher–student relationship is an integral aspect of successful student performance in those programs, based in part on how teachers effectively negotiate their interactions with the students (who hold the thoughts about how that relationship should be, as indicated in the above research). The teacher–student relationship in alternative school settings is essential:
<disp-quote>
<p>Informants agreed that teachers in these programs were “different” than teachers in traditional settings. Some students referred to them as “friends” who they could “talk comfortably with” and “who are willing to listen.” Students also used words like: caring, awesome, fun, calm, friendly, and kind. They described their teachers as people who did not “take a joke too seriously,” “would not discriminate you,” and who are “kind of cool.” One student said that teachers at his school “really do care.” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1045159512452409">Quinn &amp; Poirier, 2006</xref>, p. 31)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Parents of alternative school students characterized teachers as “‘like another parent’ who ‘never seems to be having a bad day’ and who ‘love what they are doing’” (Quinn &amp; Poirier, p. 31). The unique relationship that exists between alternative schoolteachers and students is a characteristic of a successful alternative program.</p>
<p>Similarities appear to exist between court-mandated students and alternative school students, the majority of whom are mandated to attend alternative education. These similarities revolve around the special relationship that is formed between the students and the teachers. Phenomenological research by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1045159512452409">R. D. Mottern (2011)</xref> indicates that the teacher–student relationship in court-mandated adult education with correctional students is a central aspect of that experience for teachers and may define that relationship.</p>

<title>Method</title>
<p>A search for <italic>educational alliance</italic> in peer-reviewed scholarly journals in the Education Full Text database of the University of Tennessee libraries returned four results. All the results used educational alliance as a reference for programmatic associations, community partnerships, or similar alliances and not in the context of a personal relationship between teachers and students in an educational setting. A similar search of Education Resources Information Center (ERIC) yielded five results. These results also referenced working relationships between educational programs and not between individuals. A search of the PsychINFO database yielded 8 relevant results for <italic>educational alliance</italic>. These results concerned psychiatric supervision and training and were used in the same conceptual sense as used by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1045159512452409">R. D. Mottern (2011)</xref>. A search for <italic>educational alliance</italic> in the Google Scholar database yielded 553,000 results. A subsequent search with modifiers, that is, <italic>educational alliance</italic> and <italic>teacher–student relationships</italic>, returned 525 results. These included few contextual references. Although results did include references for medical supervision and training, the vast majority referenced institutional partnerships. No references obtained from any searched database used the term <italic>educational alliance</italic> in the context of relationships between teachers and students outside of the medical supervision and training.</p>
<p>As results obtained from Education Full Text, ERIC, and PsychINFO databases yielded results redundant with those obtained from Google Scholar, subsequent searches used only Google Scholar. A search for the terms <italic>educational alliance</italic> and <italic>community corrections</italic> yielded 117 results. These results were mainly for organizational partnerships and similar references. A refined search, that is, <italic>educational alliance</italic> and <italic>community correction</italic>, yielded only one result, that is, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1045159512452409">R. D. Mottern (2011)</xref>.</p>
<p>A search for <italic>educational alliance</italic> and <italic>adult education</italic> yielded 147 results. The majority of these results dealt, once again, with organizational programs and community alliances and not with individual relationships. Those references of contextual significance were primarily redundant from previous searches. One reference, however, Bloom (in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1045159512452409">Burrows, Stanley and Bloom, 2001</xref>), specifically spoke about educational alliance and adult education.

<title>Findings</title>

The term is not used in the general literature of adult education, although the concept of forming meaningful teacher–student relationships to facilitate learning is endemic to the practice of adult education. That this type of relationship is fostered in teachers’ work with community corrections students is evidenced by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1045159512452409">R. D. Mottern’s (2011)</xref> phenomenological study of teachers’ experience working with this special population.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1045159512452409">R. D. Mottern (2011)</xref> found the teacher–student relationship in adult education with court-mandated students was grounded in the unique relationship between teachers and students in these settings and circumstances. Mottern borrows from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1045159512452409">Merleau-Ponty (1964)</xref> and describes this unique relationship as a <italic>chiasm</italic>, an intertwining of teachers’ experiences with the students and the teachers’ understanding of the students’ experiences (which are also experienced by the teachers). These experiences were represented by four themes: where teachers experience a change in the manner in which students view learning, where teachers experience that students realize they can learn, where teachers understand that they make a difference to society through educating students, and where teachers experience feelings of accomplishment in their role as a teacher. It is through these thematic experiences that teachers become grounded in relationships with their correctional students. These themes are similar to aspects attributed to teacher–student relationship success in alternative K-12 educational programs. Of especial note is the idea that when working with correctional students, “your world stops,” the description one teacher gave of working with correctional students, indicating that her attention was focused on these students when they entered the classroom:</p>
<speech>
<speaker>P:</speaker>
<p>So, I guess you would say we have been real busy, we’d be into something, and somebody’d walk in, and you just change your - your world stops because you’ve got to get them - that’s your job.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>I:</speaker>
<p>So that’s an interesting metaphor, that when these students walk in, “your world stops,” and it sort of becomes, then</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>P:</speaker>
<p>Their world. (R. Mottern, in press)</p>
</speech>
<p>The need for correctional students to have the focused attention of the teacher (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1045159512452409">Davis et al., 2010</xref>) is recognized by teachers working in court-mandated adult education settings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1045159512452409">R. D. Mottern, 2011</xref>). This is very similar to the expressed needs of students in alternative education programs for teacher engagement in the learning process, often to an extent beyond the ordinary:
<disp-quote>
<p>[T]he demands on the [alternative school] staff are extraordinary and most people in our society probably wouldn’t be able to do it, so they have to have just a sort of inherent trait toward liking kids and these kinds of kids. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1045159512452409">Quinn &amp; Poirier, 2006</xref>, p. 31)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Those teachers in R. Mottern’s (2012) study who had some longevity working with correctional students indicate that their relationships with correctional students are similar to those teacher–student relationships in alternative education programs. One participant talked about the need to relate to his students and does that through an approach that may be considered unconventional in traditional educational settings:
<disp-quote>
<p>I have three children, five years apart. So I have learned to be street savvy. And my youngest is seventeen at (School A). And I know the music, I know how to talk the music, we play the music, and we relate. Long as they learn, have no problem with that. And we become very tight with those guys. We just get on their - their level, and we can talk just about anything they want to talk about, ‘cause when that big old door closes, we have a good time, we learn and they relate, and they trust us. They know we’re there to help them, not to beat them over the head, take them to the office and all that crapola. We don’t do that. That’s old school. We’re there to - to give them a new chance, a new opportunity to make something out of themselves. They feel like we’re there to help them; we’re friends with them. (R. Mottern, in press)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>This relationship, however, also comes with the expectation of commitment to learning, and the participant showed high expectations for his clients. Drawing from R. Mottern’s (2012) study, one participant explained,
<disp-quote>
<p>[I]f they screw up, I take them somewhere and I - I kind of get in their face. “What do you think you’re doing?” You know? Some of them tear up, you know, “I’m sorry, Gomer.” . . . And they don’t do it again. But you’ve got to push. Nobody else is doing it. Real school system didn’t do it for them, whatever reason. It just didn’t work for them. You fill in. This has worked for some of the younger ones. They’re just not used to it. You always love to hear, “Man, if you’d been my teacher in high school, I’d have never left.”</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Such themes are repeated throughout the data and indicate that the unique characteristics of teachers working with community corrections students are very similar to teachers working with alternative education clients. The formation of an educational alliance through building meaningful relationships within the classroom must be a prerequisite when working with correctional students.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The research in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1045159512452409">R. D. Mottern’s (2011)</xref> study found that the relationship between teachers and students is so profound as to create a chiasm between them, an educational alliance that transforms court-mandated students into participatory learners. As this educational alliance may, indeed, be transformative in nature, literature from transformative learning on forming authentic relationships may help teachers working to form this alliance. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1045159512452409">Cranton (2006)</xref> suggested that the formation of authentic and transformative relationships requires self-awareness of the teacher, an awareness of students as individuals, the formation of a relationship with students on an appropriate level, an awareness of the situational context of the learning relationship, and critical reflection by the teacher on his or her individual role within the teaching relationship.</p>
<p>Part of the understanding of correctional students as individuals requires meeting them on their individual level of thinking and behavior. Recognition of thinking errors by teachers working in court-mandated adult education may help them understand from where students are coming in their approach to the educational relationship. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1045159512452409">R. Mottern (2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1045159512452409">2007</xref>) suggested strategies for using therapeutic concepts, including recognition of thinking errors, with correctional students as a way to facilitate the learning process.</p>

<title>Summary</title>
<p>Adult education teachers who work with court-mandated students, and that number may be rising as the number of individuals remanded to probation and parole increases, must be able to recognize and respond to the special needs of correctional students. Although correctional students are not defined as special-needs students on the basis of being correctional students alone, research suggests that these individuals represent a very special population of adult learners, characterized by patterns of thinking and behaving that place them within the correctional system. Teachers must recognize that these patterns of total behaviors do not vanish when students are placed on probation or parole but are carried into the classroom as a part of the whole being of the student. Teachers should be cognizant of these needs, especially the strong need for a relationship with the teacher as a caring individual, and the need to form an educational alliance between teacher and student to facilitate learning. Court-mandated students in adult education demand much of their teachers. Teachers who are able to recognize and respond to these needs motivate students to be successful. Teachers who do not recognize the need for an educational alliance are seen by students as uncaring and are, therefore, unmotivating. When working in adult education with court-mandated students, the creation of an educational alliance comes first.</p>
