<title>Objective:</title>
<p>Psychological variables such as perceived stress appear to play a role in symptom onset or disease exacerbation in multiple sclerosis (MS). The authors sought to determine if perceived stress is indeed associated with the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines and disease symptoms in individuals with MS. To do so, the authors examined the relationships among disease symptomatology, perceived stress, and cytokine production from peripheral blood mononuclear cells in 42 outpatients with MS and 36 normative controls.</p></sec>
<sec>
<title>Method:</title>
<p>The authors drew peripheral blood from all subjects prior to the completion of a series of psychological instruments. The authors measured stress using the Perceived Stress scale and negative mood with the Profile of Mood States. Disease symptoms were measured using the Multiple Sclerosis Symptom Checklist. Cytokine production was induced separately by lipopolysaccharide and a combination of phytohemagglutinin and phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate.</p></sec>
<sec>
<title>Results:</title>
<p>In MS subjects, the induced production of interleukin (IL)-6 and IL-10 positively correlated with psychological stress, mood disturbance, and disease symptomatology. In contrast, psychological stress in control subjects significantly correlated with level of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), and mood disturbance correlated with levels of TNF-α and interferon-gamma. As well, compared to controls, MS subjects exhibited a significant fourfold increase in the production of IL-12.</p></sec>
<sec>
<title>Conclusion:</title>
<p>There is, in those with MS, a pattern of IL-6 and IL-10 production that correlates significantly with perceived stress and disease symptomatology.</p></sec>

<body>
<p>Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic, degenerative neurologic disorder that evolves from an immune-mediated inflammatory demyelinating process. While the pathogenic process of MS is not fully understood, the disorder is believed to emerge from an interaction of genetic susceptibility with precipitating environmental factors. Although controversial, among the possible environmental factors contributing to the pathogenic process of MS may be a state of psychological stress.</p>
<p>Research evidence supports the involvement of psychological variables, particularly psychological stress, in the exacerbation or onset of MS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1099800411425703">Franklin, Nelson, Heaton, Burks, &amp; Thompson, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1099800411425703">Grant et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1099800411425703">Kroencke &amp; Denney, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1099800411425703">Warren, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1099800411425703">Warren, Cockerill, &amp; Warren, 1991</xref>). While there is evidence of an alteration in the rate of symptom exacerbation in relation to psychological stress, the impact of psychological stress on those immune mechanisms related to disease progression and symptom exacerbation is not clear. Research evidence has demonstrated the existence of a pattern of communication between nervous, endocrine, and immune systems in normal controls, such that perceived stress can modulate immune function including cytokine production and secretion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1099800411425703">Heinz et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1099800411425703">Koh, Lee, Beyn, Chu, &amp; Kim, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1099800411425703">Yamakawa et al., 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>In normal control subjects, researchers have found psychological stress to be associated with an increase in the production of select pro-inflammatory cytokines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1099800411425703">Heinz et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1099800411425703">Yamakawa et al., 2009</xref>). Such findings indicate that alterations in cytokine production and secretion, whether adaptive or maladaptive, are part and parcel of the homeostatic response to psychological stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1099800411425703">Maes, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1099800411425703">Maes et al., 1998</xref>). However, the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines in response to psychological stress may also be associated with the development of psychopathologic conditions. In those with MS, it is possible that the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines in response to psychological stress may result in a disruption of the necessary balance between the production of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1099800411425703">Welsh et al., 2009</xref>). As cytokine dysregulation is associated with the pathogenic process of MS, it is critical to understand the potential influence of psychological stress on cytokine balance in MS. A stress-induced imbalance in cytokine production may trigger worsening of symptoms in those with MS, whereas in a healthy population such a change might have little overall influence on health.</p>
<p>Individuals with a chronic disease like MS may also be prone to react to stress in a differential manner than normal controls (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1099800411425703">Klapps, Seyfert, Fischer, &amp; Scherbaum, 1992</xref>), exhibiting a stress response that may contribute to the course and progression of disease through the modulation of cytokine production. We thus conducted a study to examine the relationships among perceived stress, disease symptomatology, and cytokine production in those with MS.</p>
<p>Previously, we reported findings regarding the relationships among perceived stress, other psychological variables, and disease symptomatology in those with MS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1099800411425703">Sorenson, Janusek, &amp; Mathews, 2006</xref>). In brief, we found significant positive correlations between perceived stress and mood disturbance in both controls (<italic>r</italic> = .447, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .010) and individuals with MS (<italic>r</italic> = .797, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001). In individuals with MS, the strength of the correlation between perceived stress and total mood disturbance was almost twice as strong as that found in control subjects. We also found significant positive correlations between total disease symptomatology and total mood disturbance (<italic>r</italic> = .719, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001) and total disease symptomatology and perceived stress (<italic>r</italic> = .745, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001). Having identified a relationship between psychological variables and disease symptomatology in those with MS, we now report our findings linking cytokine production with both psychological variables and disease symptomatology.</p>

<title>Method and Materials</title>
<sec id="section2-1099800411425703">
<title>Sample and Setting</title>
<p>The study was descriptive, comparative, and longitudinal in nature. We recruited a convenience sample of male and female patients previously diagnosed with clinically definite MS using the Poser criteria from the outpatient neurology clinic of a large Level I medical center in Illinois and from regional community support groups. We attempted to avoid the recruitment of individuals until at least 6 months after the time of diagnosis due to possible confounding side effects associated with the start of medication therapy. We also excluded from consideration individuals with current symptoms of cardiovascular, respiratory, neoplastic, or other autoimmune disorders. We recruited control subjects from the surrounding community. Prior to implementation of the study, we obtained approval from the Institutional Review Board. We also obtained informed consent from all subjects prior to study participation.</p>
<p>Initially, 42 patients with MS consented to participate. Of these, one did not complete all psychological measures, and we could not obtain the appropriate amount of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) in two. All participants but one had been free of corticosteroid and immunosuppressant therapy for at least 2 months prior to study entry; we did not assay the cytokines of the one individual who had ceased immunosuppressant therapy (Imuran) 2 weeks prior to study enrollment. Therefore, cytokine data are limited to 39 subjects and psychological data to 41 subjects. We obtained data from 36 control subjects.</p>
<p>We saw participants in a variety of community and clinic settings, where we obtained blood (30 mL) by venipuncture and asked participants to complete the psychological instruments. Control participants completed the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS), Profile of Mood States (POMS), and a demographic data sheet, which we used to collect information on gender, age, medical conditions, and use of medications and other drugs. MS study participants completed the PSS, the POMS, the MSSC, and a demographic data sheet, which elicited the same information as from controls with the addition of questions regarding diagnosed type of MS and clinical pattern.</p>

<title>Psychological Instrumentation</title>
<p>The PSS is a 10-item subjective self-report measure designed to measure cognitive appraisal of a global state of stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1099800411425703">Cohen, 1994</xref>). The PSS has stability reliability as demonstrated through the use of test–retest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1099800411425703">Cohen, Kamarck, &amp; Mermelstein, 1983</xref>) and homogeneity reliability as demonstrated through a Cronbach’s α coefficient of .75 in a norm-referenced sample (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1099800411425703">Cohen &amp; Williamson, 1988</xref>). In this study, we found homogeneity reliability as determined by Cronbach’s α to be .91.</p>
<p>The POMS is a 65-item self-report measure designed to assess affect and mood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1099800411425703">McNair, Lorr, &amp; Droppleman, 1992</xref>). A total mood disturbance score can be derived (POMS-TD), as well as scores for six subscales that assess further components of mood: tension-anxiety (POMS-T), depression-dejection (POMS-D), anger-hostility (POMS-A), vigor-activity (POMS-V), fatigue-inertia (POMS-F), and confusion-bewilderment (POMS-C). Homogeneity reliability was demonstrated through Kuder–Richardson 20 (KR20) scores of between .84 and .95 for the six factors. Stability reliability was demonstrated through test–retest coefficients ranging from .65 to .74. For the present study, Cronbach’s α subscales scores ranged from .69 to .96.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1099800411425703">
<title>Symptom Assessment</title>
<p>The MSSC is a 26-item self-report measure designed to assess for the presence of 26 disease symptoms common in MS patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1099800411425703">Gulick, 1989</xref>). The tool consists of five subscales assessing motor function, sensory disturbance, mental and emotional concerns, bowel and bladder elimination, and brain stem symptomatology. Homogeneity reliability has been determined through the use of Cronbach’s α with subscale scores ranging from .78 to .87. Total scale Cronbach’s α was .89 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1099800411425703">Gulick, 1998</xref>). Participants score items on a 6-point scale with responses ranging from <italic>never</italic> to <italic>always</italic>. Higher scores indicate the presence of increased symptomatology. We calculated Cronbach’s α levels for all subscales and the total instrument in this study. Subscale scores were as follows: motor .75, sensory disturbance .76, mental and emotional concerns .88, elimination patterns .87, and brainstem symptoms .31. Total instrument Cronbach’s α was .90.</p>

<sec id="section5-1099800411425703">
<title>Immunologic Measurement</title>
<p>We determined cytokine profiles by measuring cytokine production from bulk-cultured supernatant fluids of stimulated and unstimulated PBMCs. We selected this method as a means of examining variance in the capacity of cells to produce cytokines in association with psychological variables and disease symptomatology. Plasma cytokines provide a glimpse into cytokine production but do not demonstrate what the cell is capable of producing under challenging conditions. Using a mitogenic challenge provides a sense of cell capacitance that can then be examined in relation to other variables. We processed blood within 2 hr of sample procurement. Heparinized peripheral blood was overlaid onto Ficoll/Hypaque and then centrifuged at 1,000 × g for 20 min. Cells at the interface were washed with Hank’s balanced salt solution and enumerated with a standard hemacytometer.</p>
<p>PBMCs (1 × 10<sup>6</sup>) were cultured in Roswell Park Memorial Institute formulation (RPMI) 1640 plus 10% fetal bovine serum (supplemented with glutamine, penicillin, and streptomycin), with and without a mixture of phytohemagglutinin (PHA) and phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate (PMA; PMA @ 20 ng/well; PHA @ 0.05%/well) in 24-well plates for 48 hr at 37 °C. Previous kinetic studies measuring cytokine production with the above technique established that 48 hr of incubation would be optimal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1099800411425703">Witek-Janusek &amp; Mathews, 1999</xref>). Additional cells were stimulated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS; 1.0 μg/mL at 48 hr). After 48 hr, aliquots of supernatant fluid were collected and stored (−70 °C) until analyzed.</p>
<p>We examined the following cytokines: interleukin (IL)-6, IL-10, IL-12, IL-13, interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α). We used a quantitative sandwich enzyme immunoassay technique to measure all cytokines in duplicate (Quantikine kit, R&amp;D Systems, Minneapolis, MN). Sensitivity was as follows: IL-6, 0.70 pg/mL; IL-10, 3.9 pg/mL; IL-12 5, pg/mL; IL-13, 32 pg/mL; IFN-γ, 7 pg/mL; and TNF-α, 4.4 pg/ml. We used serum controls (R&amp;D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) to monitor interassay reliability.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1099800411425703">
<title>Data Analysis</title>
<p>We determined internal consistency reliability coefficients for each of the psychological instruments. We initially screened and analyzed all data descriptively. We then analyzed demographic (age and gender) and clinical variables (length of time since diagnosis and medications) to determine possible independent effects of these variables on stress-immune profiles. We coded all data and entered them into a spreadsheet workbook created in Microsoft Excel and into statistical package for the social sciences (SPSS), version 10.05, comparing data entries between Microsoft Excel and SPSS to ensure correct entry. We conducted all data analyses using SPSS. The alpha level we determined prior to analysis for correlational methods, nonparametric statistics, and <italic>t</italic> tests was <italic>p</italic> = .05.</p>
<p>On occasion, participants failed to complete all items on select psychological instruments. When this occurred we contacted the participant to obtain a response to the missing item. For psychological items not noted to be missing until well after the time point, we used mean substitution. We did not, however, replace missing cytokine data, resulting in variable sample sizes.</p>
<p>We examined all data prior to analysis for the presence of outliers. In general, we considered an outlier to be a value that lay outside 2 <italic>SD</italic>s from the mean and excluded them from analysis.</p>
<p>All reported correlations were bivariate Pearson’s <italic>r</italic> correlation coefficients, unless otherwise indicated. We administered Levine’s test for equality of variance prior to conduction of <italic>t</italic> tests for independent samples. We further tested those samples that obtained a .05 level of significance on Levine’s test (which indicated the existence of a nonnormative pattern of distribution) using the nonparametric statistic Mann–Whitney <italic>U</italic> test. In such cases, we give the score for the Mann–Whitney and indicate it as such.</p>
<p>We used <italic>t</italic> tests for independent samples to determine between-group differences in cytokine production for MS patients versus healthy controls and also for MS patients stratified into high versus low levels of perceived stress. We awarded high–low group designations based on a median split using the PSS, classifying participants as high stress if the PSS scores were at or above the median (≥20) and as low stress if PSS scores were below the median (&lt;20). Stratification of participants into high- and low-stress groups produced variable numbers for comparison. When stratification resulted in less than five subjects for comparison on a particular variable, we did not examine the scores for that variable.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<sec id="section8-1099800411425703">
<title>Sample Characteristics</title>
<p>MS subjects were between 28 and 75 years of age (<italic>M</italic> = 49, <italic>SD</italic> = 9.11), with 12 male subjects (28.6%) and 31 female subjects (71.4%). In those with MS, individuals identified as Caucasian (<italic>n</italic> = 38) comprised the majority of the sample (90.5%), with three subjects identified as African American (7.1%) and 1 as American Indian. Control subjects were between 29 and 54 years of age (<italic>M</italic> = 43, <italic>SD</italic> = 1.34). All control subjects were identified as Caucasian; three control subjects were male and the remainder female (<italic>n</italic> = 31).</p>
<p>To ensure equality of groups in terms of age and other demographic variables, we performed independent <italic>t</italic> tests and the Mann–Whitney <italic>U</italic> test. We found no significant differences between the control and MS groups in terms of age, gender, race, or marital status. We did, however, find a significant difference in level of education, <italic>t</italic> = 4.35 (44, confidence interval [CI] [1.88, 2.30]), <italic>p</italic> &lt; .000, with control subjects reporting significantly more years of education (<italic>M</italic> = 18.70, <italic>SD</italic> = 1.34) than MS subjects (<italic>M</italic> = 15.19, <italic>SD</italic> = 2.44).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-1099800411425703">
<title>Form of MS</title>
<p>We asked each MS subject to specify whether they had been diagnosed with a subtype or form of MS. There were 24 individuals with relapsing remitting (55.8%), 6 with chronic progressive (13.9%), 1 with progressive-recurring or nonprogressive, and 9 (20.9%) who were unable to identify whether a particular form of MS had been diagnosed and whom we categorized as type unknown. None of the chronic progressive individuals identified themselves as having primary progressive MS.</p>
<p>In order to determine whether reported form of MS accounted for differential cytokine production or for variance in relation to psychological measures, we performed serial <italic>t</italic> tests for independent samples. To provide a sufficient number of subjects for valid comparison, we placed all individuals with a progressive element to the disease process (progressive-recurring, chronic progressive) into one category labeled “progressive.” This resulted in a sample of eight progressive disease subjects who we then compared with relapsing–remitting subjects. We found no significant differences in any study variables between the two groups.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-1099800411425703">
<title>Perceived Stress, Mood State, and Cytokines</title>
<p>In MS subjects, PSS and total mood disturbance (POMS-TD) scores significantly and positively correlated with PHA/PMA-induced production of IL-6 and LPS-induced production of IL-10 (See <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1099800411425703">Table 1</xref>
). In addition, POMS-TMD significantly and positively correlated with PHA/PMA-induced production of IL-10. We did not see these correlations among control subjects. Rather, in control subjects, the production of three cytokines correlated significantly in a positive manner with PSS and POMS-TD scores: The LPS-induced production of TNF-α significantly correlated with PSS scores (<italic>r</italic> = .808, <italic>p</italic> = .05); PSS scores also were significantly and positively correlated with IL-12 production as induced by PHA/PMA stimulation (<italic>r</italic> = .751, <italic>p</italic> = .012); and the PHA/PMA-induced production of IFN-γ was positively correlated with POMS-TD scores (<italic>r</italic> = .493, <italic>p</italic> = .044). In MS subjects, we found no significant correlations among psychological variables and production of TNF-α, IL-13, or IFN-γ.</p>

<title>Between-Group Comparisons: High- and Low-Stress Groups</title>
<p>Among MS subjects, there were select significant differences in the cytokine production of subjects identified as low stress (<italic>n</italic> = 17) as compared with those identified as high stress (<italic>n</italic> = 24). High-stress MS subjects produced higher levels of LPS-induced IL-10 (<italic>M</italic> = 3.75 ng/mL, SEM = .52 ng/mL) than did low-stress MS subjects (<italic>M</italic> = 1.97 ng/mL, SEM = .28 ng/mL; <italic>U</italic> = 106, <italic>z</italic> = −2.45, <italic>p</italic> = .01). While it did not reach a significant level of difference, there was a trend for high-stress MS subjects to produce higher levels of TNF-α in response to PHA/PMA stimulation (high-stress <italic>M</italic> = 7.04 ng/mL, SEM = 0.75 ng/mL; low-stress <italic>M</italic> = 5.39 ng/mL, SEM = 0.87 ng/mL). As well, the production of IL-6 in response to both PHA/PMA (high-stress <italic>M</italic> = 28.76 ng/mL, SEM = 3.51 ng/mL; low-stress <italic>M</italic> = 19.48 ng/mL, SEM = 3.78 ng/mL) and LPS stimulation (high-stress <italic>M</italic> = 40.35 ng/mL, SEM = 2.76 ng/mL; low-stress <italic>M</italic> = 35.67 ng/mL, SEM 3.46 = ng/mL) tended to be higher in MS subjects categorized as high stress, though again, these differences did not reach statistical significance.</p>
<p>When we grouped control subjects in relation to level of stress based upon a median split of PSS scores, the majority fell into the low-stress group (<italic>n</italic> = 33 vs. <italic>n</italic> = 5). The mean difference in PSS scores of control subjects classified as high stress when compared to those with low stress was 11.20 points, <italic>t</italic> = −6.77 (33, CI [−14.56, −7.84]) <italic>p</italic> &lt; .000. Control subjects did not display any significant group differences in terms of cytokine production in response to either LPS or PHA/PMA stimulation. However, it is worth noting that individuals with higher levels of stress had generally lower levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines than did low-stress individuals, primarily for cytokine production as induced by LPS (TNF-α, IL-6, IL-10; data are not shown).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The objective of this study was to investigate the relationships among degree of psychological stress, disease symptomatology, and cytokine profile in individuals with MS. In MS subjects, the induced PBMC production of both IL-6 and IL-10 was positively correlated with psychological stress and disease symptomatology. Normal controls subjects did not exhibit these correlations.</p>
<p>Previous research has examined IL-12 production in MS and control subjects with inconsistent results. Investigators have found noted decreases in the amount of biologically active IL-12 in MS subjects who were not treated with immunomodulatory agents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1099800411425703">Rohowsky-Kochan, Molinaro, Choudhry, Kahn, &amp; Cook, 1999</xref>). However, findings of the present study are consistent with other research findings that IL-12 may indeed be elevated in those with MS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1099800411425703">Karp, Biron, &amp; Irani, 2000</xref>). After finding increased amounts of p-40 in clinically stable progressive MS subjects, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1099800411425703">Heesen, Sieverding, Schoser, Hadji, and Kunze (1999)</xref> concluded that this protein, which is associated with IL-12, may have anti-inflammatory properties, and therefore, the functional properties of IL-12 may be far more complex and involved than previously believed. This protein was not elevated in individuals with a relapsing–remitting form of MS and may serve as a marker for differential forms of the disease. However, in the present study, we found no differences in IL-12 production among the different forms of MS. Perhaps, the limited sample size for IL-12 results masked any existing differences.</p>
<p>There were also differences between the control and MS subjects in the specific cytokines that correlated significantly with psychological stress. In those with MS, the production of both IL-10 and IL-6 correlated significantly with total mood disturbance, perceived stress and total disease symptomatology, illness uncertainty, and several of the POMS subscales. Among the cytokines we measured, IL-6 and IL-10 are the ones commonly produced by macrophages and dendritic cells. In control subjects, we found no significant correlations between IL-6 production and psychological measures.</p>
<p>The literature has demonstrated a pattern of heightened IL-6 production in those with MS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1099800411425703">Kouwenhoven, Teleshova, Ozenci, Press, &amp; Link, 2001</xref>). This finding may be somewhat predictable because MS is an autoimmune disease and IL-6, a component in the acute inflammatory response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1099800411425703">Feghali and Wright, 1997</xref>), is generally considered to be pro-inflammatory in nature. This evidence has led to the suggestion that heightened IL-6 production may serve as a marker of immune system activation in those with MS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1099800411425703">Hautecoeur, Forzy, Gallois, Demirbilek, &amp; Feugas, 1997</xref>). IL-10, on the other hand, has suppressive effects on the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1099800411425703">de Waal Malefyt, 1999</xref>) and on MS pathogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1099800411425703">Ozenci, Kouwenhoven, Huang, Kivisakk, &amp; Link, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1099800411425703">van Boxel-Dezaire et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1099800411425703">Wang, Frank, &amp; Ritz, 2000</xref>). Ironically, an increase in the production of IL-10 could be related to the increased production of IL-6. Nicoletti et al. (2000) conjectured that the primary mechanism behind the therapeutic effect of IFN-β was a general increase in the production of IL-6 in response to its administration. This increase in the level of IL-6 would, in turn, activate T-helper (Th)2 and Th3 (globally suppressive) cytokines. Investigators have also noted that the production of IL-10 increases during chronic (nonexacerbating) phases of MS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1099800411425703">da Costa et al., 2000</xref>). There is, then, support from previous studies for increased production of IL-6 and IL-10 in MS patients.</p>
<p>It is worth considering the effect of the inclusion in our sample of subjects on immunomodulatory therapies (variants of IFN-β) used in the treatment of MS. Approximately two thirds of the present study sample was treated with either Avonex or Betaseron. While we found no significant difference between the two treatment groups (Avonex and Betaseron) and untreated MS subjects (data not shown), the possibility cannot be ruled out. The use of such agents may provide an explanation for the apparent suppression of IFN-γ in the MS sample and the increase in the production of IL-10. Yet, the production of IL-6 in untreated subjects was slightly higher than in those treated with either agent.</p>
<p>In those with MS, then, there is a pattern of cytokine production that reflects immune system activation. Increased levels of IL-6 reflect activation of the immune system, and prior research has demonstrated levels of this cytokine to be elevated in the presence of psychological stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1099800411425703">Maes et al., 1999</xref>). The process may be countered by increased production of IL-10, preventing disease exacerbation. This conceptualized process could easily be disrupted by the production of further stress-/distress-related elements, leading to a state of disease exacerbation. The lack of an association between examined cytokines and reported MS symptoms could hint at other aspects of the disease process that remain unexamined. The findings from both MS and normative control subjects also indicate that the physiologic mechanisms involved in the response to psychological stress may influence macrophage and dendritic cell populations differently than monocyte cell populations.</p>

<sec id="section15-1099800411425703">
<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>The finding of differential cytokine production between MS and control subjects in correlation with psychological variables argues for the development of biobehavioral nursing interventions designed to aid the individual in coping with, or managing the influence of, environmental events. The goal of nursing has been defined as the improvement, or enhancement, of individual adaptation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1099800411425703">Roy &amp; Andrews, 1991</xref>). In order to attain such a goal, we need to continue to increase our understanding of the physiologic mechanisms by which psychological stimuli can have an effect on the physiologic state of the individual. Aiding the individual with MS to develop coping mechanisms that are more efficacious in the amelioration of psychological stress may, in turn, reduce the presentation of disease. The development of such interventions is beyond the scope of this investigation, yet this work does highlight the importance and salience of such interventions and emphasizes the need for nursing research to attend to bioimmunologic processes.</p>
