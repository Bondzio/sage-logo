<abstract>
<p>The aim of this study was to investigate if newly developed polyurethane (PU) scaffolds are suitable as scaffold for cell-seeded meniscus tissue engineered constructs. Scaffolds were seeded with goat meniscal fibrochondrocytes and cultured to assess changes in biological and mechanical properties. Furthermore, the effect of TGF-β on these properties was investigated. PU scaffolds were made from poly <sc>d</sc>/<sc>l</sc> lactide and caprolactone as soft segments and 1,4-butanediisocyanate for the urethane hard segments. The porosity of the scaffolds was 95%. Isolated goat meniscal fibrochondrocytes were seeded on the scaffolds and cultured with or without the addition of 10 ng/mL TGF-β in standard culture medium. After 2, 4, and 6 weeks of culture, scaffolds were analyzed for cell proliferation, matrix synthesis, and mechanical properties. Scanning electron microscopy and histology showed that the scaffolds had an interconnected isotropic pore structure. Without the addition of TGF-β, cells did not proliferate during the culture period and isolated meniscus fibrochondrocytes were more frequently located in the peripheral parts of the scaffold. Fibrochondrocytes supplemented with TGF-β were distributed throughout the construct. Clustered cells were surrounded by matrix which stained slightly positive for glycosaminoglycans (GAGs). Also, collagen production was increased significantly after 4 and 6 weeks of culture compared to cultures without TGF-β and also more GAG staining was found after 4 and 6 weeks in the sections of the TGF-β stimulated cultures. Despite the increase in matrix production, the compressive stiffness of the constructs was not increased during the culture period. Meniscal fibrochondrocytes were able to adhere to the PU scaffold. However, the scaffold itself does not stimulate proliferation and matrix production. The addition of TGF-β resulted in a strong induction of both proliferation and extracellular matrix production.</p>

<p>Menisci are semilunar-shaped structures located in pairs in each knee joint. They fill the gap between the round femoral condyle and the rather flat (medial) or even concave (lateral) tibia plateau. Although the meniscus has quite a number of functions in the knee joint, the main function of the meniscus is to distribute stresses in a homogenous way over the articular surfaces of the tibia and femur. To withstand the high forces in the knee, the fibro-cartilage of the meniscus has a highly circumferentially oriented type I collagen fiber organization. Moreover, it also contains type II collagen and some glycosaminoglycans (GAGs), particularly in the inner highly loaded part of the meniscus.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0885328211417317">1</xref></sup> The composition of the tissue enables the meniscus to withstand compressive and tensile shear forces and to maintain its position under load. Thereby, it transfers axial loads into circumferential directed forces.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0885328211417317">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0885328211417317">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>Meniscus injury will generate pain and cause mechanical locking of the knee joint. The most frequent occurring meniscus traumas are tears. The peripheral part of the meniscus is the so-called red zone which is vascularized. Since vascularization is a key player in regeneration after trauma,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0885328211417317">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0885328211417317">5</xref></sup> tears in this location normally can heal.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0885328211417317">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0885328211417317">6</xref></sup> When tears occur in the inner two-third of the meniscus, also called the white zone of the meniscus, no or very limited regeneration is possible due to a lack of vascularization.</p>
<p>The flap tear and bucket handle tear are the most common meniscus injuries. In the past, the resulting loose fragments were arthroscopically removed. Although this treatment is an enormous improvement compared to a total meniscectomy, even a partial meniscectomy will result in osteoarthritic changes in the articular cartilage.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0885328211417317">7</xref></sup> Also, the amount of meniscal tissue removed has a direct relationship with the induction of late osteoarthritis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0885328211417317">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0885328211417317">9</xref></sup> Upon removal of meniscal tissue, more load is directly transferred from the condyles to the tibial plateau, resulting in large peak stresses which cause an early onset of osteoarthritis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0885328211417317">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0885328211417317">7</xref></sup> Therefore, in order to preserve the contact area of the meniscus, the general practice these days is fixation of the loose fragment to the main body of the meniscus by suturing, anchors, or screws.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0885328211417317">10</xref></sup> Unfortunately, the used fixation devices are still inferior to cope with the forces applied on the meniscus, resulting in high rates of ruptures or even osteochondral defects.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0885328211417317">11</xref></sup> When fixation is not possible or insufficient, a partial meniscectomy is inevitable.</p>
<p>Regeneration of the lost part of the meniscus would be the most optimal treatment. A scaffold that replaces the meniscus tissue could guide new tissue ingrowth into the lost meniscus and by that meniscus regeneration could be established. Two implants based on scaffolds are already in clinical use, namely a scaffold based on collagen (Menaflex™) and one based on a synthetic polymer (Actifit®).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0885328211417317">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0885328211417317">13</xref></sup> The Menaflex™ implant has already been implanted for a number of years and supports ingrowth of a new meniscus-like tissue. However, the scaffold shrinks in size after 5 years.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0885328211417317">13</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0885328211417317">15</xref></sup> The Actifit® implant, based on a synthetic caprolactone-urethane polymer, is only recently available in Europe. Preclinical animal experiments showed that implantation of this scaffold in a partial defect will enable equal contact pressures as a normal meniscus, whereas without implantation contact pressures increase.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0885328211417317">16</xref></sup> After implantation, the scaffold had rapid ingrowth of tissue and no cartilage defects were present after 1 year.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0885328211417317">17</xref></sup> These experiments were conducted in partial meniscus defects, but when implanted as a total meniscus replacement, the scaffold was not strong enough and failed to protect the cartilage from damage.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0885328211417317">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0885328211417317">19</xref></sup> Recently, the first patient study with Actifit® as a partial replacement has been published. After 1 year follow-up, implant was integrated with native meniscus tissue, and biopsies showed fully vital tissue.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0885328211417317">20</xref></sup></p>
<p>In contrast to partial meniscal replacement, the only clinically used treatment for total meniscus replacement is allograft transplantation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0885328211417317">21</xref></sup> Even though clinical results are satisfactory, there exists a minor risk of disease transfer, the availability is limited due size matching, and the allograft meniscus can re-tear, shrink, and dislocate.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0885328211417317">22</xref></sup></p>
<p>Tissue engineering could be a promising alternative approach to replace the lost tissue after (partial) meniscectomy. Pre-cultured cell-seeded scaffolds showed better integration with the surrounding meniscus tissue in an <italic>ex vivo</italic> setup.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0885328211417317">23</xref></sup> Also, in <italic>in vivo</italic> experiments, cell-seeded constructs showed better integration with adjacent tissue after implantation in defects.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0885328211417317">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0885328211417317">25</xref></sup> Pre-seeding cells on a scaffold also strongly improved the mechanical properties compared to the initial scaffold.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0885328211417317">26</xref></sup> Three cell types are most often used so far, namely mesenchymal stem cells,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0885328211417317">23</xref></sup> chondrocytes,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0885328211417317">27</xref></sup> meniscal fibrochondrocytes (MFCs),<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0885328211417317">28</xref></sup> or a combination of these cell types.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0885328211417317">27</xref></sup> Which cell type is best suited for these cell-seeded constructs remains unknown. To stimulate these cell-based meniscal constructs, a number of growth factors (GFs) have been tested. Most commonly used are TGF-β, IGF, bFGF, and PDGF.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0885328211417317">28</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0885328211417317">32</xref></sup> These GFs stimulate cell proliferation, matrix production and migration, thereby reducing the time needed to engineer new meniscus tissue.</p>
<p>Which type of scaffold is best suited for meniscus TE is still pending. Scaffolds of many different composites, e.g., based on hydrogels, biologic polymer (collagen/silk), or synthetic polymer (PLA/PGA/PCL), have been described in literature.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0885328211417317">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0885328211417317">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0885328211417317">34</xref></sup> A synthetic polymer scaffold with very promising characteristics has already been described in detail by Spaans et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0885328211417317">35</xref></sup> and van Minnen et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0885328211417317">36</xref></sup> They synthesized a polyurethane (PU) co-polymer porous scaffold with poly <sc>d</sc>/<sc>l</sc> lactic acid (PDLLA) and poly-ε-caprolactone (PCL) as soft block segments and 1,4-butanediisocyanate (BDI) as hard block urethane segments.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0885328211417317">36</xref></sup> These highly porous scaffolds were tested both <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> for cytotoxicity and degradation. The <italic>in vitro</italic> experiments showed that after 12 weeks only 3.4% mass was degraded, thereby categorized as a slow degrading scaffold. Cytotoxicity tests showed that scaffolds did not change the proliferation speed and metabolic activity of fibroblast after direct contact.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0885328211417317">37</xref></sup> The long-term test showed some cytotoxicity; however, this was ascribed to the accumulation of degradation products in their <italic>in vitro</italic> test system.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0885328211417317">37</xref></sup> The <italic>in vivo</italic> experiments of short- till long-term subcutaneous implantation showed no toxicity. The scaffolds followed a gradual resorption pattern over 3 years. First, encapsulation and infiltration with connective tissue was observed. Subsequently, degradation and resorption by macrophages and giant cells was found. Scaffolds were not completely resorbed after 3 years but they were expected to be totally resorbed after 3.5–4 years.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0885328211417317">38</xref></sup></p>
<p>The PU described above has a number of novel aspects compared to other synthetic polymer scaffolds previously used for meniscus tissue engineering purposes or in clinical practice. The scaffold described in this study has a 95% porosity compared to approximately 80% porosity of most other scaffolds.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0885328211417317">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0885328211417317">39</xref></sup> This high porosity is required to increase surface area for cell attachment and tissue ingrowth; moreover, it facilitates adequate transport of nutrients and cellular waste products.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0885328211417317">40</xref></sup> With decreasing porosity, nutrient and waste exchange of cells in the deeper regions is limited, leading to necrotic sites in the center of the scaffold.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0885328211417317">19</xref></sup> Another advantage of a high porosity is that it, in general, will lead to a faster speed of resorption as less polymer material has to be degraded. Reducing the time for which the foreign materials remain present in the body has been shown to lower the risk on immunological responses. In addition, with smaller amounts of polymer material to be degraded, lower acidic levels will be reached. Higher acidity levels are known to reduce tissue regeneration speed.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0885328211417317">37</xref></sup> The high porosity of the material used in our study also aims to insure a faster resorption rate, low immunological risk, and high tissue regeneration speed. Furthermore, the use of a co-polymer from caprolactone and both isomers of lactic acid excludes crystalline regions in this material. It has been described that increasing crystallinity results in highly stable remnants and increases inflammatory risk in a late degradation stage.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0885328211417317">41</xref></sup></p>
<p>The aim of this study was to improve the properties of the PU scaffolds as described by van Minnen et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0885328211417317">36</xref></sup> by a tissue engineering approach for total meniscus replacement. Pre-seeding cells on scaffolds could have beneficial effects on biological and mechanical properties. In this study, biological properties (i.e., proliferation, distribution, and matrix production) were tested after culture of MFCs on this PU scaffold. Furthermore, we tested the effect of TGF-β on these biological properties. Finally, the mechanical properties of this tissue-engineered construct was determined to assess whether it is comparable to native meniscus.</p>

<sec id="sec3-0885328211417317"><title>Scaffold preparation</title>
<p>Scaffolds were composed of 50% DL(50/50)-lactide (PDLLA, Purac) and 50% ε-caprolactone (PCL, Acros Organics) by ring opening polymerization with 1,4-butanediol (BDO) as initiator. The final macrodiol prepolymer had a number average molecular weight (M<sub>N</sub>) of 2000 g/mole. Subsequently, this was end-capped with BDI. Chain extension was performed with a BDO–BDI–BDO urethane block, which resulted in a hard block urethane segment with a uniform length of five urethane moieties. Final PU consisted of 22.5% (w/w) hard urethane segments and 77.5% (w/w) amorphous polyester soft segments. Polymers were solvent casted, frozen, and lyophilized. The obtained scaffolds had a 95% porosity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0885328211417317">36</xref></sup> Finally, scaffolds were frozen in liquid N<sub>2</sub>, punched with a 6 mm internal diameter dermal punch, and cut into 3 mm high cylinders. After cutting the scaffolds, SEM images were made to evaluate the internal pore structure of the scaffolds (JEOL JSM 6310, JEOL Ltd, Herts, UK).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec4-0885328211417317"><title>Cell isolation</title>
<p>Both lateral and medial menisci from four skeletal mature female Dutch milk goats (Capra Hircus Sana) were isolated immediately after sacrifice under aseptic conditions. Tissue collection was approved by the Animal Ethics Committee of the Radboud University, Nijmegen. Isolation of MFCs was performed according to earlier reported protocols.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0885328211417317">42</xref></sup> In short, menisci were washed three times with PBS/1 × PSF (penicillin/streptomycin/fungizone, Gibco, Carlsbad, CA, USA). Subsequently, the outer rim was removed and inner part cut into small pieces. These pieces were digested in DMEM/F12 + 1 × PSF with 3 mg/mL collagenase II (Worthington, Lakewood, NJ, USA) for 48 h in a 5% CO<sub>2</sub>, 37°C controlled culture incubator. Digest was filtered over 70 µm tissue filter bags and filtrate centrifuged for 10 min at 1100 rpm to pellet the cells. Cells were washed two times with PBS and plated in culture flasks. Cells were cultured in standard medium (DMEM/F12 + 10% FBS + 1 × PSF) in a culture incubator. At 70% confluence, cells were passed once by trypsinization using standard procedures. Passage 1 cells were harvested, frozen in cryo-vials, and preserved in liquid nitrogen until use.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec5-0885328211417317"><title>Cell culture</title>
<p>Before start of the experiment, cells were defrosted and expanded twice. Finally, cells were isolated, counted, and used for cell culture experiments. MFCs isolated had a &gt;95% cell viability determined by trypan blue exclusion. Scaffolds were ethanol sterilized in series till 96% EtOH, washed three times with sterile PBS, and incubated o/n in standard culture medium. Scaffolds were squeezed to remove excess medium and passage 4 MFCs, a total of 5 × 10<sup>5</sup> in 50 µL, were placed on top of each scaffold and incubated for 60 min in an incubator. After incubation, standard medium was added with or without 10 ng/mL TGF-β (R&amp;D Systems, Minneapolis, MN, USA). Total medium was refreshed three times a week.</p>
<p>Pilot tests were performed with different concentrations of TGF-β (1 ng, 10 ng, and 100 ng/mL). If 10 or 100 ng/mL was added, proliferation was shown to increase. However, no differences were observed between 10 and 100 ng. Therefore, 10 ng/mL was used in the current experiments. Scaffolds were cultured for 2, 4, and 6 weeks without or with the addition of 10 ng/mL TGF-β in standard medium and performed in triplo.</p>

<p>After 2, 4, and 6 weeks of culture, samples were washed with PBS and frozen in Milli Q. After repeated freeze/thaw cycles, samples were measured using PicoGreen dsDNA assay kit as per manufacturer’s protocol (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec7-0885328211417317"><title>Collagen analyses</title>
<p>After 2, 4, and 6 weeks of culture, samples were washed and frozen in PBS. Samples were analyzed to quantify the amount of collagen using a colorimetric hydroxyproline assay.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0885328211417317">43</xref></sup> In short, samples were hydrolyzed in 6 N HCl by autoclaving for 20 h at 110°C. The hydrolyzate was washed twice with Milli Q. Chloramine-T was added and incubated for 20 min at room temperature. Subsequently, Ehrlich’s reagent was added and chromophore developed during 20 min at 60°C. Finally, absorbance was read at 570 nm using a spectrophotometer.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec8-0885328211417317"><title>Routine histology</title>
<p>Scaffolds were paraffin embedded and sections of 7 µm in thickness cut. Sections were deparaffinized and rehydrated. Oil red O with hematoxylin (ORO/H) for cell staining, and alcian blue for GAG staining, were used for routine histology. For ORO/H staining, sections were shortly incubated in ORO. Hereafter, cell nuclei were counterstained with hematoxylin and mounted with aquamount. For alcian blue, sections were washed in 3% acetic acid, and incubated for 45 min in alcian blue. After washing, cell nuclei were counterstained with nucleus red and mounted with DPX. All samples were analyzed under light microscopy and pictures recorded with an Olympus digital camera and a photo program software (analySIS Soft Imaging System, GmbH, Münster, Germany).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec9-0885328211417317"><title>Mechanical analyses</title>
<p>At day 0 and after 2, 4, and 6 weeks of culture, samples were tested for mechanical stiffness. Samples were placed in a Bose ElectroForce BioDynamic bioreactor mounted with a 22 N load cell housed in a 37°C incubator (BOSE, MN, USA). The specimen chamber was filled with PBS and scaffolds were compressed at 1 mm/min till 20% compression. With the obtained stress/strain curve, the Young’s modulus was calculated as the steepness of this curve.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec10-0885328211417317"><title>Statistics</title>
<p>A two-way ANOVA was used on all datasets with treatment (TGF yes/no) and time (0, 2, 4, and 6 weeks) as factors. All data were expressed as mean ± SEM.

<p>SEM images showed that the scaffolds had macropores with diameter in the range 100–300 µm. All macropores were interconnected by micropores ranging 10–30 µm.

<p>Irrespective to the culture period, isolated MFCs were homogeneously distributed throughout the scaffolds which were not stimulated by TGF-β; however, in the periphery, slightly more cells were present. After 6 weeks of culture, more cells were present at the outer surface but they did not formed a continuous layer.

<p>In the cultures stimulated with TGF-β, more cells were present. Already after a culture period of 2 weeks, more cell clusters were found than isolated cells, not only on the surface of the scaffolds but also in the deeper regions. After 4 and 6 weeks, the difference with the nonstimulated scaffolds was even more pronounced. On the surface of the scaffold, a continuous layer of MFCs surrounding the scaffold was present. Clusters of cells were found up to the center of the scaffolds. With the alcian blue staining, the difference between nonstimulated and stimulated cultures was further illustrated.

<p>Until this date, scaffolds based on collagen or caprolactone urethane (PU) have been developed to regenerate partial defects in human menisci.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0885328211417317">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0885328211417317">20</xref></sup> These scaffolds are implanted without cells. Results are promising for partial defect repair, but not applicable for all patients. Furthermore, it is not possible to treat defects involving the rim of the meniscus with these scaffolds. To repair such a defect with a scaffold, it is worthwhile to invest the possibility to enhance the biological and mechanical properties by seeding cells prior to implantation. These pre-cultured scaffolds are able to integrate with the host tissue stronger and faster.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0885328211417317">23</xref></sup> To supply sufficient volume for cells to grow and synthesize matrix a 95%, highly interconnective porous scaffold was used.</p>
<p>The first aim of this study was to investigate the biological properties of cell-seeded scaffolds. Scaffolds made from 50/50 P(<sc>d</sc>/<sc>l</sc>)LA and PCL with BDI were seeded with MFCs and cultured up to 6 weeks. This study shows that MFCs can be cultured on this scaffold. However, they did not proliferate and extracellular matrix (ECM) synthesis did not increase in time. Also, the number of cells in the center of the scaffold was limited. This could be due to the hydrophobic nature of the scaffold or by a lack of nutrition in the center.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0885328211417317">44</xref></sup> Another explanation could be that passage 4 MFCs lose the ability to proliferate or synthesize matrix.</p>
<p>To enhance biological response, 10 ng/mL TGF-β was added to standard medium. TGF-β is known to induce proliferation and matrix syntheses. Addition of TGF-β increased proliferation of MFCs cultured in these scaffolds. This effect of TGF-β is in line with results described by others.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0885328211417317">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0885328211417317">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0885328211417317">46</xref></sup> Moreover, the amount of collagen and GAG, which are two main components of the meniscus ECM, also increased after TGF-β stimulation. Increase in matrix was not only due to an increase in cell numbers. As indicated with the picogreen assay, total cell number was 3.75 times higher compared to nonstimulated cultures. Collagen synthesis was increased more than 15 times compared to nonstimulated cultures. This means that collagen production per cell was also strongly increased by TGF-β. In addition, this proves that passage 4 MFCs are still able to proliferate, if correct stimuli are presented to the cells. This indicates that the aforementioned loss of proliferation is not the case. The result that MFCs will not proliferate in the scaffold, under normal culture conditions, points out that the surface characteristics of this scaffold is not bio-inductive for these cells. A study from Gunja et al<italic>.</italic> reported that environmental characteristics have a great effect on MFCs. They showed that with increasing passage number, up to passage 4, MFCs alter gene expressions for collagen and GAGs. Reversal effects could be initiated if re-cultured on a collagen- or GAG-coated surface.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0885328211417317">47</xref></sup> For future applications of this scaffold, it could be advantageous to coat the scaffolds surface with bioactive markers such as collagen or GAG. This would improve correct gene expression, and in the end, lead to native-like meniscal tissue.</p>
<p>The second aim of this study was not realized. The initial Young’s modulus of the scaffold was 26 kPa and did not reduce significantly after 6 weeks of culture due to degradation. This short-term degradation stability is in line with previous studies. Here, it was shown that scaffolds remained physically intact up till 20 weeks.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0885328211417317">48</xref></sup> The initial compressive stiffness measured is below that of human meniscal tissue. Others showed that native menisci vary in mechanical stiffness between 30 and 100 kPa depending on sample site.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0885328211417317">49</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0885328211417317">50</xref></sup> Since cell proliferation and matrix deposition can increase stiffness, the cell-seeded scaffolds were expected to have a higher stiffness.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0885328211417317">51</xref></sup> The TGF-β stimulated group, which synthesized the most ECM, did not increase significantly in mechanical stiffness. However, the mean Young’s modulus of these cultures after 6 weeks was 43 kPa. Possibly, if culture times prolong, matrix synthesis will increase; thereby, the Young’s modulus will increase further and could become similar to that of native meniscus tissue. On the other hand, perhaps initial cell density was too low. Many methods have been described to increase the cell density. The most obvious would be to increase total number of seeding cells. Alternatively, optimizing seeding efficiency can increase initial cell density and distribution. Cell seeding techniques can be divided into static or dynamic systems. Examples of static systems are droplet and cell suspension.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0885328211417317">52</xref></sup> Recently, more dynamic seeding systems have been described which use specially developed devices such as perfusion systems, spinner flasks or bioreactors.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0885328211417317">52</xref></sup> These dynamic seeding techniques yield higher densities and better homogeneous cell distribution.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0885328211417317">52</xref></sup> Also, bioreactors can be promising to increase the biological properties. When dynamic mechanical loading is applied on cell-seeded scaffolds, proliferation and matrix synthesize increase compared to static cultures.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0885328211417317">53</xref></sup> Furthermore, the produced matrix was unorganized while in the meniscus collagen fibers are highly oriented. Methods to increase biological properties further could lead to more <italic>in vivo</italic> like mechanical properties. New methods to increase mechanical properties are <italic>in vivo</italic> cultures of cell-seeded constructs. If pre-seeded scaffolds are cultured subcutaneously, the mechanical modulus becomes higher when compared to <italic>in vitro</italic> pre-seeded constructs.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0885328211417317">54</xref></sup> On the other hand, scaffolds could be adapted to create initially stiffer scaffolds resembling native meniscus more closely.</p>
<p>In summary, MFCs can be cultured in PU scaffolds made from poly <sc>d</sc>/<sc>l</sc> lactide and caprolactone and BDI. However, the scaffold did not permit proliferation of these cells. Addition of TGF-β will increase the biological properties significantly. The mechanical properties, however, remained similar. Further research needs to focus on changing the scaffold’s properties to increase biological and mechanical behavior during culture. Methods to change these properties could be coating the scaffolds surface with biologic cues such as proteins. This can increase the cellular response during cell cultures.</p>
