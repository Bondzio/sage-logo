<abstract>
<p>The ability to adapt to different environmental conditions including seasonal changes is a key feature of the circadian clock. Here, we compared the ability of 3 <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> wild-type strains to adapt rhythmic activity to long photoperiods simulated in the laboratory. Fruit flies are predominantly crepuscular with activity bouts in the morning (M) and evening (E). The M peak follows dawn and the E peak follows dusk when the photoperiod is extended. We show that this ability is restricted to a certain extension of the phase angle between M and E peaks, such that the E peak does not delay beyond a certain phase under long days. We demonstrate that this ability is significantly improved by simulated twilight and that it depends additionally on the genetic background and the ambient temperature. At 20 °C, the laboratory strain <italic>CantonS</italic> had the most flexible phase angle between M and E peaks, a Northern wild-type strain had an intermediate one, and a Southern wild-type strain had the lowest flexibility. Furthermore, we found that the 3 strains differed in clock light sensitivity, with the <italic>CantonS</italic> and the Northern strains more light sensitive than the Southern strain. These results are generally in accord with the recently discovered polymorphisms in the <italic>timeless</italic> gene (<italic>tim</italic>) that affect clock light sensitivity.</p>

<p>A key task of endogenous clocks is to adapt the activity of animals to different environmental conditions and especially to seasonal changes that are accompanied by different photoperiods. This adaptation can nicely be followed in animals showing bimodal activity patterns: The timing of the morning (M) and evening (E) activities of finches correlates with dawn and dusk, meaning that the M activity occurs earlier and the E activity later under long summer days (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0748730411420246">Aschoff and Wever, 1965</xref>). On the other hand, M and E peaks are closer together under short-day conditions. This seasonal change in phase angle between M and E peaks is also observed in other animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0748730411420246">Aschoff, 1966</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0748730411420246">Daan et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0748730411420246">Pittendrigh and Daan, 1976</xref>) including the fruit fly <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0748730411420246">Majercak et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0748730411420246">Rieger et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0748730411420246">Shafer et al., 2004</xref>). For flies and other insects, optimal timing of their activity is most important during long and hot summer days when they are most at risk of overheating and desiccation. Indeed, the flies respond to increased temperature and light intensity by prolonging their siesta and by shifting M and E activity peaks into the early morning and late evening, respectively, already at a 12-hour day length (conventional 12-hour:12-hour light:dark cycles) under laboratory conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0748730411420246">Majercak et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0748730411420246">Rieger et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0748730411420246">Yoshii et al., 2009</xref>). Under long photoperiods, the increased phase angle between M and E peaks is most evident (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0748730411420246">Rieger et al., 2003</xref>). Nevertheless, the previous studies also showed that this increase is limited, indicating that M and E peaks are mutually coupled and not working independently. In the present study, we intended to reveal whether simulated twilight modifies the adaptation of the flies to long photoperiods and whether the flexibility between M and E activity peaks under long days depends on the genetic background of wild-type strains caught in the field.</p>
<p>In nature, gradual changes in light intensity and spectral composition characterize the light transitions of dawn and dusk. Several studies have shown that the clock’s entrainment characteristics differ if twilight transitions are present (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0748730411420246">Wever, 1967</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0748730411420246">Kavaliers and Ross, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0748730411420246">Boulos et al., 1996a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0748730411420246">1996b</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0748730411420246">2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0748730411420246">Fleissner and Fleissner, 1998</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0748730411420246">2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0748730411420246">Gorman and Zucker, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0748730411420246">Danilenko et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0748730411420246">Boulos and Macchi, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0748730411420246">Comas and Hut, 2009</xref>). In these studies, twilight was usually defined as gradual, natural-like changes of light intensity without modifying the spectral composition of light (exception: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0748730411420246">Wever, 1967</xref>). Nevertheless, this kind of simulated twilight provoked a lower day-to-day variability of activity on-sets and thus a higher precision of the rhythms in many species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0748730411420246">Boulos et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0748730411420246">Boulos and Macchi, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0748730411420246">Fleissner et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0748730411420246">Gorman and Zucker, 1998</xref>). In hamsters and mice, simulated twilight additionally changed the phases of the rhythms, and this was correlated with period changes in subsequent constant darkness (DD), suggesting that twilight influences the clock instead of merely provoking masking effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0748730411420246">Boulos and Macchi, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0748730411420246">Comas and Hut, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>In fruit flies, simulated twilight (natural-like change of light intensity over 1.5 hours without modifying color) provoked an almost complete shift of the activity into dawn and dusk (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0748730411420246">Rieger et al., 2007</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0748730411420246">Fig. 1B</xref>): The M activity was advanced and the E activity delayed in comparison to rectangular light-dark cycles. Interestingly, M and E activities peaked when light reached an intensity of approximately 7.5 lux, independently of the final irradiance during the day (10, 100, 500, or 1000 lux) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0748730411420246">Rieger et al., 2007</xref>). This result suggested that the flies prefer to be active at rather dim light. The previous study was performed with the laboratory strain <italic>CantonS</italic> under LD 12:12. Longer photoperiods have not yet been tested with twilight simulation, and it is also unknown whether wild <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> strains respond in the same way to artificial twilight.</p>

<p>To reveal the influence of the genetic background on the adaptation to 12:12 LD cycles and long photoperiods, we compared the behavior of the laboratory strain <italic>CantonS</italic> with that of 2 wild-type strains caught in moderate Southern (46°N) and Northern (52°N) Europe. In the South, the longest photoperiod in summer was around 16 hours, and the flies were observed to be active until early November when photoperiods were already shorter than 12 hours (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0748730411420246">Bhutani, 2009</xref>). In the North, active adult flies were exposed to photoperiods up to 18 hours, and they rarely experience photoperiods shorter than 12 hours because they enter diapause in autumn when the temperature drops below a certain value (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0748730411420246">Bhutani, 2009</xref>). We therefore expected the Northern strain to adapt more easily to long photoperiods than the Southern strain.</p>
<p>Polymorphisms in several clock genes appear to facilitate the adaptation to certain environmental conditions, and among those, the short (<italic>s</italic>) and long (<italic>ls</italic>) forms of the <italic>timeless</italic> (<italic>tim</italic>) gene play a major role in the response to light (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0748730411420246">Kyriacou et al., 2008</xref>). The clock of <italic>s-tim</italic> flies is more light sensitive than that of <italic>ls-tim</italic> flies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0748730411420246">Sandrelli et al., 2007</xref>), but <italic>ls-tim</italic> flies have a higher incidence to enter diapause, likely increasing the flies’ fitness in the North (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0748730411420246">Tauber et al., 2007</xref>). Therefore, it is believed that the <italic>ls-tim</italic> allele, which originated in the South and is still more frequent there, will slowly infiltrate the North (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0748730411420246">Kyriacou et al., 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>Here, we show that the simulation of twilight helped all 3 wild-type strains to adapt to more extreme photoperiods. Nevertheless, the maximal phase angle between M and E activity peaks was limited, genetically determined, and only partly dependent on the <italic>tim</italic> allele.</p>

<title>Strains and Rearing</title>
<p>Locomotor activity was recorded in the laboratory strain <italic>CantonS</italic> that was isolated from a wild strain near Canton, Ohio, in 1930 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0748730411420246">Bridges and Brehme, 1944</xref>) as well as in 2 wild-type strains that were caught from the wild in Northern and Southern Europe (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0748730411420246">Sandrelli et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0748730411420246">Tauber et al., 2007</xref>). The Northern wild-type strain stemmed from one isofemale line caught in the Netherlands, close to the town Houten (52°N). The corresponding strain was named <italic>HU<sub>(4-1)</sub></italic>. The second strain originated from 37 isofemale lines caught in Val Venosta (Alto-Adige) in North Italy (45°N) and was named <italic>ALA</italic>. The isogenic <italic>ALA</italic> lines contributed to a mixed culture, which was regularly refreshed by adding a few flies from the isofemale lines that were maintained separately. The flies were raised on <italic>Drosophila</italic> medium (0.8% agar, 2.2% sugar-beet syrup, 8.0% malt extract, 1.8% yeast, 1.0% soy flour, 8.0% corn flour, and 0.3% hydroxybenzoic acid) at 20 °C in LD 12:12.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0748730411420246">
<title>Recording</title>
<p>At the age of 1 to 3 days, individual male flies were transferred into the recording chambers (photometer cuvettes that were placed with one end in an infrared light beam; on the opposite end, the flies had access to water and sugar). Locomotor activity was recorded photoelectrically in 1-minute intervals at 20 °C (or 30 °C) as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0748730411420246">Rieger et al., 2007</xref>). Illumination was derived from “white” LEDs (Lumitronix LED-Technik GmbH, Jungingen, Germany) and was adjusted to 100 lux (19 µW/cm<sup>2</sup>). Either rectangular LD cycles (lights were shut on and off) were applied or dawn and dusk (LDR cycles) was simulated by increasing/decreasing irradiance in 1-minute steps within 1.5 hours (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0748730411420246">Rieger et al., 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>In the first experiment, the activity of the flies was recorded at 20 °C under LD/LDR 12:12 cycles of different light intensity (10, 100, and 1000 lux; 2.4, 19, and 150 µW/cm<sup>2</sup>, respectively) to judge the response of the flies to increasing irradiances.</p>
<p>In the next experiment, activity was recorded at 20 °C for about 1 week under LD/LDR 12:12 cycles. Subsequently, the duration of the photoperiod was increased symmetrically to 14 hours (or 16 hours). After another week of recording, the photoperiod was further increased (to 18 hours or 20 hours). One experiment was performed under LDR 18:6 cycles at 30 °C.</p>
<p>In a further experiment, the wild-type flies were transferred into DD after initial entrainment to 12-hour:12-hour LD cycles at 20 °C to determine the free-running period of the 3 different strains.</p>
<p>A last experiment was performed to determine the light sensitivity of the clock in the 3 wild-type strains. For this purpose, the flies were entrained to rectangular light-dark cycles of low light intensity at 20 °C. Intensity was adjusted by neutral density filters (Rosco Laboratories Ltd., London, UK). In the first week of recording, light intensity was 6.0 × 10<sup>−3</sup> µW/cm<sup>2</sup> (~0.003 lux). After all flies had entrained to this intensity, the LD cycle was phase advanced by 6 hours, and simultaneously, light intensity was reduced to 3.6 × 10<sup>−4</sup> µW/cm<sup>2</sup> (~0.0002 lux, equal to starlight). In the next step, the LD cycle was again phase advanced by 6 hours, and simultaneously, light intensity was reduced to 2.2 × 10<sup>−5</sup> µW/cm<sup>2</sup> (~0.00001 lux). The last light intensity was at the limit of entrainment, and only few flies could re-entrain (compare <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0748730411420246">Hirsh et al., 2010</xref>). Therefore, the experiment was repeated at a light intensity of 4.7 × 10<sup>−5</sup> µW/cm<sup>2</sup> (~0.00003 lux). After the end of the experiments, the number of days the flies needed to re-entrain for each shift was determined as well as the percentage of flies that were able to re-entrain. All this was judged on the original actograms by 3 different persons who were “blind” to the genotype. These persons were advised to determine the number of days each fly needed until its M and E activity peaks had reached exactly the same phase they had before the phase shift. Determined values were averaged and plotted.</p>
<p>For all experiments and for each condition, 20 to 50 flies were recorded and analyzed.</p>

<title>Data Analysis</title>
<p>The raw data were displayed as actograms using ActogramJ (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://actogramj.neurofly.de">http://actogramj.neurofly.de</ext-link>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0748730411420246">Schmid et al., in press</xref>). Flies were judged to be entrained when they exhibited 24-hour periods, and M and E activity peaks showed stable phase angles to lights-on and lights-off (or to dawn and dusk), respectively. If this was the case, mean activity profiles of individual flies and of groups of flies were calculated for each chosen light intensity and light program as done previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0748730411420246">Helfrich-Förster, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0748730411420246">Rieger et al., 2003</xref>). The average days shown in the diagrams are smoothed by a moving average filter (over 11 values). To reveal the phase angle of the M and E peaks to lights-on or lights-off, the maxima of both peaks were determined and the phase angle between M and E peaks calculated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0748730411420246">Helfrich-Förster, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0748730411420246">Helfrich-Förster et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0748730411420246">Rieger et al., 2003</xref>). The maxima of the peaks were determined manually by clicking on them after the data had smoothed over 101 values by a nonrecursive linear digital low-pass filter in the second canonical form (detailed description in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0748730411420246">Helfrich-Förster, 2000</xref>).

<title>Activity Pattern and Activity Level of the 3 Wild-Type Strains under Increasing Irradiances in 12:12 Light-Dark Cycles</title>
<p>Under conventional rectangular LD cycles, <italic>CantonS</italic> flies reduce overall activity with increasing irradiance and shift parts of activity into the dark phase. Under simulated twilight, they shift most activity into dawn and dusk, and this behavior is more pronounced the higher the irradiance during the light phase. To test whether the Northern and Southern wild strains show the same behavior as the laboratory strain, we recorded their activity pattern under rectangular 12:12 LD cycles and cycles with simulated twilight (12:12 LDR cycles) at irradiances of 10, 100, and 1000 lux during the light phase.</p>
<p>We found that all 3 strains reduced the overall activity level with increasing irradiance during the light phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0748730411420246">Fig. 1</xref>).

We found that all flies of the 3 wild-type strains entrained to the long photoperiods and increased the phase angle between M and E peaks (Y<sub>M,E</sub>) with increasing day length (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0748730411420246">Fig. 2</xref>), but we observed clear differences between rectangular LD cycles and simulated twilight as well as differences between the strains that will be described in the following.</p>

<p>Under rectangular 12:12 LD cycles, M and E activity peaks were close to lights-on and lights-off, respectively, in the 3 strains, whereby the Northern <italic>HU</italic> strain showed a significant earlier M peak than the other 2 strains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0748730411420246">Fig. 3A</xref>). Under the longer photoperiods, the M peaks of <italic>HU</italic> and <italic>CantonS</italic> occurred consistently earlier than those of <italic>ALA</italic>, but the M peaks followed lights-on quite well in all 3 strains. Just the amplitudes of the M peaks decreased with increasing photoperiod (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0748730411420246">Fig. 2</xref>), and in approximately 10% of the flies, the M peak was not visible at longer photoperiods (χ<sup>2</sup> analysis revealed no significant differences in the frequency of M peak presence between all 3 strains: χ<sup>2</sup> = 0.442; <italic>p</italic> = 0.802). For the E peak, the situation was different: It remained present in each single fly, but it did not track lights-off at longer photoperiods (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0748730411420246">Figs. 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0748730411420246">3</xref>). With increasing day length, the E peak occurred clearly before lights-off, and this tendency was the same in all strains. Nevertheless, differences were evident in the ability to delay the E peak towards lights-off in the 3 strains. The laboratory strain <italic>CantonS</italic> delayed its E peak most, followed by the Northern <italic>HU</italic> strain and the Southern <italic>ALA</italic> strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0748730411420246">Fig. 3A</xref>). We calculated a maximal Y<sub>M,E</sub> of 15.6 ± 0.2 h for the laboratory strain <italic>CantonS</italic>, 14.9 ± 0.2 h for the Northern strain <italic>HU</italic>, and 14.4 ± 0.1 h for the Southern strain <italic>ALA</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0748730411420246">Fig. 3C</xref>). A 2-way ANOVA revealed that Y<sub>M,E</sub> was significantly dependent on day length and the strain (day length: <italic>F</italic><sub>4,423</sub> = 431.194; <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001; strain: <italic>F</italic><sub>2,423</sub> = 24.823; <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001). Furthermore, day length and strain showed a significant interaction, meaning that the photoperiod influenced Y<sub>M,E</sub> in the 3 strains differently (<italic>CantonS</italic> flies increased Y<sub>M,E</sub> more than the other strains; <italic>F</italic><sub>8,423</sub> = 5.627; <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001).</p>

</fig>
<p>Under LDR cycles with simulated twilight, all 3 strains did extend Y<sub>M,E</sub> to larger values (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0748730411420246">Figs. 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0748730411420246">3B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0748730411420246">3C</xref>). If visible, the M peaks perfectly tracked dawn under all photoperiods in the laboratory strain <italic>CantonS</italic> and the Northern strain <italic>HU</italic> and almost perfectly, although with a later phase, in the Southern strain <italic>ALA</italic> (as found under LD, ~10% of the flies lost the M peak under long photoperiods) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0748730411420246">Fig. 3B</xref>). The E peak tracked dusk until a day length of 16 hours in all 3 strains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0748730411420246">Fig. 3B</xref>). At longer day lengths, the E peaks of the Northern and Southern wild strains could not further track dusk but occurred clearly before dusk. Nevertheless, a second activity peak occurred at late dusk (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0748730411420246">Fig. 2</xref>), which we interpreted as a direct response to the rapid decrease in light intensity (see Discussion and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0748730411420246">Kempinger et al., 2009</xref>). At LDR 18:6, the dusk peak had almost the same amplitude as the E peak before dusk in <italic>ALA</italic> but was considerably smaller in <italic>HU</italic>. At LDR 20:4, the dusk peak was almost invisible in <italic>ALA</italic> but still evident in <italic>HU</italic>.</p>
<p>In the laboratory strain <italic>CantonS</italic>, the E peaks remained on average close to dusk until a day length of 18 hours (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0748730411420246">Fig. 3B</xref>). At the level of individual flies, we found that the E peak of 68% of the <italic>CantonS</italic> flies still tracked dusk at LDR 18:6. The remaining 32% of the flies showed an E peak before dusk that is visible as a shoulder in the average activity profile calculated from all flies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0748730411420246">Fig. 2</xref>). In addition to this earlier E peak, these flies showed a second increase in activity at late dusk, as did the Northern and Southern wild strains. At 20:4, none of the <italic>CantonS</italic> flies was able to track dusk, but the dusk peak remained clearly visible in the average day (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0748730411420246">Fig. 2</xref>).</p>
<p>Y<sub>M,E</sub> was always calculated between the M peak and the first E peak (if the flies showed 2 peaks). As already revealed for rectangular LD cycles, we found that the laboratory strain <italic>CantonS</italic> showed the most flexible Y<sub>M,E</sub> under simulated twilight (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0748730411420246">Fig. 3C</xref>). The maximal possible Y<sub>M,E</sub> for <italic>CantonS</italic> was 16.5 ± 0.2 h, followed by a maximal Y<sub>M,E</sub> of 15.3 ± 0.1 h for the Northern <italic>HU</italic> strain and 14.7 ± 0.1 h for the Southern strain <italic>ALA</italic>. A 2-way ANOVA revealed that Y<sub>M,E</sub> was significantly dependent on day length and the strain (day length: <italic>F</italic><sub>4,404</sub> = 2248.242; <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001; strain: <italic>F</italic><sub>2,404</sub> = 215.081; <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001) and that <italic>CantonS</italic> flies increased Y<sub>M,E</sub> more than the other strains (interaction between strain and photoperiod; <italic>F</italic><sub>8,404</sub> = 32.903; <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001).</p>
<p>To test the effects of simulated twilight on Y<sub>M,E</sub>, we performed a 2-way ANOVA for each strain, comparing the values under LD and LDR at long days (14 hours to 20 hours). We found that simulated twilight led to a larger Y<sub>M,E</sub> in each strain and at each photoperiod (<italic>F</italic> values in the legend of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0748730411420246">Fig. 3</xref>).</p>
<p>For the peak phase of the E activity, ANOVA revealed no significant difference in the adaptation to long photoperiods between the Northern and Southern wild strains (<italic>F</italic><sub>1,320</sub> = 0.102; <italic>p</italic> = 0.752) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0748730411420246">Fig. 3B</xref>). This was surprising because one would expect the Northern strain to adapt “better” to longer photoperiods and not only shift the M peaks to earlier phases but also the E peaks to later phases. To shed light on this apparent discrepancy, we decided to consider the waveform of the rhythms in addition to the E peak phases. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0748730411420246">Figure 4</xref> compiles the average activity profiles for each strain at the different photoperiods in one graph. This graph reveals clear differences between the 3 strains in adapting to long photoperiods. Whereas the E activity started later with increasing day length in <italic>CantonS</italic> and the Northern strain <italic>HU</italic>, the E activity started always at the same phase in the Southern <italic>ALA</italic> strain and became just broader with increasing day length, meaning that the flies did not increase their midday trough. As a consequence, the overall daily activity of <italic>ALA</italic> was higher under long photoperiods than under 12:12 LDR cycles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0748730411420246">Fig. 4</xref>). In <italic>CantonS</italic> and <italic>HU</italic> flies, the mean activity level remained similar at all photoperiods. This finding suggests that the Southern strain may not adapt as well to long photoperiods as the other 2 strains do.</p>

<title>The Influence of Temperature</title>
<p>High ambient temperatures are characteristic for summers in the South. To investigate whether high temperatures provoke a longer midday trough and a delayed E peak in <italic>ALA</italic>, we recorded the activity of the strains under 18:6 LDR cycles at 30 °C. Indeed, <italic>ALA</italic> flies exhibited now a longer siesta (not shown) and in addition delayed the E peak (and advanced the M peak) significantly as compared to 20 °C (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0748730411420246">Fig. 3B</xref>). This finding suggests that temperature is the predominant factor that determines the phase of the M and especially E peaks in the Southern strain.</p>
<p>The high temperature did also influence the phases of M and E peaks in the other 2 strains, but clearly in a different way. At 30 °C, the M peaks were strongly advanced in <italic>HU</italic> and <italic>CantonS</italic> flies, but the E peaks were not delayed. In <italic>CantonS</italic> flies, the E peaks were even significantly advanced at 30 °C as compared to 20 °C (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0748730411420246">Fig. 3B</xref>). In spite of the different effects of temperature on M and E peaks in <italic>ALA</italic> and the 2 other strains, all 3 strains had a similar large Y<sub>M,E</sub> at 30 °C that was not significantly different from Y<sub>M,E</sub> of <italic>CantonS</italic> flies at 20 °C (<italic>F</italic><sub>3,114</sub> = 0.625; <italic>p</italic> = 0.600) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0748730411420246">Fig. 3D</xref>). For <italic>ALA</italic> and <italic>HU</italic> flies, Y<sub>M,E</sub> at 30 °C was significantly larger than Y<sub>M,E</sub> at 20 °C (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001).</p>

<title>Free-Running Period</title>
<p>To clarify whether the observed differences in adapting to long days are caused by a different speed of the endogenous clock, we determined the free-running periods of the 3 wild-type strains at 20 °C. We found no significant differences in period: <italic>CantonS</italic> flies showed a mean period of 24.2 ± 0.07 (<italic>n</italic> = 32), <italic>HU</italic> flies showed a mean period of 24.3 ± 0.05 (<italic>n</italic> = 56), and <italic>ALA</italic> flies showed a mean period of 24.3 ± 0.10 (<italic>n</italic> = 39).</p>

<title>Light sensitivity of the clock</title>
<p>Under simulated twilight at 20 °C, the laboratory strain <italic>CantonS</italic> and the Northern strain <italic>HU</italic> showed their M peaks (and to some extent also their E peaks) at lower irradiances than the Southern strain <italic>ALA</italic>. This suggests that the circadian clocks of <italic>CantonS</italic> and <italic>HU</italic> are more sensitive to light than the clock of <italic>ALA</italic>. To test this hypothesis, we determined the re-entrainability of the flies to very dim light, starting at an irradiance of 6.0 × 10<sup>−3</sup> µW/cm<sup>2</sup>. At this irradiance, all flies were entrained and exhibited their typical bimodal activity pattern (not shown). When light intensity was gradually reduced and the LD cycle simultaneously phase advanced by 6 hours, obvious differences in the ability to re-entrain became evident. Whereas almost all flies of the strains <italic>CantonS</italic> and <italic>HU</italic> could re-entrain at a light intensity of 3.6 × 10<sup>−4</sup> µW/cm<sup>2</sup>, only 70% of the <italic>ALA</italic> flies were able to re-entrain under the same conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0748730411420246">Fig. 5A</xref>). The remaining <italic>ALA</italic> flies showed free run. The lower light sensitivity of <italic>ALA</italic> flies became also evident in the number of days the flies that could re-entrain needed to do so. <italic>ALA</italic> flies needed significantly longer to re-entrain than <italic>CantonS</italic> and <italic>HU</italic> flies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0748730411420246">Fig. 5B</xref>).

<title>tim polymorphism</title>
<p>Some <italic>tim</italic> polymorphisms contribute significantly to the light sensitivity of the circadian clock, for example, <italic>s-tim</italic> being more light sensitive than <italic>ls-tim</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0748730411420246">Sandrelli et al., 2007</xref>). Furthermore, the frequency of <italic>ls-tim</italic> shows a latitudinal cline with a higher frequency in Southern Europe (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0748730411420246">Tauber et al., 2007</xref>). As a consequence, the Northern <italic>HU</italic> strain had a high probability to carry the <italic>s-tim</italic> allelic form, what would be consistent with its high light sensitivity in the present experiments. On the other hand, the Southern <italic>ALA</italic> strain that consisted of a mixture of different isofemale lines should carry both <italic>tim</italic> forms with a higher incidence for <italic>ls-tim</italic>, and again, this would fit to the lower light sensitivity of this strain found in the present experiments. The laboratory strain <italic>CantonS</italic> was genotyped as <italic>ls-tim</italic> in former studies (Peschel et al., 2006), and this classification seems not to fit to the observed high light sensitivity of <italic>CantonS</italic> flies.</p>
<p>We determined the <italic>tim</italic> polymorphism in 3 to 10 flies of each strain to test the putative correlation of the <italic>s-tim</italic> form with a high light sensitivity. We found that the flies of the Northern <italic>HU</italic> strain carried indeed all the <italic>s-tim</italic> allele and those of the laboratory strain <italic>CantonS</italic> carried the <italic>ls-tim</italic> allele, whereas the Southern <italic>ALA</italic> strain contained as expected a mixture of both <italic>tim</italic> forms, but predominantly <italic>ls-tim</italic> (of 10 tested flies, 6 flies were <italic>ls-tim</italic>, and 4 flies were heterozygous).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The main aims of the present study were to find out 1) whether wild <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> strains show a similar preference for dim light as does the laboratory strain <italic>CantonS</italic>, 2) whether Northern and Southern wild strains differ in the ability to adapt their locomotor activity rhythms to long photoperiods, and 3) whether simulated twilight can improve this ability. All 3 questions can be clearly answered with yes.</p>
<p>We found that all 3 <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> strains had crepuscular activity patterns with activity maxima during early dawn and late dusk. Furthermore, all 3 strains reduced their activity levels at higher irradiances (compare <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0748730411420246">Rieger et al., 2007</xref>). We conclude that the well-described crepuscular behavior of <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> is not a unique feature of strains that were kept in the laboratory for decades but seems to be more generally true for this particular species. Similarly, the avoidance of being active at higher light intensities seems to be well fixed in the genes and not to change after many generations in the laboratory. These observations fit well with a recent study showing that <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> flies kept in complete darkness for 1340 generations (since 1954) still maintained their locomotor activity rhythms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0748730411420246">Imafuku and Haramura, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>In spite of the obvious stability of certain life history traits, we could reveal differences in the light sensitivity of the 3 strains. The clocks of the laboratory strain <italic>CantonS</italic> and the Northern strain <italic>HU</italic> were significantly more light sensitive than the clock of the Southern strain <italic>ALA</italic>, and as a consequence, the former 2 strains showed their activity peaks during simulated twilight at slightly lower irradiances. The high light sensitivity of the clock is at least partly caused by the short TIM isoform encoded by the s-<italic>timeless</italic> allele that still prevails in Northern Europe and was present in the <italic>HU</italic> line used here (the <italic>ls-tim</italic> allele originated in the South and is just about to expand to the North) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0748730411420246">Sandrelli et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0748730411420246">Tauber et al., 2007</xref>). Nevertheless, these studies also showed that additional genetic factors determine the light sensitivity of <italic>Drosophila</italic>’s clock. When different natural fly strains were compared, <italic>HU</italic> flies carrying the <italic>ls-tim</italic> alleles turned out to be still more light sensitive than <italic>s-tim</italic> flies from a strain derived from Bitetto in Southern Italy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0748730411420246">Sandrelli et al., 2007</xref>). Here, we found that <italic>CantonS</italic> flies are as light sensitive as <italic>HU</italic> flies, although the <italic>CantonS</italic> flies carried the <italic>ls-tim</italic> allele. Genes that affect the light sensitivity of the clock besides <italic>tim</italic> are, for example, <italic>jetlag</italic> and <italic>cryptochrome</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0748730411420246">Koh et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0748730411420246">Peschel et al., 2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0748730411420246">2009</xref>) as well as putatively all other genes coding for proteins that are involved in the stability and degradation of the Tim protein.</p>
<p>In addition to the different light sensitivity, we could reveal significant strain differences in the ability of the flies to adapt to longer photoperiods. It was shown previously that the <italic>s- ls-tim</italic> polymorphism is also involved in seasonal adaptation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0748730411420246">Tauber et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0748730411420246">Kyriacou et al., 2008</xref>): <italic>ls-tim</italic> flies have a higher incidence of entering diapause putatively, increasing the flies’ fitness in the North. Here, we found that <italic>CantonS</italic> flies had the most flexible Y<sub>M,E</sub>, and as a consequence, M and E peaks followed dawn and dusk best at long days. This coincides well with the fact that <italic>CantonS</italic> flies carry the <italic>ls-tim</italic> allele. However, <italic>ALA</italic> flies that were also predominantly <italic>ls-tim</italic> showed the “poorest adaptation” to long days, whereas <italic>s-tim HU</italic> flies adapted clearly better, at least at 20 °C. Thus, the <italic>tim</italic> polymorphism can only partly explain the observed adaptation to long days.</p>
<p>Besides light, temperature is a major factor that influences the activity pattern of fruit flies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0748730411420246">Tomioka et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0748730411420246">Majercak et al., 1999</xref>). The present study suggests that light and temperature have a different influence on the activity pattern in Southern and Northern strains. M and E activities of the Southern <italic>ALA</italic> flies had clear difficulties to follow dawn and dusk under long days at 20 °C but not at 30 °C: Whereas <italic>ALA</italic> flies started activity always about 3 to 4 hours after noon at 20 °C, they clearly delayed their E peak and consequently avoided activity after noon under long days (LDR 18:6) at 30 °C. Thus, <italic>ALA</italic> flies can perfectly adapt to the environmental constraints. The delay in E activity under long summer days is just not triggered by the photoperiod but by temperature. This makes perfect sense, given the fact that day length does not vary to such an extent throughout spring and summer in the South, but temperatures can be rather high in the summer.</p>
<p>This behavior was clearly different in the Northern <italic>HU</italic> strain (and the laboratory strain <italic>CantonS</italic>) that started E activity later under long photoperiods at 20 °C but surprisingly not at 30 °C. Instead, both strains considerably advanced their M peaks into the night at 30 °C, a behavior that seems to make no sense in nature. This suggests that the clocks of <italic>HU</italic> and <italic>CantonS</italic> flies have difficulties in dealing with constant high temperatures. We may argue that both strains are not used to temperatures of 30 °C, <italic>HU</italic> not accustomed because of its Northern origin and <italic>CantonS</italic> not accustomed because we kept this strain more than 30 years constantly at 20 °C. Perhaps temperature is a more stringent environmental factor that changes life history traits faster than light (compare above). Our results with the natural strains suggest that photoperiod may be the most important cue for timing activity in the temperate North, whereas temperature may be the dominant factor in the South. Nevertheless, our data are just case studies. Many more natural strains need to be tested to infer real adaptations to local environments.</p>
<p>Furthermore, we have to admit that several of our conditions are not natural: Our twilight simulations did lack the systematic spectral changes of light. In addition, it was completely dark during the night, and we kept irradiance during the day constantly at 100 lux and temperature constantly at 20 °C (or 30 °C), although in nature, irradiance may rise to much higher levels (~100,000 lux at maximum) and temperature oscillates with average amplitudes of approximately 10 °C, depending on latitude, altitude, and the actual weather conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0748730411420246">Bhutani, 2009</xref>). We limited irradiance to 100 lux because a previous study had shown that flies avoided exposing themselves to high irradiances (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0748730411420246">Rieger et al., 2007</xref>). Thus, it seems more natural to not expose them to strong light without offering a possibility to hide. Nevertheless, our conditions with completely dark nights, no change in irradiance during the day, and no additional temperature cycle may create another artifact: the flies’ activity gets stimulated by the rather rapid increase/decrease of irradiance during twilight (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0748730411420246">Kempinger et al., 2009</xref>). Therefore, the endogenous M and E peaks may partly be masked. In nature, nights are not completely dark, and temperature is at its minimum during dawn and then continuously increases until it reaches its maximum approximately 2 hours after midday. Similarly to light-dark cycles, temperature cycles are potent zeitgebers for <italic>CantonS</italic> flies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0748730411420246">Tomioka et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0748730411420246">Glaser and Stanewsky, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0748730411420246">Yoshii et al., 2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0748730411420246">2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0748730411420246">Busza et al., 2007</xref>). When light and temperature cycles are combined during a 12-hour:12-hour day, they contribute synergistically to entrainment of the activity rhythms without obvious masking effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0748730411420246">Yoshii et al., 2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0748730411420246">2010</xref>). Future experiments will reveal whether the natural-like combination of light and temperature cycles in simulated long days will influence behavior differently in the different wild-type strains and whether this will lead to less advanced M peaks and more delayed E peaks on hot days in <italic>CantonS</italic> and <italic>HU</italic> flies.</p>
<p>In spite of the discussed limitations, our study underlines the idea that differences in clock properties have evolved in adaptation to the local environmental fluctuations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0748730411420246">Kyriacou et al., 2008</xref>). It remains exciting to uncover the underlying genes and the neuronal basis of these differences.</p>
