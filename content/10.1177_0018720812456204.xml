<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Ergonomics improvements of workplace conditions play an important role in occupational health practices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0018720812456204">Kawakami &amp; Kogi, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0018720812456204">Kogi, 2010a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0018720812456204">Tan &amp; Kawakami, 2009</xref>). The promotion of practical ergonomics improvements is making progress in diversifying work situations, including small-scale workplaces. It is necessary to develop means of support for facilitating this progress, particularly in basic occupational health services addressing these workplaces in industrially developing regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0018720812456204">Dul et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0018720812456204">Khai, Kawakami, &amp; Kogi, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0018720812456204">Kogi, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0018720812456204">Zalk, 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>Awareness is growing of the roles of participatory action–oriented training in facilitating workplace improvements that can reduce work-related risks in varied work situations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0018720812456204">International Labour Office [ILO], 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0018720812456204">Kogi, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0018720812456204">Zalk &amp; Nelson, 2008</xref>). Intervention studies on the effects of participatory approaches indicate the usefulness of these approaches in supporting the initiative of local people to make improvements and the application of realistic solutions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0018720812456204">Noro &amp; Imada, 1991</xref>). These effects are notable in both developed and developing countries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0018720812456204">Kogi, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0018720812456204">Scott, Kogi, &amp; McPhee, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>Ergonomics improvements can generally improve both productivity at work and work and life conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0018720812456204">Kogi, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0018720812456204">ILO, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0018720812456204">Itani et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0018720812456204">Niu &amp; Kogi, 2012</xref>). These improvements have direct effects on manager–worker relations, mutual support among coworkers, and workplace culture for better quality work life. These merits are useful as there are usually significant constraints, particularly in small-scale workplaces, concerning planning and implementing workplace improvements. Managers and workers in these workplaces are faced with economic limitations and a lack of technical knowledge for making valid improvements. In fact, there are opportunities in these workplaces for making practical improvements by focusing on the merits of ergonomics solutions. It is important to examine practical ways to facilitate ergonomics improvements in local conditions.</p>
<p>In examining the ways to facilitate workplace improvements in occupational health practice, attention is drawn to participatory approaches to achieving better practices through the cooperation of workplace people. An emphasis should be placed on recent experiences in overcoming the existing constraints of small enterprises and agriculture in industrially developing countries. It is therefore important to examine generally applicable practical ways to facilitate ergonomics improvements in view of these constraints.</p>

<title>Materials</title>
<p>Practical steps taken in recent participatory action–oriented programs for ergonomics improvements in small enterprises and agriculture are reviewed. This review covers (a) participatory training programs in small workplaces in industry as well as services for reducing work-related health and safety risks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0018720812456204">Itani et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0018720812456204">Kawakami, Kogi, Toyama, &amp; Yoshikawa, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0018720812456204">Khai et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0018720812456204">Kogi, 2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0018720812456204">2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0018720812456204">Tsutsumi, Nagami, Yoshikawa, Kogi, &amp; Kawakami, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0018720812456204">Yoshikawa et al., 2006</xref>); (b) WISE (work improvement in small enterprises) courses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0018720812456204">ILO, 2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0018720812456204">2010</xref>); (c) WIND (work improvement in neighborhood development) workshops for farmers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0018720812456204">Kawakami, Khai, &amp; Kogi, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0018720812456204">Niu &amp; Kogi, 2012</xref>); and (d) participatory programs organized as part of basic occupational health services (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0018720812456204">Kogi, 2010b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0018720812456204">Rantanen, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>All these programs are organized as short-term action training programs. Support for the programs is provided by occupational health and safety teams and relevant local agencies and organizations. As a rule, a locally adjusted training package comprises action checklists, photographs or video clips showing local good examples, presentation slides incorporating the basic principles of ergonomics and occupational hygiene, and guidance materials about practical improvements. Usually, workshops for trainers are organized around action-oriented training steps and the use of the training package.</p>
<p>The focus of this review is on the ways the trainers facilitate the application of workplace-level procedures for planning and implementing practical improvements in the local context. The types of improvements that have a real impact on reducing work-related risks and the ways in which training toolkits are used are discussed. How the group work process of training participants is promoted by the trainers with the support of occupational health services and local organizations is taken into account.</p>

<p>Recent trends in the reviewed programs are summarized in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0018720812456204">Table 1</xref>. These programs are applied in an increasing number of countries, as outlined by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0018720812456204">Khai et al. (2011)</xref>. WISE and WIND programs are applied in a number of countries in Asia, Latin America, and Africa. WISE methods are applied to various manufacturing industries, health care services, construction sites, and informal work sites such as home-based workplaces. A new trend is to apply the participatory approach to the workplace programs for preventing work stress in various work situations.</p>

<p>The approaches taken by these programs are similar in their emphasis on learning local good practices when developing goals for improving existing conditions. Each participatory program is organized after collecting local good examples in multiple technical areas related to both productivity and working conditions.</p>
<p>Therefore, the technical areas covered by these programs and the criteria used for selecting local good practices as goals for workplace improvements are strikingly similar. The criteria used for collecting local good practices as references for setting goals for workplace improvements are likewise similar among the programs reviewed. It is of particular interest that the following criteria are generally used:</p>
<list id="list1-0018720812456204" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>contributing to reducing identified risks,</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>contributing to increasing productivity,</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>promoting better general working conditions,</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>complying with regulatory standards,</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>meeting ethical principles,</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>having sustainable effects, and</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>improving workplace culture.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>Accordingly, a broad range of technical areas are covered by the participatory programs. This is based on awareness of the advantages of the multifaceted improvements, which have been proven by recent occupational health good practices. The following technical areas are usually covered by these programs:</p>
<list id="list2-0018720812456204" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>materials storage and handling,</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>workstation design and machine safety,</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>physical environment,</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>welfare facilities, and</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>work organization and schedules.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>In addition, the following areas are covered, depending on local needs:</p>
<list id="list3-0018720812456204" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>work–life balance and family cooperation,</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>social support and community cooperation, and</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>environmental protection.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>Further, access to health and social services and the promotion of employer–worker cooperation may also be covered, particularly in the case of stress prevention programs.</p>
<p>The good examples identified in the local workplace conditions serve as guidance and reference in setting goals for planning improvements. It is helpful to cover multiple technical areas in each training program because ergonomics-related workplace risks are various and can be better addressed by a broad scope of improvement actions. The broad coverage of the technical areas is useful for identifying corresponding improvement actions and conducting informed group work for selecting priority actions.</p>
<p>It is of particular interest that the participants of the programs reviewed are always guided to discuss the good points of existing workplace conditions and then to discuss necessary improvement actions. This process is helped by learning a variety of good practices in the multiple areas.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0018720812456204">Figure 1</xref> presents the typical training steps adopted by the reviewed programs. The initially collected good examples are utilized for designing the training materials for training the participants about the types of improvements aimed at. In the short-term training workshops or courses, the participants first learn these locally attainable, good practices. They then learn how to propose feasible improvements similar to the local good examples. Through group discussion, the participants select priority improvements that are immediately applicable. Follow-up activities are essential for reporting the improvements done, assessing the validity and benefits of these improvements, and encouraging sustained action.</p>

<graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0018720812456204-fig1.tif"/>
</fig>
<p>The practical nature of the training steps are summarized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0018720812456204">Figure 2</xref>. The initiative for planning workplace improvements is encouraged by jointly learning from existing local good practices. The training participants realize the potential for making immediate improvements using the learned good practices as workable goals. They then proceed to propose locally feasible improvement options by looking at the multifaceted options available in each local situation. They can select such options from among practical types of improvements presented to them. Finally, the participants can agree through group work on the priority improvements that can be readily applied step-by-step.</p>

<graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0018720812456204-fig2.tif"/>
</fig>
<p>These steps are helped by providing the support measures indicated in the lower part of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0018720812456204">Figure 2</xref>. Presentation of locally achieved good examples in multiple technical areas is helpful for setting immediate goals for improving existing conditions. A good summary of local good examples is important. When the feasible improvement options presented in prepared action toolkits are discussed in small groups, the participants are further encouraged to identify simple options that can have real impacts in their own workplaces. Consensus building about the priority improvements for immediate implementation is supported by trainers who provide guidance about practicable good practices in similar workplaces and their benefits. Thus, informed group work about practical, stepwise progress is made possible.</p>
<p>The action-oriented nature of the informed group work steps in the reviewed programs may explain why these participatory steps can lead to many improvements in different work settings.</p>

<title>Practical Low-Cost Improvements Applying Basic Ergonomics and Occupational Hygiene Principles</title>
<p>The types of improvements achieved by the participatory approaches have common features in terms of their practical nature and local feasibility.</p>
<p>The approaches reviewed emphasize low-cost improvements that are feasible in local conditions. This recommendation is relatively easy to follow for two obvious reasons. First, there are many low-cost improvements already achieved through workplace-level efforts in each work situation. The reports of the improvements proposed and done by the training participants demonstrate that there are many different kinds of low-cost improvements in the technical areas covered by the reviewed programs. Second, the validity of the low-cost improvements planned and implemented is secured by referring to basic principles of ergonomics and occupational hygiene. Thus, these improvements are mostly conducive to improving productivity and reducing work-related risks by means of applying the principles at low cost. Case studies of the improvements done by WISE, WIND, and other approaches have shown that the costs of making these improvements are low.</p>
<p>The technical areas of such low-cost improvements covered by the participatory programs are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0018720812456204">Table 2</xref>.</p>

<p>It is confirmed that for workplace problems there is a large variety of low-cost solutions commonly applicable in any of the areas covered. The low cost of these improvements can certainly encourage managers and workers to plan selected improvements. This also makes it easy to verify the obtained benefits.</p>
<p>The basic principles of ergonomics and occupational hygiene incorporated in the typical improvements advocated by the participatory programs are outlined in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0018720812456204">Table 3</xref>.

<p>This emphasis placed on locally feasible basic principles of ergonomics and occupational hygiene has a significant impact on spreading the participatory programs. As a rule, the low-cost types of workplace improvements are reported through the trainers of the programs and thus utilized in further developing the training contents. The feedback effects are notable in all the programs reviewed. Typical improvement examples are exchanged through intercountry networking arrangements and compiled into good practice databases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0018720812456204">Khai et al., 2011</xref>). The compiled good examples have been utilized for developing training tools such as action checklists and illustrated guides. Examples of illustrations created based on real examples and used as feasible guides for subsequent programs are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0018720812456204">Figure 3</xref> for training home workers in developing countries. Similar illustrations are widely used in participatory training and for spreading low-cost improvements in different work settings in many countries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0018720812456204">ILO, 2010</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0018720812456204">2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0018720812456204">Niu &amp; Kogi, 2012</xref>).</p>

<title>Procedures by Localized Action Toolkits</title>
<p>The group work steps in the reviewed programs make full use of action-oriented toolkits that are adjusted to each local situation. The design of these toolkits is relatively easy because they are based on local good practices and reflect basic principles of ergonomics and occupational hygiene.</p>
<p>Three kinds of action tools are commonly used by the participatory programs. It is important that each toolkit consist of these three kinds of training tools and that the tools be mutually interrelated in their structure and contents. A typical toolkit contains the following three training tools:</p>
<list id="list4-0018720812456204" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>an action checklist—a list of low-cost improvement actions covering multiple technical areas and feasible in the local situation;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>photographs and brief case reports of feasible improvements—examples of low-cost improvements achieved locally; and</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>illustrated how-to guides—presentation slides and illustrated guidance materials about practical types of improvements that apply basic principles of ergonomics and occupational hygiene.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>A set of these tools can guide the training participants and the trainers about the ways of setting immediate goals and planning and implementing locally feasible improvements. The action checklist includes typical low-cost improvements reflecting local good practices in the action form and helps the participants look at existing good examples and select locally available actions. Photographs and brief case reports present local good examples with information about how to achieve such improvements. The illustrated slides and how-to guides provide concrete guidance about easy-to-implement, risk-reducing options for improving the existing conditions.</p>
<p>It is evident that the combined use of these tools as a toolkit can facilitate the planning and implementation of improvements that can have real impact. Because attention is drawn to the multifaceted benefits of making feasible improvements, the toolkit can make it easy to initiate group work for selecting available options. An important asset of such a toolkit is to facilitate stepwise progress in improving existing workplace conditions.</p>
<p>It should be noted that these practical tools provide useful guidance about developing an overview of work-related risks with the options available for reducing the identified risks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0018720812456204">Kogi, 2007</xref>). This can simplify the identification of risks and the planning of necessary improvements through group discussion. This represents the action-oriented feature of the toolkits.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0018720812456204">Figure 4</xref> shows typical check items on an action checklist for use in small enterprises. The check item about the working height mentions the action “adjust work height at elbow level or slightly lower” and shows an example of providing a foot platform for a smaller worker. The item about lighting mentions the action “add skylights and keep skylights and windows clean.”</p>

</fig>
<p>The contents of these training toolkits are adjusted in order to indicate the improvement options that are feasible and adapted to the local situation. Examples in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0018720812456204">Figure 5</xref> show the illustrations used in the action checklist and illustrated how-to guides used in training. In training local people in different situations, special care is usually taken to provide guidance about locally available improvement options in this way.</p>

</fig>
<p>These action-oriented tools have proven useful for promoting participatory workplace improvements in various settings. The roles of these tools in accordance with the training steps of the participatory programs are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0018720812456204">Figure 6</xref>. These tools can help employers and workers in small-scale workplaces select and implement practical improvements suitable to each local situation. It should be noted that the three fundamental tools are useful not only in one step but also in the subsequent steps of training. Photographs of good examples are used in Steps 1 and 2. An action checklist of typical low-cost improvements is used in Steps 2, 3, and 4. The how-to improvement guides and presentation slides describing how to make improvements can be useful in Steps 2, 3, and 4 as well. In this way, it is very important to develop a set of action-oriented tools consisting of local good examples, an action checklist, and an illustrated how-to manual. This toolkit can facilitate the participatory steps leading to many practical improvements.</p>

<p>These three tools can be developed for specific locations with the support of occupational health and safety teams or training institutions. The three kinds of tools also can be used in providing support services for improving occupational health practices. Recent experiences show that the three kinds of tools can be applied in providing basic occupational health services for small enterprises, particularly in industrially developing countries. Because these support services include quick surveys of the work environment and of safety and health problems, simple survey forms can be added to the three kinds of tools in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0018720812456204">Figure 6</xref>.</p>
<p>The benefits of taking participatory steps with the direct support of occupational health and safety teams, including basic occupational health services, are clear. As visible goals for making immediate improvements are presented in the form of local good examples, employers and workers in small enterprises are motivated to examine their own workplace conditions. By using simple survey sheets and an action checklist, they can plan and implement feasible low-cost measures. The occupational health services directly contacting small enterprises can thus promote and sustain the active participation of employers and workers.</p>
<p>Special attention is drawn to the trainers’ functions in conducting participatory training programs. In all the reviewed programs, trainers always serve as facilitators of the participatory steps taken. The steps shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0018720812456204">Figure 6</xref> are always led by the trainers, who are knowledgeable about the merits and uses of the training toolkit for the target groups. Often the trainers are involved in the development of the training toolkit, as its contents are based on local good practices. Training of the trainers can be done by involving them in organizing one or more short-term training workshops for local people. Many of these trainers are volunteers selected from the target groups or from collaborating local organizations. Local networks of core and local trainers are effective for facilitating training activities in a structured way. Usually, core trainers are trained by the efforts of the program organizers in the country. The core trainers take part in the development of training toolkits and then train local trainers.</p>
<p>There are a variety of ways for adjusting the training process to each local situation. Examples include conducting short training sessions for identifying simple, immediate improvements that are similar to local good practices; developing and applying industry-specific training modules; conducting one-day workshops for selected groups of workers or in the communities; and repeating stepwise workshops.</p>
<p>Recent intervention studies conducted by partners of the Asian network for work improvement demonstrate the effectiveness of the participatory action–oriented training programs in different settings. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0018720812456204">Yu, Yu, and Li (2011)</xref> compared the changes in the rates of occupational injuries in small enterprises in Shenzhen, China, between workers trained by participatory action–oriented training and workers receiving didactic training; the researchers found that participatory training was significantly more effective than didactic training. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0018720812456204">Kogi, Kawakami, Itani, and Batino (2003)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0018720812456204">Kogi (2008)</xref> reported that participatory training is effective for reducing work-related risks, particularly by focusing on the low-cost risk reduction strategy. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0018720812456204">Tsutsumi et al. (2009)</xref> reported significant intervention effects of participatory workplace improvement programs on mental health and job performance among blue-collar workers. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0018720812456204">Yoshikawa and Kogi (2010)</xref> further reviewed the role of stress prevention good practices for workplace improvements and reported that the use of action support tools such as action checklists led to many workplace improvements for reducing work stress.</p>
<p>The effectiveness of the participatory methods applied should be further assessed in light of several limitations. The first limitation relates to the scope of local good practices identified by program organizers and trainers. More extensive studies may be necessary to track a broader scope of risk-reducing practices addressing multiple work-related risks in each work situation. The second limitation of this review process is the possibility of complex relationships between the improvement options applied and effective ergonomics measures in diverse work situations. The participatory steps relying on basic ergonomics principles need to be continually assessed in this regard. The third limitation relates to the conduct of group work by the training participants that may be affected by their previous training and experiences. Practical means of securing the suitable level of group work need to be continually explored. Finally, this review has employed an empirical approach to examine commonly effective ways to facilitate the process of identifying and planning valid ergonomics improvements. It is necessary to study in more detail the roles and effectiveness of the participatory steps applied. The program features discussed by this review can be a useful basis for further exploring generally effective support measures for ergonomics improvements in small-scale workplaces despite constraints.</p>
<p>The intercountry networking of partner institutions using the reviewed methods has contributed significantly to the development and dissemination of participatory toolkits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0018720812456204">Khai et al., 2011</xref>). The exchanges of newly developed action checklists, PowerPoint slides presenting improvement guidance, and illustrated guides have been particularly useful.</p>
<p>It is suggested that direct support for participatory action training through trainers using locally adjusted toolkits be provided within the scope of occupational health practices. Partici-patory action–oriented training is particularly useful as part of basic occupational health services for small enterprises.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>In facilitating ergonomics improvements, particularly in small-scale workplaces in industrially developing countries, it is important to build on local good practices; to focus on practical, low-cost improvements that apply basic ergonomics principles in multiple technical areas; and to provide training toolkits adjusted to each local situation. The action form of these toolkits, including local examples, action checklists, and illustrated guides, is essential. The locally adjusted nature of these toolkits is particularly useful for facilitating effective training that leads to concrete results. The exchange of positive experiences by intercountry networking through collaboration of ergonomics and occupational health institutions and groups is essential in supporting the stepwise progress by participatory programs.</p>
