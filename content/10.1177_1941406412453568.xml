<p>Dear <italic>ICAN</italic> Readers,</p>
<p>Today we hear more and more about the importance of <italic>not</italic> leaving a footprint. Of course, this concept is intended to be in the context of the environment and the need to take care not to demand more of the earth than it can reasonably produce.</p>
<p>However, when one considers the work we do in pediatric nutrition, it is clear that the <italic>greatest</italic> value of our work is in the footprint we do make. In fact, the goal of our work is somewhat contrary—to leave a noticeable impression on the lives we work diligently to provide guidance to feed, nourish, and nurture.</p>
<p>This issue of <italic>ICAN</italic>, although not a themed issue, has a focus on breastfeeding and breastmilk. As clinicians we are clear about the tremendous value of breastmilk for the vast majority of infants and the importance of the role we have in supporting those mothers who choose to provide breastmilk to their child—whether they have special health care needs or not.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the simplicity of that statement as well as the simplicity of breastfeeding is lost in the complexity of our lives, our medical care, our hospitals, our politics, and our society. It is said that nearly all women can breastfeed successfully. With support most women are willing to initiate breastfeeding, but the drop off rate is stated to be 90% within the first 6 weeks of life. Most unfortunately, these mothers when asked, say they would have liked to continue to breastfeed. These numbers are a reminder that rates could be higher with consistent support from hospital to home.</p>
<p>It is hard to imagine a more ecological, economical, and impactful influence on a small vulnerable life. Beyond the wonderful physiologic and protective qualities of breastmilk, the simplicity of breastmilk as a sole source of nutrition is arguably one of the greatest features of this food. One could easily conclude that, in one act, we can manage to satisfy both goals by supporting our mothers—make a tremendous impact while not leaving a footprint.</p>
<p>Again, I am always tremendously gratified to hear from readers who tell me they read every article in <italic>ICAN</italic>—each issue. Please take the time to appreciate all of <italic>ICAN</italic>’s contributors this issue. As always, I am gratified by the opportunity to provide a venue for the broad and far-reaching work that is being done in the field of infant, pediatric, and adolescent nutrition in the United States and beyond.</p>
<p>I encourage you to contact me directly to discuss your thoughts and ideas for your next submission to <italic>ICAN</italic>.</p>
<p>Best to you all,</p>
