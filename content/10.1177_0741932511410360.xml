<abstract>
<p>The purpose of this study was to compare the effect of a repeated reading and question generation intervention entitled Re-read-Adapt and Answer-Comprehend (RAAC) with a modified RAAC intervention without the repeated reading component. The sample included 30 students in Grades 3 through 5. The students received services in reading within a three-tiered response to intervention framework or in special education. Students were randomly assigned to the nonrepetitive condition or the control repeated reading condition and participated in 50 intervention sessions over a 4-month period. Regardless of condition, all students made gains in oral reading fluency on independent passages. The modified RAAC program without passage repetition appeared to be as effective if not more so at increasing reading fluency when compared to the RAAC program with passage repetition.</p>

<p>Reading is a challenge for many children, with 20% of students having significant difficulties with reading acquisition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0741932511410360">Lyon &amp; Moats, 1997</xref>). Reading difficulties often continue past third grade when students are expected to make the transition from learning to read to reading to learn. According to the National Assessment of Educational Progress, 36% of fourth-graders have yet to obtain a basic skill level in reading and only 31% read proficiently (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0741932511410360">United States Department of Education, 2005</xref>). Reading is also a typical need area for students with mild cognitive disabilities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0741932511410360">Vaughn, Bos, &amp; Schumm, 2007</xref>). Approximately 80% of students with learning disabilities (LD) have identified needs in reading (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0741932511410360">Shapiro, Church, &amp; Lewis, 2002</xref>). Reading is also the most common instructional area addressed for at-risk students served within Response to Intervention (RTI) frameworks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0741932511410360">Council of Administrators of Special Education, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Reading fluency, defined as the ability to read with speed, accuracy, and proper expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0741932511410360">Kuhn &amp; Stahl, 2003</xref>), has been identified by the National Reading Panel as an essential reading skill area (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0741932511410360">National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD), 2000</xref>). It is also a common skill deficit for students with and without disabilities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0741932511410360">Therrien, Gormley, &amp; Kubina, 2006a</xref>). The ability to read a passage fluently is often a stronger predictor of comprehension than direct measures of reading comprehension such as asking comprehension questions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0741932511410360">Fuchs, Fuchs, Hosp, &amp; Jenkins, 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>Repeated reading, “a supplemental reading program that consists of re-reading a short and meaningful passage until a satisfactory level of fluency is reached” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0741932511410360">Samuels, 1979</xref>, p. 404) is an extensively researched fluency intervention that has been found to improve reading fluency of both students with and without disabilities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0741932511410360">Bryant et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0741932511410360">Gilbert, Williams, &amp; McLaughlin, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0741932511410360">O’Shea, Sindelar, &amp; O’Shea, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0741932511410360">Rashotte &amp; Torgesen, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0741932511410360">Rasinski, Padak, Linek, &amp; Sturtevant, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0741932511410360">Sindelar, Monda, &amp; O’Shea, 1990</xref>). Furthermore, in a meta-analysis, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0741932511410360">Therrien (2004)</xref> reported that repeated reading interventions that (a) had competent tutors provide correct feedback on word errors (e.g., an adult) and (b) had students read until a performance criterion was reached (e.g., certain number of correct words per minute) were extremely effective (effect size = 1.37).</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0741932511410360">LaBerge and Samuels’s (1974)</xref> theory of automatic word processing presents a reasoned explanation for the effectiveness of repeated reading. They hypothesize that repeated reading provides students with multiple opportunities to master words, sentences, and paragraphs in a passage. This mastery, in turn, generalizes to novel passages particularly when there is a high degree of word overlap between the passages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0741932511410360">Rashotte &amp; Torgesen, 1985</xref>). Despite the dramatic impact of repeated reading on reading fluency, the intervention has at best a moderate impact on students’ reading comprehension (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0741932511410360">Therrien, 2004</xref>) with many individual studies reporting little to no improvement in comprehension (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0741932511410360">Bryant et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0741932511410360">Homan, Klesius, &amp; Hite, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0741932511410360">Levy, Abello, &amp; Lysynchuk, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0741932511410360">Rashotte &amp; Torgesen, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0741932511410360">Simmons, Fuchs, Fuchs, Hodge, &amp; Mathes, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0741932511410360">Stoddard, Valcante, Sindelar, O’Shea, &amp; Algozzine, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0741932511410360">Vaughn et al., 2000</xref>).</p>
<p>To directly address students’ comprehension achievement along with fluency, a recent repeated reading–based intervention titled Re-read-Adapt and Answer-Comprehend (RAAC) combines repeated reading and question generation into a supplemental reading program (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0741932511410360">Therrien et al., 2006a</xref>). Program instructional components are based on recommendations made by meta-analytic reviews of repeated reading (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0741932511410360">Therrien, 2004</xref>) and question generation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0741932511410360">Rosenshine, Meister, &amp; Chapman, 1996</xref>). To improve reading fluency, students reread until a performance criterion is reached and receive formative feedback from a competent tutor on speed, accuracy, and prosody. To improve comprehension-monitoring ability, students read each passage purposefully, in an attempt to adapt and answer question generation prompts. The program is also designed to be implemented for an extended period of time (50 sessions) because extended reading fluency intervention is often needed to affect students’ overall reading achievement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0741932511410360">Bryant et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0741932511410360">Vaughn et al., 2000</xref>).</p>
<p>Previous studies of the RAAC program have investigated its effectiveness on student reading achievement. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0741932511410360">Therrien, Wickstrom, and Jones (2006b)</xref> investigated the impact of the RAAC program on the reading achievement of students (<italic>N</italic> = 30) at risk for or with a reading learning disability in fourth, fifth, and eighth grades. The program was implemented for a total of 50 sessions by preservice special education teachers. Study results indicated that the program significantly improved students’ reading fluency and ability to answer inferential comprehension questions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0741932511410360">Therrien et al., 2006b</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0741932511410360">Therrien and Gormley-Budin (2008)</xref> investigated the impact of the RAAC program on students with reading learning disabilities and behavioral difficulties. Results indicated that to maximize program effectiveness, the addition of a behavioral or motivational component may be necessary. Two studies investigated the impact of a modified RAAC program on the reading achievement of deaf students (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0741932511410360">Schirmer, Schaffer, Therrien, &amp; T. Schirmer, in press</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0741932511410360">Schirmer, Therrien, Schaffer, &amp; Schirmer, 2009</xref>). Results indicated that the program significantly improved students’ overall reading achievement measured via standardized achievement tests.</p>
<p>Despite the effectiveness of repeated reading interventions and the RAAC program, questions remain regarding the appropriateness of using repeated reading to improve students’ reading achievement. Critics of repeated reading hypothesize that improvement in reading fluency achieved during repeated reading has nothing to do to with rereading but is instead due to additional reading practice with feedback (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0741932511410360">Kuhn &amp; Stahl, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0741932511410360">Pressley, 2006</xref>). Most repeated reading studies cannot directly refute this hypothesis because their findings are based on differences in pre- to posttest scores or between treatment and no-treatment control groups.</p>
<p>Studies have directly compared repeated reading to a nonrepetitive reading condition and found no significant differences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0741932511410360">Homan et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0741932511410360">O’Connor, White, &amp; Swanson, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0741932511410360">Van Bon, Boksebeld, Font Freide, &amp; Van den Hurk, 1991</xref>). Results from these studies are not definitive, however, because the repeated reading interventions investigated did not include all of the essential repeated reading instructional components delineated by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0741932511410360">Therrien (2004)</xref>. The interventions used by Homan and colleagues and Van Bon and colleagues did not include feedback from a component tutor (Homan used students to provide feedback and Van Bon used audio-cassettes) and none of the interventions used a performance criteria to determine when to move to the next passage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0741932511410360">Homan et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0741932511410360">O’Connor et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0741932511410360">Van Bon et al., 1991</xref>).</p>
<p>Addressing the need or lack therefore of rereading is critical. If rereading is not necessary to improve reading fluency, nonrepetitive interventions are preferable because reading numerous passages instead of rereading a few passages increases students’ exposure to vocabulary words, topics, and genre (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0741932511410360">Homan et al., 1993</xref>). Increased text exposure expands students’ background and vocabulary knowledge, which are important components in their own right in improving students’ overall reading achievement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0741932511410360">Homan et al., 1993</xref>). Therefore, determining if, when, and/or with whom repeated reading interventions are necessary are important questions to address in order to provide effective guidance for teachers developing and implementing reading fluency programs. Because repeated reading is often implemented with students at risk for or with reading disabilities, determining the necessity for passage repetition for interventions aimed at these student populations is of paramount importance.</p>
<p>The purpose of this study was to examine the necessity of passage repetition within the RAAC program on the reading achievement of students receiving special education or Tier 2 or Tier 3 services within a three-tiered RTI framework for reading. The following research questions were posited:</p>

<title>Participants and Setting</title>
<p>Students (<italic>N</italic> = 30; see Note 1) in third (<italic>n</italic> = 10), fourth (<italic>n</italic> = 7), and fifth (<italic>n</italic> = 13) grades receiving tiered services (Tier 2, <italic>n</italic> = 25) and (Tier 3, <italic>n</italic> = 1) within a three-tiered RTI framework or special education services in reading (<italic>n</italic> = 4; see Note 2) were participants in the study. One student was African American and the remaining students were Caucasian. Eleven participants were male. Gender did not differ significantly between groups according to chi-square analysis (<italic>p</italic> = .979). Students were identified through the school’s response to intervention model as requiring additional instruction in reading fluency. Eligibility for supplemental instruction within the RTI framework was determined via <italic>Dynamic Indicators of Basic Early Literacy Skills</italic> (DIBELS; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0741932511410360">University of Oregon, 2009</xref>) which provides an appraisal of five core areas: initial sound fluency, letter naming fluency, phoneme segmentation fluency, nonsense word fluency, and oral reading fluency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0741932511410360">Goffreda &amp; DiPerna, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>Students (approximately 15% of the population) identified as “at risk” or “some risk” via DIBELS criteria were provided supplemental instruction. All students involved in the study had reading fluency difficulties and read a minimum of 25 correct words per minute on grade-level passages but below the 50th percentile spring norms for their respective grade levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0741932511410360">Hasbrouck &amp; Tindal, 2005</xref>). Along with the supplemental instruction provided via the study, students were involved in Tier 1 (core) reading instruction within the general education classroom. Tier 1 instruction consisted of a commercially available basal reading program.</p>
<p>Because of school administrator preference and the extensive research base already indicating the effectiveness of repeated reading programs, students were randomly assigned at a 2:1 ratio (i.e., two students to the nonrepetitive condition for every one student to the repeated reading condition). To assess group equivalence after random assignment, pretest scores on the DIBELS <italic>Oral Reading Fluency</italic> (DORF) and <italic>Woodcock-Johnson III</italic> (WJ-III; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0741932511410360">Woodcock, McGrew, &amp; Mather, 2001</xref>) <italic>Broad Reading</italic> standard scores were compared between conditions. The DORF indicator provides an appraisal of reading fluency through the use of connected text (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0741932511410360">University of Oregon, 2009</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0741932511410360">Goffreda and DiPerna (2010)</xref> reported that test–retest, interrater, and alternate form reliability coefficients for the DORF indicator all met <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0741932511410360">Salvia, Ysseldyke, and Bolt’s (2010)</xref> criteria for group and screening purposes. With regard to validity, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0741932511410360">Goffreda and DiPerna (2010)</xref> reported that the DORF indicator exhibited moderate to high concurrent and predictive validity coefficients.</p>
<p>The WJ-III <italic>Broad Reading</italic> dimension consists of the following tests: letter word identification, reading fluency, and passage comprehension. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0741932511410360">Salvia et al. (2010)</xref> noted that the WJ-III <italic>Broad Reading</italic> dimension exhibited adequate reliability and validity.</p>
<p>On average, students in the repeated reading condition read DIBELS grade-level material at 76.82 (<italic>SD</italic> = 25.67) correct words per minute and students in the nonrepetitive condition read 81.42 (<italic>SD</italic> = 25.52) correct words per minute. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) results indicated that this difference was not significant, <italic>F</italic>(1, 28) = 0.23, <italic>p</italic> = .64. On average, students in the repeated reading group obtained a WJ-III <italic>Broad Reading</italic> standard score of 92.27 (<italic>SD</italic> = 6.03) and students in the nonrepetitive condition obtained a mean standard score of 90.42 (<italic>SD</italic> = 10.7). ANOVA results indicated that this difference was not significant, <italic>F</italic>(1, 28) = 0.28, <italic>p</italic> = .60.</p>
<p>Students were enrolled in a rural elementary school located in Southeast Iowa. Forty-three percent of the school population received free or reduced-price lunch and 15% were receiving special education services. The interventions were conducted one on one in a pull-out setting by two paraprofessionals trained by the investigative team. Both paraprofessionals were high school graduates with 1 and 3 years of experience, respectively, in their current positions. Neither paraprofessional had formal training in the field of education or special education. To ensure any potential teacher effect was not confounded with the intervention effect, each paraprofessional was trained and they implemented both the repeated reading and the nonrepetitive programs. All students were involved in 50 intervention sessions over a 4-month period.</p>

<title>Data collection</title>
<p>Pre- and posttest measures (DIBELS <italic>Oral Reading Fluency</italic> and WJ-III) data were collected by a special education doctoral student who had extensive experience implementing the measures as a practicing teacher and during clinical experiences in his master’s and doctoral studies. The pretests were administered during a 2-week period before program implementation and the posttests were administered during a 2-week period after program completion.</p>
<p>The study was conducted following a seven-step sequence: (1) Students (<italic>N</italic> = 30) who met study criteria as discussed in the participant section were recruited. (2) Paraprofessionals were trained to conduct the intervention as discussed in the teacher training section. (3) Students (<italic>N</italic> = 30) were assigned via random assignment to the repeated reading or nonrepetitive reading conditions. (4) The WJ-III <italic>Broad Reading</italic> subtests and DIBELS <italic>Oral Reading Fluency</italic> were administered. (5) Interventions were implemented until a total of fifty 15-min, sessions were completed. Students averaged three sessions per week and engaged in a total of 12.5 hr of instruction over a 4-month period. Students began reading material at the instructional level determined via WJ-III assessment. (6) Treatment integrity data were collected for 9.3% of the sessions. (7) Students were posttested using and DIBELS <italic>Oral Reading Fluency</italic> and the WJ-III <italic>Broad Reading</italic> subtests.</p>

<sec id="section5-0741932511410360">
<title>Interventions</title>
<p>The interventions consisted of two versions of the RAAC program—one with repeated reading and one with nonrepetitive reading. The RAAC intervention with repeated reading consists of the following nine instructional steps (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0741932511410360">Therrien et al., 2006a</xref>). In Step 1, the teacher cued the student with the following statement: “Read this story the best you can and as quickly as you can. Pay attention to what you are reading as you will need to answer these questions (teacher pointed to the cue card questions).”</p>
<p>In Step 2, a cue card containing generic story structure questions was presented and the teacher prompted the student to read the questions aloud. The following story questions created by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0741932511410360">Short and Ryan (1984)</xref> were used: Who is the main character? Where and when did the story take place? What did the main character do? How did the story end? How did the main character feel?</p>
<p>For Step 3, the student reread the passage aloud until he or she reached a preestablished number of correct words per minute (CWPM). The criterion of CWPM was based on norms reported by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0741932511410360">Hasbrouck and Tindal (1992)</xref> of students reading at the 50th percentile at the student’s instructional reading level. Regardless of the established criteria, students read each passage at least two and no more than four times. A minimum and maximum number of readings was set because previous research indicates that comprehension gains are no longer significant after the third reading and gains in CWPM is appreciably smaller from the third to seventh reading than from the first to third reading (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0741932511410360">O’Shea et al., 1985</xref>). The intervention maximizes the likelihood that students in general will reach the preestablished number of CWPM in two to four readings by lowering and raising the difficulty of the material based on their previous progress (see Step 9).</p>
<p>In Step 4, the teacher provided corrective feedback on word errors. If the student hesitated on a word for 3 s or omitted a word(s), error correction was provided immediately. Otherwise, error correction was provided after the passage had been read but prior to rereading the passage. Error correction in both cases entailed pointing to the word(s) in the passage, stating the correct pronunciation of the word(s), and asking the student to repeat it/them.</p>
<p>For Step 5, after each reading, the teacher provided feedback to the student on the fluency of his or her performance (e.g., speed, accuracy, and prosody) using the “How Did I Read” rubric. See <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0741932511410360">Figure 1</xref> for this rubric. During initial sessions, teachers rated student performance and provided a rationale for their rating. As sessions progressed, students were asked to rate their own performance and provide a rationale for their rating prior to receiving feedback from the teacher.</p>

<p>In Step 6, after the terminal passage reading, the teacher prompted the student to adapt and answer the cue card questions orally. Depending on the content of the passage, the generic questions varied on whether they were factual in nature with answers explicitly stated in the text or inferential in nature, thus requiring students to integrate information or make a guess based on story content and their background knowledge on the topic. Tutors provided scaffolded assistance during this process using a least-to-most prompt sequence. If the student provided a wrong answer(s) or no answer(s), a prompt to look for the information in the passage was given. If the student answered the question(s) incorrectly or no answer(s) was provided a second time, the teacher pointed to the sentence(s) where the answer(s) could be found or inferred. If the student still was unable to answer the question(s), the answer(s) was provided and the teacher explicitly pointed out where the information needed to answer the question(s) could be found and/or provided the rationale(s) needed to answer the question(s) correctly.</p>
<p>In Step 7, the teacher asked four factual and four inferential comprehension questions about the passage (see material section for description of the questions). For Step 8, the session ended and Steps 1 through 7 were repeated in the following session.</p>
<p>In Step 9, the teacher adjusted the difficulty of the reading material for use in the subsequent session using the following guidelines. If, for three sessions in a row, the student was unable to reach the preestablished number of CWPM required for their instructional reading level in four readings, the reading material to be used in subsequent sessions was lowered by one grade level (e.g., from third to second grade). If, for three sessions in a row, the student was able to reach the preestablished number of CWPM required for their instructional reading level in one reading, the reading material to be used in subsequent sessions was raised by one grade level (e.g., from second to third grade).</p>
<p>The instructional steps in the RAAC intervention nonrepetitive condition consisted of the same steps with the following three exceptions: (1) Instead of rereading passages to criterion, each passage was only read one time. (2) Each instructional session consisted of two novel passage readings and related steps (i.e., a session of the nonrepetitive condition consisted of a student engaging in two cycles of the above steps with two different passages whereas students in the repetitive reading condition read one passage until criterion was reached and went through the steps only once). Therefore, although students in the RAAC program without passage repetition had the same number of sessions and overall instructional time, they read twice as many novel passages as students in the repeated reading condition. (3) The teacher adjusted the difficulty of the reading material for use in the subsequent sessions using the following guidelines. If, for three sessions in a row, a student read both passages at 20% above the criterion, the difficulty of the material was raised (e.g., from a second- to a third-grade instructional level). If, for three sessions in a row, the student read both passages 20% below the criterion, easier material (e.g., from third- to second-grade instructional level) was used in the subsequent session.</p>

<title>Materials</title>
<p>A total of 300 narrative passages (50 passages at instructional reading grade levels of first through sixth according to Flesch-Kincaid [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0741932511410360">Flesch, 1948</xref>; Microsoft, 2003]) and associated comprehension questions from the previous investigation of the RAAC intervention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0741932511410360">Therrien et al., 2006b</xref>) were used. Each passage contained a complete narrative. Topics were wide-ranging and included story topics often found in children’s literature. The number of words each passage contained was such that they could be read in 1 to 1.25 min by students with reading speeds at the 50th percentile for their respective instructional reading level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0741932511410360">Hasbrouck &amp; Tindal, 1992</xref>). For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0741932511410360">Hasbrouck and Tindal (1992)</xref> indicated that second-grade students reading at the 50th percentile during the spring assessment read 94 correct words per minute (CWPM) and so second-grade reading material was set at a length of 94 to 117 words.</p>
<p>Comprehension questions (four factual, four inferential) from the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0741932511410360">Therrien et al. (2006b)</xref> study were also used. These questions were created by graduate students in school psychology or special education using the following operational definitions. “Correct responses to factual questions can be underlined directly in the text without requiring the integration of information from multiple sentences. Correct responses to inferential questions either cannot be located in the text (i.e., cannot be underlined) or require integration of information from multiple sentences” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0741932511410360">Davey &amp; McBride, 1986</xref>, p. 257). A three-stage process was used when creating questions. (1) A graduate student created four factual and four inferential questions using the above definition. (2) Blind to the original question author’s intent, a second graduate student read the passage and questions and identified them as either factual or inferential. (3) A comparison was made between the two graduate students’ question labeling, when there was disagreement, the question(s) were rewritten.</p>

<title>Paraprofessional Training</title>
<p>Two special education paraprofessionals employed by the school implemented the interventions. Paraprofessionals were trained to conduct both interventions. The investigative team trained the paraprofessionals to implement the interventions during a 4-hr in-service held over a 2-day period. Training used in the previous investigation of the RAAC intervention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0741932511410360">Therrien et al., 2006b</xref>) was modified and used in this study with instruction on RAAC, with repeated reading occurring first and instruction on implementing RAAC without passage repetition occurring second. Instruction followed a five-step sequence. First, instruction was provided on the definition and importance of reading fluency and comprehension. Second, a checklist that contained the instructional steps in the intervention was provided. Tutors were advised to follow the cue card when implementing the intervention. Third, the intervention was explained in detail and modeled. Fourth, teachers practiced intervention implementation with formative and corrective feedback given by the investigators. Fifth, the paraprofessionals were required to demonstrate mastery of intervention implementation by receiving 100% on treatment integrity checklists while conducting mock sessions of the interventions with a member of the investigative team acting in the role of the student.</p>
<p>To ensure paraprofessionals adhered to the appropriate intervention protocols during study implementation, student material was maintained in individual color-coded folders, with all repeated reading students’ material maintained in blue folders and all nonrepetitive reading students’ material maintained in red folders. Furthermore, paraprofessionals were required to use laminated intervention check sheets during all intervention sessions.</p>

<title>Dynamic Indicators of Basic Early Literacy: Oral Reading Fluency measure (DORF)</title>
<p>The DORF is a curriculum-based fluency measure where students read aloud for 1 min from a grade-level passage, and the number of correct words per minute is recorded (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0741932511410360">University of Oregon, 2009</xref>). Although brief in duration, curriculum-based measurement (CBM) reading fluency scores correlate well with traditional (norm-referenced) measures of decoding and comprehension and reliably differentiate special education status (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0741932511410360">Marston, 1989</xref>). CBM appears to be one of the most valid measures available for monitoring reading competence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0741932511410360">Fuchs &amp; Fuchs, 1999</xref>). Assessment sessions (pre- and posttesting) consisted of three passage readings with the median score reported. Per the National Center on Student Progress Monitoring (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0741932511410360">United States Office of Special Education Programs, 2009</xref>), DORF demonstrated evidence to meet psychometric (i.e., reliability and validity) standards.</p>

<title>Treatment integrity</title>
<p>Treatment integrity data were collected via direct observation for a total of 9.3% (139/1,500 sessions) of the sessions. Treatment integrity data were collected by the second author using a checklist of the essential instructional steps of the interventions that are listed above in the intervention section. The second author was originally trained by the first author on the RAAC interventions and integrity protocols and prior to data collection had extensive experience (more than 2 years) implementing the RAAC interventions and collecting treatment integrity data. A proportional sampling method across paraprofessionals and interventions was used to collect data, with 70% of the integrity sessions conducted in the nonrepetitive condition. During the first 2 weeks of program implementation, each paraprofessional was observed implementing both interventions at least once a day to ensure initial adherence to intervention protocols. Integrity data then continued throughout the remainder of program implementation at a rate of approximately 8% of sessions conducted per week. For the repeated reading condition, an overall integrity percentage of 98.8% (<italic>SD</italic> = 3.24%) was obtained with a mean range per tutor of 98.3% to 98.9%. For the nonrepetitive reading condition, an overall integrity percentage of 97.6 (<italic>SD</italic> = 4.4%) was obtained with a mean range per tutor of 97.5% to 99.3%.</p>

<sec id="section14-0741932511410360">
<title>Statistical analysis</title>
<p>Mean comparisons using dependent <italic>t</italic> tests and analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) were used to examine interventions’ impact on students’ reading achievement. For the obtained statistics to be distributed as <italic>F</italic> or <italic>t</italic>, the underlying raw score distributions must be normal and variances of the groups must be equal. To verify that the assumption of equal variance was satisfied, Levene’s tests of homogeneity of variance were conducted. The results of these tests were found to be nonsignificant. In addition to the above two assumptions, ANCOVA tests also require that the assumption of homogeneity of linear regression be met. Homogeneity of linear regression is equivalent to no treatment by covariate interaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0741932511410360">Feldt, 1993</xref>). To verify that no interactions existed, ANCOVA tests using the additional interaction term (Treatment × Covariate) were conducted on all data sets subject to ANCOVA testing. The results of these tests were found to be nonsignificant. Cohen’s <italic>d</italic> was used to calculate effect sizes (<italic>ES</italic>s). To ensure against potentially inflated effect sizes for comparisons using dependent <italic>t</italic> tests, the original standard deviations for the scores were used instead of the <italic>t</italic> statistic when calculating the effect sizes.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>The results were examined with regard to the following research questions: (1) What is the effect for the repeated reading version of the RAAC on student reading fluency outcomes? (2) What is the effect of the nonrepetitive reading version of the RAAC on student reading fluency? (3) How do the effects on students’ reading fluency outcomes compare for each version of the RAAC? (4) What is the effect for the repeated reading version of the RAAC on overall reading achievement? (5) What is the effect for the nonrepetitive reading version of the RAAC on overall reading achievement? (6) How do the effects on students’ overall reading achievement compare for each version of the RAAC?</p>
<p>To ascertain if reading fluency on the DORF posttest was significantly higher than the DORF pretest measure for both versions of the RAAC program (i.e., Research Questions 1 and 3), pre- to posttest DORF scores of students were compared. On average, students in the repeated reading condition increased 15.73 CWPM from pretest (76.82 CWPM) to posttest (92.55 CWPM). Dependent <italic>t</italic>-test results indicated that this finding (<italic>ES</italic> = .65) was statistically significant (<italic>t</italic> = 3.39, <italic>p</italic> = .007). Second, pre- to posttest scores of students in the nonrepetitive condition were compared. On average, students in the nonrepetitive condition increased 26.89 CWPM from pretest (81.42 CWPM) to posttest (108.32 CWPM). Dependent <italic>t</italic>-test results indicated that this finding (<italic>ES</italic> = .92) was statistically significant (<italic>t</italic> = 6.05, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .0005).</p>
<p>To ascertain if either RAAC program was more effective at increasing students’ reading fluency (i.e., Research Question 3), DORF pre- to posttest gain scores of students in the repeated reading and nonrepetitive reading groups were compared. ANCOVA results using DORF pretest scores as the covariate indicated that this finding (<italic>ES</italic> = .64) was not statistically significant, <italic>F</italic>(1, 27) = 2.8, <italic>p</italic> = .10.</p>
<p>To ascertain if reading achievement on the WJ-III <italic>Broad Reading</italic> posttest was significantly higher than the pretest (i.e., Research Questions 4 and 5), WJ-III <italic>Broad Reading</italic> standard score pre- to posttest scores of students were compared. On average, students in the repeated reading condition standard score increased 3.36 from pretest (92.27) to posttest (95.64). Dependent <italic>t</italic>-test results indicated that this finding (<italic>ES</italic> = .62) was statistically significant (<italic>t</italic> = 2.89, <italic>p</italic> = .01). Second, pre- to posttest scores of students in the nonrepetitive condition were compared. On average, students in the nonrepetitive reading condition standard score increased 5.0 from pretest (90.42) to posttest (95.42). Dependent <italic>t</italic>-test results indicated that this finding (<italic>ES</italic> = .50) was statistically significant (<italic>t</italic> = 5.53, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .0005).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Results from this investigation confirm and extend previous findings from the repeated reading and nonrepetitive reading literature base. Similar to the previous Re-read-Adapt and Answer-Comprehend (RAAC) study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0741932511410360">Therrien et al., 2006b</xref>) and repeated reading studies (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0741932511410360">Bryant et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0741932511410360">Gilbert et al., 1996</xref>), students in the RAAC condition with rereading made significant gains in reading fluency from pre- to posttesting. Furthermore, as was found in previous investigations of nonrepetitive oral reading with feedback interventions (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0741932511410360">O’Connor et al., 2007</xref>), students in the RAAC condition without rereading also made significant gains in reading fluency from pre- to posttesting. The pre–post differences (15.73 for repeated reading and 26.9 for nonrepetitive reading) across 17 weeks translates to increases of approximately +0.91 and +1.58 CWPM per week respectively. Intervention effects of this magnitude indicate that the programs produced growth rates that exceeded the expected growth rates of elementary general education children (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0741932511410360">Deno, Fuchs, Marston, &amp; Shin, 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>Students in both conditions also made significant gains in general reading achievement between pre- and posttesting, a finding that was not consistently found in previous investigations of interventions aimed primarily at oral reading fluency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0741932511410360">Therrien, 2004</xref>). Length of intervention implementation is the most likely reason for the significant finding as most previous investigations of fluency programs were short in duration, with studies of longer duration often reporting significant gains in measures of students’ overall reading achievement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0741932511410360">Bryant et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0741932511410360">Vaughn et al., 2000</xref>).</p>
<p>Along with an extended intervention implementation period, the effectiveness of the RAAC program with and without passage repetition is likely due to two critical instructional components. First, both interventions include oral reading with feedback. Meta-analytic results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0741932511410360">NICHD, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0741932511410360">Therrien, 2004</xref>) and previous investigations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0741932511410360">O’Connor et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0741932511410360">Therrien et Al., 2006b</xref>) indicate that the inclusion of feedback is essential to maximize student achievement. The importance of feedback within reading fluency programs also aligns with what is known about the inclusion of formative feedback in education interventions in general. Formative feedback has been conclusively shown to improve achievement and the gains in achievement obtained via formative feedback appear to be among the largest ever reported for education interventions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0741932511410360">Black &amp; Wiliam, 1998</xref>, pp. 7–8, 61). Second, the RAAC program with and without passage repetition adjusts the difficulty of the reading material to students’ oral reading ability, ensuring students are reading material where fluency is a concern but not an overwhelming difficulty. Previous successful oral reading fluency studies (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0741932511410360">O’Connor et al., 2007</xref>) ensured students read material at an instructional level (e.g., approximately 90% accuracy level) during intervention implementation.</p>
<sec id="section17-0741932511410360">
<title>Comparison of Repeated Reading and Nonrepetitive Reading Conditions</title>
<p>As was found in previous comparison studies of repeated reading and nonrepetitive reading interventions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0741932511410360">Homan et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0741932511410360">O’Connor et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0741932511410360">Van Bon et al., 1991</xref>), there was no significant difference (<italic>p</italic> = .10) between conditions on pre- to posttest gains in reading fluency and general reading achievement (<italic>p</italic> = .35). Despite the lack of statistical significance, the mean difference in reading fluency (+11.17 CWPM) in favor of the nonrepetitive condition was surprising. While repeated reading students’ increase in CWPM (15.73) was comparable to the increase found in the previous investigation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0741932511410360">Therrien et al., 2006b</xref>) of the RAAC with passage repetition program (13 CWPM), the increase in CWPM (26.9) among students in the nonrepetitive condition was two times greater than those found in the initial study. Furthermore, comparison of students’ pre- and posttest scores to DIBELS <italic>Oral Reading Fluency</italic> benchmark goals for the middle and end of the year respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0741932511410360">University of Oregon, 2009</xref>) also favored students in the nonrepetitive condition. Sixty-three percent of students in the nonrepetitive intervention improved in DIBELS classification from at risk to some risk or from some risk to low risk compared to only 30% of students in the repeated reading condition.</p>
<p>Plausible explanations for this difference in favor of the nonrepetitive intervention may involve student characteristics and/or reading material. Compared to the previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0741932511410360">Therrien et al., 2006b</xref>) that included fourth- through eighth-grade students with more than half diagnosed as having a learning disability in reading, students involved in the current investigation were younger and the majority were not receiving special education services. This difference in severity of need may have resulted in a higher response rate in the current study. In fact, gains in reading fluency achieved in the current investigation are similar to the fluency gains (20 CWPM) of second- through fourth-grade students reported by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0741932511410360">O’Connor and colleagues (2007)</xref>.</p>
<p>Of course, difference in severity of need does not explain the potential greater impact in favor of nonrepetitive reading. Along with severity of need, the reading material used in the interventions may have attributed to this difference. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0741932511410360">LaBerge and Samuels (1974)</xref> hypothesized that repeated reading improves word recognition and decoding skills by providing students with multiple exposures to the same words. This increase in word recognition, in turn, results in increased reading fluency. Although students in the nonrepetitive reading group read passages only one time each, they were still likely exposed to unknown words multiple times. Students reading at a first- through third-grade level are learning, and their instructional materials include a large percentage of high-frequency words, which results in word overlap between passages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0741932511410360">Nagy &amp; Anderson, 1984</xref>). This overlap combined with additional novel passage readings at an appropriate difficulty level for the nonrepetitive reading group (they read 100 passages compared to repeated reading students reading 50 novel passages) may have resulted in greater exposure to unknown words, which in turn excelled their growth rate in reading fluency.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section18-0741932511410360">
<title>Limitations</title>
<p>There are five limitations to the conclusions of this analysis. First, because of an ethical concern to provide instruction to all students identified as needing assistance via the school’s RTI model, the study design did not include a no-treatment control group so comparisons to a similar group of students who received no treatment could not be made. This limitation is particularly pertinent for the pre- and posttest comparisons because without a control group we have no indication of the amount of growth a similar group of students who received no supplemental instruction would have made. Students in both conditions, however, had growth rates that far exceeded the expected growth rates of elementary general education children. Second, statistically significant differences between the two treatment conditions at the traditional .05 level were not found. Considering, however, that both interventions targeted reading fluency, the effect size difference (<italic>ES</italic> = .64) in favor of the nonrepetitive condition is noteworthy. Additional research examining differences between repetitive and nonrepetitive reading fluency interventions is warranted. Third, a reading comprehension measure parallel with DIBELS <italic>Oral Reading Fluency</italic> was not used to compare gains in reading comprehension between conditions. Although reading fluency was the main focus of both interventions, it is possible that the programs affected reading comprehension differentially. It is important to note, however, that WJ-III <italic>Broad Reading</italic> scale includes reading comprehension and the difference between conditions on this measure was not significant. Fourth, treatment fidelity data were collected for only 9.3% percent of the sessions and all observations were conducted by the same person. Additional observations and observers would have enhanced the rigor of the study and would have allowed interrater reliability to be calculated. Although low by percentage, the total number of observations was large (<italic>n</italic> = 139) that combined with the low variability of scores and significant student achievement across conditions increases our confidence that the interventions were implemented as intended. Fifth, social validity of the interventions from the students’ and paraprofessionals’ perspectives was not collected. Future studies may want to collect this information to ascertain if key stakeholders have a preference for one intervention over the other.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>Taking into account the limitations of this analysis, two noteworthy findings have emerged from this investigation. First, the RAAC program with and without passage repetition may improve third- through fifth-grade students receiving remedial instruction reading fluency and has the potential to impact their overall reading achievement. Second, the RAAC program without passage repetition may be as effective, if not more so, at improving students’ reading fluency compared to the RAAC program with passage repetition. This conclusion echoes findings by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0741932511410360">Homan et al. (1993)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0741932511410360">O’Connor et al. (2007)</xref>, who concluded that reading practice with feedback, not rereading, is the essential component needed to improve reading fluency.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section20-0741932511410360">
<title>Implication for Future Research</title>
<p>Although there is a growing research base to suggest passage repetition may not be necessary to improve reading fluency, additional studies need to be conducted to determine when and/or with whom repeated reading interventions may be necessary. It is possible that older students and/or students with significant reading disabilities may in fact require passage repetition to improve reading fluency. Additional research on the RAAC program also needs to be conducted to determine its efficacy for various student populations and compared to other instructional approaches. Furthermore, the connection between reading fluency and comprehension assessment and intervention needs to continue to be explored and refined.</p>

<p>Originally 31 students were involved in the study (20 in the nonrepetitive condition and 11 in the repeated reading condition). One student in the nonrepetitive condition moved during intervention implementation, leaving a total of 19 students in the nonrepetitive condition.</p>

<p>Students in Iowa do not receive traditional special education labels (e.g., learning disabilities) and instead are classified as “eligible individuals” based on the Iowa Instructional Decision Making Model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0741932511410360">Iowa Department of Education, 2006</xref>). When determining a student’s eligibility for special education services, Iowa’s model takes into account three general areas: <italic>educational progress data</italic> (rate compared to expected), <italic>discrepancy data</italic> (difference of level of performance compared to peers), and <italic>instructional need data</italic> (needs in the areas of instruction, curriculum and environment) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0741932511410360">Iowa Department of Education, 2006</xref>).</p>
