The centres’ remit was to address issues relating to women’s offending, such as substance misuse, domestic violence, other experiences of abuse and trauma, mental and physical health, finance, and accommodation issues. </p><p>The research was undertaken by Leicester University. The aim was to assess whether: a) referral to TW reduced proven reoffending within a one year period, and b) whether the availability of TW encouraged sentencers to divert women from custody. The evaluation covered the period from December 2006 to March 2009. A total of 3466 women were recorded as having been referred within this period, although due to poor recording this is likely to be an underestimate.</p><p>TW centres were available to offenders and non-offenders and women could be referred via a number of routes: Criminal Justice Agencies, i.e. Police and Probation; other Referring Agencies, and self-referrals, with CJAs referring the majority of women. Attendance was largely voluntary. The majority of women referred were white (91%). The average number of dependent children was two, although this data was found to be unreliable. The average age of women referred was 34. </p><p>Evaluation of TW’s effectiveness was hampered by the imperfect and incomplete provision of qualitative and quantitative data by the TW centres. Problems included: lack of a common assessment framework or data collection system; lack of a definition of ‘at risk’ of offending; and lack of information with which to check the Police National Computer (PNC) at evaluation stage. Poor data recording is a theme throughout the evaluation document.</p><p>It was found that there was no proven reduction in reoffending within one year. Those women identified as having been convicted of an offence soon before or after their referral to TW were compared to a control group of those on a Community Order without a TW referral. Of the TW group 35.3 per cent reoffended as compared to 36 per cent of the control group. A further comparison was done between those referred to TW who were also on a Community Order and those on a Community Order without TW. Again, no significant statistical difference was noted. This outcome was assessed as unreliable due to the limited data available to the research team.</p><p>Prevalent identified needs were: peer offending, current offending, anti-social behaviour, educational needs, life skills, drugs and alcohol issues and health needs. Difficulties in capturing needs-related data arose as areas did not use the same recording systems or have the same categories. No correlation between needs identified and support provided was found, but due to the data collection problems this result is not reliable. </p><p>Twenty sentencers from eight Courts were interviewed about the Court’s awareness of TW, what sentencers thought of the TW project, and whether its availability diverted women from custody. The research found that despite TW having been in operation for three years at the time, awareness among sentencers remained quite low. Sentencers noted that many voluntary projects were of variable quality, and that an endorsement of a TW referral from the probation service was most likely to influence sentencers favourably. The perception was that TW helped women deal with a range of personal and social problems, thereby addressing the underlying issues to offending behaviour. The women-only nature of TW and the commitment of staff was also noted. This matches feedback from service users also.</p><p>A TW referral was found to have been used to divert women from custody on a small number of occasions. One judge had diverted women from custody by making TW attendance a specified activity as part of a community order. Some sentencers had concerns about the mixing of offenders and non-offenders in TW. In general sentencers believed that for TW to be used more widely, it would need to be both enforceable and exclusively available for convicted offenders.</p><p>In concluding the researchers noted the following:</p><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Due to incomplete data recording and assessment methods, reoffending rates were not proven to be reduced by a referral to TW. However, this did not mean that women had not been supported by TW to reduce reoffending and deal with other issues such as drug use;</p></list-item><list-item><p>TW had a low profile among sentencers, but among those who were aware of it, it was viewed positively. For it to be used more widely it would need to be mandatory, and restricted to offenders only;</p></list-item><list-item><p>That trained evaluators should be involved at the outset of projects to assist with setting project objectives and methods for assessing outcomes. This is seen as essential for those involved in payment by results schemes in future.</p></list-item></list><p><italic>Re-offending Analysis of Women Offenders Referred to Together Women (TW) and the Scope to Divert from Custody</italic> by Darrick Jolliffee, Carol Hedderman, Emma Palmer and Clive Hollin, December 2011, Ministry of Justice Research Series 11/11.
