<p>It has recently become the norm to use physician extenders to assist busy physicians in managing larger and more complex patient populations. It appears that patients better understand their disease or injury states when their information is provided by trained nurse educators.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1071100712460233">1</xref></sup> Physician assistants, nurses, or nurse practitioners can be trained to greatly expand the number of patients who can efficiently be cared for by physicians and physician specialists. In the world of orthopaedic surgery, this has been best exemplified in the algorithm-driven subspecialties of total joint arthroplasty or spine surgery. In these disciplines, physician extenders may provide much of the patient education as well as the routine preoperative and postoperative care. These providers can be trained to provide the primary treatment for simple musculoskeletal complaints and screen patients who require more advanced care.</p>
<p>A 55-year-old athletic man recently came to my office following an ankle injury. He lives in a suburban community, owns a construction company, and has private health insurance. He recently injured his ankle in a fall during a workout at his health club. He went to the local emergency room at the private hospital in his community. The triage nurse sent him to the radiology department, and the results of his radiographs were deemed normal. Without actually being touched by the emergency room physician, he was signed out with a sprained ankle protocol and advised to follow up with his primary care physician. The schedule of his primary care physician was fully booked, so he was treated by the nurse practitioner of the practice. She retrieved the hospital emergency room records and reinforced the sprained ankle protocol. After 3 months of continued symptoms, he made an appointment with a local orthopaedic surgeon, who diagnosed his Achilles tendon rupture. This efficient modern medicine system converted the relatively straightforward problem of an acute Achilles tendon rupture into the complex problem of a neglected Achilles tendon rupture.</p>
<p>It is easy to point fingers and advise returning to the “good old days.” The reality is that we are not going to return to the days of the kindly general practitioner who was capable of diagnosing virtually any problem. The forces in play that make the delivery of modern medicine so complex are the same issues that produced this problem. The health care system that we knew has become unsustainable. If the system does not build in these new efficiencies, it will not be able to provide the current state of the art at a cost that the system can afford. As we implement these innovative efficiencies, we need to be careful to build in safeguards to limit the system-associated complications as seen in our patient example. The truth is that everyone in the health care system is being required to do more with less. As we relegate responsibility, we need to implement these efficiencies with patient safety as our primary focus, not simply lifestyle or financial efficiencies. What are your thoughts? The FootForum is interested in publishing them on this complex topic. Forward your comments to <email>mpinzur@faijournal.com</email>.</p>
