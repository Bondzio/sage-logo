<p>Tobacco use remains the single largest preventable cause of death in the United States, with approximately 443 000 US adults dying from smoking-related illnesses each year.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-2150129713480886">1</xref></sup> In 2011, the Center for Disease Control estimated that 19.0% (43.8 million) of US adults aged 18 and older were current cigarette smokers. About half (51.8%) of them and those who had quit the preceding year made an attempt to quit smoking for more than 1 day the preceding year.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-2150129713480886">1</xref></sup> Tobacco dependence is a chronic disease requiring repeated intervention and multiple attempts to quit. The combination of counseling and medication for treating tobacco dependence is more effective than either modality alone.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-2150129713480886">2</xref></sup></p>
<p>Varenicline (Chantix) is a non-nicotine prescription medication indicated in adults for use as an aid to smoking cessation treatment. Varenicline (Chantix) tablets, manufactured by Pfizer Inc, New York, was approved by the FDA in May 2006. It binds with high affinity and selectivity at the α<sub>4</sub>β<sub>2</sub> neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptors, acting as an agonist by stimulating receptor-mediated activity but at a significantly lower level than nicotine. As varenicline (Chantix) blocks the ability of nicotine to bind to α<sub>4</sub>β<sub>2</sub> receptors, nicotine can no longer stimulate the central nervous mesolimbic dopamine system and trigger the reward cigarette smokers feel on smoking.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-2150129713480886">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>The pharmacokinetics of varenicline (Chantix) is not affected by age, gender, race, smoking status, or use of concomitant medications. Safety and efficacy of varenicline in pediatric patients have not been established; therefore, use in patients under 18 years of age is not recommended. The maximum plasma concentrations of varenicline (Chantix) occur within 3 to 4 hours. Steady-state conditions following multiple oral dosages were reached within 4 days. After a mass balance study, varenicline (Chantix) was found to be completely absorbed orally, and systemic availability was ~90%. Plasma protein binding of varenicline is low, reported at &lt;20%, and is independent of both age and renal function. Smoking cessation with or without treatment may alter the pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics of certain medications (eg, theophylline, warfarin, insulin) in which dosage adjustment may be necessary.</p>
<p>The most common reported adverse reactions in placebo-controlled studies associated with varenicline (Chantix) treatment are nausea, abnormal (vivid, unusual, or strange) dreams, constipation, flatulence, and vomiting. Serious adverse reactions reported in postmarketing experience include neuropsychiatric symptoms and suicidality, angioedema and hypersensitivity reactions, serious skin reactions, cardiovascular events, and accidental injury.</p>
<p>Varenicline (Chantix) is supplied as 0.5 mg and 1 mg tablets. It is recommended that varenicline (Chantix) be started 1 week before the date set by the patient to stop smoking. The patient also has the option of starting varenicline (Chantix) and then quit smoking between days 8 and 35 of treatment. Varenicline (Chantix) should be taken after eating, and with a full glass of water. Varenicline is dosed at 0.5 mg once daily on days 1 to 3, 0.5 mg twice daily on days 4 to 7, and then 1 mg twice daily thereafter for a total of 12 weeks. An additional 12 weeks of treatment is recommended for patients who successfully quit, increasing the likelihood of staying quit.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-2150129713480886">6</xref></sup>
</p>
<p>Patients should be provided educational materials and appropriate counseling to help support their attempt to quit smoking. Encourage patients to continue to attempt to quit if they have early lapses after their quit date. Patients should attempt treatment again if they fail to stop smoking or relapse when they have addressed the factors that contributed to their failed attempt.</p>
