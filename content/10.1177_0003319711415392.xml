<p>A subgroup of patients with normal stress myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI) have obstructive coronary artery disease (CAD) on coronary computed tomographic angiography (CCTA). A retrospective study was performed to identify factors associated with obstructive CAD in patients with normal MPI. Bivariate differences between patients with obstructive (&gt;50% stenosis) and nonobstructive (&lt;50% stenosis) CAD were assessed. Of the 105 patients with normal MPI, 42 (40%) had obstructive CAD on CCTA. After a multivariable logistic regression analysis increased Framingham risk scores ([FRS] ≥10%) and coronary artery calcium scores ([CACS] &gt;100 Agatston Units [AU]) were independently associated with obstructive CAD (<italic>P</italic> = .006 and <italic>P</italic> &lt; .0001, respectively). Patients with normal MPI had 13 times and 98 times higher odds of having obstructive CAD if they had a FRS ≥10% versus &lt;10% and CACS &gt;100 AU versus ≤100 AU, respectively. Increased FRS and CACS may stratify patients who may benefit from further evaluation for significant CAD despite normal MPI.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Recently, 64-slice coronary computed tomographic angiography (CCTA) has been widely utilized as a noninvasive imaging modality to detect significant coronary artery disease (CAD). Compared to CCTA, myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI) using gated single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) has been more extensively studied and utilized in clinical practice. However, numerous studies have documented a disparity between CCTA and SPECT MPI to identify visually obstructive versus flow-limiting CAD, respectively. In fact, recent studies have reported that up to 50% to 68% of symptomatic patients with normal MPI results had obstructive CAD on CCTA.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0003319711415392">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0003319711415392"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0003319711415392">3</xref>
</sup> Thus, patients identified with obstructive CAD may potentially receive treatment aimed at improving their symptoms and prognosis. The aim of this study was to identify factors associated with obstructive CAD on CCTA in patients with normal SPECT MPI.</p>

<title>Methods</title>
<sec id="section3-0003319711415392">
<title>Study Design and Population</title>
<p>This was a retrospective study of patients who had both CCTA and MPI studies between December 2005 and December 2007. This study was approved for exemption by the Institutional Review Board of the Kaiser Foundation Research Institute. Only patients who had both imaging tests within a 1-year time interval were included in the study. All patients were members of the Kaiser Permanente Health Plan. All patients presented to the San Jose Medical Center (San Jose, California) for CCTA. Single-photon emission computed tomography MPI studies were performed at Northern Kaiser Permanente medical centers. For each patient, clinic characteristics were collected from their medical records including age, gender, vital statistics, documented cardiac risk factors (including diabetes mellitus, hypertension, obesity [body mass index ≥30 kg/m<sup>2</sup>], dyslipidemia, family cardiac history, obstructive sleep apnea, smoking [previous and current]), renal insufficiency (glomerular filtration rate, GFR &lt;60 mL/min), clinical indication for cardiac test, and most recent laboratory results (including creatinine and fasting lipid panel). A Framingham risk score ([FRS] 10-year coronary heart disease [CHD] risk) was calculated for each patient based on his or her most recent clinical assessment.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0003319711415392">4</xref>
</sup> A recent study of symptomatic patients compared outcomes in patients with obstructive CAD (&gt;50% stenosis) on CCTA to FRS and found that CCTA was more predictive of cardiac events.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0003319711415392">5</xref>
</sup> Since we intended to collect coronary artery calcium scores (CACS) for our analysis, patients with previous coronary bypass surgery and percutaneous coronary stent implantation were excluded from the study.</p>

<sec id="section4-0003319711415392">
<title>Myocardial Perfusion Imaging</title>
<p>For all patients, a 1-day stress-rest SPECT protocol was performed. During the rest phase, patients received an intravenous injection of 10 to 15 mCi Technetium Tc99m Sestamibi. Image acquisition was performed 30 minutes postinjection using a dual-head detector camara (ADAC Genesys, ADAC Laboratories, Milpitas, California). To obtain stress phase images, patients were induced with stress by symptom-limited or target heart rate (&gt;85% maximum predicted heart rate) exercise (using standard Bruce protocol) or infused with a pharmacological agent (adenosine) if they could not achieve target heart rate or unable to exercise. Patients were injected with 20 to 30 mCi Technetium Tc99m Sestamibi at peak exercise or 2 minutes after the start of a 4-minute adenosine infusion (300 mL/h). Image acquisition was performed 15 minutes post-Sestamibi injection for the patients who completed the exercise protocol while images were obtained 45 to 60 minutes postadenosine injection for patients who received the vasodilator. All images were acquired using a dual-headed detector camera with low-energy, high-resolution, parallel-hole, 64 × 64 × 16 matrix, with a 180-degree rotation. The 2 heads were oriented at an angle of 90° to each other. Images were sent for postprocessing to a Pegasys workstation (ADAC Laboratories). Thoracic images in transverse, coronal, and sagittal planes were used for image registration. Axial cardiac sections were reconstructed and realigned into frontal and sagittal sections. Using a gadolinium-153 line source and Vantage system (ADAC Laboratories), attenuation correction was applied to all images. In addition, gated images were used to evaluate wall motion in segments with potential attenuation artifacts. Post-stress and rest SPECT images were interpreted using visual assessment for regional perfusion abnormalities based on a 17-segment model.<sup>

</sup> Only studies reported as normal or probably normal were included in the analysis.</p>

<title>Coronary Artery Calcium Score/Coronary CTA</title>
<p>All CCTA scans were performed with a 64-slice multidetector CT scanner (Lightspeed VCT, GE Healthcare, Chalfont St. Giles, United Kingdom). Initial scout acquisitions were obtained to localize the heart and extracardiac anatomy. Prior to the CCTA, prospective coronary artery calcium scans were performed in all patients. The detector configuration was DFOV 25 cm and acquisition consisted of approximately 40 slices at 2.5 mm slice thickness at 75% of the cardiac cycle after the QRS complex. Using the Advantage Workstation (GE Healthcare), coronary calcification was identified using a peak density cutoff of &gt;130 Hounsfield units. CACS were calculated in Agatston units (AU).<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0003319711415392">7</xref>
</sup> Patients were identified by their raw calcium score as well as categorized into 2 groups (&gt;100 AU and ≤100 AU). The cutoff of 100AU was chosen for this study based on a number of papers that identified &gt;100AU as a prognostic marker for increased cardiovascular events.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0003319711415392">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0003319711415392"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0003319711415392">10</xref>
</sup> Patients with baseline heart rates greater than 60 beats/min received oral metoprolol or atenolol the evening and morning prior to the CT scan. If heart rates were still greater than 70 beats/min, patients received 5 mg intravenous metoprolol at 5-minute increments to achieve a heart rate below 70 beats/min. For the helical CCTA scan, detector configurations were 64 × 0.625 mm collimation, 120 kV tube voltage, and 600 to 850 mA tube current. Gantry speed was 0.35 seconds and pitch factor was 0.16 to 0.24 based on the patient’s heart rate. Timing bolus was administered using Visipaque contrast (GE Healthcare Inc. Princeton, New Jersey) at 5 mL/s for 15 mL of contrast followed by 5 mL/s for 15 mL of normal saline. Bolus peak time was selected when the maximum contrast opacification was visualized at the level of the ostial left main coronary artery in the ascending thoracic aorta. Prior to contrast injection, patients received 0.4 mg sublingual nitroglycerin spray. During image acquisition, a 3-phase injection was administered using contrast injection of 50 mL of visipaque at 5mL/s then 50 mL of 40% contrast and 60% normal saline followed by a 40 mL saline flush at 5 mL/s.</p>
<p>Using retrospective electrocardiograph (EKG)-gating, reconstructed images were obtained at 65%, 70%, 75%, 85%, and 90% of the cardiac cycle after the QRS complex. Scans were reconstructed with slice thickness of 0.625 mm and sent to the Advantage Workstation (GE Healthcare) for image postprocessing. Coronary artery segments were analyzed using 2-dimensional maximum intensity projections at axial and oblique spatial orientations. Multiplanar and curved planar reformation, as well as, cross-sectional axial viewing techniques were used to assist in coronary segment evaluations. Coronary artery segments were assessed for nonobstructive (&lt;50% stenosis) or obstructive (&gt;50% stenosis) CAD. “High-risk” scans were defined as obstructive CAD of the left main artery, 3-vessel disease or 2-vessel disease including the proximal left anterior descending artery (LAD).<sup>

<title>Data Analysis</title>
<p>Patients' characteristics between those with obstructive CAD (&gt;50% stenosis) and those with nonobstructive CAD (&lt;50% stenosis) on CCTA were compared using the <italic>t</italic> test or Wilcoxon rank sum test for continuous variables and chi-square tests or Fisher exact test for categorical variables. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was conducted to examine the predictors of obstructive CAD, with appropriate adjustments for covariates including age, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, dyslipidemia, FRS, and CACS. Categorical variables were expressed as numbers and percentages, while continuous variables were expressed as either a mean with a standard deviation or median with an interquartile range for variables not normally distributed. Analyses were performed using SAS software version 9.13 (SAS Institute Inc, Cary, North Carolina), and a 2-sided <italic>P</italic> value &lt;.05 was considered statistical significant.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>A total of 105 patients (males = 56, mean age = 57 years) had both normal MPI results and CCTA performed (median interval = 75 days; <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0003319711415392">Table 1</xref>
). Eighty-seven patients (87 of 105, 82%) had symptoms as the indication for their CCTA. While 32% of patients (34 of 105) had typical angina (substernal chest pain provoked by exertion), the majority patients had atypical chest pain (46 of 105, 43%). Of the 105 patients with normal MPI results, 42 patients (42 of 105, 40%) had obstructive CAD (&gt;50% stenosis) on CCTA (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0003319711415392">Table 1</xref>). Nineteen patients (19 of 42, 45%) had single-vessel CAD with the LAD artery being predominantly affected (32 of 42, 83%; <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0003319711415392">Table 2</xref>
). In addition, 18 patients (18 of 42, 43%) had obstructive CAD considered “high-risk” (left main artery disease, 3-vessel CAD, or 2-vessel disease including the proximal LAD). None of the MPI studies observed transient left ventricular dilatation or transient lung uptake after stress which would represent high-risk perfusion abnormalities.<sup>

After adjusting for advanced age (≥65 years), hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and dyslipidemia; increased FRS, and elevated CACS were the only predictors that remained significantly associated with obstructive CAD on CCTA in patients with normal SPECT MPI (<italic>P</italic> = .006 and <italic>P</italic> &lt; .0001, respectively; <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0003319711415392">Table 3</xref>
). Patients with normal stress MPI had 13 times and 98 times higher odds of having obstructive CAD on CCTA if they had a FRS ≥10% compared to &lt;10% (95% CI: 2.1-78.0) and CACS &gt;100AU compared to ≤100 AU (95% CI: 16.1-594.8), respectively (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0003319711415392">Table 3</xref>). Combining both FRS and CACS, we observed that 100% of patients with FRS ≥10% and CACS &gt;100 AU had obstructive CAD.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The salient observations from this study are (1) 40% of our cohort with normal SPECT MPI had obstructive CAD on CCTA; (2) increased FRS and CACS are associated with obstructive CAD on CCTA despite normal SPECT MPI.</p>
<p>Many symptomatic patients are screened for CAD with SPECT MPI. The sensitivity and specificity for stress SPECT MPI ranges between 85% to 90% and 70% to 75%, respectively.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0003319711415392">13</xref>
</sup> Given the high sensitivity of stress SPECT MPI, there is a high degree of confidence that symptomatic patients with normal SPECT MPI results do not have hemodynamically significant CAD. However, 82% of our cohort with normal SPECT MPI had symptoms that prompted clinicians to subsequently refer them for CCTA. From our study, 40% of our cohort with normal SPECT MPI were identified with obstructive CAD (&gt;50% stenosis) on CCTA. The sensitivity and specificity of 64-slice CCTA to detect significant CAD is approximately 73% to 99% and 95% to 99%, respectively.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0003319711415392">14</xref>
</sup> In one study that directly compared the accuracy of CCTA and stress MPI to detect significant CAD, CCTA demonstrated both higher sensitivity and specificity compared to MPI (95% vs 81% and 89% vs 78%, respectively).<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0003319711415392">15</xref>
</sup> Although we found 40% of our cohort had obstructive CAD despite normal SPECT MPI, a number of studies have described similar observations. Gaemperli et al found that 68% of stenosed coronary vessels on CCTA were not associated with perfusion defects on MPI.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0003319711415392">2</xref>
</sup> In addition, Schuijf et al reported in 2 studies that 50% to 59% of patients with normal SPECT MPI had obstructive CAD on CCTA.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0003319711415392">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0003319711415392">3</xref>
</sup> In fact, 8% of the patients were identified with total or subtotal occlusions.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0003319711415392">1</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>Based on our results, we found that the majority of patients with obstructive CAD had single-vessel CAD (45%) involving the left anterior descending artery. Similarly, van Werkhoven et al reported that 46% of patients with normal MPI had 1-vessel obstructive CAD.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0003319711415392">16</xref>
</sup> In our study, we identified 18 patients (18 of 42, 43%) with obstructive CAD considered “high risk” (left main artery disease, 3-vessel CAD, or 2-vessel disease including the proximal LAD) despite normal MPI (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0003319711415392">Table 2</xref>). In comparison, van Werkhoven et al reported that 18.2% of patients with normal MPI and obstructive CAD had either left main or severe 3-vessel CAD.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0003319711415392">16</xref>
</sup> Despite the potentially complementary role of MPI (a physiologic study) and CCTA (an anatomical study), this study raises controversy over the clinical and prognostic implications of a normal MPI with obstructive CAD on CCTA. Shaw et al provided a review of a number of studies identifying the prognostic value of normal or low risk MPI findings. She concluded that there is a 0.6% annualized risk of cardiac events and mortality in patients with intermediate-risk patients with normal perfusion findings.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0003319711415392">17</xref>
</sup> Conversely, 2 published studies have demonstrated that patients with obstructive CAD identified by CCTA constitute a high cardiac event rate and all-cause mortality.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0003319711415392">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0003319711415392">19</xref>
</sup> Pundziute et al reported that increasing number of vessel segments with obstructive CAD on CCTA predicted higher cardiac events and mortality.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0003319711415392">18</xref>
</sup> Similarly, Min et al found that patients with an increasing number of vessels with ≥50% and ≥70% stenosis on CCTA constituted higher overall mortality.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0003319711415392">19</xref>
</sup> To reconcile the apparent prognostic differences between normal MPI and obstructive CAD on CCTA, a future study to follow the prognostic outcomes of our cohort may be warranted.</p>
<p>Based on a univariable analysis, we found that traditional cardiovascular risk factors, including advanced age (≥65 years), hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and dyslipidemia were significant predictors of obstructive CAD on CCTA in patients with normal SPECT MPI studies (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0003319711415392">Table 3</xref>). None of these individual risk factors were significant predictors after multivariable analysis. However, incorporating these risk factors into a FRS, increased Framingham risk (10%, 10-year CHD risk) was highly associated with obstructive CAD (&gt;50% stenosis) after both univariable and multivariable analyses (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0003319711415392">Tables 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0003319711415392">3</xref>). Based on the Framingham study, a 10% to 20% CHD risk constitutes moderate risk.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0003319711415392">4</xref>
</sup> According to the published CCTA appropriateness criteria, symptomatic patients with moderate CHD risk have the greatest benefit from CCTA.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0003319711415392">20</xref>
</sup> In our study, patients with normal SPECT MPI results and nonobstructive CAD on CCTA had low FRS (6.0%, 10-year CHD risk; <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0003319711415392">Table 1</xref>). Based on the CCTA appropriateness criteria, asymptomatic patients with low CHD risk (&lt;10%) are considered inappropriate candidates for CTA.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0003319711415392">18</xref>
</sup> Even indications for CTA in low CHD risk patients with acute chest pain are considered uncertain.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0003319711415392">20</xref>
</sup> In our study, there was a greater probability for obstructive CAD with higher FRS. In fact, a Framingham risk ≥10% compared to &lt;10% constituted a 13 times higher odds of having obstructive CAD on CTA despite a normal SPECT MPI (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0003319711415392">Table 3</xref>). Although FRS has been used to predict 10-year CHD risk in asymptomatic patients, Hadamitzky et al compared cardiac event rates in symptomatic patients based on Framingham risk score to findings of obstructive CAD (&gt;50% stenosis) on CCTA. Interestingly, the study found that results from CCTA were more predictive of cardiac event rates than the Framingham risk calculation.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0003319711415392">5</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>In addition to Framingham risk, elevated CACS (&gt;100 AU) were significantly associated with obstructive CAD on CTA (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0003319711415392">Table 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0003319711415392">3</xref>). Similar observations were described by Schepis et al in which a CACS cutoff of &gt;709 AU was highly predictive of significant CAD (&gt;50% stenosis on coronary angiography) that was not detected by MPI.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0003319711415392">21</xref>
</sup> Almeda et al reported that coronary calcium score ≥1000 AU was associated with coronary stenosis ≥50% on CCTA.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0003319711415392">22</xref>
</sup> In our study, patients with obstructive coronary disease (&gt;50% stenosis) on CCTA had a higher median CACS compared to patients with nonobstructive CAD (288.0 [429.0] AU vs. 0.0 [14.0] AU, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001, respectively; (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0003319711415392">Table 1</xref>). In our analysis, we observed that there was a greater probability for obstructive CAD with higher CACS. Patients with CACS &gt;100 AU compared to ≤100 AU had a 98 times higher odds of having obstructive CAD on CTA despite normal SPECT MPI (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0003319711415392">Table 3</xref>). Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA) demonstrated that patients with CACS &gt;100 AU were at a 2 to 5 times higher risk of having cardiovascular event, after taking into account the FRS.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0003319711415392">8</xref>
</sup> Nasir et al discovered that live expectancy declined 2.0 to 5.9 years for 40-year-old non-Hispanic whites if they had CACS &gt;100 AU.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0003319711415392">9</xref>
</sup> By combining FRS and CACS, we observed that 100% of patients with both FRS ≥10% and CACS &gt;100 AU had obstructive CAD (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0003319711415392">Table 4</xref>). Conversely, only 4.2% of patients with low FRS (&lt;10%) and low CACS (≤100 AU) had obstructive CAD (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0003319711415392">Table 4</xref>). Thus, FRS and CACS could potentially stratify those who may or may not benefit from further testing for obstructive CAD (such as CCTA or cardiac catheterization) after a normal stress MPI.</p>
<p>Important limitations of our study deserve consideration. First, the number of patients in our cohort was small which could potentially affect the analyses from our study. Thus, further studies may be warranted to validate our initial observations. Since all patients completed their SPECT studies prior to their CCTA, there may be an inherent referral bias with our study. Since this was a retrospective study, we could not control for the manner and timing in which patients were referred for their respective imaging studies. Thus, additional randomized, prospective studies may be necessary to support our findings. Lastly, as discussed above, we did not study outcomes (cardiac event rates, invasive cardiac procedures, and interventions) from our cohort; thus, the clinical significance of patients with normal MPI but obstructive CAD on CCTA may need to be investigated in a future prospective study. Perhaps, a subgroup analysis from the PROMISE (PROspective Multicenter Imaging Study for Evaluation of Chest Pain) trial, a study investigating the outcomes from an initial CCTA versus functional stress testing (including MPI) strategy, may identify the outcomes of patients who have both obstructive CAD on CTA and normal MPIs. This study was funded by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute in October 2009 and will have an average follow-up of 2.5 years.<sup>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Based on our study, increased FRS and elevated CACS are highly associated with obstructive CAD (&gt;50% stenosis), despite normal SPECT MPI results. Thus, symptomatic patients with at least moderate FRS (≥10%) and or elevated CACS (&gt;100 AU) despite normal MPI may warrant further evaluation and treatment of obstructive CAD. In addition, symptomatic patients with increased FRS and CACS may benefit from an initial strategy of CCTA as compared to stress MPI to identify the presence and severity of CAD.</p>
