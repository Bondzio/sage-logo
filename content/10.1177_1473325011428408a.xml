<p><bold>‘VARIATIONS ON A THEME: EXPLORING THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN RESEARCH, KNOWLEDGE AND PRACTICE’</bold></p>
<sec id="sec1-1473325011428408a" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title>
<p>The relationship between research, knowledge and practice became a significant issue in social work over the last two decades. Although arguably a perennial concern, its rise to prominence reflects very particular concerns regarding the robustness of social work’s knowledge base following high profile service ‘failures’. Social work has sought to address such concerns principally via the vehicle of ‘evidence based’ practice. As readers will know, this has provoked controversy, and polarized ‘camps’ have developed on the vexed issue of how best to generate knowledge for practice, which simplistically but usefully can be characterized as ‘scientific’ and ‘artistic’. Positions within this debate parallel positions within the social sciences more generally regarding the nature of knowledge and how we might know, with affiliations to particular paradigmatic assumptions. The various ‘affinities and propensities’ – positivism, constructivism, realism, critical theory – within this debate are well established, and for many, incommensurate. It is perhaps because of the seemingly irresolvable nature of intra-disciplinary debate that governments have been attracted to evidence based approaches which claim the capacity to improve practice quality via the application of knowledge hierarchies, and invested accordingly.</p>
<p>At the same time, less prominent social work research has continued to develop largely independently of large scale initiatives. The focus here has been varied, but includes research as a means of answering questions and solving problems within social work agencies and evaluating – loosely – the impact of changes in policy and practice. Quite recently, there have been efforts to shift researchers’ priorities and increase relevance and utility via research which does justice to both practitioner and service user perspectives. ‘Frontline’ and participatory approaches are significant to social research more generally, but arguably especially so in social work research, highlighting both congruence and division between the two major ‘players’ in the social work enterprise.</p>
<p>The editors of the <italic>Sage Handbook of Social Work Research</italic> have set themselves ambitious objectives which are sensitive to this backdrop but not defined by it. They aim to map the ‘state of the art’ in social work research across the globe. Rather than remaining constrained by the contours of the existing landscape, they aim to impact upon this topography, contributing to the future development and practice of social work research in meaningful ways. In order to achieve their aims, the editors have assembled a cast of well known authors, proscribed a relatively tight brief, facilitated novel pairings of writers and utilized a ‘hands on’ approach to editorial issues. In this way, they aim for comprehensiveness, coherence but also novelty. The intended audience is an academic one – researchers, university staff and postgraduate students – and contributions reflect this, generally entailing relatively ‘high level’ debate and discussion. For those seeking practical ‘how to’ guidance, this may be off-putting, but this is explicitly <italic>not</italic> a methods text. Rather, it can be characterized as theoretical and philosophical in its approach. The resultant tome comes garlanded with high profile praise, all of which alerts us that whatever its merits, this handbook represents a substantial and potentially significant endeavour. In this essay, then, my interest is in exploring the extent to which it achieves its stated aims but also the wider, overarching objective of enabling social work as discipline and profession to better address the problems it currently faces. To what extent do the priorities of ‘state of the art’ social work research tally with the challenges faced by contemporary social work?</p>
<p>At the heart of the book are a number of key questions regarding the relationship between knowledge, research and practice. These relate to the role of social work research, how this is shaped by the varied contexts in which it is undertaken, its practice and quality, and its relationship to the broader social work discipline and profession. These are well chosen themes which lend the book a logical structure and flow. They are underpinned by a commitment to pluralism and diversity, perhaps a necessity in a field in which debate can be heated and consensus seems unlikely. There is also an explicit emphasis on philosophical issues, not least the assumptions underpinning the distinctive character of paradigmatic debate as it plays out in social work. The editors characterizes these as ‘unresolved and probably best-left unresolved’ (p. 9). To counter any potential tendencies towards polarized, divisive positions, however, the editors urged contributors to adopt a critical stance in relation to their own positions, urging advocacy but not partisanship. There is a determination that chapters should not follow the well trodden path whereby well known authors restate well established positions for the <italic>n</italic>th time, and novel writing teams have been assembled to this end.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec2-1473325011428408a"><title>Purposes</title>
<p>The book begins by outlining various perspectives on the ‘purposes’ of social work research. In keeping with a pluralist perspective, authors with differing commitments grapple with the issue of what social work research is, its possible distinctiveness, and the ways in which these vary depending on the particular world view of the researcher. This is because, as Parton and Kirk make clear in their chapter on ‘The nature and purposes of social work’, the goals of social work research cannot be disentangled from those of social work more generally, what it seeks to achieve, how it does this and why. As the purposes of social work shift – and due to concerns about risk, they argue, they have – so will the priorities of social work research. However, the changes they highlight – a shift away from relationship based practice to preventative aims and practices which rely on surveillance and control – are seen as detrimental, and so the challenge for both social work and social work research is whether and to what extent to acquiesce to this agenda or instead engage in forms of resistance in which alternative assumptions and methods are privileged. Key here is the potential of the inclusion of service user perspectives. Here then is a commitment to a degree of partisanship, in which the needs of social work clients take centre stage in ways which are downplayed in contemporary policy priorities. Boaz and Blewett, however, in a helpful review of ‘positions’ in social work highlight some of the limitations of approaches to research which are partisan or subjective. They highlight ‘the near hegemony… of emancipatory and transformational approaches to research’ (p. 46) and question the extent to which one-sided representations of what particular approaches entail are likely to better enable social workers to understand the strengths and limitations of knowledge claims derived from different <italic>but not necessarily competing</italic> traditions. Given that we know that practitioners utilize multiple sources of knowledge, the challenge is to synthesize high quality knowledge in a way which has meaning and relevance in agency settings. Other chapters in this section, notably Orme and Briar-Lawson’s chapter on ‘Theory and knowledge about social problems’ step outside of this debate to engage more directly with the issue of the ways in which social work research might be distinctive. From a broadly feminist and participatory perspective they argue that social work research’s position between practice and policy ‘enables it to make a distinctive contribution to developing knowledge about social problems, and thus enhancing policy’ (p. 63). Overall, this section of the handbook serves as a sophisticated primer, ensuring readers are up to speed with the various debates which characterize ‘the paradigm wars’ as they play out in social work.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec3-1473325011428408a"><title>Contexts</title>
<p>Contributors to the second section of the handbook take as their foci the extent to which the ‘contexts’ in which research is undertaken impact upon its character. Context incorporates political, social and ethical dimensions, all of which effects the nature and aims of research practice and the use to which findings may be put. The relationship between research and government in social work is explored by Shaw and Zlotnik, who highlight the ways in which knowledge generated via research is to some extent dependent on the function it serves to government, with implications for priorities, ethics, preferred designs and methods and how knowledge may be used. The primacy attached to evaluation and generating evidence of effectiveness which has characterized governmental emphasis for the last twenty years may have sidelined those alternative (often qualitative) studies which privilege depth rather than breadth, but in itself should not be regarded as problematic, because evaluation itself is a plural field in which a diversity of perspectives ensure that studies are not necessarily limited by the parameters of policy relevant work. Similarly, in an illuminating discussion of the ways in which politics and values impact on the conduct and interpretation of social work research, Soydan is optimistic that the centrality of emancipatory aims to a social justice orientation should not be taken to devalue research findings. Instead, he suggests that the application of both ‘extra-scientific and intra-scientific norms and criteria’ (p. 147) can minimize concerns that the political and value commitments of standpoint researchers are necessarily problematic. This is because scientists engage in debate ‘often or exclusively as human beings… Their activities are based on values, ethics or politics that they are committed to and advocate’ (p. 147). Hugman, meanwhile, in his chapter on ethics takes the relatively strong position that ‘research in social work that does not potentially benefit service users in some way… does not accord with the profession’s ethics more generally’ (p. 163). Some may find this argument unconvincing, but the journey – via (amongst others) Marx, Weber and Habermas – is an invigorating one. There are clear connections, then, between the purpose of social work research and the use to which knowledge is put. Ruckdeschel and Chambon’s chapter on ‘The uses of social work research’ therefore supplements discussion of knowledge development strategies with a review of models of utilization, varieties of knowledge, and patterns of dissemination, with a particular emphasis on developments in information technology and new media. They suggest that in a fast moving context, traditional ways of accessing and using knowledge have been superceded, and consequently the assumptions underpinning the evidence based practice model rendered problematic. The notion of ‘research minded practice’ is therefore more suited to fluid environments in which the voices of a wider array of stakeholders have the opportunity to flourish and be heard. The issue of ‘voice’ is also a theme in the concluding chapter of the section, in which Ian Shaw explores the ways in which spatial and temporal contexts impact on research. This discussion draws on the historical, via the under-explored relationship between sociology and social work research in the work of the original ‘Chicago school’, as well as the contemporary via delineation of the potential that a cultural geography of networks might contribute to innovative methodological and theoretical developments as well as novel understandings of how and where practice is undertaken and with what effects. Cumulatively, this section demonstrates that differences of perspective regarding nature and purpose are complicated further by the variety of contexts in which researchers go about their business. Nevertheless, this complexity can be constructive where there is consensus regarding the need for, on the one hand, recognition that context matters, but on the other that it does not determine, and that this is best achieved via inter-disciplinary approaches which transcends differences within social work research.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec4-1473325011428408a"><title>Practice</title>
<p>The third section of the Handbook focuses on the ‘practice’ of social work research, In line with the theoretical rather than methodological focus of the book, there is no particular focus on methods that social work researchers might use, but rather extended discussion of the links between method and standpoint, and the strengths and limitations of maintaining these linkages versus the less rigid associations which are evident when mixed methods are utilized. Contributors approach these issues from a variety of perspectives. Powell and Ramos’ chapter on ‘The practice of social work research’ is an introductory overview which approaches the issue of diverse positions via exploration of the ways in which researchers deal with the tensions between the various stakeholders in social work research. They suggest that researchers are obliged to incorporate multiple perspectives, and this – along with practice relevance and engagement with service users – is what makes social work research distinctive. They are also strong, perhaps uncritical, advocates of reflexivity as a bridge between participative research and emancipatory practice, suggesting that methodological choices need to incorporate consideration of the extent to which they promote engagement with the diversity of stakeholder viewpoints. Issues of research logic and quality are at the heart of the subsequent essay by Shaw. Claims that social work research has a scientific character are scrutinized via engagement with both social studies of scientific practice and the evaluation literature, while the distinctiveness of social work research is regarded sceptically: ‘the right question to ask is not what makes social work research distinctive, but what might make it distinctively good’ (p. 259). Rather than emphasizing those qualities which have become orthodox – reflexivity, participation – Shaw suggests that ‘inner’ and ‘outer’ science criteria need to be integrated if social work is to satisfy the requirements of its diversity of stakeholders. Pitching quality criteria at ‘a middle range of generality’ offers potential in ‘maximizing agreement between diverse epistemological positions while not requiring a unitary consensus’ (p. 247). It is acknowledged that such a position is likely to be controversial, especially to those whose existing commitments are strong, and it is debatable whether the authors of subsequent chapters necessarily share this agenda. In their chapter on ‘Evidence and practice’ McDonald and Popay are clearly comfortable with the notion of ‘hierarchies of knowledge’. However, they do not dismiss the utility of ‘lower ranking’ methods in particular circumstances, emphasizing the capacity of evaluation to produce revealing knowledge about practice without necessarily satisfying criteria of rigour or generalizability. From a very different perspective, in their chapter on ‘Methods for understanding learning and social justice’ Lavoie, MacDonald and Whitmore advocate participatory approaches to research as prerequisites for generating knowledge which will achieve emancipatory aims. They regard democratization of the knowledge production process as an essential vehicle for bringing to the fore the views and perspectives of categories of people whose voices are rarely heard and thus contributing to empowerment. The emphasis here is not just on the role that participatory research might play in enhancing understanding but its potential to have effect through change-orientated action. Although the potential for particular contexts to limit the opportunities for democratization are acknowledged, the authors are confident that skilled and committed social work researchers are well placed to overcome such obstacles.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec5-1473325011428408a"><title>Domains</title>
<p>The final section focuses on the various ‘domains’ of social work and the role that research plays in influencing how particular problems are understood and services delivered. Familiar areas of practice are addressed, as well as more novel exploration of what is encompassed in discussion of the intersection between practice and its setting. Thus, Linda Briskman’s chapter on ‘Nation’ emphasizes – from a critical perspective – the implications of changing understandings of citizenship within a fluid, globalized world for marginalized populations in particular, and the knock-on effect of geopolitical changes for social work agencies. Key here is a commitment to ensuring that social work researchers challenge policy developments they regard as incompatible with the profession’s humane traditions, especially in areas of practice entailing work with displaced populations, asylum seekers, indigenous populations and in development work. Here, social work research is conceived of as a moral and political activity in which concerns with rigour and objectivity are of little significance compared to the imperative to act to challenge dominant relations of power. Perhaps unsurprisingly, evidence based approaches are implicated in structures of oppression and harmful practice which do not do justice to lived realities of those experiencing exclusion and discrimination. The implicit suggestion is that much practice and research is oppressive, with ‘politicized groups… intentionally shut out from decision making’ (p. 353). The implication for social work research is that it should seek to ‘critically interrogate pervading ideologies in order to move policy, political consciousness and practice into the ethical realm’ (p. 355). Similarly, Staller and Mafile’o’s chapter on ‘Community’ takes the traditional focus of some social work practice on communities rather than individuals as a basis for broadening the focus of social work research to incorporate diverse understandings of community in a changing world. Again, there is emphasis on the potential for standpoint approaches to subvert both individualized and western assumptions within research processes and so contribute to countering oppression. Subsequent chapters cover more familiar ‘domains’, focusing on particular social work specialisms – children and families, health, disability, mental health, aging and work with offenders. In doing so they emphasize the extent to which social work research is truly multi-disciplinary in its orientations and affiliations. Common themes include effectiveness research, the impact of service user perspectives, tensions between evidence based and participatory approaches, and novel developments which suggest that each of these domains is characterized by lively debate and discussion regarding how best to generate knowledge for practice so as to enable the ongoing furtherance of practice objectives.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec6-1473325011428408a"><title>Strengths</title>
<p>Certain chapters stood out for me, either because they seemed to be saying something distinctive, or were approaching familiar themes in novel ways. Gredig and Marsh provide an illuminating review of various models via which the relationship between research and intervention might be understood, including ‘reflective professionalism’ in which ‘science’ (empirical knowledge) and ‘art’ (interpretation) form ‘hybrids’ which hold out promise of enhanced integration. Though I disagree with the presumptions and conclusions of Bob Pease’s chapter on ‘Challenging the dominant paradigm’, it is nevertheless an extremely insightful overview of certain aspects of the paradigm wars in social work, which takes seriously the editor’s request that writers acknowledge the veracity of alternative positions even though they might not agree with them. Steve Trevillion’s reversal of the assumptions behind drives to ensure research informs practice represents an innovative exploration of an underdeveloped area. The suggestion here is that we need to know much more about how practice informs research if we are to develop successful models of research informed practice. Conceived of in this way, and in a context which is ‘complex… and conflict ridden’ (p. 165) a case is made for why the relationship between knowledge, research and practice cannot be linear but must be reciprocal. Jane Gilgun’s overview of methods, meanwhile, is comprehensive but concise in its elaboration of the strengths and limitations of various approaches to knowledge and theory generation. She argues that ‘methodological pluralism is key to social work’s effective response to demands for many types of knowledge’ (p. 284). Similarly, Greene, Sommerfeld and Haight give a reasoned case for the necessity of a mixed method approach in generating knowledge. They argue that understanding the complexity of social work practice requires the use of the ‘full social scientific methodological repertoire’ (p. 316). They draw on their own research to demonstrate that mixed methods can generate a depth of understanding which singular approaches cannot. Whereas for some, advocates of mixed methods are naive in their disregard for the significance of affiliations between research philosophy and method, here, it is paradigmatic ‘integrity’ which is problematic, because no one world view will do justice to ‘the multitude of human experiences and the diversity of human values and aspirations’ (p. 331). Of the chapters on specific domains, meanwhile, Bywaters and Ungar’s chapter on health and well-being was something of a revelation. Though much of the ground that they cover is familiar, given their emphasis on social determinants of experience, tensions with more ‘traditional’ models, and the significance of ‘lived reality’, nevertheless. I found their exposition of the ways in which research has and has not informed practice informative and nuanced. The chapter on social work in criminal justice, meanwhile, by McNeill, Bracken and Clarke is as good an overview of the ways in which the politics of social research have played out over the last few decades in this particular domain of practice that I have come across.</p>
<p>It is also worth highlighting the strength of the contributions made by the editors in their own section essays, which seek to synthesize themes and perspectives in productive ways. The pluralist principles which underpin the project as a whole have limitations, but on balance are key to holding together an area of practice as diverse as social work research, and go some way to ensuring the coherence of the volume. This is especially evident in the opening chapter, which spells out the basis for this approach by reference to the need to construct a ‘coalition’ in social work research, whereby debate and discussion are privileged ahead of polarized polemic. In the final chapter on ‘Challenges and directions’, the productive potential of the diversity of perspectives within social work research is highlighted. Differences can either be regarded as insurmountable obstacles to consensus or as the basis for productive communication and interchange of ideas. This is important because the challenges faced by social work are best addressed by a united rather than divided profession. This is perhaps partly what the editors have in mind when they suggest they hope their efforts have impact on the future of social work research. As Shaw puts it ‘jaw-jaw is better than war-war’ (p. 262). The challenges which social work research will face in the future – to do with its purpose, methods, priorities, quality, credibility and impact – cannot be separated from those which social work practice also faces.</p>
<p>Overall, then, the <italic>Handbook</italic> is undoubtedly a great success. It represents a state-of-the-art mapping of the parameters of social work research. Both structure and content lend themselves to what will certainly come to be regarded as a benchmark statement within the field. Of course, it is not beyond criticism and the diversity of positions and perspectives covered mean that undoubtedly there will be much that individual readers will take issue with. More generally, its aims of comprehensiveness and cohesiveness render it vulnerable where there are gaps, however small. There are also questions regarding the extent to which it fulfils unstated aims which nevertheless might be reasonable expectations of a text such as this.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec7-1473325011428408a"><title>Limitations</title>
<p>Despite the stated commitment to comprehensiveness, it is evident in the <italic>Handbook</italic> that there is a very real emphasis on the merits of broadly defined qualitative approaches to social work research. There are of course good reasons why this might be appropriate – as a corrective to the presumed dominance of quantitative approaches and the known commitments of the editors, for example. However, it is notable that although there are excellent contributions regarding the significance of mixed methods, there are no standalone chapters which make the case for quantitative approaches in themselves. Within the context of the overall aims of the text, this seems a little one-sided. Of course, arguably the merits of quantitative approaches are embedded in those chapters which seek to state the advantages of evidence based approaches. But empiricism is not the same as quantification, and there are notable authors who have drawn our attention to the ways in which we can enhance understanding via quantitative data, in both social work and the social sciences more generally. For some, their absence will be taken as confirmation of the divisions within social work research. It is also notable that for a text in which debate regarding the merits of paradigmatic affiliation is so central, there is a lack of attention to the claims regarding the potential merits of realism as a framework for understanding and undertaking social work. Similarly, the burgeoning and reinvigorating impact of complexity thinking on debates concerning knowledge and knowing seems to have been bypassed altogether.</p>
<p>There is also, despite the aims of the editors, some retreading of old ground by authors, with no notable volte-faces (though Macdonald and Popay’s acknowledgment that ‘Without awareness of “the knowing subject”… social work “clients” are too easily reduced to unthinking bearers of deficits and risks’ (p. 266) may confound those who wish to pigeonhole particular authors according to reputation). Pease, for example, in making the case for critical theory informed social work research, suggests that those who advocate evidence based approaches are unable to grasp the merits of constructivism, critical theory and postmodernism but then demonstrates similar difficulties appreciating the merits of empirically based practice! Similarly, in their chapter on disability French and Swain are clear that they have little time or appreciation for those who hold different views to themselves, querying the extent to which social workers that do not practice according to the principles which they proscribe can genuinely contribute to improving the lives of disabled people. It is also worth mentioning that as part of its commitment to comprehensiveness, the book’s ambitions are global, but in reality there are few contributions from eastern Europe, south America, Asia or Africa. This, perhaps, is because as Shaw and Zlotnik put it, in these areas qualitative social work research in particular is ‘parlous or at best a noisy infant’ (p. 122). Nevertheless, even if not fully comprehensive in this regard, the <italic>Handbook</italic> is much more international than ‘the norm’ and the editors deserve credit for their efforts.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec8-1473325011428408a" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title>
<p>These limitations are relatively minor. There are, however, two related issues which require elaboration. These relate to the commitment to pluralism which underpins the project as a whole, and to the nature and function of social work research. The editors make much of their commitment to pluralism. There are of course questions regarding the point at which pluralism – respect for the diversity of viewpoints about a particular issue – shades into relativism with regard to the issues and problems which define and divide social work and social work research. Here, however, the problem has the opposite character. The editors’ claim to ‘distance ourselves from the soft relativism that would allow all ideologies an equal chance of expression’ (p. 12) but this ‘position’ appears to have manifested in ways which, to my mind, are potentially counter-productive. This is particularly the case when we consider the issue of the nature and purposes of social work research. Unfortunately, there is a relative lack of attention to issues arising from involuntary practice in the <italic>Handbook</italic>. This is more significant than it might initially appear. In certain jurisdictions, the difficulties which social work faces in terms of legitimacy and trust are directly related to questions that have been asked about the ability of practitioners to effectively ensure that the harm involuntary service users may cause – to children in child protection settings, to carers, self or others in mental health, and to the public at large in social work with offenders – is prevented or minimized. One of, if not <italic>the</italic> key challenge that social work faces is the ongoing development of both a knowledge base and strategy which will enable it to meet these demands. Some regard these as unrealistic, while others regard such developments as distancing social work from its client-centred, humanistic roots. However, although more generally there is a lack of consensus regarding the nature and function of social work (which Shaw [p. 217]) characterizes as ‘slippery’, within the <italic>Handbook</italic> there is a notable clustering of views regarding the function of practice, which is assumed to be a vehicle for individual emancipation and thus social justice. There is also an evident tendency for contributors to characterize many contemporary developments as antithetical to the traditional value base of practice and as a threat to how social work ought to be understood and undertaken. Unsurprisingly, this is most apparent in those chapters which are explicit in their commitment to critical traditions, but is arguably evident in both the framework of the book as a whole and very many of its chapters. This consensus could be taken as testament to the coherence of the text, but it raises a question mark over the extent to which the book actually does justice to the plurality of positions which characterize contested debates about the nature and purpose of social work practice and research. It reflects the overwhelmingly dominant ‘leanings’ of the majority of authors, who are generally sceptical towards the claims and methods of evidence based practice, committed to the merits of qualitative approaches, and convinced by the notion of social work research as a value driven, reflexive endeavour in which the demands of neutrality and objectivity are less important than partisanship and subjectivity. That is well and good, but there are alternative perspectives which are not represented here. My own view is that although historically, partisan positioning has served social work well, at this juncture it is not helpful in enabling the profession to deal with the threats it faces. If this is true for social work, it is doubly so for social work research which has the added burden of satisfying scientific standards as well as political expectations. The limitations of such an approach to social work research reflect the limitations of a particular ‘take’ on the nature of social work, outlined in the opening chapter by Parton and Kirk, in which social work is aligned wholly with humanistic, emancipatory concerns. There is no space here for social work as much other than a ‘caring’ activity, and thus in the questions it chooses, the methods it uses and the objectives it pursues, little likelihood that social work research will effectively address the pressing contemporary challenge to address the legitimacy gap which undermines trust in social work as both discipline and profession.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec9-1473325011428408a" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Notwithstanding these concerns, the editors of the <italic>Handbook</italic> have undoubtedly fulfilled their ambitions by producing what by any standards is a benchmark text which is well worth the investment – time, effort, money (!) – entailed in getting to grips with the stimulating and rewarding debates within. It is hard to envisage how this undertaking could have been more impressive without the project as a whole transmuting into something altogether different. Its weaknesses – such as they are – reflect the high bar the editors set in their stated ambitions of comprehensiveness and cohesiveness – tricky to achieve in a discipline characterized by contestation – and the weaknesses in social work research itself. Only time will tell whether it fulfils its aim of not only mapping but also shaping the future topography of social work research, but all the signs are that it is headed in the right direction. Perhaps the major way that the book will meet this ambition is that, to my mind, immersion in the diverse perspectives represented within the book cannot help but contribute to some degree of respectful rapprochement between competing camps. There is scope for the nature of the interaction between research, knowledge and practice to be a more constructive and meaningful one than has sometimes been the case, and this <italic>Handbook</italic> is the best effort yet to explain how this might be achieved. Consensus may be elusive in both social work and social work research, but a coalition built around the ‘mid range generality’ that the editors advocate would be well placed to position both discipline and profession to face the challenges that the future undoubtedly holds.</p>
