<abstract>
<p>Thyroid hormones (THs) are essential for growth and development of the kidney. Also TH influences glomerular filtration and tubular functions. Hypothyroidism negative influences kidney function indirectly by affecting the cardiovascular system and the renal blood flow, and directly by affecting glomerular filtration, tubular functions and the structure of the kidney. The purpose of this study was to evaluate changes in biochemical markers, oxidative stress parameter and histological changes in kidney of hypothyroid rats before and after treatment with folic acid. Hypothyroidism was induced for 6 weeks by the administration of propylthiouracil in drinking water. Urea and creatinine were measured to evaluate the changes in kidney function. Also malondialdehyde, nitrite, nitrate and other oxidative stress parameter were measured in serum and kidney tissue as indicators of oxidative damage. Kidney function and oxidative stress parameters in hypothyroid rats were significantly changed compared to those in control rats. Treatment with folic acid helps in improving the adverse effect of hypothyroidism; the histological study also confirms this finding.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Thyroid hormone (TH) is necessary for growth and development of the kidney and for the maintenance of water and electrolyte homeostasis. Conversely, the kidney is a target organ for some of the actions of iodothyronines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0748233711432577">Iglesias and Díez, 2009</xref>). On the other hand, kidney is involved in the metabolism and elimination of TH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0748233711432577">Den Hollander et al., 2005</xref>). Hypothyroidism is a very common clinical disorder that is associated with abnormalities in many organs, including the kidney. Kidney dysfunction seems to be more related with the decline in TH levels rather than with thyroid autoimmunity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0748233711432577">Suher et al., 2005</xref>). Among the mechanisms involved in hypothyroidism-associated kidney derangements are direct effects of TH on the cardiovascular system (increased peripheral resistance and reduction in myocardial contractility and stroke volume) and metabolism (hyperlipidaemia) and indirect effects through paracrine or endocrine mediators, such as insulin-like growth factor type 1 and vascular endothelial growth factor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0748233711432577">Elgadi et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0748233711432577">Nikolaeva and Pimenov, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0748233711432577">Vargas et al., 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>Hypothyroidism has been reported to cause mild hyperhomocysteinaemia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0748233711432577">Ingenbleek et al., 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0748233711432577">Parrot-Roulaud et al., 1995</xref>). Possible mechanisms for changes in homocysteine (Hcy) metabolism include changes in the activity or concentration of enzymes necessary for metabolism of Hcy. An alternative explanation for hyperhomocysteinaemia occurring in a state of hypothyroidism was reduction in glomerular filtration rate which is linked to impaired renal Hcy clearance and hyperhomocysteinaemia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0748233711432577">Turhan et al., 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>Folic acid, also known generically as folate is a member of the B-complex family of vitamins, works in concert with vitamin B12. Folic acid functions primarily as a methyl-group donor involved in many important body processes, including DNA synthesis. Therapeutically, folic acid is instrumental in reducing Hcy levels.</p>
<p>Moreover, this vitamin also has antioxidant properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0748233711432577">Au-Yeung et al., 2006</xref>). The aim of this work is to study the effect of hypothyroidism on kidney, total plasma Hcy level and oxidative stress parameters, which aid in assessing the possible effect of folic acid in reducing these changes.</p>

<title>Materials and methods</title>
<p>The experiments were performed on 50 male albino rats (<italic>Rattus norvigicus</italic>) weighing 120 ± 10 g and of 6–7 weeks of age. The rats were kept in the laboratory for 1 week before the experimental work and maintained on a standard diet and water available <italic>ad libitum</italic>. The temperature in the animal room was maintained at 23 ± 2°C with a relative humidity of 55 ± 5%. Light was on a 12:12-h light–dark cycle. The experimental protocol was approved by Local Ethics Committee and Animals Research. The rats were randomly and equally divided into 5 groups (10 animals each).</p>
<list list-type="simple">
<list-item>
<p>Group 1: (G<sub>1</sub>) Control group in which rats never received any treatment.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Group 2: (G<sub>2</sub>) Folic acid group in which rats received clear water for 2 weeks followed by folic acid (El Nasr Pharmaceutical Chemicals Co.; 0.011 μmol/g of body weight/day) for 4 weeks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0748233711432577">Matte et al., 2007</xref>).</p>
</list-item>

<list-item>
<p>Group 4: (G<sub>4</sub>) Cotreatment group in which rats received 0.05% PTU in drinking water and folic acid simultaneously according to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0748233711432577">Matte et al. (2007)</xref>. Rats received PTU for 6 weeks as in hypothyroid rat group. However, folic acid was administered orally for 4 weeks (from 2nd week to 6th week) after evidence of hypothyroidism had been established at the end of the second week.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Group 5: (G<sub>5</sub>) Posttreatment group in which rats received 0.05% PTU in drinking water for 6 weeks as in hypothyroid rat group. Additionally, folic acid was administered for another 4 weeks (from 7th week to 10th week) while PTU was withdrawn after the 6th week to return to the euthyroid state.</p>
</list-item>
</list>
<p>During the course of treatment, daily fluid consumption, body weight gain and feed consumption were recorded periodically. At the end of the experimental period, rats were euthanized. Blood samples were individually collected from each rat in heparinized and nonheparinized glass tubes to estimate some parameters in plasma and serum. Also both kidneys were quickly removed and weighed after the removal of the surrounding connective tissues carefully and washed in saline, a part of tissue was homogenized for assessment of biochemical parameters and other part used for histological study.</p>

<p>The kidney was then immediately removed, sliced sagitally and fixed in 10% neutral-buffered formalin for 24 h. The specimens were then dehydrated, cleared and embedded in paraffin. Serial sections of 5-μm thick were cut by means of rotary microtome (Litz, Wetzlar, Germany). Sections were processed for haematoxylin and eosin staining (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0748233711432577">Bancroft and Cook, 1994</xref>). All stained slides were viewed using Olympus microscope and images were captured by a digital camera (Cannon 620).

<p>Histological examination of the kidney of control rat revealed entirely normal structures of the renal cortex which comprised renal corpuscles, proximal and distal convoluted tubules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0748233711432577">Figure 1(a)</xref>, (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0748233711432577">b</xref>) and (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0748233711432577">d</xref>)). Kidney sections of folic acid groups showed normal histological structures of the glomeruli, mesangial cells, glomerular basement membrane, capsular space, proximal convoluted tubules and distal convoluted tubules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0748233711432577">Figure 1(c)</xref>). Kidney of hypothyroid rats showed variable pathological changes in glomeruli and some parts of the urinary tubules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0748233711432577">Figure 2(a) to (c)</xref>).

Some glomeruli seemed to have lost their attachments and mesangial stroma and others were atrophied with dilatation in the subcapsular space (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0748233711432577">Figure 2(c)</xref>). The tubular epithelia were exfoliated from their underlying basement membrane and their lining cells exhibited cytoplasmic vacuolation and pyknotic nuclei (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0748233711432577">Figure 2(a)</xref>). Examination of the kidney sections of cotreated hypothyroid rat with folic acid revealed congestion of renal blood vessels and degeneration of some tubules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0748233711432577">Figure 2(d) and (e)</xref>).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The present study was designed to investigate the effect of hypothyroidism on rat kidney structure and functions and the possible ameliorating effect of folic acid in treatment. In order to achieve this target we made a hypothyroid state using a reversible goitrogen (PTU) that was known to decrease the conversion of peripheral T<sub>4</sub> to T<sub>3</sub> and thereby reduce serum T<sub>3</sub> concentration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0748233711432577">Gilbert and Paczkowski, 2003</xref>). Hypothyroid state was documented by changes in T<sub>3</sub> and TSH.</p>
<p>The overall changes in the THs profile reflects the observed decline in body weight gain as well as the relative weight of kidney in hypothyroid rats. The decrease in body weight gain and RKW are associated with a reduction in food and fluid consumption in groups of hypothyroidism. These findings are compatible with the results of other studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0748233711432577">López-Torres et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0748233711432577">Mahfoud et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0748233711432577">Tousson et al., 2011a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0748233711432577">b</xref>).</p>
<p>Kidney is a major target organ for TH with important biological and medical implications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0748233711432577">Daminet et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0748233711432577">Gommeren et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0748233711432577">Van Hoek et al., 2008</xref>). In addition, the thyroidal status influences kidney function both during embryonic development and in the mature functioning of the kidney, directly by affecting glomerular function, the tubular secretory and absorptive capacities, electrolyte pumps and kidney structure and indirectly by affecting the cardiovascular system through its influence on renal blood flow which decreases in hypothyroidism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0748233711432577">Den Hollander et al., 2005</xref>). The present data showed that creatinine and urea were significantly increased in hypothyroid rats. Also postadministration of folic acid to hypothyroid rats resulted in marked decrease in creatinine and urea compared to hypothyroid rats. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0748233711432577">Ingbar and Braverman (1986)</xref> reported that creatinine and urea are influenced by THs by their action on muscle, kidney, liver and peripheral protein metabolism.</p>
<p>Folic acid exerts an important role over Hcy catabolism by methyl group donation in remethylation pathway to methionine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0748233711432577">Brosnan et al., 2004</xref>). In the present study serum Hcy in hypothyroid rats were significantly higher than those found in the control, also Hcy in hypothyroid rats treated with folic acid during and after inducing hypothyroidism were insignificantly lower than those found in the hypothyroid rats. This finding is in line with that of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0748233711432577">Diekman et al. (2001)</xref> who reported that plasma Hcy concentrations increased in hypothyroidism and decreased in hyperthyroidism; the mechanism of thyroid-induced changes in Hcy metabolism is currently unknown. And with that <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0748233711432577">Adrees et al. (2009)</xref> observed that total Hcy levels were elevated in patients with subclinical and overt hypothyroidism. The explanation of this effect could be attributed to the reduced glomerular filtration rate in hypothyroidism which is linked to impaired renal Hcy clearance and hyperhomocysteinaemia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0748233711432577">Turhan et al., 2008</xref>). Alternatively, changes in the concentrations or biologic activity of vitamin B12 or B6 and/or folate may occur in response to altered thyroid homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0748233711432577">Parameswaran Nair et al., 1994</xref>).</p>
<p>THs regulate protein and antioxidant enzyme synthesis and degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0748233711432577">Varghese et al., 2001</xref>). The current study showed that MDA were increased in plasma and in kidney of hypothyroid rats and treatment with folic acid decrease the MDA level as folic has scavenging character.</p>
<p>The present study showed that plasma total NO metabolites (NO<sub>2</sub> + NO<sub>3</sub> or NO<italic>
<sub>x</sub>
</italic>) were significantly higher in the hypothyroid group when compared to the control. This matches with the finding of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0748233711432577">Virdis et al. (2009)</xref>. The increase in NO metabolites reflects the oxidative stress associated with hypothyroidism. On the other hand, significant decrease in total NO<italic>
<sub>x</sub>
</italic> in treatment with folic acid and posttreatment groups was observed when compared to the hypothyroid group. This finding can be explained by the ability of 5-methyltetrahydrofolate, the circulating form of folic acid, in preventing peroxynitrite-mediated tetrahydrobiopterin oxidation and improving endothelial nitric oxide synthase coupling and dimerization. It is due to its ability to increase endothelial tetrahydrobiopterin bioavailability in vessels through scavenging reactive oxygen species (such as peroxynitrite and superoxide) responsible for its oxidation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0748233711432577">Antoniades et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0748233711432577">Moens et al., 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>The significant decrease in TAC of kidney homogenate in hypothyroid group compared to control group reflects increasing oxidative stress and reduction of antioxidants’ effectiveness with hypothyroidism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0748233711432577">Yilmaz et al., 2003</xref>). The significant increase in TAC of kidney homogenate in cotreatment as compared to hypothyroid group was explained by the role of folic acid in restoring ferric reducing ability of plasma without restoration of euthyroid state as presented here. However, posttreatment kidney homogenates show significant increase in TAC as compared to hypothyroid group, this was explained by the role of folic acid and normal TH. This finding confirms that THs regulate protein and antioxidant enzyme synthesis and degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0748233711432577">Varghese et al., 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>In the present study, PTU was observed to induce variable pathological changes in glomeruli and some parts of the urinary tubules in the kidney of hypothyroid rat revealed. The most severe changes were in the Malpighian corpuscles that lost their characteristic configuration and the renal tubules appeared with wide lumen and degenerated epithelium. Supplementation of folic acid in hypothyroid rats resulted in normal histoarchitecture, including increase in sinusoid spaces. Our results are in agreement with a number of recent studies that provided evidence that hypothyroidism causes an adverse effect on the human health (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0748233711432577">Cano-Europa et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0748233711432577">Tousson et al., 2011b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0748233711432577">Woeber, 2002</xref>). Kidney of cotreated hypothyroid rat with folic acid revealed congestion of renal blood vessels and degeneration of some tubules; while in hypothyroid rats posttreated with folic acid, the kidney showed better organized tubular and glomerular structures with well-established epithelia which resembled that of the control group except mild inflammatory infiltration. The obtained results showed that treatment of hypothyroid rats with folic acid may improve the histopathological and biochemical changes induced in the kidney by PTU.</p>
