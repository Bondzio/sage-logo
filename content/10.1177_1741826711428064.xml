<p><bold>Aim:</bold> Reperfusion therapy in acute myocardial infarction reduces infarct size and increases hospital survival. We investigated whether the benefit of reperfusion therapy for myocardial infarction was sustained long-term and assessed the gain in life expectancy by reperfusion therapy.</p>
<p><bold>Methods and results:</bold> We analysed the outcome of 533 patients (mean age 56 years, 82% men), who were randomized to either reperfusion therapy or conventional therapy during 1980−1985. Median follow up was 27 years (25–30 years). At follow up, 59 patients (22%) of the 269 patients allocated to reperfusion treatment and only 39 patients (15%) of the 264 conventionally treated patients were still alive (<italic>p</italic> = 0.02). The cumulative 10−, 15−, 20−, and 25-year survival rates were 69, 48, 37, and 24% after reperfusion therapy and 59, 38, 27, and 18% in the control group, respectively (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001). Life expectancy of the reperfusion group was 15.6 years vs. 12.5 years in the conventionally treated group (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.02). Myocardial reinfarction and subsequent coronary interventions were more frequent after reperfusion therapy, particularly during the first year. In multivariable analysis, reperfusion therapy was an important independent predictor of lower mortality at long-term follow up. Other independent predictors of mortality were age, impaired left ventricular function, multivessel disease, infarct size, and inability to perform an exercise test at the time of discharge.</p>
<p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> These data confirm that the benefits of early reperfusion therapy for acute myocardial infarction are sustained throughout the lifetime of the patients. More than 3 life years were gained by reperfusion therapy.</p>

<p>For patients with clinical presentation of an acute coronary syndrome within 12 hours after symptom onset and with persistent ST-segment elevation (STEMI), early mechanical or pharmacological reperfusion should be performed.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1741826711428064">1</xref></sup> Primary percutanuous coronary intervention (PCI) is the preferred therapy, whenever it is available within 90−120 min of the first medical contact by an experienced team (24/7).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1741826711428064">2</xref></sup> However, in many countries it is not possible to transfer all STEMI patients in time to a PCI-capable hospital and thrombolytic therapy remains the recommended therapy. Furthermore, a conservative attitude of internists and some cardiologists still prefer to use thrombolysis instead of sending their patients to another hospital with facilities for primary PCI.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1741826711428064">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>The benefit of early reperfusion therapy is well established.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1741826711428064">4</xref></sup> It reduces infarct size, preserves left ventricular function, and improves survival. Approximately 30 early deaths are prevented per 1000 patients. This survival benefit is maintained during the first year and longer follow up.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1741826711428064">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1741826711428064">8</xref></sup> In order to assess the gain of life expectancy by reperfusion therapy more precisely, follow up until end-of-life is necessary. Therefore, we conducted a long-term, almost 30 years, follow up of patients participating in a randomized controlled trial between 1981 and 1985 of reperfusion therapy as compared with conventional therapy by the Interuniversity Cardiology Institute of the Netherlands (ICIN). The aim of this study was to clarify whether the benefit of reperfusion therapy for acute myocardial infarction was sustained 25−30 years after randomization and to assess the gain of life expectancy by reperfusion therapy. Furthermore, we investigated how accurate the initial assessment of the gain of life expectancy was, which was based only on follow up data during the first 12 months.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1741826711428064">9</xref></sup></p>

<sec id="sec2-1741826711428064" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title>
<sec id="sec3-1741826711428064"><title>Study population</title>
<p>From 1981 to 1985, 533 patients in five participating hospitals were randomized to either immediate reperfusion therapy (<italic>n</italic> = 269) or conventional treatment (<italic>n</italic> = 264). The study design and initial results have been reported previously.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1741826711428064">10</xref></sup> Acute coronary angiography was performed in 233 out of 269 patients allocated to reperfusion therapy. If the infarct-related coronary artery appeared to be occluded, streptokinase (250,000 IU) was administered intracoronary. In the last 117 patients, intracoronary administration was preceded by intravenous streptokinase (500,000 U). In 46 patients with severe residual stenosis of the infarct related coronary artery, coronary angioplasty was attempted as part of the recanalization procedure.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1741826711428064">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1741826711428064">11</xref></sup></p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec4-1741826711428064"><title>Follow up</title>
<p>Follow-up vital status was obtained by reviewing the hospital records and from general practitioners and civil registries. Data were collected on death, recurrent myocardial infarction (MI), and coronary revascularization procedures. The diagnosis of recurrent MI was based upon the report of the treating physician and verified from hospital discharge letters. If necessary, patients were contacted by telephone. Follow up was complete in 99%. Survival status of four patients (two patients allocated to reperfusion therapy and two allocated to conventional treatment), who had moved abroad, could not be retrieved, and the most recently available follow up data were used.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec5-1741826711428064"><title>Statistical analysis</title>
<p>Continuous variables were compared by Student’s t-test and categorical variables by chi-squared tests. Cumulative survival analyses were constructed using the Kaplan−Meier method. Among patient subgroups, the Mantel and Haenszel log-rank test was used to compare survival and event-free survival curves. According to the consolidated standards of reporting trial’s recommendations,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1741826711428064">12</xref></sup> we report our findings also in terms of absolute benefit of reperfusion per 100 patients, relative risk reduction [i.e. (M<sub>r</sub>−M<sub>c</sub>/)/M<sub>c</sub>, with M = mortality, r = reperfusion and c = conventional treatment], absolute risk reduction (i.e. M<sub>r−</sub>M<sub>c</sub>), and number of patients needed to be treated (i.e. 1/absolute risk reduction).</p>
<p>The expected survival in a reference population was calculated using age- and gender-specific mortality data from the Netherlands in 1983 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="www.cbs.nl">www.cbs.nl</ext-link>) and compared with survival in patients after MI. Since the mean age of our infarct study population was 56 years and 80% were male, mortality risks were weighted accordingly.</p>
<p>The Cox proportional hazards model was used to identify independent risk factors for 27-year mortality. Preselected patient baseline characteristics were: age, sex, previous MI, infarct site, Killip class at admission, time from onset to treatment allocation, and sum of ST-segment elevation at admission. In the analyses, the following data collected in hospital were also included: atrial fibrillation and ventricular fibrillation/flutter, infarct size as assessed from cardiac enzyme release, the (in)ability to perform an exercise test before discharge, extent and severity of coronary artery disease, and left ventricular function.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec6-1741826711428064"><title>Life expectancy</title>
<p>Life expectancy after MI, with or without reperfusion therapy, was calculated from the area under the Kaplan−Meier curves truncated at 27 years.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1741826711428064">13</xref></sup> To calculate the exact life expectancy, the curves were extended beyond 27 years using the age- and sex-specific mortality data from the reference population in the Netherlands, assuming that those post-MI patients who had survived 27 years would have similar further life expectancy as their age- and sex-matched peers. The yearly mortality rates of an 81-year-old (56 years old at baseline + 27 years) male in the Netherlands were around 6%. The loss of life years for MI was computed as the area between the survival curves of the two treatment groups.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="sec7-1741826711428064" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title>
<p>A total of 533 patients were enrolled in this study. Baseline characteristics have been described in detail.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1741826711428064">10</xref></sup> Mean age was 56 years (28⊟71 years), 18% were female, 22% had a previous infarction, 46% were admitted with an anterior infarction, and three out of four patients were treated within 2 hours after onset of symptoms. At final follow up (median 27 year, range 25−29 years) 59 patients (22%) of the 269 patients allocated to reperfusion therapy were alive and only 39 (15%) of the 264 patients allocated to conventional therapy. The cumulative 10−, 15−, 20−, and 25-year survival rates were 69, 48, 37, and 24% in patients allocated to reperfusion therapy and 59, 38, 27, and 18% in the control group, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1741826711428064">Figure 1</xref>). The gain in survival by early reperfusion therapy was significant (<italic>p</italic> = 0.02) by log-rank analysis. The corresponding expected survival of the reference population was 86, 78, 56, and 36%, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1741826711428064">Figure 1</xref>). The survival difference with reperfusion therapy was apparent at hospital discharge and 1-year follow up. After 1 year, the two curves were approximately parallel. Thus, the 10% early survival benefit was sustained during almost three decades. Calculated life expectancy was 12.5 years in the control group and 15.6 years when allocated to reperfusion therapy. Accordingly, more than 3 years were gained by reperfusion therapy (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1741826711428064">Table 1</xref>). This beneficial effect was observed in all subgroups (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1741826711428064">Table 2</xref>), especially in patients with anterior MI where 3.7 years was gained by reperfusion therapy. Furthermore, also women had a 5-year longer life expectancy then males after reperfusion therapy.

<p>In our earlier report, based on 1-year outcome, we calculated an expected gain in life expectancy by reperfusion therapy of 1.5 years, which is only half of the actual benefit of 3.1 years as observed in the present study (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1741826711428064">Table 3</xref>). Thus, the earlier model underestimated the beneficial effect of reperfusion therapy by a factor two. Especially in those patients with a large ST-elevation anterior infarct treated &gt; 2 hours after onset symptoms, the difference between the 1-year model and the real life expectancy was very large (1.5 years benefit after reperfusion therapy in the 1-year model and in reality almost 8 years benefit).

<p>The expected survival in the normal population was 21.1 years. In those patients suffering from MI, 8.6 years out of these 21.1 life years were lost when treated conventionally. About half of this loss (3.1 years) could be restored by timely reperfusion therapy.</p>
<sec id="sec8-1741826711428064"><title>Repeat cardiac events</title>
<p>Recurrent infarction occurred more frequently in patients allocated to reperfusion treatment than in conventionally treated patients. As a result, cumulative survival free from reinfarction were identical in both treatment groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1741826711428064">Figure 2</xref>). In particular, early reinfarction, within the first year, was more frequent after reperfusion therapy, while subsequent reinfarction rates, after the first year, were low in both groups, averaging 1% per year. One-third of the patients (<italic>n</italic> = 95; 35%) allocated to reperfusion therapy had at least one recurrent MI at a median follow-up time of 2 years; 39 of these patients (14%) had a first reinfarction within 1 year after randomization. Seventeen patients (6%) had a second reinfarction, which was followed by a third reinfarction in three patients and a fourth in one patient. In conventionally treated patients, only 69 (26%) had a recurrent MI. Remarkably, these re-infarctions occurred much later than after reperfusion therapy (median 4.3 years; <italic>p</italic> = 0.02). Only 16 reinfarctions (6%) occurred within the first year. A second reinfarction was reported in 10 patients and was followed by a third reinfarction in three patients. Also coronary revascularizations occurred more after reperfusion therapy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1741826711428064">Figure 3</xref>). Fifty five (20%) of the patients treated with streptokinase underwent coronary angioplasty and 83 (31%) underwent coronary bypass surgery (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1741826711428064">Figure 3</xref>). In conventionally treated patients, the intervention rate was lower (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001): only 32 patients (12%) underwent coronary angioplasty and 66 patients (25%) coronary bypass surgery of whom 20 before discharge. Especially after reperfusion therapy, revascularization procedures were performed predominantly in the first year, while after the first year were infrequent and not statistically significant between treatment groups, averaging 0.6% and 0.8% respectively per year. At 1 year, freedom from death, recurrent MI, bypass surgery, and angioplasty was 57% in patients treated with streptokinase and 64% in conventionally treated patients (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1741826711428064">Figure 4</xref>). Beyond 1 year, the curves converged rapidly to overlap after 10 years (<italic>p</italic> = 0.8). Important to note is that, irrespective of the treatment arm, almost all patients (95%) underwent some event during the 27 years of follow up.

<p>Predictors of long-term mortality were age, a previous MI, anterior infarction, extensive ST-segment elevation, and severe heart failure or cardiogenic shock (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-1741826711428064">Figure 5</xref>). However, after inclusion of parameters representing reperfusion therapy and subsequent clinical course, these baseline characteristics were replaced by more precise measurements of left ventricular function, infarct size, and extent of vessel disease. Also, reperfusion therapy remained an independent predictor of lower mortality (HR 0.8; 95% CI 0.7 to 1.0) as compared with conventional therapy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-1741826711428064">Figure 5</xref>).

<p>This study provides unique data with respect to long-term outcome after reperfusion therapy. It confirms that the early survival benefit by reperfusion therapy, reached immediately after AMI, is maintained throughout follow up. Reperfusion therapy prolongs life for at least 3 years and restores one-third of the loss in life years by the infarct. These findings re-emphasize that all efforts should be made to identify patients with evolving MI, to provide rapid, effective reperfusion therapy without delay.</p>
<p>Although primary PCI has taken over the role of the preferred therapeutic treatment option, fibrinolytic therapy still has its role. In patients presenting with ST-elevation MI, early, effective reperfusion of the culprit artery is needed to salvage myocardium, maintain left ventricular function, and reduce mortality. According to ESC guidelines for the treatment of these patients, the time from medical contact to initiation of fibrinolytic therapy (door-to-needle time) should be 30 minutes, and the time from medical contact to PCI (door-to-balloon time) should be 90 minutes. Because many patients present to hospitals that are not equipped to administer PCI, door-to-balloon time often falls far short of the ideal. When PCI is not readily available, efficient prehospital treatment with fibrinolytic agents may reduce mortality rates and result in outcomes similar to PCI when administered promptly.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1741826711428064">14</xref></sup></p>
<p>Of course, since this present study from the early 1980s, reperfusion therapy has evolved. It is likely that the benefits of current therapy with primary PCI and stenting will be larger than the important benefit reported by us. Indeed, successful reperfusion can now be achieved in more than the 80% of our study, while also the incidence of reinfarction has been significantly reduced.</p>
<p>The absolute survival benefit after reperfusion therapy at 1 month was 6%, increasing to 10% at 1 year and beyond. No additional benefit of reperfusion therapy was observed after the first year, in spite of the better left ventricular function at hospital discharge. This may be due to the excess of reinfarction, with associated loss of ventricular function, as was observed during the first years in the reperfusion group.</p>
<p>We had the unique opportunity to verify the life expectancy model, which was developed on the basis of earlier infarct studies and 1-year outcome.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1741826711428064">9</xref></sup> In that report, the extrapolated life expectancy was 15.3 years with conventional therapy and 16.8 years after early reperfusion, a gain of 18 months. After extended follow up, in the current study we could calculate life expectancy more accurately and we found that life expectancy was overestimated by 1 to 3 years with the original 1-year model (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1741826711428064">Table 3</xref>), but also observed a twofold greater (3.1 years) gain in life expectancy in favour of reperfusion therapy. Apparently the (necessary) assumptions in the original model with limited follow up were not accurate. These observations indicate that estimates of life expectancy and cost-effectiveness analyses of medical interventions should be interpreted with caution as long as true long-term follow-up data are lacking. Therefore, true long-term follow-up studies of randomized trials should be conducted more frequently.</p>
<sec id="sec11-1741826711428064"><title>Limitations</title>
<p>The treatment that was given for acute MI between 1980 and 1985 is no longer current.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1741826711428064">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1741826711428064">16</xref></sup> Intracoronary streptokinase is no longer given and the dose of intravenous streptokinase is now different from that used in those earlier years. But this is inevitable when reporting long-term survival and event-free survival results as treatment evolves with the passage of time. Nevertheless, our main point, that re-establishment of coronary patency improves survival, is not invalidated.</p>
