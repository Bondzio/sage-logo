It is my privilege to provide leadership for the expanding applications of music in medical and health care contexts that continue to be developed worldwide.</p><p>The IAMM will hold its second international conference at Chulalongkorn University in Bangkok, Thailand, July 3-6, 2012, on the theme <italic>The power of music in medicine and health care</italic> (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="www.iammthailand.com" xlink:type="simple">www.iammthailand.com</ext-link>). The conference features 3 exceptional keynote addresses from experts in the music and medicine field.</p><p>There will be 42 sessions with speakers who are practicing and researching in 18 countries from 5 continents. Along with music performances, a conference dinner, and a party on the final night, there will be ample opportunity for engaging in intercultural learning combined with social experiences that promote professional networking.</p><p>The keynote speakers from Thailand, United States, and Australia represent the diversity of practice and research in the field of music and medicine. Their presentations will provide delegates with the opportunity to further expand their knowledge of the ways in which music and medicine applications are developing across the world. The broad range of papers reflects the diversity of practices and approaches when music is applied for the benefit of infants, children, adults, parents, caregivers, and staff in health care worldwide. The IAMM is immensely grateful to its generous sponsors, Chulalongkorn University and Thailand’s Ministry of Public Health, for supporting this event.</p><sec id="section1-1943862112440581"><title>The Venue</title><p>Chulalongkorn University is Thailand’s first university.

Dr Claudius Conrad’s research into the effects of music for medical patients at the Harvard Medical School, United States, has received much attention in the literature and international media coverage as well. He will present about the present state and future potential for music and medicine and will inspire conference delegates with his academic and practitioner expertise in medicine. As well, his beautiful piano performance will be a highlight. Professor Emeritus Poonpit Amatayakul from Thailand brings a unique perspective from the world of ethnomusicology, demonstrating for delegates how the music of Thailand integrates a body–mind approach to well-being. Dr Helen Shoemark from Australia will share her research about very young infants’ need for support and communication that musical interplay can provide.</p><sec id="section3-1943862112440581"><title>Claudius Conrad</title><fig id="fig2-1943862112440581" position="float"><graphic alt-version="no" position="float" xlink:href="10.1177_1943862112440581-fig2.tif" xlink:type="simple"/></fig><p>Claudius Conrad, MD, combines his passion and expertise in both music and medicine.

Helen completed her music therapy training at the University of Melbourne and Kansas University, and her PhD from the University of Melbourne. Helen is a music therapist at The Royal Children’s Hospital in Melbourne, where she has worked since 1995. Since 2005 she is also the senior music therapist for neonates and infants. The music therapy program features 2 clinical frameworks—the first is focused on the infant’s physiological state, using music as a safe stimulus for neurological development; and the second framework is family-centered care in which music is a shared intersubjective experience for the ongoing cognitive and psychological development of the infant in the context of the family. As a researcher at the Murdoch Children's Research Institute, Helen’s investigations have focused on developing an effective evidence base for interpersonal intervention with infants and families and particularly the application of music and music therapy for high-risk newborn infants. Helen’s international publication includes a chapter in the recently released text <italic>Music</italic> <italic>Therapy</italic> <italic>in</italic> <italic>Parent-Infant</italic> <italic>Bonding</italic>, Oxford University Press.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1943862112440581">1</xref></sup> She has published numerous refereed journal papers. She is an adjunct professor in the music therapy program at the School of Music, University of Queensland, and is an honorary senior fellow at the School of Music University of Melbourne. Helen regularly presents at conferences in Australia, Europe, and North America. She is a past national president and honorary lifetime member of the Australian Music Therapy Association.</p></sec></sec><sec id="section6-1943862112440581"><title>Speakers of Distinction</title><p>Our speakers of distinction include Professor Cheryl Dileo, an internationally renowned leader in music therapy. She is the director of the Arts and Quality of Life Research Center at Temple University, Philadelphia. Dr Dileo won the SAGE paper prize at the first international conference of IAMM held in collaboration with Mozart &amp; Music II in Krems, Austria, in 2010. She has made an outstanding contribution to the field of music and medicine, particularly through her recent coauthoring of 7 Cochrane systematic reviews on medical music therapy for the Cochrane Library. She is a founding member of the IAMM and serves on the board of directors. She will indicate how the evidence from the Cochrane Review findings can be applied in clinical practice and will present findings from the study of music applications in cardiac care and for oncology patients.</p><p>Joanne Loewy of the Louis Armstrong Center for Music &amp; Medicine, United States and Ralph Spintge of the Department of Algesiology and Interdiscilinary Pain Medicine in Germany, and the coeditors in chief of the journal <italic>Music &amp; Medicine</italic>, respectively, will be leading a joint forum on research in music medicine and music therapy in pain and anesthesia. These leaders in the field of music and medicine have both contributed uniquely to the development of knowledge and the shaping of new ideas. Dr Spintge coined the widely used term MusicMedicine.</p><p>Professor Suzanne Hanser (United States) won the SAGE paper prize at the first meeting of the IAMM at the University of Limerick, Ireland, in 2009.</p><p>Dr Hanser is the chair of the Music Therapy Department at the Berklee College of Music in Boston and serves on the IAMM Executive Committee as Chair of Communication and Outreach.
