<abstract>
<p>The world has changed dramatically since the Ottawa Charter was developed in 1986. Contemporary health promotion responses continue to evolve and become more sophisticated in response to the multiple challenges created by an ever-changing world. This commentary discusses some of the challenges facing health promotion professionals today and some of the responses that are being developed to address them. The importance of contextual considerations for both the worker and the work of health promotion are emphasised. The author then suggests ways that organisations and individuals can meet modern-day health promotion challenges through specific courses of action.</p>

<p>While volumes could be written about what has happened in the world of health promotion since the Ottawa Charter was launched in November 1986, I would like to address some of the challenges that face health promotion at a global level, then tell you what is being done and what can be done to help overcome those challenges.</p>
<p>We all know the Ottawa Charter. In four short pages it provided a definition of health promotion, set out prerequisites for health, gave us three key actions to undertake, and five action areas in which to work. The Charter spoke of the need to develop political will, as well as the importance of holistic thinking, ecological action and human caring. It pointedly spoke of the need to address health inequities and the importance of participation as a way of accepting the community as the essential voice in matters of its health and wellbeing.</p>
<p>The Ottawa Charter set out for the first time a clear role for health promotion within an integrated conceptualisation of public health. Health promotion demanded an equal space next to disease prevention and health protection in a new public health and, in taking that place, health promotion empowered and strengthened the field of public health by expanding the understanding of determinants of health, of settings, of multi-sectoral influences on health and wellbeing, of healthy policymaking and the use of integrated strategies.</p>
<p>The problem with applying the Ottawa Charter to the problems of the world is that the world keeps changing. The world of 1986 was vastly different from today in so many ways. There are more than two billion additional people living on the planet now than there were in 1986 – an increase of over 28.5 per cent.</p>
<p>The world has seen the rise of globalisation, urbanisation, armed conflict, climate change and new health challenges like HIV/AIDS and alarmingly increasing rates of non-communicable diseases. In the past quarter century the world has seen economic and environmental devastation in numerous regions. Globalised financial markets, corporate greed and regional and civil wars have worked against the principles of health promotion.</p>
<p>Yet, in the face of it all, health promotion efforts at a global level have developed strategies and new ways of contributing to health gains. We have seen advances in the evidence and arguments for social determinants of health and some countries are beginning to grapple with ways to effectively deal with them, but this is patchy at best and the vast majority of our health financing and health systems thinking is aligned in narrow silos and not mainstreamed across the sectors required to improve health.</p>
<p>While some successes have been seen in the development of the world’s first public health treaty – the Framework Convention on Tobacco Control – we also witness the uneven implementation of the articles of the convention across nations and the renewed aggression of multinational tobacco companies in using their wealth to fight against every gain that is made.</p>
<p>Health in all policies is a concept arising out of the Ottawa Charter that is gaining momentum. The application of a health lens to policy development at all levels will be the central theme of the next WHO Global Conference on Health Promotion in Helsinki in June 2013. A great deal of activity has been taking place on this theme in Australia and in Europe and the 8<sup>th</sup> Global Conference on Health Promotion will provide an opportunity for that and other activity to be showcased to the world.</p>
<p>The most recent focal point for health promotion activity is the UN work on combating non-communicable diseases (NCD). This is an agenda that health promotion has a central role in, advancing and positioning in the context of holistic health thinking. Our work is to avoid letting NCD issues get caught up in lifestyle drift and relegated once again to behavioural interventions only. Our efforts will be needed to ensure that determinants are appropriately assessed and that policy measures are taken at the highest levels.</p>
<p>Advances have also been made in media technology and communication, including social media, all with the potential to revolutionise the way we gather information, share it and learn from one another. This challenges us in health promotion to make the best use of these tools, to use them to empower communities to have greater control of information and to create a unified voice for their concerns and their priorities.</p>
<p>Perhaps these technological advances, combined with our scientific evidence, our networks and our experience over the past two and a half decades will prepare us to face increasing rates of NCDs and mental health issues, continue the fight for health equity, achieve our goals and targets, implement our plans for tobacco control and social determinants, and address the critical importance of governance for health.</p>
<p>But the reality we face at a global level is one of contextual evolution. Health promotion has evolved in different ways in different parts of the world because the contexts and situations that require specific actions and reactions vary so much from place to place and across peoples. There is no universally applicable health promotion solution to any of the world’s problems. The challenges we face are complex and the strategies with which we face them require greater focus, greater calibration to the factors particular to the individual context. We have an arsenal of strategies but we must carefully weigh up the contextual factors and seek evidence that supports the best integrated response in the given situation.</p>
<p>While the circumstances in which we work may have changed and the strategies may have become more focused, the underlying principles of health promotion remain the same. As health promoters we care about equity, social justice, sustainability and participation. We take a holistic view of health and the factors that influence whether we live long, full and healthy lives or whether we suffer sickness, disability and premature death. We know that multiple strategies are required to address the complexities of the health and wellbeing challenges that confront us. We still advocate, mediate and enable and we still believe in integrated approaches from the level of the individual to the community to government and inter-governmental levels. Increasingly we are leaning toward higher-level interventions to address broader determinants of health and to ensure that policymaking at all levels is amenable to health. Dr Margaret Chan, the WHO Director General, recently said, ‘gaps in health outcomes are not a matter of fate – they are indicators of policy failure’.</p>
<p>Perhaps the advice on a global way forward is that we first acknowledge that, just as no two health promotion contexts are the same, so are no two health promoters. Perhaps it is acceptable, even desirable, for tensions to exist between what should be done most urgently and the role that health promoters should take in doing it.</p>
<p>Just as there are different demographic and epidemiological experiences across contexts, so are there different political, social, economic and environmental realities. We need to appreciate that the work of a health promoter in a war-ravaged village in a developing African nation will necessarily be different from that of an urban health promotion worker in a developed European nation. What may seem to us to be insurmountable political, economic or social challenges may provide opportunities for reconstructions of democracy and citizenship in response. Humanity is amazingly resilient and health promotion has to allow for humanity to teach us – as well as to learn from us.</p>
<p>Some of us may rightfully be at the forefront of social movements that demand radical changes to governments and societies, while others feel more comfortable in a more objective scientific role, providing evidence and analysing results, while yet others may become partners working within systems to effect change. The definition of health embraced by the field of health promotion is a broad and inclusive one. Perhaps the time has come for the definition of health promoter to be appreciated as one that is broad and inclusive as well. The context, the training, the experience, and even the personality of the individual will influence the ways in which they take action for health promotion. Some will have more limited opportunities than others, some will have fewer resources, some will not be as empowered to take action as others. While we must always press for increased opportunities, resources and empowerment, we should also be able to value and appreciate the diverse perspectives, priorities and contributions made by our richly different health promotion family. None of us can solve the problems of the world on our own. Let us celebrate our diversity as health promoters and continue to use it to our collective advantage.</p>
<p>So, faced with this rapidly changing world full of challenges, what are we to do at a global level – as a health promotion field of work, as a health promotion discipline, as a health promotion movement? First and foremost, we must speak out for the principles that we hold dear: equity and human rights, sustainability, and participation. We must use our collective voice to be strong advocates for action by governments whether local, provincial, national or regional. We must continue to represent the voice of health promotion as a profession and as a movement to improve the wellbeing of the people of the world, wherever and in whatever conditions they live. We must continue to be strong advocates for action that will have a positive impact on the health equity, sustainability and participation of the people affected by that action. Our advocacy must include high-level policy-making that results in great gains for great numbers of people. We must engage with the global debates on social determinants, health in all policies, non-communicable diseases and the sustainability of resources, development, trade and environments. We must continue to use the evidence of the effectiveness of health promotion to support our advocacy arguments, and we must continue to build and contribute to that evidence base, no matter where that evidence is gathered. It is just as important for the results of effective health promotion in poor developing nations to be known as it is for evidence to pour in from wealthy developed areas. We must form links with each other to share what we have learned, to support each other in finding solutions to the problems we face in our individual contexts, and contribute to the strength of the voice advocating on the global stage.</p>
<p>I am proud to say that the International Union for Health Promotion and Education (IUHPE) has been doing just this level of advocacy, in a far more organised and comprehensive way in the past two years than we have in living memory. The IUHPE has been a part of global discussions on NCDs, sustainability, health in all policies, competencies and workforce development, social determinants and, above all, health equity. We have developed and continue to develop and refine our mechanisms for responding to and influencing global discussions and plans of action in all of these areas. We are attempting to reform our governance structures so that we can be both more agile and capable of quickly responding to global discussions on health and wellbeing issues, while at the same time developing new ways for IUHPE members to connect to each other and to these global debates through participation in Interest Groups. Our work is difficult, particularly given the current global financial crisis and the tendency of governments to shift funding from global priorities to national or local ones. With renewed membership involvement we believe that we can face these challenges and be a formidable force for positive change in the world.</p>
<p>This level of advocacy is already helping us to influence the ‘mediate’ challenge of the Ottawa Charter as more sectors of government and non-government alike acknowledge the inter-connectedness of their work with the health and wellbeing outcomes of the people they serve. Greater effort is still required as the world embraces social determinants of health, and works through strategies such as Health in All Policies to deliver improvements.</p>
<p>The IUHPE has also been working to support the development of competencies and workforce development strategies in nations and regions from the Americas, to Europe to Asia and in many countries now realising that the vast work of health promotion can’t be successfully done without a competent, well-trained, well-resourced workforce. The IUHPE is supporting the development of regional and national strategies that will ensure these necessary workforce issues are dealt with and result in measurable impacts.</p>
<p>The IUHPE is also working to continue to build the scientific evidence base for health promotion through our suite of journals, our World Conferences, our Global Working Groups and our Global Programme on Health Promotion Effectiveness (GPHPE). The IUHPE has been instrumental in supporting the work of the World Alliance for Risk Factor Surveillance (WARFS) as it advocates for standards on what information should be collected and evaluated to ensure that health promotion work is having the desired impact on health equity, outcomes and wellbeing.</p>
<p>The IUHPE is also active in global collaborations to advance the principles by which we live. We are dynamic partners in the work of the World Health Organization at global and regional levels. We participated fully in the United Nations Summit on Non-Communicable Diseases. We partner with and provide support to alliances of like-minded health organisations because we know the value of participating in these alliances and adding our strong voice to the collective call for meaningful change in policies, approaches and political will for health.</p>
<p>We are challenged to maintain our high level of activity, to continue to make contributions across this large range of issues. We can only continue to do this with active members who engage with our work and who provide the on-the-ground feedback that is essential to our organisation remaining informed, active and relevant. The challenges facing health promotion are great, but I believe that the passion and contribution of members has the capacity to be greater. We already are a great force in health promotion globally, but increased participation from members all over the world, will only add to our strength, our voice and our achievements.</p>
<p>But what about you? What can the individual health promoter do to contribute to global situations? I put my recommendations to you in an easy to remember way – the four Ps.</p>
<p>The first is <bold>Personal</bold> – if you believe in the principles of equity and social justice, sustainability and participation, then demonstrate this in your personal life. If you don’t already, let others close to you know that you support these principles. If you have money, donate it to an organisation that works to support these principles. If you have time, volunteer it. Great things happen when individuals start sharing thoughts and working together at the personal level.</p>
<p>The second P is <bold>Professional</bold>. I challenge each of us to examine our principles, our philosophy, our work practices to ensure that we are making as much of a difference as we can to promote equity, to promote sustainability of ecological, social, political and economic environments, and to commit to the participation of those people affected by the work we do – participation, not just as clients or service recipients, but participation in determining the priorities for our work, participation in decision-making and participation in the power structures that govern what we do.</p>
<p>Also included in the Professional realm is the importance of being a part of professional organisations that support the principles of health promotion, whether those associations are at the local, national or global level. Adding your voice to the membership of such organisations strengthens the organisation’s base of support and also provides you with professional networks and connections that may assist you in your own health promotion work. A stronger professional voice is more successful at advocacy and you can have a part in that.</p>
<p>The third P is <bold>Political</bold>. If you believe in and support the principles of health promotion then you should let the political powers that be know it. Write letters, talk to leaders, organise community action, demonstrate, vote for those who support health promotion. Participate in debates on matters related to the wellbeing of the people in your life. Stand up, speak out and join in the creation of demand for equity, sustainability and participation.</p>
<p>The final P is for <bold>Permanent</bold>. In this step I ask each of you to continue to strive for the principles and goals of health promotion throughout your lives. Don’t just get excited and try to take action when a conference rolls around. Make a permanent commitment to engaging with the personal, professional and political activities that work together to achieve health promotion objectives. With commitment from all of you in each of these areas, the possibilities of success dramatically increase.</p>
<p>In quickly talking about the development of health promotion since the Ottawa Charter, I have focused on changes to the world and challenges arising from them, but I hope that I have also provided some words of hope, some encouragement that we in health promotion are making a difference. We are adapting to the demands of numerous contexts and we are still fighting for equity, sustainability and participation.</p>
