<abstract>
<p>Legal mobilization in the courts and in political discourse has emerged as an increasingly important strategy of social movements that complements other political approaches. This is true also for women’s movements in post-socialist countries, but most research on strategic litigation has focused so far on common law countries and on supranational litigation in Europe. Using the case of Poland as an example, this article asks why references to the law are so attractive in post-socialist contexts and what can be gained by this with respect to actual rights, justice and social change. It focuses thereby on strategic litigation as the most sophisticated strategy that results from other sustained movement activities connected with the law. It draws on field research, interviews with activists and analyses of primary as well as secondary sources. The article explores the reasons for using the law as the ‘master frame’ by analysing the traditions of gender and law in state socialism and during democratic consolidation. Two examples of strategic litigation, the Tysiąc case for reproductive rights and the ‘Biedronka’ cases for employment rights, are analysed and situated in the context of other legal mobilization activities. These cases set the agenda for crucial social problems and resulted in binding decisions by the courts. A broad and predominantly supportive media discourse was conducive to cultivating public opinion. These analyses support the conclusion that legal mobilization tends to directly influence law and legal practices. It has a socializing effect on the population and their legal consciousness. In aiming at both state and society, these legal strategies of the women’s movement are a modest but crucial success for democratic consolidation.</p>

<p>Worldwide social movements are utilizing the law increasingly to advance their political and social causes, be it in court or in political debates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1350506812456641">McCann, 2006</xref>). This also holds true for causes dealing with gender equality and women’s rights. Rejecting arguments of cultural relativism,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1350506812456641">1</xref></sup> women’s networks have initiated a discourse at the national and transnational level on basic women’s rights as human rights. They have used political mobilization and strategic litigation – a strategy which uses the justice sector to achieve legal and social change by means of test cases – and often succeed in achieving public acknowledgement and domestic enforcement of women’s rights by state institutions and non-state actors alike. Using the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW), signed by virtually all UN member states, as a leverage to demand and secure domestic change, is proving to be an especially powerful instrument (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-1350506812456641">Simmons, 2009</xref>, esp. 236–255; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1350506812456641">Baer, 2011</xref>: 22ff.).</p>
<p>Closer to home, the activities of women’s organizations on the European continent vary from country to country. Interestingly enough, the use of strategic litigation as a means to promote basic women’s rights has been more prominent in terms of attracting public attention and eliciting movement self-reflection in post-socialist states and/or in developing countries than in Western Europe.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1350506812456641">2</xref></sup> This may – to a certain degree – be due to the influence of US funding in these struggling countries, which reflects positive experiences in the United States with this strategy (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1350506812456641">Rekosh, 2008</xref>). Nevertheless, such instruments have contributed substantially to the development of antidiscrimination law within the European Union at the national level as well as at the European level by bringing cases before the European Court of Justice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1350506812456641">Alter and Vargas, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1350506812456641">Cichowski, 2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1350506812456641">2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-1350506812456641">Schott, 2008</xref>). For these reasons, the domestic agency in international norm diffusion has emerged as a relative new field of research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-1350506812456641">Zwingel, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>This article asks how strategic litigation actually works and to what degree the recognition of women’s rights can be achieved using specific law cases. Strategic legal action entails politically motivated tactics used by NGOs or advocacy groups by launching or supporting court cases in order to pressure governments to change laws or policies that are unconstitutional; to ensure that laws are correctly enforced; or to identify shortcomings or gaps in the law. Goals of strategic legal support may also include raising public awareness and/or setting political agendas in order to build up political pressure for legislative change as well as to empower marginalized groups. Strategic litigation is often chosen as a political tactic when the legal issue at stake relates to a major social problem; in such a case, court decisions will more likely have a broad impact and a greater potential to attract public interest and media reporting.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-1350506812456641">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>Discourses on law and rights as political instruments of the opposition have been gaining prominence particularly in Eastern Europe since the 1970s.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-1350506812456641">4</xref></sup> In spite of this, research in this area has focused primarily on Western legal systems, and more specially, on common law systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1350506812456641">McCann, 2006</xref>: xxi–xxii), in which law is developed through court decision rather than through legislative statutes as is the case in civil law systems. The development and outcome of legal mobilization in new democracies with state socialist legacies have yet to be the focus of scholarly attention.</p>
<p>Consolidation following the democratic transition in 1989, in terms of state institutions, political representation and democratic values, norms and actual behaviour, has proven to be an immense challenge (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1350506812456641">Merkel, 2010</xref>: 110–127). Over the years, references to the law and human rights have not diminished; instead the emergent civil society has come to openly support such complaints and has even extended their scope of services to encompass these needs. The framing of gender issues in a legal context has since become a central strategy of the women’s movement, in particular. Most segments of the women’s movement in Poland today implement diverse strategies to promote women’s rights and factual gender equality in their country.</p>
<p>In the following article, I intend to analyse the utilization of strategic litigation for women’s rights in Poland. I begin with a description of the development of the relations between gender and law during Poland’s state socialism and the process of democratic consolidation that followed. After a characterization of the main features of the Polish women’s movement, I then take a closer look at strategic supranational and national litigation with the help of two case studies, both of which provoked a high level of political mobilization in Poland. In the course of this analysis, I take a closer look at both strategic and practical gender interests, differentiating between the two (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1350506812456641">Molyneux, 1985</xref>: 231–233). A major objective of strategic gender interests, on the one hand, is to overcome women’s subordination in society. Considering that reproductive rights are often at the core of this problem and that they are the anathema of the Polish women’s movement, I thus chose the Alicja Tysiąc case, a lawsuit concerning access to a lawful abortion. On the other hand, practical gender interests arise, among other things, from women’s concrete situation as a result of the gendered division of labour; most often these interests surface from immediate perceived need and solutions seldom entail long-term strategic goals such as women’s emancipation. Pursuing practical gender interests rarely challenges the prevailing forms of gender subordination; however, class and gender interests often intersect. For these reasons, I picked the mobilization for women’s employment rights in ‘Biedronka’ supermarkets as my second example. I found the fact that these two cases differed in their legal approach particularly interesting, the type of outcome as well as how they handled gender.</p>
<p>I conclude the article with a discussion of the opportunities and restrictions of strategic litigation for the Polish women’s movement as well as their successes in terms of agenda-setting, legislation and legal awareness therewith to date. I collected my data in the context of a comparative research project on litigation for women’s employment rights in Germany, Switzerland, France and Poland. This included 20 interviews with lawyers, political activists and plaintiffs in Poland conducted between 2008 and 2010.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-1350506812456641">5</xref></sup></p>
<sec id="section1-1350506812456641">
<title>Political ideology and law in state socialism</title>
<p>As is well known, the Communist Party abolished the separation of powers soon after it came into power after the Second World War in Poland. All political and legal institutions were quickly brought under party control; their central function was seen in the stabilization and legitimization of socialist power (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-1350506812456641">Rzeplinski, 1999</xref>). Even the courts of law were committed to protect ‘socialist achievements’. Under state socialism, judicial punishment was set up to be preventive; perpetrators were to be (re-)educated subsequently and reintegrated into socialist society (see, for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1350506812456641">Fuszara, 1994</xref>: 328–330). The concepts of socialist rights in the Polish constitution was based on the significance of collective interests as defined by the Polish United Workers’ Party and enforced by constitutional clauses that prohibited the use of rights for ‘anti-socialist purposes’. Independent organizations and political parties were banned.</p>
<p>Thus, the concept of an impartial rule of law was countermanded and replaced with a vague concept of ‘proletarian justice’. These changes had severe consequences for legal awareness of Polish citizens and legal culture in general in Poland. For one, the difference between politics and the law have since become indistinct in the minds of citizens. At the end of state socialism, claimants often had difficulties differentiating between a legal claim and personal or political issues. Frequently, they were looking for a capable lawyer to ‘arrange matters’ in their favour, rather than actually seeking justice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1350506812456641">Łętowska, 1989</xref>: 264ff.).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-1350506812456641">6</xref></sup> Further legacies of the socialist state have been a ‘paternalist demoralization and passivity’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1350506812456641">Łętowska, 1993</xref>: 220); the general assumption appears to be, while real-world problems could be solved by the ‘fathers of a state’ simply enacting a decree, individuals can do little to change their lot in an unfair world. Legal literacy was low and adherence to law was not highly valued among citizens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1350506812456641">Kojder, 1999</xref>: 152, 147ff.).</p>
<p>A possible explanation for the difference in political strategies between women in Western Europe and in the CEE could very well lie in the dissimilarities in legal cultures. Women in Western countries grew up in a political and legal culture that, for the most part, separates the political and legal. Accepting the promotion of basic women’s rights as political, feminists may remain sceptical towards attempts to use strategic litigation a means to reach their goals; perhaps fearing to stray into areas where political objectives are openly frowned upon and thus more likely to impair their chances of success. Western feminists also criticize the concept of an autonomous legal individual, pointing out that it was originally developed for property-owning <italic>men</italic>, deliberately excluding women (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1350506812456641">Pateman, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-1350506812456641">Schmidt, 2006</xref>), which has amplified the mistrust in the gender fairness of the Western legal systems. As the former socialist countries negated and systematically violated the basic rights of both men and women, activists in the CEE may be more alert to the significance of legal individualism as a basic principle for the implementation and enjoyment of all other rights. Thus in the context of an (at least emerging) impartial legal system strategic litigation may look more promising.</p>
<p>Compared to Western Europe with its well-established processes of political representation, the party system and interest aggregation and representation in Poland are still volatile. Legal amendments through the parliament are uncertain, and thus litigation may look more promising than in Western Europe, at least for agenda-setting. These ideas are tentative, and more socio-legal research should be done on the question of comparative legal cultures.</p>

<title>Gender equality and the socialist state</title>
<p>State socialist developments in Poland after 1945 were particularly ambivalent with regard to gender equality. On the one hand, the socialist government quickly embraced formal equality in political participation, family, education and employment. It even granted a liberalization of the abortion law during de-Stalinization in 1956/1959, giving women personal autonomy over their own bodies. On the other hand, despite formal equality, the patriarchal system persisted in Poland and women continued to be objects of political action, thus merely transferring women’s dependency from their fathers or husbands, to a ‘father state’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-1350506812456641">7</xref></sup></p>
<p>The roots for this partial liberation of Polish women can be found in the country’s history of foreign occupation and cultural traditions with strong Catholic influence, which continues to influence the society to this day. The figure of Matka Polka, the national Catholic symbol of the Polish Mother, who sacrifices her own needs and ambitions for the sake of the family and the nation, also upheld in Polish state socialism, remains an important female role model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1350506812456641">Kowalczyk, 2003</xref>). As a result, even the concept of individualist rights for women has been difficult to assert in Poland (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1350506812456641">Nowicka, 2007</xref>: 177). Due to the weak communist regime, a divided system of values developed in Poland after 1945. Although socialist ideological and national Catholic values are contradictory, often certain elements of these value systems were able to exist side-by-side in the ethical context of individuals and social groups. For example, in the communist era, the so-called ‘superwoman syndrome’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1350506812456641">Corrin, 1992</xref>) developed in Poland, combining the socialist aspiration towards economic independence and self-confidence, on the one hand, with a positive identification with and an acknowledgement of Catholic women’s tradition role in family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1350506812456641">Limanowska, 1993</xref>). Women accepted this offered balancing act because it promised specific advantages for them: social acceptance of their independence without giving up social recognition in their role as mothers.</p>
<p>Special provisions for women, which endeavoured to ease the woman’s now difficult task of combining traditional household responsibilities and childcare with the full-time employment and political activism, actually resulted in continued marginalization of women in the working world: special protective labour rights for women such as unpaid maternal leave of up to three years or extra days off for mothers combined with unchanged male gender roles to nourish the stereotype of women as problematic employees; work protection restrictions for women as bus and tractor drivers, and jobs dealing with explosives developed into male privileges (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1350506812456641">Plakwicz, 1992</xref>: 82).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-1350506812456641">8</xref></sup> However as independent organizations were banned in the socialist state of Poland, women could neither debate their situation in public, nor fight socialist and Catholic patriarchy.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-1350506812456641">
<title>Gender and law after 1989</title>
<p>During the democratic transition in Poland 1989, the rule of law was (re-)instated, state powers were once again separated into the executive and legislature, and constitutional clauses limiting the civil rights of Polish citizens were abolished. The reinstatement of fundamental political and civil rights in itself was a tremendous achievement. Legislative amendments and the reorganization of legal institutions constituted an extensive, rapid, although not always transparent process. Nevertheless, in the years to follow the newly won political and civil liberties generated realistic possibilities for claimants to demand their own rights vis-a-vis the state legal system.</p>
<p>Despite tendencies of conservative politicians, the clergy or popular culture to re-traditionalize gender roles in Poland, formal equality has been maintained under the law as EU membership became an important political objective. Nevertheless, gender inequality increased in daily life and open gender discrimination in areas of employment and welfare system has lead to asymmetrical access to justice, although the basis of the injustice this time around is not political, but rather financial.</p>
<p>The Polish citizens have an ambivalent relationship to the law: trade unionists, NGO activists and lawyers interviewed have noticed a slow rise in <italic>legal awareness</italic> in the population and especially in employees over the last years. They attribute this mainly to the numerous activities of legal empowerment that have been organized, but also to media discourse.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-1350506812456641">9</xref></sup> The director of the Strategic Litigation Programme of the Helsinki Foundation assessed the situation as follows:<disp-quote>
<p>You wouldn’t organise a single assembly of people like in Germany or Switzerland protesting against, let’s say biometric passports. It will not happen in Poland. But people are really aware of their rights when something wrong happens to them. For example when someone abused the power, then people know that there are legal procedures to fight against it. They perfectly know that something is wrong and that their rights are violated. (Interview <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-1350506812456641">Bodnar, 2008</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-1350506812456641">10</xref></sup></p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Nevertheless, this has not led to a corresponding increase in formal complaints of discrimination placed before the courts of law. As already discussed, Polish citizens still have difficulty differentiating between legal rights and personal or political matters. In addition, not everyone can afford legal counselling. Legal procedures in Poland are also particularly protracted and expensive.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-1350506812456641">11</xref></sup> However, the number of civil law cases is increasing year by year, which reflects the rising tendency to use the courts to claim ‘one’s rights’ (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1350506812456641">Kurczewski, 2011</xref>). Surveys also note a stable increase in <italic>legalism</italic> (defined here as the concept that ‘the law should always be obeyed’) since the state socialist era; in a 2007 survey 66% of the respondents confirmed this statement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1350506812456641">Kurczewski, 2011</xref>: 614).</p>
<p>The relationship between government officials and the Polish population, on the other hand, remains difficult and is impeded by <italic>mistrust</italic>. Civil servants continue to treat individuals petitioning for their rights as mere supplicants rather than as citizens. In addition, recent domestic data verify a continued precariousness of trust in public institutions like the courts, local administrations, government, parliament or the ombudsman (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1350506812456641">CBOS, 2010b</xref>).Given the importance of trust for the functioning of a democracy, this situation is disconcerting.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-1350506812456641">12</xref></sup> However, the commitment and accountability of public authorities needed to enforce and stabilize the democratic rule of law can only develop if individuals and civic associations persistently demand their rights and refer to these international principles of human rights (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1350506812456641">O’Donnell, 2004</xref>).</p>

<sec id="section4-1350506812456641">
<title>The Polish women’s movement and legal mobilization</title>
<p>Since 1989, the Polish women’s movement has rallied around numerous issues (for an overview, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1350506812456641">Fuchs, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1350506812456641">Fundacja Feminoteka et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1350506812456641">Fuszara, 2005</xref>). Similar to other women’s movements in the region, the Polish women’s movement has had to deal with widespread ignorance in politics and society about gender inequality, attempts to re-traditionalize gender relations, general problems of building civil society organizations and activities, as well as misunderstandings with Western colleagues on the nature of gender discrimination and a feminist worldview in the light of state socialism (see, for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-1350506812456641">Wallace, 1995</xref>). However, the socialist regime in Poland had been more politically tolerant than most other state socialist countries so that small feminist groups had begun to discuss, mostly American, feminist theories in the underground early on. This is one reason why the Polish movement is stronger and more differentiated than in other CEE countries. International funding has been instrumental for the often counter-hegemonic activities of women’s NGOs in Poland as well as in other countries. Most Polish women’s NGOs that have received foreign funding are strong, stable organizations today, each with their own agenda and not donor-driven (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1350506812456641">Funk, 2006</xref>). In general, Polish women’s organizations deal with empowerment issues in a broader sense and strive for political influence. About 300 organizations, groups and research centres are active across the entire country. They are particularly engaged in the fields of employment and job qualification, social assistance, violence and health – only some of their work is overtly in the area of the severely restrictive reproductive rights. These issues seem to form the specific thematic profile of women’s organizations in the CEE.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-1350506812456641">13</xref></sup></p>
<p>As funding for NGO activities became more difficult to obtain soon after the EU accession, particularly for smaller organizations, all organizations were forced to align their forms of activities, financing and issues to the framework of EU programmes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1350506812456641">Fuchs and Payer, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1350506812456641">Roth, 2007</xref>). Many women’s NGOs also had to cut back their activities, some even closed down completely. Some succeeded better than others in adjusting their work to current funding programmes; however, despite this squeeze, the NGOs are competing increasingly with regional state administrations as service providers. This tendency of ‘NGOization’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1350506812456641">Lang, 1997</xref>) was counterbalanced in the 2000s by a rise in street-level activism.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn14-1350506812456641">14</xref></sup> At the same time, this coincided with the diversification of constituencies and issues as well as of forms of action and organizing.</p>
<p>In the mid-1990s, women’s organizations began forming national (Ośka, Feminoteka) and regional (KARAT, NEWW) cooperation networks. They also sought to establish modes of consultation with state institutions, although the outcome of these efforts was varied (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1350506812456641">Gerber, 2010</xref>). The EU accession and the respective funds allowed for the diffusion of gender knowledge, mainstreaming instruments and certain policies (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1350506812456641">Mazewska and Zakrzewska, 2007</xref>; on domestic violence see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1350506812456641">Krizsan and Popa, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-1350506812456641">Spurek, 2008</xref>); at the same time, academic feminists were able to distinguish themselves as gender experts after writing several reports on NGOs and international organizations. These reports substantially increased the knowledge on gender relations and politics as well as the legal, political, economic and social situation of women in Poland and are informed by recent international debates (Fundacja <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1350506812456641">Feminoteka, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1350506812456641">Fundacja Feminoteka et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1350506812456641">Heinrich-Böll-Stiftung, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-1350506812456641">UNDP, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>Since then, women’s organizations in Poland have succeeded in legitimizing most of their demands through references to the established law as well as to international human rights treaties. Framing their causes in legal terms has become important for many reasons; in a different context, Nicolas Pedriana elaborates on this topic:<disp-quote>
<p>In short, because social movements draw on deeply resonant cultural symbols to define and legitimate their grievances and goals, and because law provides one of the deepest reservoirs of symbolic resources, discourses, and institutionalized scripts available to collective actors of all sorts, social movements . . . typically (though not exclusively) frame their cause in explicitly legal terms.

<p>When dealing with gender discrimination, particularly in the fields of employment and welfare, arguing in legal terms and presenting cases to court now constitute a viable option to obtain one’s rights. Through the legislative codification and international acknowledgement of legal norms concerning gender equality, demands for equal treatment in working life and social welfare (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1350506812456641">CBOS, 2006</xref>) as well as in politics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1350506812456641">CBOS, 2010d</xref>) have become more legitimate in the eyes of the society. Sustained political initiatives can be successful eventually. For example, after many years of public debate and political initiative, the Women’s Congress (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.kongreskobiet.pl">www.kongreskobiet.pl</ext-link>) launched a citizens’ project in 2009 for a 50% quota on electoral lists, which was debated in parliament. Despite much opposition in the past, even the governing liberal-conservative Platforma Obywatelska (Citizens’ Platform) held it at this time wise to support the compromise of a 35% quota, which was finally adopted in late 2010.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn15-1350506812456641">15</xref></sup></p>
<p>Many causes pursued by women’s organizations in Poland derived from practical gender interests arising in the daily work situation, caused by the present-day gendered division of labour, such as welfare assistance for mothers. The legal framework has proven to be a useful instrument, whether for providing legal counselling or for pressing demands for further legislation in the area of women’s rights. It must be noted that, in the past, this path has proven to be more successful in Poland than attempts to base demands for equal rights on arguments of social justice, because many affiliate the latter with the discredited state socialism.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn16-1350506812456641">16</xref></sup> Additionally, utilizing the human rights frame, the women’s movement was able to align many of its issues with other important national discourses: women’s rights were linked with standpoint of the democratic opposition in the 1970s; incorporating women’s rights into the discussion of the ‘return to Europe’ endeavour most political elites in Poland supported.</p>

<title>Strategic litigation</title>
<p>Strategic litigation – i.e. supporting, advising and funding of test cases that could significantly enforce or change law and legal practices – is a slowly developing field of work in Polish NGOs. It requires funds, expertise, experience and a complainant who is willing to go through the process. Even so, some cases have been prosecuted in order to catch political and public attention and raise awareness. A likely facilitating factor for the increased utilization is that legal counselling and legal literacy activities are important and widespread work in Polish women’s NGOs.</p>
<p>The Women’s Rights Centre (Centrum Praw Kobiet, CPK) has since emerged as the main supporter of legal empowerment. They have a comprehensive advocacy strategy (legal counselling and up-to-date publications, psychological help, shelter for victims of domestic violence, training for decision-makers and experts). These activities are indirectly supported by the Helsinki Foundation for Human Rights (HFHR), which has run a strategic litigation programme since 2004 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.hfhrpol.waw.pl/precedens">www.hfhrpol.waw.pl/precedens</ext-link>) and has supported all important human rights cases in Poland, whether through <italic>amicus</italic><sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn17-1350506812456641">17</xref></sup> briefs, testimony in court or legal support and counselling on a <italic>pro bono</italic> basis, including both cases analysed in this article. The HFHR supports legal cases that strive to change legal provisions as well as cases that raise awareness about human rights:<disp-quote>
<p>We litigate this case because we know that it is a problem of human rights. So, we choose one individual case, but not to obtain precedent judgement, because the law is pretty clear.

(Interview <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-1350506812456641">Bodnar, 2008</xref>)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Still it should be noted that women’s organizations like the Women’s Rights Centre or the Family Planning Federation (the latter supported the Tysiąc case) were not consciously ‘hunting for strategic cases’; rather, it was the problems they handled that determined the use of the litigation track (Interviews <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr80-1350506812456641">Federacja, 2008</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-1350506812456641">CPK, 2008</xref>).</p>

<title>Abortion debate and Tysiąc case</title>
<p>Women’s civil rights and control of their bodies became a crucial issue during the Polish transformation. Since the summer of 1989, politicians have repeatedly initiated debates on the re-criminalization of abortion. Eventually, a very restrictive regulation came into force in 1993, which allows abortion in Poland only on medical grounds,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn18-1350506812456641">18</xref></sup> or if the pregnancy is the result of rape (Article 4a, Dz. U. 1993r. Nr. 17, poz. 78). In 1996, the parliament reintroduced social grounds for an abortion; however, a year later the Constitutional Court declared them unconstitutional (K. 26/96 of the Constitutional Court, 28 May 1997). The nascent women’s movement had been too weak at the time to prevent this; nonetheless, the liberalization of the abortion law remains one of the principal demands of the women’s movement. Numerous attempts to effect a change in the law have yet to be successful.</p>
<p>Reproductive rights were placed on the agenda in most post-socialist states as disputes over the nature of citizenship, autonomy, democracy and the nation-state ignited. It is important to understand that in the Polish abortion conflict, Catholic-conservative, state-socialist and modern liberal ideas and gender concepts continue to clash. The Church has played a dominant role in the discussion, blocking the promotion of ‘new moral values’, a ‘civilization of life’ opposed to the ‘civilization of death’ of communism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1350506812456641">Heinen and Portet, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1350506812456641">Nowicka, 2007</xref>: 185). Polish feminists and political scientists have criticized the clergy for such direct political interventions. In this manner, the Church has achieved some institutionalized influence (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1350506812456641">Agnosiewicz, 2009</xref>); it also has generated a professional network of mostly informal contacts and consultations with various political party delegates and administration officials so that its political influence remains covert (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1350506812456641">Hierlemann, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>In the public debate on abortion up to 1993, the pro-life advocates labelled abortion ‘murder’, designating that the foetus is self-aware and therefore a ‘person’. This strategy has since altered the public language on the subject (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1350506812456641">Kramer, 2010</xref>). Pro-choice parliamentarians have mainly employed needs-based arguments to thwart a ban on abortion. This did not resonate well with constituency members given that the historical memory of the misery of illegal abortions before 1956 has faded (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1350506812456641">Nowicka, 2007</xref>: 174ff.). The women’s movement took a different stance from the very beginning, arguing in legal terms. This utilization of international law and its covenants has had a most significant effect on the political situation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1350506812456641">Fuchs, 2003</xref>: 199–203). Pro-choice activists have been working to broaden the reproductive rights frame. They state that abortion is part of the bigger social issue of unwanted pregnancies, the lack of sex education, conscious parenthood and unrestricted contraceptive access. Advocates of pro-choice now claim the right of women to reproductive health, information and participation in medical and social programmes; they also demand their access to health care services such as assisted reproduction.</p>
<p>Since 1996, the Family Planning Federation, Federacja, has gained empirical credibility through its regular reports on the anti-abortion law in Poland and through the sponsoring of three tribunals since 2000 with testimonies of neglect, contempt and denial of legal abortions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1350506812456641">Federacja, 2007b</xref>). Nevertheless, it has taken many years to establish legitimacy for women’s individualist rights given the conservative hegemony of women as national heroines who subordinate their own needs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1350506812456641">Nowicka, 2007</xref>: 177).</p>
<p>Official data on legal abortions show a substantial decrease in the number of abortions since 1997, from 3047 cases to 499 in 2008. Strikingly, abortions on medical grounds have also declined from 409 cases in 1997 to only 32 in 2008 (Rada <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1350506812456641">Ministrów, 2009</xref>: 52; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-1350506812456641">Szymański, 2009</xref>: 125). This strongly suggests that many women with health problems cannot execute their right to a legal abortion in the public health sector (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1350506812456641">Bodnar, 2008</xref>). According to other sources, illegal abortions are widespread – up to 140,000 annually (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1350506812456641">Federacja, 2007a</xref>: 22–29); although these are mostly performed by physicians, they are very expensive. Most neighbouring countries are experiencing considerable abortion tourism by Polish women (<italic>Gazeta Wyborcza</italic>, 27 August 2010). At the same time, public opinion has become increasingly conservative over the last 10 years regarding the termination of pregnancies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1350506812456641">CBOS, 2010a</xref>: 4). This denotes a significant dissonance between social reality and dominant values and discourses (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1350506812456641">Nowicka, 2007</xref>: 190–194) and requires further research.</p>
<p>Against this backdrop, the failure to actually be able to go through with an abortion that had been approved on medical grounds became the first straightforward women’s rights case, which Polish NGOs brought before the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR). In 2000, Alicja Tysiąc became pregnant for the third time. However, suffering from severe myopia and retina degeneration, her ophthalmologist had warned her against a further pregnancy; hence she tried to obtain permission for an abortion on medical grounds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1350506812456641">Bodnar, 2008</xref>: 56–64; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1350506812456641">Federacja, 2007b</xref>: 32–35). It was only with the help of Federacja’s counselling services that she was able to find an internist who was willing to issue the required medical certificate. Nevertheless, the responsible gynaecologist at the public hospital she went to for the abortion alleged that the certificate was invalid and destroyed it.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn19-1350506812456641">19</xref></sup> Unable to afford an illegal abortion, Alicja Tysiąc gave birth to a daughter. As a result, her eyesight deteriorated further and she had a retinal haemorrhage. She pressed criminal charges against the doctor who had refused carry out the abortion but lost in two instances with no possibility of appeal. Simultaneously, she lodged a complaint with the regional and national Medical Association accusing the gynaecologist of violation of rule of conduct, which was also rejected.</p>
<p>Having exhausted all possible legal actions at the national level, Alicja Tysiąc brought her case to the ECHR in January 2003. After the Court declared the case admissible in February 2006, it determined a year later that Poland had violated Article 8 of the European Convention of Human Rights, the right to privacy and family life. It ruled that Poland has no effective legal framework for pregnant women to assert their right to abortion on medical grounds and no effective mechanism capable of determining whether the conditions for obtaining a lawful abortion had been met. The Court ruled furthermore that Poland should ensure some form of procedure before an independent and competent body, which, after a personal interview with the pregnant woman, should promptly issue written grounds for its decision. Bearing in mind the very nature of the issues involved in the decision to terminate a pregnancy, the ECHR observed that the existing procedures should also ensure that decisions are made in due time to limit or prevent damage to a woman’s health (ECHR press release, 20 March 2007).</p>
<p>The Polish state was required to pay €25,000 in damages to Alicja Tysiąc. Procedural amendments took longer and were passed in 2009/2010 in the Bill on Patients’ Rights and its ordinance. The Federacja has criticized repeatedly, however, that the bill now specifies that a grievance procedure before a medical commission cannot be appealed and the fact that decisions must be made within 30 days, which, in the case of a denial, is definitely too long for a woman to seek alternatives (<italic>Gazeta Wyborcza</italic>, 16 October 2009; Art. 31, Dz. U. 2009r. No. 52, poz. 417 and Dz. U. 2010r. No. 41, poz. 244).</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the law case illustrates the significance of litigation in mobilizing interest in and solidarity with the Polish women’s movement. With the help of domestic and international attorneys as well as international NGOs specializing in strategic human rights litigation, the Federacja and the HFHR supported Alicja Tysiąc’s case in Strasbourg. This case also demonstrates how strategic litigation can develop out of the everyday counselling activities of women’s organization.</p>
<p>In addition, this case study illustrates the positive impact that strategic litigation can have on a claimant’s awareness of her rights and her self-confidence in her status as a rights-bearing citizen. Initially, Alicja Tysiąc made appearances in public only incognito; however, in the course of the legal actions she gradually acknowledged that there was no need to be ashamed, she was simply demanding her rights (interview <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr80-1350506812456641">Federacja, 2008</xref>). Thus, in a process of exemplary personal empowerment, the claimant’s perspective on the problem of denied abortions was also changed, with the process clearly politicizing and radicalizing her. At a press conference on the ECHR ruling, she commented:<disp-quote>
<p>I am very pleased with the Strasbourg Tribunal’s sentence; I am sorry I had to go as far away as there to find justice. . . . Every woman should decide for herself if she wants to have a child or not, and the government should not be involved in this. (<italic>Gazeta Wyborcza</italic>, 20 March 2007)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Finally, the case generated enormous publicity worldwide, thus underscoring the impact that reporting on litigation can have on the public opinion. Apart from its radical right wing, the Polish media eventually came forward in favour of Alicja Tysiąc.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn20-1350506812456641">20</xref></sup> This agenda-setting function was particularly important since the media have been a key platform from which pro-life and pro-choice lobbies advanced their cause (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1350506812456641">Kramer, 2005</xref>). Furthermore, the secrecy cultivated around abortion is considered the most crucial barrier in the struggle for legalization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1350506812456641">Nowicka, 2007</xref>: 193ff.). Additionally, the ECHR ruling fuelled and polarized the debate in Poland on the introduction of a total ban on abortion into the Constitution (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1350506812456641">Heinen and Portet, 2009</xref>: 20–23).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn21-1350506812456641">21</xref></sup></p>
<p>Although the Tysiąc ruling was not about the legality of abortion, the ECHR did send Polish authorities an explicit reminder that they must provide fast, transparent and accessible procedures for complaints against a denial of legal abortion. Whether or not the Polish state has truly complied with this court demand has yet to be subject to judicial review. Meanwhile, a similar case is now pending in Strasbourg (the case of A. L., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1350506812456641">Federacja, 2007b</xref>: 41–44). As this case study suggests, the ECHR is, in principle, a useful avenue for the safeguarding of human rights. However, it is not a path for quick remedies and it is not in itself sufficient to solve such problems.</p>

<title>Employment rights: The Biedronka cases</title>
<p>Mobilization of Polish citizens for social and economic rights has received considerable less scholarly attention than for civil rights issues such as the ban on abortion. This is true even though the consequences of economic transformation to a market economy were severe: structural changes, marked income differences and ever-increasing regional disparities. Privatization of businesses and liberalization of labour laws has also led to open discrimination of women in terms of employment practices, dismissals, payment, sexual harassment, maternity leave and career development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1350506812456641">Fundacja Feminoteka et al., 2009</xref>: 39–73; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1350506812456641">Hardy et al., 2008</xref>: 104–110; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1350506812456641">Leven, 2008</xref>: 123–126; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-1350506812456641">UNDP, 2007</xref>: Ch. 3). The cutback of the welfare state, resulting in the curtailment of welfare benefits such as in community childcare, hurts mothers in particular since they always have been and continue to be the primary care givers. Recent studies show that in situations where a choice must be made, when confronted with the need to choose between family life and employment, Polish women tend to favour the latter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1350506812456641">Plomien, 2009</xref>). However, women’s chances are strongly influenced by education and class. Generally better educated than Polish men, women have fared better in maintaining, for example, their positions in the restructured and increasingly important financial sector of Poland than many blue-collar workers in their professions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1350506812456641">Leven, 2008</xref>: 126–131). On the other hand, new professions have emerged in the service economy with job opportunities especially for women; the working conditions especially in the retail sector are highly exploitative and characterized by low wages, long working hours, high staff turnover and severe working stress.</p>
<p>Seeking help to claim labour rights, Polish women, however, have few choices where to turn. Labour unions are not particularly popular in Poland (only about 15% of all employees are currently union members) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1350506812456641">CBOS, 2010c</xref>: 1), particularly in the new sectors of the private economy. Moreover, trade union pluralism is widespread here, which means, apart from some public sectors and state-owned enterprises, the labour unions tend to be weak (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1350506812456641">Ost, 2007</xref>). In Solidarność and the former socialist All Polish Trade Union Federation (OPZZ), two major trade unions in Poland, women’s employment rights are not particularly high on the agenda. Considering their comparatively high membership percentage in these trade unions (38% and 48% respectively), women are underrepresented in all decision-making bodies. Their women’s division are heavily understaffed and the trade unions have yet to implement substantial and binding gender equality policies (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-1350506812456641">Sechi, 2007</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn22-1350506812456641">22</xref></sup> Consequently, voicing one’s interests through NGOs as in the Biedronka case has emerged as an alternative opportunity.</p>
<p>Biedronka is a Portuguese-owned supermarket chain that generally only employed cashiers; hiring no additional help for cleaning tasks, unloading the trucks and refilling shelves. Cashiers were also expected to do all work manually, with no equipment to aid them; the results were overtime or even double shifts. In 2004, (former) employees informed the Polish state labour inspection agency that Biedronka was not paying its employees overtime and, at the same time, was seriously violating occupational health and safety regulations. The <italic>Gazeta Wyborcza</italic> published commentaries on this situation in Biedronka stores in their numerous local news sections, receiving a vast amount of responses from other employees in turn.</p>
<p>The first person to sue the company was Bożena Łopacka, claiming that the supermarket chain owed its employees and her, a shop manager, about 35,000 PLN in unpaid overtime (then about €10,000). The Association of Persons Aggrieved by Biedronka, a group founded in Olsztyn by suppliers who Biedronka had cheated, quickly supported Ms Łopacka. Among other things, the Association provided her with a <italic>pro bono</italic> lawyer, Lech Obara. The Helsinki Foundation also provided support in order to:<disp-quote>
<p>. . . show that this is a human rights problem and to show that she is not a crazy lady that claims some damages, but that she is a real person who fights for her rights and that her case has a consequence for the whole movement of the workers in supermarkets. (Interview <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-1350506812456641">Bodnar, 2008</xref>)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>This legal assistance primarily encompassed strategic and media consulting. The Foundation also filed an <italic>amicus</italic> brief. After several trials and appeals, Łopacka was awarded 26,000 PLN in damages by the court in July 2007, which Biedronka eventually paid.</p>
<p>The bad publicity the Biedronka chain received also alerted various other NGOs to these women’s working conditions: consequently, the Friedrich Ebert Foundation and the KARAT network conducted a collaborative project to raise awareness of employees and the State Labour Inspection alike. Encouraged and supported by the Association of Persons Aggrieved by Biedronka, further employees also sought legal redress.</p>
<p>A key factor in effective legal mobilization as movement strategy is media attention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1350506812456641">McCann, 1994</xref>: 58–68). This also held true in this case. As one Association activist put it,<disp-quote>
<p>There were always discussions about supermarkets and work; my acquaintances worked in different supermarkets, and it was always a topic, but never spoken aloud, because everyone was scared and it was a fuse . . . eventually, somebody said it publicly. . . . When one person said it, the second joined, then the third, then the rest stopped being afraid, and they started to talk about it. (Interview former Biedronka employee, December <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr81-1350506812456641">2008</xref>)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Many studies on media reporting of civil litigation have confirmed a relationship between reporting and the population’s perceptions on litigation, as well as its influence on the decision-making of involved actors, including potential litigants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1350506812456641">Robbennolt and Studebaker, 2003</xref>; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1350506812456641">Jäckel, 2011</xref>: 189–220). Furthermore, the effects of mass media on public opinion are central points of reference for political decision-makers. They get their information and direction from ‘published opinion’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1350506812456641">Neidhardt, 1994</xref>: 25–27) and take it into account when making political decisions. Therefore, it is crucial for political actors to catch media attention when seeking support for their issues. For social movement actors, media standing may sometimes be the only form of political influence available.</p>
<p>In the wake of escalating complaints, the State Labour Inspection Office (Państwowa Inspekcja Pracy) stepped up its monitoring of supermarkets. As a result, officials found numerous violations of rules covering working hours, occupational health and safety. In the course of my research, interviews were held with former employees. Four out of five women we interviewed had suffered very serious workplace accidents and three of them are thus disabled today. Despite the intervention of the State Labour Inspection Office, Biedronka stores remain understaffed. In the opinion of many, the state agency was equipped with too little authority and thus limited in what it could legally do.</p>
<p>Former employees and activists who eventually sued Biedronka expressed remarkable determination and a strong sense of justice. To them, legal mobilization was a way to regain their dignity. Their narratives offer invaluable insights into personal motives and processes of legal mobilization:<disp-quote>
<p>Not for a moment did I have the thought: ‘For sure, I will not make it.’ No! I will make it, because I have the court of first instance, second instance . . . I have Strasbourg and will not give up. (Interview former Biedronka employee, December <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr81-1350506812456641">2008</xref>)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Another activist who was fired after her sick leave as a result of a serious workplace accident, commented:<disp-quote>
<p>Actually, the company treated [its employees] like expired commodities which are only good for the dump. Therefore, this rebellion arose within me, and I decided to go to the court. (Interview former Biedronka employee, January <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr81-1350506812456641">2009</xref>)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>It is possible to conclude from the interviews that the more intensive their mutual support, the better they survived the stress and strains of the long trial and the necessity of job reorientation. Proceedings were overlong, complicated and ambiguous; some complainants might have given up or agreed to a settlement simply because they were exhausted or they needed money for the rent – a perfect leverage for the employers.</p>
<p>The Biedronka cases generated popular outrage and some political mobilization, although not primarily for women’s rights. The scandalizing of Biedronka’s working and employment conditions was possible thanks to a supportive media discourse and to individuals who dared to publicize their cases. The press acted as watchdog, a true fourth power in the state. An analysis of two quality newspapers – <italic>Gazeta Wyborcza</italic> and <italic>Rzeczpospolita</italic> – yielded over 100 articles between 2004 and 2007 dealing with the Biedronka proceedings, rulings and penal investigations, local sections not included (see SSRN, 2011: 23–30). These newspaper articles often characterized the claimants as Davids fighting Goliath, as aggrieved yet determined persons fighting for their rights. However, their gender was never made an explicit issue. In about half of these articles, claimants or their lawyers were quoted directly or indirectly (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1350506812456641">Ferree Marx et al., 2002</xref>: 13), in contrast to only one-third carrying significantly shortened quotes from the employer. The case victims had a considerable stronger standing in the newspaper articles than in comparable cases in Western Europe. Also, overall media reporting was several times higher than it was for similar cases in France, Switzerland or Germany. Most activists in these Western countries did not give media coverage and PR as great an importance as their Polish colleagues did. This implies the higher prevalence of strategic litigation as a movement strategy in Poland (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-1350506812456641">Fuchs, 2011</xref>). The Polish newspapers wrote mainly about the issues at stake, i.e. the actual working conditions, but rarely discussed possible political consequences. They depicted court trials as a promising path: for once, they did not criticize but actually supported the judicial system.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, it is important to note that (social) justice rather than gender was at the centre of the public discourse. However, activists did often concede that women are often more dependent on employers like Biedronka than men, since the latter are more likely able to find better (paying) positions. Yet, only one activist explicitly tagged this <italic>discrimination</italic> against women. With their emphasis on the perception of male and female occupations, the former employees found a leverage to criticize Biedronka, namely, for forcing women to do heavy ‘male’ work that placed their health at risk.</p>
<p>In contrast to the abortion debate, activists most often referred to national labour regulations rather than to international law to support their case in the public. It is possible to conclude that the employees’ demands did not need such comprehensive legitimization in Poland. Legal mobilization was still seen as the most promising means of attaining workers’ rights. This, however, reflects the weakness of organized labour vis-a-vis employers, rather than a belief in the efficacy of Polish courts.</p>
<p>The future of employment rights in Poland depends on the ability of the union movement to incorporate interests of new workers’ groups, political initiatives to change labour law (interview <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-1350506812456641">Bujara, 2008</xref>), as well as the ability of state agencies to enforce laws passed. This case of strategic litigation used to fight labour exploitation demonstrates that adverse political structures of opportunity, a comparatively small NGO sector and general low trust in judicial institutions can be overcome by provoking popular outrage about scandalous cases, by building coalitions among various NGOs and by a positive media discourse. In this case, strategic litigation clearly contributed to high visibility and encouraged citizens to stand up for their rights, even though the political consequences were small.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>This article set out to address the questions, to what extent can an appeal to the law and the courts be a promising avenue to achieve social change for women’s rights in Poland under conditions of an emergent rule of law, and how do the achievements of such legal mobilization fit in with other social movement strategies? The framing of international law and human rights when voicing political demands in Poland constitutes the argumentative basis for all legal mobilizations, but resonates only partly with prevalent national reference frames of rights and the law. Although Poland is predominantly perceived as belonging to the Western world of values and norms – a good precondition – women’s individual rights are not widely accepted there, as became evident in the their conflict on abortion. Little has changed over the last two decades with the exception of an increase in legal awareness.</p>
<p>Litigation can help to implement and strengthen people’s rights by aiming at legal changes, by helping individuals or by politicizing them. Successful examples of court lawsuits occur at different stages of movement mobilization. The Tysiąc case was the result of political mobilization, while the Biedronka affair preceded it. The Tysiąc case was an integral part of a larger process of agenda-setting and one of several strategies implemented to fight for reproductive rights. It was the outcome of earlier organizing efforts, such as the establishment of the Federacja, and its long-standing political and practical activities for reproductive rights. Voicing political demands by means of a legal case however meant changing the perspective of one’s arguments. The Tysiąc case did not primarily deal with the more fundamental issue of women’s right to self-determination. It was chiefly about a narrower, technical issue, namely the necessity of fast and accessible judicial review. Yet, restricted as the trial itself was, the discourse emerging around the trial did in fact give Alicja Tysiąc an opportunity at her press conference to personally reintroduce the larger issue of women’s rights. While the frame on women’s reproductive rights was narrowed, the frame on the democratic rule of law was opened up. Accordingly, many followers were able to join in the discussion on due process under the rule of law without declaring their position on abortions. This case of strategic gender interests thus enabled concerned Polish NGO actors to reintegrate the issue into the larger frame of women’s self-determination – a frame that already existed in a broader context.</p>
<p>In the Biedronka affair, legal mobilization constituted the starting point of organizing for workplace rights and for consciousness-raising, i.e. for political activity. Individuals gained recognition as well as indemnities through their court rulings, and the positive media coverage generated the sense that it is worth fighting for one’s labour rights. Viewing practical gender interests, gender was or remained essentialized in the Biedronka case. The activists were not yet able to fall back upon an established discourse of gender workplace justice and fighting structural discrimination. Legal mobilization alone and in isolation from political activity does not solve problems; in this case: does not improve actual working conditions. Trade unions are weak and not well represented in the supermarkets. Employers have worked to prevent unionization of their enterprises, and they still reject collective bargaining, which could improve working conditions or adherence to protective labour laws. Furthermore, state institutions like the labour inspections are also ineffective and understaffed. Under such conditions, unorganized labour is hampered in its attempts to launch initiatives for legal amendments. This makes litigation the more valuable.</p>
<p>Public attention and media coverage have been crucial for agenda-setting, but cannot replace political initiatives. By means of strategic litigation and the employment of the law frame, public attention can be drawn to a social problem. With the help of the media and public relations, it is possible to scandalize social injustices. In cases where the law is quite clear – as with the labour law violations at supermarkets – litigation serves to mobilize the public and civil society. Ideally, mobilization can result in political activities or attempts to change the law. Few legislative initiatives arose out of the Biedronka cases however. In cases where the law lacks clarity or has substantial gaps – as was in the Tysiąc case – litigation serves to generate pressure for legal amendments. In other words, it is more directly addressed to the state. In short, the societal acknowledgement of women’s rights cannot be attained through one-off legal cases or by strategic litigation alone, but through sustained and combined efforts of the stakeholders.</p>
<p>The case studies discussed here also point to several hurdles standing in the way of legal mobilization. In the end, only a handful of cases for women’s rights went to court and were used strategically. This is because strategic litigation is extremely costly for NGOs, which have serious funding problems. More generally, legal procedures are protracted, complicated and sometimes there is the risk of corruption. Personal exposure and pressure is very high, remedies may be meagre, results uncertain. Given these liabilities, going to court often is not the most promising avenue to achieve justice for the specific case at stake.</p>
<p>Regarding the limitations of litigation, Polish experts, in particular, have voiced practical concerns. In Western Europe, in contrast, strategic litigation is often seen as depoliticizing and distracting from strategies that are more promising (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-1350506812456641">Wilde, 2006</xref>). The activists and claimants, who stated that litigation sometimes is the only avenue to justice, speak from a position of the weak and marginalized: at times courts are seen as the last resort to get one’s rights. However, a low level of legal mobilization in itself does not allude to weak movements. Going to court constitutes an additional, promising channel for realizing important goals. In general, legal strategies are embedded in more comprehensive organizational activities. If networks are built and organizational activities are sustainable, and if activists get support from a broad range of NGOs or foundations, political successes are possible. These could include agenda-setting and legal amendments.</p>
<p>Overall, given conducive conditions, legal mobilization tends to have direct effects on laws or practices. In addition, it also has a socializing effect on the population and its legal awareness. Neither of the two should be underrated. Accordingly, by setting their sights on both the state and the society the Polish women’s movement has been able to record modest but crucial democratic achievements.</p>

<p>In first world countries with long established democracies, such as those found in Western Europe, the use of strategic litigation to advance women’s rights may be seen as ‘selling coal to Newcastle’ to many who regard all basic human rights, women’s rights included, as guaranteed and generally respected.

<p>The case law of the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR), which examines violations of the European Convention of Human Rights in member states of the Council of Europe and is becoming an increasingly popular ‘last resort’ against corrupt, discriminatory or negligent state authorities in Eastern Europe, confirms this assertion: in the last 10 years, nearly half the rulings against Poland were for the violation of the right to a trial within a reasonable period of time, cf.
