<abstract>
<p>The Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009 (BPCIA) creates a pathway for expedited FDA approval of follow-on biologic drugs. As part of this pathway, the BPCIA includes special procedures to resolve patent disputes between the brand, or reference product sponsor, and the follow-on drug manufacturer. This article outlines the basics of the BPCIA and details procedures that reference product sponsors and follow-on applicants will follow to resolve patent issues under the Act. Finally, the article notes that the BPCIA patent dispute mechanism may lead to several unintended consequences: (1) it may be unlikely to provide patent certainty to the parties because it may not address the full portfolio of patents covering a biologic product; (2) it may also be unlikely to raise and resolve all pertinent patent issues prior to FDA approval; and (3) it is unclear whether there is a manner in which parties can enforce the rules of the patent dispute mechanism. At this time, no drug has been approved under the BPCIA, and no litigation has begun under the BPCIA's patent resolution procedures. While this article identifies potential outcomes, it will be important to monitor real-world experiences over the next several years.</p>

<body>
<p>The FDA approves prescription drug medicines for marketing in the United States through two different statutes, depending on the drug’s method of manufacture. Small molecule drugs are manufactured by chemical synthesis and are approved under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&amp;C Act).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1741134312454258">1</xref></sup> Since 1984, the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act (Hatch-Waxman Act) has provided an accelerated regulatory pathway for generic versions of approved small molecule drugs.</p>
<p>Biologic drugs, on the other hand, are derived from living organisms or manufactured in living cells using recombinant technologies, and are approved under the Public Health Safety Act (“PHS Act”).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1741134312454258">2</xref></sup> For many years, there was no mechanism for accelerated approval of follow-on versions of approved biologic drugs. This changed in 2010 when Congress enacted the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009 (BPCIA), creating the first framework for expedited FDA approval of follow-on biologic drugs.</p>
<p>At this time, the FDA has not approved a follow-on application under the BPCIA, and no litigation has begun under the BPCIA’s patent resolution procedures. Because the law is still in its early days, this article first outlines the basics of the BPCIA. Then, it details the complicated procedures of the BPCIA patent dispute mechanism. Finally, this article notes that the patent dispute mechanism may lead to several unintended consequences: (1) the BPCIA patent dispute mechanism may be unlikely to provide patent certainty to the parties because it may not address the full portfolio of patents covering a biologic product; (2) it may also be unlikely to raise and resolve all pertinent patent issues prior to FDA approval; and (3) it is unclear whether there is a manner in which parties can enforce the rules of the patent dispute mechanism.</p>
<p>When reviewing BPCIA basics, it is important to note that the BPCIA is not Hatch-Waxman II. It creates a unique pathway for approval of follow-on biologic drugs. For example, under Hatch-Waxman, generic applicants are not required to duplicate the clinical testing of drugs already proven safe and effective. Rather, to be approved, the applicant must show that its generic drug product is the same as the branded drug product. The BPCIA does not require that the follow-on product be the “same” as the reference product. Biologic drugs are significantly more complex than small products and the idea of “sameness” is not generally appropriate for any biologic drug.</p>
<p>The BPCIA applies two terms to follow-on biologic drugs: biosimilar and interchangeable. “Biosimilar” refers to biologic drugs that are “highly similar to the reference product notwithstanding minor differences in clinically inactive components” and “there are no clinically meaningful differences between the biological product and the reference product in terms of safety, purity, and potency of the product.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-1741134312454258">3</xref></sup> “Interchangeable” refers to biologic drugs that “may be substituted for the reference product without the intervention of the healthcare provider who prescribed the reference product.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-1741134312454258">4</xref></sup></p>
<p>The BPCIA contains exclusivity provisions for the reference product. The FDA cannot accept an follow-on application within 4 years of the reference product’s license date.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-1741134312454258">5</xref></sup> The FDA also cannot approve follow-on application within 12 years of the reference product’s license date.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-1741134312454258">6</xref></sup> The reference product sponsor does not receive additional exclusivity for: (1) supplements to the reference product application; (2) non-structural changes that result in new indications, routes of administration, dosing schedules, dosage forms, delivery systems, delivery devices, or strengths; or (3) structural modifications that do not change the product’s safety, purity, or potency.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-1741134312454258">7</xref></sup></p>
<p>The reference product sponsor is eligible for additional pediatric exclusivity. If the FDA determines that information relating to the use of a new biological product in the pediatric population may produce health benefits in that population, then FDA may request pediatric studies. If the reference product sponsor completes the studies in accordance with the FDA request, then the 4-year exclusivity is extended to 4-years and 6 months, and the 12-year exclusivity also receives a 6-month extension.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-1741134312454258">8</xref></sup> Similarly, if a branded biologic has been designated an orphan drug, then the FDA may approve a follow-on application until the expiration of the latter of the 7-year orphan drug exclusivity period or the 12-year data exclusivity period. The orphan drug exclusivity runs concurrently with the 12-year exclusivity period.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-1741134312454258">9</xref></sup></p>
<p>The BPCIA also provides 12–42 months exclusivity for the first-filing interchangeable biological product.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-1741134312454258">10</xref></sup> Unlike the 180-day exclusivity provisions of Hatch-Waxman, which require generic entry to trigger exclusivity, this exclusivity runs regardless of whether the interchangeable product enters the market.</p>
<p>One of the more complicated provisions of the BPCIA is the patent dispute mechanism. It begins when the FDA notifies the follow-on applicant that its application has been accepted for review.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-1741134312454258">11</xref></sup> Within 20 days, the follow-on applicant provides the reference product sponsor with a copy of its entire follow-on application and “other information that describes the process or processes used to manufacture the biological product that is the subject of [the follow-on] application.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-1741134312454258">12</xref></sup> The follow-on applicant may also, “provide to the reference sponsor additional information requested by or on behalf of the reference sponsor.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-1741134312454258">13</xref></sup></p>
<p>In recent draft guidance, the FDA indicated that the follow-on application will include “extensive structural and functional characterization of both the proposed product and the reference product, which serves as the foundation of a biosimilar development program.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn14-1741134312454258">14</xref></sup> It appears likely that this characterization data also will be shared with the reference product sponsor. The data shared between the follow-on applicant and the reference sponsor will likely include the follow-on applicant's commercially sensitive and trade secret information.</p>
<p>The BPCIA identifies the parties that may review receive the follow-on application and manufacturing data. The data may be shared with one or more attorneys designated by the reference product sponsor, who are not employed by the reference product sponsor, so long as these attorneys do not engage in patent prosecution of the reference product. The BPCIA refers to this category as “outside counsel,” however, the BPCIA is silent on whether these attorneys must represent the reference product sponsor. The BPCIA does not limit the number of outside counsel who may view the follow-on application and manufacturing data.</p>
<p>The follow-on application and manufacturing data also may be shared with one “in-house” attorney so long as he or she does not engage in patent prosecution related to the reference product.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn15-1741134312454258">15</xref></sup> This may pose a problem for any company where all in-house attorneys are engaged in patent prosecution, because under the BPCIA none of these attorneys would be eligible to review the follow-on’s data. If a patent is licensed exclusively to the reference product sponsor, but the patent holder retains a right to enforce, then a representative of the patent holder also may view the application and manufacturing data.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn16-1741134312454258">16</xref></sup> There are no provisions for sharing the follow-on application or manufacturing data with any medical, scientific, manufacturing, or business personnel who may understand the reference product sponsor’s patent claims.</p>
<p>The BPCIA provides that the follow-on application and manufacturing data shall be used “for the sole and exclusive purpose” of determining whether the reference product sponsor could reasonably assert that the follow-on product infringes patents either assigned to, or exclusively licensed by, the reference product sponsor.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn17-1741134312454258">17</xref></sup> The BPCIA does not contain adjudication provisions for misuse of confidential data.</p>
<p>Within 60 days after the reference product sponsor receives the follow-on application and other materials from the follow-on applicant, the reference product sponsor must provide the follow-on applicant with a list of patents for which it believes infringement “reasonably could be asserted” against the follow-on applicant. This list is limited to patents held by, or exclusively licensed to, the reference product sponsor. The reference product sponsor must also identify any patents that it would license to the follow-on applicant.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn18-1741134312454258">18</xref></sup> If the reference product sponsor does not timely include a patent on this list, then it “may not bring an action under this section for infringement of the patent with respect to the biological product.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn19-1741134312454258">19</xref></sup> While the reference product sponsor may not bring litigation under 42 U.S.C. § 262(l), the statute does not appear to limit the reference product sponsor’s right to assert traditional patent claims.</p>
<p>Within 60 days after the follow-on applicant receives the patent list from the reference product sponsor, the follow-on applicant responds. It tells the reference product sponsor either that it will not market the follow-on product until after patent expiry, or it provides with “a detailed statement that describes, on a claim by claim basis” that the patents identified by the reference product sponsor are invalid, unenforceable, or will not be infringed by commercial marketing of the follow-on product.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn20-1741134312454258">20</xref></sup> The follow-on applicant may also identify additional patents, not identified by the reference product sponsor, which the follow-on applicant believes may be infringed by commercial marketing of its product. The follow-on applicant's expanded list is limited to patents held by the reference product sponsor. Third-party patents are unavailable. If the follow-on offers an expanded list, then it must also state whether it believes the patents are invalid, unenforceable, or not infringed, or that it will refrain from marketing its product until the patents have expired.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn21-1741134312454258">21</xref></sup></p>
<p>If the follow-on applicant believes that the patents described above are invalid, unenforceable, or not infringed by the follow-on product, then, within 60 days, the reference product sponsor tells the follow-on applicant why it believes the patents are valid, enforceable, and would be infringed by the commercial marketing of the follow-on product.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn22-1741134312454258">22</xref></sup></p>
<p>After the reference product sponsor and the follow-on have exchanged patent lists and position statements, the BPCIA requires parties to engage in good faith negotiations to determine which patents will be the subject of the reference product sponsor’s infringement suit against the follow-on. The timing of this step is uncertain. It begins after the follow-on applicant receives the reference product sponsor’s latest statement, however because there does not appear to be a triggering event to begin these negotiations, this provision may be used to delay the patent resolution process.</p>
<p>If, within 15 days after negotiations begin, the reference product sponsor and the follow-on applicant are able to agree on the patents that will be the subject of litigation, then within 30 days of this agreement, the reference product sponsor files suit. The litigation is limited to the agreed upon patents.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn23-1741134312454258">23</xref></sup> If the reference product sponsor initiates patent litigation more than 30 days after the agreement, then it forfeits its right to an injunction or lost profit damages, and a court may only award a reasonable royalty.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn24-1741134312454258">24</xref></sup> A reasonable royalty is also the only available relief if the reference product sponsor brought the action within 30 days but did not prosecute it “in good faith.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn25-1741134312454258">25</xref></sup> This provision applies only to litigation arising under 35 U.S.C. §262(l). It appears that the reference product sponsor is still entitled to all remedies for litigation brought under traditional U.S. patent law<italic>.</italic></p>
<p>If the parties are not able to come to agreement within 15 days after negotiations begin, then the follow-on applicant tells the reference product sponsor how many patents the reference product sponsor can enforce against it. At this time, the follow-on applicant does not need to identify any patents.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn26-1741134312454258">26</xref></sup></p>
<p>Within 5 days after the follow-on applicant identifies the number of patents that can be enforced against it, the parties exchange lists identifying the patents to be litigated.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn27-1741134312454258">27</xref></sup> The number of patents listed by the reference product sponsor cannot exceed the number listed by the follow-on. If, however, the follow-on previously stated that no patents could be enforced against it, then the reference product sponsor can identify one patent.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn28-1741134312454258">28</xref></sup></p>
<p>If the parties still do not agree on the patents to be litigated, then, “the reference product sponsor shall [within 30 days] bring an action for patent infringement with respect to each patent that is included on such lists.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn29-1741134312454258">29</xref></sup> The statue is unclear, but it appears that this would include all patents listed by the reference product sponsor and all patents listed by the follow-on. As above, if the reference product sponsor initiates patent litigation after 30 days, or brings suit but does not prosecute “in good faith,” then it also forfeits its right to an injunction or lost profit damages.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn30-1741134312454258">30</xref></sup></p>
<p>Finally, within 30 days of being served with the reference product sponsor’s complaint, the follow-on notifies FDA of the suit, and FDA publishes notice of the litigation in the Federal Register.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn31-1741134312454258">31</xref></sup></p>
<p>Patents may issue to, or be exclusively licensed to, the reference product sponsor after the patent resolution process has begun. If the reference product sponsor believes that the follow-on product will infringe these newly issued or licensed patents, then reference product sponsor must provide notice of these patents to the follow-on applicant within 30 days of issuance or licensing.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn32-1741134312454258">32</xref></sup> Within 30 days of receipt, the follow-on applicant must provide a statement that it will not commercially market the follow-on product until the newly issued, or licensed, patent expires, or a statement that the patent is invalid, unenforceable, or not infringed.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn33-1741134312454258">33</xref></sup></p>
<p>Patents that are identified during the patent resolution process but are not included in the initial patent litigation are eligible for injunctive relief. The BPCIA requires the follow-on applicant to notify the reference product sponsor no later than 180 days before the first commercial marketing of the follow-on’s product.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn34-1741134312454258">34</xref></sup> After the reference product sponsor receives this 180-day notice, but before commercial marketing begins, the reference product sponsor is allowed to seek a preliminary injunction to prevent the follow-on from engaging in commercial marketing until validity, enforceability, and infringement are resolved. The reference product sponsor may seek preliminary injunction based on any earlier identified patent, or any patent that was not included in the earlier process, “as applicable.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn35-1741134312454258">35</xref></sup></p>
<p>The BPCIA also limits the parties’ declaratory judgment rights based on the follow-on applicant’s actions during the 20-day period for exchange of its follow-on application and manufacturing information. If the follow-on applicant provides this information within the 20-day limit, then neither the follow-on nor the reference product sponsor may seek declaratory judgment based on any subsequently identified patent before the follow-on later provides its 180-day notice of commercial marketing.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn36-1741134312454258">36</xref></sup> If the follow-on applicant fails to provide information during the initial period, then the reference product sponsor may bring a declaratory judgment action for any patent that claims the biological product or a use of the biological product.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn37-1741134312454258">37</xref></sup> Finally, if the follow-on applicant submits information during the 20-day period, but fails to participate in the later exchange of patent information, then the reference product sponsor may bring declaratory judgment for any patent it identified.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn38-1741134312454258">38</xref></sup></p>
<p>The BPCIA patent dispute mechanism may lead to several unintended consequences. First, it may be unlikely to provide patent certainty to the parties because it may not address the full portfolio of patents covering a biologic product. The portfolio of patents covering a biologic product is highly complex. For example, it may include drug target patents, technology platform patents, patents that claim compounds, methods of use, or manufacturing processes, and biomarker patents. Due to the nature of biologic drugs, these portfolios may include patents owned by the reference product sponsor, as well as third-party patents that are licensed exclusively or non-exclusively to the reference product sponsor. Of these, only patents that are held by, or exclusively licensed to, the reference product sponsor will be resolved during the patent resolution process. Patents licensed on a non-exclusive basis are not eligible for the patent resolution process, and issues surrounding validity, enforceability, or infringement, must be resolved after FDA approval.</p>
<p>Second, the BPCIA also is unlikely to raise and resolve all pertinent patent issues prior to FDA approval of the follow-on application. Patents claiming the reference product sponsor product may issue after the process has begun. Patents may also issue after FDA approval. In either situation, the reference product sponsor may need to bring additional litigation to enforce these later-issued patents. The follow-on application and product may also change during the approval process, such that early patent litigation might not apply to the approved product.</p>
<p>Third, it is unclear whether there is a manner in which parties can enforce the rules of the patent dispute mechanism. At the same time, reference product sponsors have no incentive to list their patents and have these patents invalidated or held not infringed by the follow-on product, especially if these issues are resolved several years before follow-on entry. If a reference product sponsor does not identify a patent during the BPCIA process, or begin patent litigation within the time limits of the BPCIA, then it forfeits injunctive and lost profit remedies for litigation <italic>commenced under 35 U.S.C. § 262(l)</italic>. Nothing in the BPCIA appears to impinge on the patent holder’s rights under 35 §101, <italic>et seq</italic>. The reference product sponsor, or any other patent holder, may still bring a patent infringement action after FDA approval.</p>
<p>Finally, and perhaps most importantly, the patent resolution process may lead to consumer harm. Forced sharing of information between rivals about the timing and content of the follow-on application and manufacturing processes could facilitate collusion. For example, this information could facilitate agreements to delay entry, allocate markets, or fix prices. Anticompetitive harm could also arise from providing the reference product sponsor with competitively sensitive information that it could otherwise not obtain. The reference product sponsor may be able to act on this information before approval of the follow-on, and thus pre-empt the innovation and price competition that is likely to occur with follow-on biologic entry. Potential follow-on applicants may be wary of the reference product sponsor’s ability to use its information in this manner and may elect to avoid the BPCIA and seek approval as a branded competitor.</p>
<p>As mentioned above, at this time, no drug has been approved under the BPCIA, and no litigation has begun under the BPCIA’s patent resolution procedures. While this article identifies potential outcomes, it will be important to monitor real-world experiences over the next several years.</p>
