<abstract>
<p>Music-games present a highly pervasive new platform to create, perform, appreciate and transmit music through peer and online communities (e.g., Peppler, Downton, Lindsay, &amp; Hay, 2011). While learners are increasingly engaged with such digital music participation outside the classroom, evidence indicates learners are increasingly disengaged with formal music education (e.g., Abril &amp; Gault, 2008; Dillon, 2003; Lamont &amp; Maton, 2008). The challenge for music educators is to utilize digital music participation as a tool to create new opportunities to inspire and engage learners with music in formal and informal learning contexts (see Hargreaves, Marshall, &amp; North, 2003). The music-game synergy presents a unique, yet relatively untapped, platform to investigate the processes and outcomes of both music and video game participation in a comprehensive context. On one hand, previous research highlights the power of music education to enrich intellectual, social and personal development (e.g., Hallam, 2010), while on the other a growing body of work highlights the educational potential of digital-games to scaffold and enrich learning (e.g., Wastiau, Kearney, &amp; Van den Berghe, 2009). This warrants investigation of the potential of game-based technology to promote engagement with music, and the wider benefits of music-game participation in the lives of learners. In this light, we present a single exploratory case study of a learner’s encounter with Rock Band 3, addressing the learner’s attitudes toward music-games and the music-game experience. It is asserted that music-games are a valuable vehicle to connect formal and informal music participation in the 21st century, embodying fundamental musical concepts in gameplay and authenticating formal participation to the wider musical world of the learner.</p>

<p>The digital revolution is creating new ways to engage with music, facilitating new opportunities to experience the potential intellectual, social and personal benefits of music participation in the classroom and wider world (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1321103X13488032">Gee, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1321103X13488032">North &amp; Hargreaves, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1321103X13488032">Webb, 2007</xref>). While learners are increasingly engaged with digital music technology outside the classroom, evidence indicates that learners are increasingly disengaged with formal music education (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1321103X13488032">Abril &amp; Gault, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1321103X13488032">Durrant &amp; Green, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1321103X13488032">Green, Facer, Rudd, Dillon, &amp; Humphreys, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1321103X13488032">Lamont &amp; Maton, 2008</xref>). The challenge for music educators is to utilize music participation with digital technology as a tool to create new opportunities to inspire and engage learners with music in educational contexts (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1321103X13488032">Hargreaves et al., 2003</xref>). Music-games present one of the most pervasive and popular digital music participation contexts, with growing evidence indicating that informal music making with music-games is inspiring greater interest in music and potentially impacting upon wider musical behavior (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1321103X13488032">Missingham, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1321103X13488032">Peppler et al., 2011</xref>). However, the nature of music-game participation, and the potential for music-games to benefit music education and wider intellectual, social and personal development, remains relatively untapped (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1321103X13488032">Goble, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Music-games can be defined as a digital game-based activity in which music (performance, appreciation and/or creation) is integral to the game mechanic, and in which the player interacts with music through an interface such as conventional or adapted instrument controllers, microphones, dance mats or music creation software, in single or multiplayer contexts. From off-the-shelf entertainment games such as Rock Band by Harmonix (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1321103X13488032">Harmonix, 2010</xref>) to music training games such a RockSmith by Ubisoft (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1321103X13488032">Ubisoft, 2012</xref>), Hear It, Note It! by My Note Games (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1321103X13488032">My Note Games, n.d</xref>.) and Dust Buster Music Ed by Joy Tunes (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1321103X13488032">Joy Tunes, 2013</xref>), learners are widening their musical landscape in digital medium (see <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://musicianswithapps.com">musicianswithapps.com</ext-link> for further examples). Harnessing the potential of music-games to promote opportunities for music participation is an important step in both encouraging exposure to the potential benefits of music, and developing an authentic and inclusive music education.</p>

<title>Informal music-game participation</title>
<p>The power of music education to enrich intellectual, personal and social wellbeing has long been supported by an established body of work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1321103X13488032">Hallam &amp; Creech, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1321103X13488032">Juslin &amp; Sloboda, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1321103X13488032">MacDonald, Miell, &amp; Hargreaves, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1321103X13488032">North &amp; Hargreaves, 2008</xref>). Within the UK, England’s new National Plan for Music Education asserts that:<disp-quote>
<p>The value of music as an academic subject lies in its contribution to enjoyment and enrichment, for its social benefits, for those who engage in music seriously as well as for fun. High quality music education enables lifelong participation in, and enjoyment of, music, as well as underpinning excellence and professionalism for those who choose not to pursue a career in music. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1321103X13488032">Department for Education, 2011</xref>, p. 9)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Indeed, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1321103X13488032">Hargreaves and colleagues (2003)</xref>, among others, assert the need for music education to recognize the importance of informal music participation in determining the nature, success and authenticity of formal music learning (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1321103X13488032">Dillon, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1321103X13488032">Folkestad, Hargreaves, &amp; Lindström 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1321103X13488032">Green, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1321103X13488032">Green et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1321103X13488032">Lamont, Hargreaves, Marshall, &amp; Tarrant, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1321103X13488032">Miell &amp; MacDonald, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1321103X13488032">North &amp; Hargreaves, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1321103X13488032">O’Neill, 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>In terms of informal music-game participation, the existing music-game literature has focused on the potential for music-games to promote music learning, development of musical skill and skill transferable to the musical domain. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1321103X13488032">Missingham’s (2007)</xref> report for Youth Music found that of 12 million 13–18-year-olds in the UK, over half regularly played music-games inspiring 2.5 million to take up a musical instrument. Participants perceived music-games to be an inclusive platform for music participation across socioeconomic background and levels of musical ability, and believed music-game participation could foster the development of transferable musical skills, including dexterity, hand-eye co-ordination and performance. Interestingly, participants suggested that music-games helped support “broader music education” by inspiring them to be more interested in music generally, enriching music education, and providing a gateway into formal skill development by authenticating musical experience. It was felt that commonly perceived constraints, such as simplified instrument peripherals, encouraged learners to seek more authentic musical experiences to extend music participation, including taking up a real instrument with its comparatively nuanced complexity. In this way, music-games were considered to inspire and encourage formal music participation rather than replace it (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1321103X13488032">Peppler et al., 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>It is asserted that music-games, as a pervasive informal mode of musical engagement, provide new opportunities for exposure to the benefits of music education in everyday life. The uniquely synergic music-game context presents a valuable vehicle to bridge the formal and informal musical worlds of the learner, and elucidate the underlying game-based learning principles that may potentially scaffold and enrich formal musical principles. However, a lack of related empirical studies warrants robust investigation of the potential for music-games to support and enrich the intellectual, personal and social benefits of music participation. Comprehensive investigation of such potential requires consideration of perspectives not only from psychology of music and music education, but also game-based learning and their mutual areas of interest and benefit.</p>

<title>Game-based learning</title>
<p>A growing game-based learning literature highlights the educational potential of digital games to scaffold and enrich personalized, differentiated and self-directed learning across the curriculum. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1321103X13488032">Groff, Howells and Cranmer’s (2012)</xref> taxonomy of the educational benefits of digital games includes authentic and active learning, literacy and critical skills, self-esteem, interdisciplinary learning and resilience (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1321103X13488032">Jisc, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1321103X13488032">Ulicsak, Sandford, &amp; Facer 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1321103X13488032">Wastiau et al., 2009</xref>). Further, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1321103X13488032">Gee (2003)</xref> asserts that digital games are designed “to be learned,” and therefore can provide models of good learning practice through principles including the ability to empower the learner, promote the construction and negotiation of identities, promote problem solving skills and develop meta-cognition. Evidence indicates that game-based learning can empower creativity, increase connectivity, and facilitate expression of individuality and collaboration within creative communities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1321103X13488032">Dillon, 2003</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1321103X13488032">2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1321103X13488032">Ulicsak et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1321103X13488032">Wastiau et al., 2009</xref>).</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1321103X13488032">Groff, Howells and Cranmer’s (2010)</xref> Futurelab report broadly organized the design and educational implementation of game genres in relation to learning theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1321103X13488032">Egenfeldt-Nielsen, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1321103X13488032">Kirriemuir &amp; McFarlane, 2004</xref>), including instructional drill-and-skill games which teach specific content and skill through extrinsically motivated tasks (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1321103X13488032">Good &amp; Brophy, 1990</xref>); discovery and inquiry-oriented games that integrate learning and play to provide a context for the active construction of knowledge (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1321103X13488032">Egenfeldt-Nielsen, 2006</xref>); and games which promote situated learning through social-cultural perspectives. Such research has given rise to identification of three key features of game-based learning: motivation (e.g., fantasy, challenge and curiosity; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1321103X13488032">Malone, 1981</xref>), skill development (e.g., personal, spatial and motor, social and intellectual; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1321103X13488032">McFarlane, Sparrowhawk &amp; Heald, 2002</xref>) and immersive learning environments (e.g., active learning in a semiotic domain shared by those participating, sharing knowledge, skills, experiences and resources; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1321103X13488032">Gee, 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>It appears that game-based learning presents an opportunity to capitalize on learners’ self-directed interests by building learning activities around the existing skills and knowledge of the learner, engaging them in activities that enhance their learning. Suggested important steps in overcoming barriers to successful pedagogy include well-planned lesson outcomes and classroom organization, technical support for teachers, and clear communication between teachers and parents to promote learning in and out of the classroom. However, the infancy of the game-based learning field and neglect of game-based learning in music education contexts calls for investigation of the processes of music-game participation in the context of music education, and in line with clear curriculum goals.</p>

<title>Music-games and music education</title>
<p>Music curriculum is increasingly supportive of game-based learning, and the creative autonomy of teachers in employing such innovative tools to create new opportunities to deliver content. ICT has been found to support formal and particularly open-ended music participation, and so the negotiation and maintenance of identity, scholastic achievement and social skills (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1321103X13488032">Dillon, 2003</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1321103X13488032">2004</xref>). For example, England’s “The importance of music: A national plan for music education” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1321103X13488032">Department for Education, 2011</xref>, p. 36), states:<disp-quote>
<p>Technology plays an important role in supporting, extending and enhancing the teaching of music. It can help connect communities in ways that rely less on location; be used to inspire, motivate and stretch pupils, including those reluctant to engage with music; help extend musical experiences; and help children with additional needs to further engage in music making. It complements other music teaching, while encouraging wider communication and collaboration with other pupils.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>However, only a handful of studies have considered music-games specifically, and the educational opportunities and outcomes they support during formal and informal participation (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1321103X13488032">Peppler et al., 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>Music-games (e.g., Rock Band, Wii Music, Rocksmith) are increasingly being employed in the classroom to engage learners more deeply with music and the wider curriculum, simultaneously supporting a range of curriculum suggested opportunities such as pupil-centred flexible approaches, working across the curriculum, and promoting inclusion. In the UK, the Guitar Hero projects reported by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1321103X13488032">Consolarium (2010</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1321103X13488032">2011</xref>) have been innovative in implementing teacher driven exploratory classroom activities centering on thematic approaches to collaborative cross-curricular learning. The authors highlight that such projects allow educators freedom to explore the educationally appropriate use of music-games and potential for situated learning across the curriculum including music, creative writing, audio and business. Yet, such approaches have neglected empirical investigation and music education-specific contexts, raising the need to investigate the potential of music-games to scaffold curriculum objectives in relation to conventional music education.</p>
<p>It is widely recognized that music education benefits general academic wellbeing, such as the development of personal, learning and thinking skills, which underpin the curriculum goals to produce successful learners, confident individuals and responsible citizens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1321103X13488032">Scottish Executive, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1321103X13488032">Wastiau et al., 2009</xref>). Guidance suggests that successful planning and assessment of such skill development across key stages requires facilitating authentic and inclusive music participation, learner-generated sequences of work and self-assessment, and “integrated” music participation contexts which integrate performance, creation and appreciation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1321103X13488032">Choksy, Abramson, Gillespie, Woods, &amp; York, 2000</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1321103X13488032">Dura (2002)</xref> calls for a music education which incorporates aural, visual, spatial and kinesthetic orientations, while <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1321103X13488032">Webb (2007)</xref> suggests that drawing on students’ non-formal musical behaviour by employing mediums of music participation which account for learners’ multi-modal digital literacy, can help make classroom analysis “a more multidimensional, imaginative and vital education experience” (p. 159).</p>
<p>Music-games may fit these needs by presenting a comprehensive, self-directed and inclusive informal platform for music participation, with the potential to integrate performance, creation and appreciation. Indeed, music-games such as Rock Band potentially provide an active participation context incorporating the five elements which <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1321103X13488032">Russell-Bowie (2009)</xref> regards as essential to develop a complete understanding of music: duration, pitch, tone, colour and dynamics. The notation system presents a combination of guitar tablature and MIDI notation translating notes into vertical rectangular blocks passing over a horizontal completion line. In this way, the music-game’s notation embodies rich musical concepts central to the construction, performance and wider comprehension of standard music notation, including hierarchy, subdivision, measurement and pattern identification (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1321103X13488032">Peppler et al., 2011</xref>). Further, the popular music content of music-games addresses the need for relevant musical content in music learning environments raised by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1321103X13488032">Green (2006)</xref>, among others, as both an important genre in itself and a gateway to authentic educational outcomes through free experimentation and imitation.</p>
<p>The focus of the small existing music-game literature on music learning raises a need to identify the educational opportunities and outcomes that music-games support for wider intellectual, personal and social development. Further, there is a need to explore how such features map onto existing models, such as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1321103X13488032">Hargreaves et al.’s (2003)</xref> models of “Opportunities in Music Education,” (namely formal–informal, statutory–elective, and specialist–generalist opportunities, and their interactions) and of “Potential Outcomes of Music Education” (musical-artistic, personal and social-cultural, and their interactions).</p>

<title>Rock Band</title>
<p>Rock Band, in particular, is receiving growing academic and educational attention, having sold over 35 million copies and “becoming one of the most lucrative media franchises of the new millennium and a cornerstone gaming experience for millions of today’s youth” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1321103X13488032">Peppler et al., 2011</xref>, p. 42). Interestingly, the development of Rock Band and Guitar Hero was informed by MIT research investigating intuitive interfaces to enable all individuals to benefit from music participation regardless of prior experience and ability (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1321103X13488032">MacHover, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1321103X13488032">Peppler et al., 2011</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1321103X13488032">Peppler et al. (2011)</xref> found that playing Rock Band can benefit the learning of fundamental mechanisms of music, supporting growing evidence of the importance of informal music practice to formal music learning, terming their findings the “Nirvana Effect.” Firstly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1321103X13488032">Peppler et al. (2011)</xref> analysed Rock Band’s notation system utilizing composition and education experts to conclude a close alignment to classical notation representing experience with high fidelity to embody musical concepts standard to many curriculum practices. The authors indicate that Rock Band scaffolds learning through prerecorded instrumental and vocal tracks, providing immediate real-time feedback to the player’s manipulation of the instrument controller in time with the notation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-1321103X13488032">Wiggins, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1321103X13488032">Peppler et al. (2011)</xref> then investigated the relationship between participation and measures of formal musicianship. The findings indicated that extended Rock Band play positively correlated with learners’ assessment levels in standard music abilities. The authors assert that learners make connections between standard and music-game representational systems of music, and that youth who have internalized one notational structure are at an advantage when presented with a new system. On one hand, learners may use their understanding of Rock Band as a tool to aid their reading and writing of conventional notation. Alternatively, learners who were already more adept in conventional musical skill may have been more likely to persist with Rock Band participation, suggesting that learners with conventional musical skill are more successful at Rock Band than learners with less conventional skill. However, both interpretations suggest that learners are making connections between virtual in-game experience of music participation and conventional music education practices.</p>
<p>Overall, findings suggest that Rock Band participation may deepen musical understanding through experience of a range of musical genres and performance styles, aid literacy in classical notation by embodying fundamental musical concepts in gameplay, and authenticate formal participation to the wider musical world of the learner through cultural currency and peer-driven collaboration (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1321103X13488032">Missingham, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1321103X13488032">Peppler et al., 2011</xref>). This is in line with research that emphasizes the connection between the listening experience and the act of performing in young people’s emulation of recordings as the prime source of informal music learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1321103X13488032">Abril &amp; Gault, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1321103X13488032">Green 2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1321103X13488032">2006</xref>). Such game-based learning activity creates a context for scaffolded learning (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1321103X13488032">Vygotsky, 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-1321103X13488032">Wood, Bruner, &amp; Ross, 1976</xref>), through immersion in peer-led musical activities in the absence of formal instruction, encouraging self-regulated and independent learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1321103X13488032">Gee, 2003</xref>).</p>

<title>Current study</title>
<p>The presented study employs Rock Band 3, the most recent, socially inclusive and technically challenging form of the music-game genre, uniquely extending play to facilitate greater individual and collaborative performance opportunities (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1321103X13488032">Peppler et al., 2011</xref>). Rock Band 3 aims to close the gap between playing music-games and playing real instruments, with makers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1321103X13488032">Harmonix (2010)</xref> asking, “Ever had someone ask you why you play plastic guitar instead of learning a real instrument? Now you can tell them you ARE learning a real instrument.” <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1321103X13488032">Harmonix (2010)</xref> assert that, “Rock Band 3 empowers players to develop actual musical skills through the fun of Rock Band Pro gameplay.” Unique features of Rock Band 3 include the introduction of “Pro Instruments” that facilitate increasingly advanced technical difficulty to mirror real instrument facility, up to four simultaneous players, 3 simultaneous vocal harmonies, and a keyboard periphery. Further, Rock Band Pro presents over 1500 tracks, spanning 5 decades; guides players with extensive tutorial modes; allows players to create and save set lists and search for new music via a built-in personal preference song recommendation system; and share tracks with friends in game and via social networking and online community support.</p>
<p>In consideration of the wider personal, social and emotional benefits of music-game participation, it is asserted that application of the flow concept would be particularly fruitful, constituently addressing factors such as motivation, cognitive efficiency and self-esteem. Both music and digital games are highlighted as ideal flow activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1321103X13488032">Cowley, Charles, Black, &amp; Hickey, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1321103X13488032">Whalen, 1997</xref>), with the music-game synergy presenting a unique opportunity to explore the relationship between flow and the processes and outcomes of music-participation. Research suggests that optimal experiences and learning environments occur when personal perception of high skill level matches perception of high challenge level, resulting in a state of flow (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1321103X13488032">Csikszentmihalyi, 1992</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1321103X13488032">Custodero (2002)</xref> suggests the flow concept provides, “both the suitable theoretical insight and methodological relevance to support the significance of musical experiences and to suggest effective practices in music education” (pp. 3–4). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1321103X13488032">Custodero (1998)</xref> operationalized the flow paradigm to young people’s cognitive music-making processes and their attempt to maintain flow, developing the Flow Indicators in Musical Activities (FIMA) instrument. The reported measures of behavioural and affective flow indicators provided clues to learners’ feelings and construction of musical meaning where children were active agents in their own learning (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1321103X13488032">Custodero, 1998</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1321103X13488032">1999</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1321103X13488032">2000a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1321103X13488032">2000b</xref>). In terms of creativity, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1321103X13488032">MacDonald, Byrne and Carlton (2006)</xref>, investigated the relationship between the processes of a group composition task and creativity of first-year university students (<italic>n</italic> = 45), finding that increased levels of flow were related to increased levels of creativity and higher quality compositions.</p>
<p>In game studies, flow has been a highly prevalent concept in user experience research focusing on player enjoyment and supporting mechanics and aesthetics of gameplay (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1321103X13488032">Cowley at al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1321103X13488032">Jones, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1321103X13488032">Sweetser &amp; Wyeth, 2005</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1321103X13488032">Cowley et al. (2008)</xref> suggested a user-system-experience (USE) to map the elements of game participation – interface (controls and display), mechanics (interacting with the game), and game play (problems and challenges) – onto <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1321103X13488032">Csikszentmihalyi’s (1992)</xref> model of flow. The resultant model asserted eight elements of game mechanic that support flow experience: challenge, immersion, control, clear goals, immediate feedback, altered time perception and sense of identity. Addressing the mutual interests of music education and game studies in the flow experience calls for investigation of the nature of the flow experience during music-game play, and the supporting gameplay features.</p>
<p>In this light, the article presents a case study of one learner’s encounter with Rock Band 3, to provide an in-depth account of the learner’s experience with and views about music, games and their synergy in the music-game, and to address potential opportunities and outcomes for intellectual, personal and social development. Further, the case study includes an initial attempt to extend the study of flow to the music-game context by examining the flow experience of a learner during Rock Band participation.</p>

<title>Participant</title>
<p>The case study (male, 15 years old) was selected as representative of a “typical case” from the participant pool of a larger usability study (<italic>n</italic> = 100) exploring requirements, functions, and potential educational opportunities with music-games across age and experience (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-1321103X13488032">Yin, 2003</xref>). This usability study is a preliminary step in an ongoing EPSRC funded project “Music-Games: Supporting New Opportunities in Music Education,” exploring the potential for music-games to support, enrich and innovate learner engagement with music while identifying processes and factors which shape and constrain authentic and inclusive music-making. The selected case study exemplified an archetypal case of an adolescent who engaged with music-based video games regularly and primarily for recreational purposes, reporting a high level of engagement with music outside of school. The case study participant volunteered in response to advertisement of the study at a local youth music company, and the resulting snowball sampling resulted in two of his acquaintances also being invited to complete a testing session of approximately 45 minutes on the same day. All three participants (male, 15–16 years of age) arrived together and were asked to participate consecutively before being afforded the opportunity to play the game alongside each other for the purposes of remuneration.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-1321103X13488032">
<title>Design</title>
<p>A sequential mixed-method paradigm was utilized to facilitate a systematic overview of the participant’s game experience through a series of pre-test, outcome and post-test measures. This included a pre-test questionnaire addressing previous music and video game experience, a series of Rock Band performance measures, behaviour observation, a post-test questionnaire addressing flow experience, and a post-test interview. Accordingly, a combination of quantitative and qualitative modes of analysis were applied to explore the individual’s subjective position post-test and to objectively measure the encounter throughout. Field notes were taken to account for contextual and social information regarding the participant, location and events.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-1321103X13488032">
<title>Equipment</title>
<p>All testing took place within the eMotion Lab at Glasgow Caledonian University, a usability facility complete with a replica living room area to enhance ecological validity of the obtained results (refer to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1321103X13488032">Figure 1</xref>). The game was displayed on a 52 inch plasma television via the PlayStation 3 console, and controllers and Rock Band instruments (the original guitar, pro-guitar, drum kit, “keytar” keyboard and microphone) were positioned in such a way as to discourage potential participant bias in instrument choice due to proximity or location. Drumsticks and a plectrum were also provided and situated alongside the user manual for the game on a table adjacent to the couch. Recording equipment was located within this room by way of two discrete in-built video cameras, remotely controlled from the observation room situated behind a 2-way mirror. Within the observation room itself, all video images were fed through a matrix switcher allowing the experimenter to select the combination of images to be recorded in real-time as a split-screen monitor captured the on-screen image of the game above and a real-time feed of the participant.</p>

<title>Procedure</title>
<p>The case study participant was welcomed to the lab, informed he would be asked to play Rock Band 3 for approximately 20 minutes, and asked to complete the pre-test questionnaire. The case study participant was then seated and informed that: he was free to “explore” Rock Band 3; he could ask for assistance from the researcher during the session; and he was free to terminate the study at any point. Once the play session had ended, the case study participant was asked to complete a post-test questionnaire before being interviewed by the lead research assistant, the completion of which marked the end of the testing session at approximately 45 minutes overall.</p>

<title>Materials</title>
<sec id="section12-1321103X13488032">
<title>Pre-test</title>
<p>A pre-test questionnaire was designed to ascertain the participant’s musical background with regard to degree of engagement and interest with music, level of musical training, and prior experience with video games. This questionnaire was built by extracting project-specific items from pre-existing music-preference instruments (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1321103X13488032">Mitchell, MacDonald, Serpell, &amp; Knussen, 2007</xref>) and is comprised of a series of closed response (Yes/No and Likert scale) and open-ended questions to investigate musical background and videogame background, independently. The purpose of this pre-test questionnaire was to identify prior experience with music and music-based technologies, and to assess the relative impact of such variables upon subsequent responses.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section13-1321103X13488032">
<title>Outcome measures</title>
<p>Utilizing the split-screen footage, descriptive information of participant choice was recorded including difficulty level, song and instrument choice, game-related features such as task completion, accuracy of task executed, and overall duration of game-play. The participant’s concurrent behaviour was also observed throughout this period with a focus on positive and negative verbal and non-verbal interaction with the game. Attention to facial expression, bodily movement and gesture was tantamount to this procedure in line with usability-testing protocol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1321103X13488032">van den Hoogen, IJsselsteijn, &amp; de Kort, 2008</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section14-1321103X13488032">
<title>Post-test questionnaire</title>
<p>A post-test questionnaire was administered to explore the participant’s self-reported account of music-game experience. The questionnaire was theoretically grounded in literature pertaining to the experience of flow during music collaboration (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1321103X13488032">MacDonald et al., 2006</xref>) and gameplay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1321103X13488032">Cowley et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1321103X13488032">Sweetser &amp; Wyeth, 2005</xref>), to address the experience of flow in the synergic music-game context. This questionnaire sought to firstly measure the participant’s perception and feelings throughout the activity in relation to a set of flow-based criteria that may be met in the achievement of an engaging and enjoyable experience. In total, five dimensions of the participant’s perceived situation were measured: Cognitive Efficiency (e.g., “How well were you concentrating?”), Motivation (e.g., “Do you wish you had been doing something else?”), Self-esteem (e.g., “Did you feel good about yourself?”), Challenge (e.g., “Indicate how you felt about the challenge of the activity”) and Skill (e.g., “Indicate how you felt about your skill in the activity”). Responses were sought using Likert-type scales ranging from either 0 (not at all) to 10 (very), or 1 (low/not at all) to 10 (high/very much), from which a high score was indicative of a high level of flow.</p>
<p>In addition, the participant’s “quality of experience” was measured via the incorporation of 12 additional items designed to assess psychological state for the duration of the activity with a focus on two major clusters of mood. Specifically, six items sought to tap the participant’s affect or “hedonic valence” (e.g., happy vs. sad) whereas the remaining six items sought to measure arousal or “potency” (e.g., active vs. passive) throughout (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1321103X13488032">Csikszentmihalyi &amp; LeFevre, 1989</xref>). Responses were subsequently scored on 7-point semantic differential scales where a high score was indicative of a positive mood throughout. A final measure of “competitiveness” vs. “cooperativeness” was also included using a 7-point semantic differential scale directly following the above measure of “quality of experience.”</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section15-1321103X13488032">
<title>Post-test interview method</title>
<p>A one-to-one semi-structured interview was carried out post-test in situ to provide an in-depth exploration of overall experience and attitudes toward music-games. A chief aim was to address the perceived learning potential of music-games in line with current informal and formal music-making practices, and foster the development of recommendations for use of music-games within music education in line with the latter phases of the wider 2-year project. As such, a series of open-ended questions were administered with further probes executed in instances where the participant mentioned anything of definitive significance in light of this overarching aim. Each interview was fully transcribed to word document format utilizing transcription conventions specific to conducting a thematic analysis (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1321103X13488032">Braun &amp; Clarke, 2006</xref>). The transcript was subsequently compared to the original recording once more in order to enhance accuracy, and analytical proceedings commenced with repeated readings and inductive data-driven coding of the verbatim text. Further organization at the semantic level gave rise to a number of recurrent themes, which were then organized into super-ordinate themes following latent analysis.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<sec id="section17-1321103X13488032">
<title>Pre-test</title>
<p>In terms of musical background, the participant perceived himself to be highly musical (a score of 8 was obtained on a scale from 0 “Not at all Musical” to 10 “Very Musical”). The participant reported that in formal settings (e.g., classroom) he had “never” played an instrument solo and “rarely” played alongside others. In contrast, the participant stated that in informal settings he “frequently” played an instrument alone and “occasionally” with others, indicating a general preference for playing a musical instrument in an informal setting (e.g., at home). The participant’s primary instrument was the guitar, having received 2 years of formal tuition at both secondary school and via private tuition. Again, the participant reported practising this instrument more frequently at home (3 hours per week) than in school (1 hour per week). Overall, the participant also indicated music in general as being of high importance in his life selecting a value of 9 on a scale ranging from 0 “Not at all Important’ to 10 “Very Important.” The participant reported a preference for rock music in particular, dedicating the highest rating solely to rock music from a list of musical genres on a scale which ranged from 1 “Strongly Dislike” to 7 “Strongly Like.”</p>
<p>With regard to video-game experience, the participant reported currently playing videogames at least once per week with a preference for the first-person shooter genre in particular, although his favourite game at the time of this study was reported to be Mario Kart, a popular racing game. He also stated that he owned three leading games consoles, including the Playstation 3 (as utilized in this study), Xbox 360 and Nintendo Wii. Referring specifically to music-games, the participant reported owning and playing Rock Band, Guitar Hero and Singstar, and stated that he liked playing music-games for recreational purposes both alone and with others. Further, he indicated that a main reason for liking music-games was personal belief that the ability to play such games is not dependent on any prior ability to play a musical instrument.</p>
<sec id="section18-1321103X13488032">
<title>Outcome measures</title>
<p>The participant immediately chose to play the game using the standard Rock Band guitar peripheral. However, upon realization that the drum kit was the default controller he then continued to play the first song using this drum kit instrument. Subsequently, the participant opted to use the pro-guitar for the remainder of the session. The session lasted 24.48 minutes in total and the participant engaged in seven separate tasks (refer to <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1321103X13488032">Table 1</xref>). As illustrated in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1321103X13488032">Table 1</xref>, the participant generally moved through the game in a systematic and constructive fashion, commencing the task at easy level before moving on to medium and difficult mode and returning to medium mode to improve upon previous tasks failed using difficult mode. The participant’s gaze remained mainly on-screen as he rarely glanced beyond the projected image of the game.</p>

<p>The participant consistently sat upright, leaning forward and shifting only to check the positioning of his fingers when using the pro-guitar. His facial expression also remained fairly constant and, of definitive significance, his mouth was open when engaged in a task. He also moved the upper half of his body in time with the music before proceeding to simultaneously tap his feet to the music towards the end. Such behaviours grew progressively more noticeable as time passed. The participant’s gaze, posture, facial expression and bodily movements suggested complete immersion in, and concentration upon, each task in turn. Further to this, he was also seen to laugh despite failing to complete a task and frowned once but only when commencing an unfamiliar task, the frown dissipating almost immediately upon clear task comprehension. Although less pronounced, such behaviours were not only denotative of engagement with the game itself, but may also be viewed as manifestations of the participant’s underlying positive affective state throughout.</p>

<p>A composite measure of flow was obtained by combining the responses to each of the items pertaining to this concept across all five dimensions demarcated above (refer to <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1321103X13488032">Table 2</xref>). This resulted in an average score of 7.8 indicating a high level of enjoyment and engagement throughout the activity (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1321103X13488032">Custodero, 1999</xref>). Further close inspection of the individual scores to each item indicated that the case elicited a high level of cognitive efficiency (7.33), self-esteem (7), and motivation (8.11) throughout the task. In addition, the participant indicated that he felt the task was challenging (8) and, accordingly, felt his level of skill (7) in the activity to be almost equally as high.</p>

<p>In sum, the elicited responses suggest that the participant’s experience successfully met with the aforementioned criteria thought to be indicative of a peak flow experience of engagement and enjoyment. These findings were further explored via the final outcome measure: a post-test interview.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section20-1321103X13488032">
<title>Post-test interview</title>
<p>The case study interview lasted approximately 10 minutes. Preliminary readings and semantic thematic analysis resulted in the identification of an initial set of recurrent themes (<italic>n</italic> = 6). Subsequent clustering and further latent thematic analysis was used to organize the themes identified at the semantic level and as a result, two superordinate themes were ascertained (refer to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1321103X13488032">Figure 2</xref>).</p>

<p><italic>Note</italic>. Given that only one case was to be analysed, the researcher’s judgement as to the “keyness” of each theme (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1321103X13488032">Braun &amp; Clarke, 2006</xref>) was dependent on whether it captured something essential to the research inquiry, and was not necessarily dependent on any “quantifiable measures” such as the number of instances across the data set. Moreover, the organization of themes into superordinate branches did not necessitate any assumption that the recurrent themes identified were in any way dissociated from others. Nonetheless, retention of each theme in terms of its specificity was empirically supported by the surrounding data.</p>

<title>Superordinate theme 1: Playing for fun</title>
<p>Discourse surrounding the recreational properties of the music-game with regard to user enjoyment permeated the data item. In particular, the participant spoke about the importance of being able to compete against others. Implicit in the participant’s dialogue surrounding the importance of playing alongside others, albeit competitively, was the enjoyment not only gained from the social interaction between users, but from the game mechanics that allowed for performance comparisons to be made between peers. The participant believed that this would foster a desire to perform better:<disp-quote>
<p>I prefer it with… people sort of like, trying to have like a competition with people and that.</p>
<p>Like it tells you the percentages and your scores and stuff so if you… wanted to beat someone at it then you could get a higher score than them, maybe go up to the next level on “expert” or something so it’s probably something I quite like to do [laughs].</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Conversely, discussion surrounding the enjoyment and fun associated with playing the game alone focused more on the relaxing properties of the music-game and the pleasurable experiences associated with being able to play at one’s leisure. Referring to the Pro-Guitar, he said:<disp-quote>
<p>Although it’s not a real guitar… you can make a chord and like you could just sit and sort of relax.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Further encompassed within this overarching theme was gratification from being able to freely explore one’s musical capabilities and preference:<disp-quote>
<p>I never really played the drums a lot so I just wanted… since it was set out and it was already switched on I thought I’ll give it a go see if I enjoy it more than I have done… before so… em I just went and it was good fun so…</p>
<p>I picked some songs mainly because of the bands, other times because I would listen, I would just… as I was scrolling down I would listen to some of the songs and see if they had good guitar sort of riffs or… and then I would just go for it.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Again this notion was tied to the mechanics of the music-game itself with reference to the ability to select from a variety of instruments, songs and difficulty levels and the enjoyment gained from being able to do so. The above excerpt implies that the music-game provided not only the necessary tools to explore musical proficiency and allied preferences, but also a safe environment in which the learner could do so.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section22-1321103X13488032">
<title>Superordinate theme 2: Playing to learn</title>
<p>As well as the ostensible enjoyment associated with playing the music-game, the participant discussed the game’s propensity to enhance or foster the development of a number of transferable music skills.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>I prefer being able to have the fret board, the strings, eh… I think it’s easier to use as well if you actually… once you learn how to use it, I think it’s just… I don’t know why, but just being able to use it properly em… [looks down at the Pro Guitar and swivels it round to face him] I just… yeah I, I think it’s just… even if you don’t play guitar in general I think it’s still, it’s valid eh to use it.</p>
<p>I think… mainly awareness is the sort of key for me because it did take a while to sort of pick up, playing without looking just like … finding the individual strings… eh I think it would help that em… and… although it’s not a real guitar it still has the sense of… like you can make a chord.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Note however, that tied to such utterances was the putative belief that this particular aspect of the game may be particularly efficacious for those less advanced:<disp-quote>
<p>Although it doesn’t make the proper noise [laughs], it still has the idea of making chords… so I think that would help someone who wishes to learn so.</p>
<p>I think it almost helps you in a way sort of… even… like I have a friend who’s just learning guitar so, [picks up Pro Guitar] even just being able to know where the strings are without having to sort of look at them constantly would help.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Nonetheless, the participant frequently spoke of the music-game interchangeably as another novel mode of learning beneficial to learners of all stages. Such utterances were full of latent references to the importance of, and satisfaction gained from, being able to personalize one’s mode of learning and to engage in self-directed learning:<disp-quote>
<p>I think mainly because eh… the music here, music on… it’s sort of, it’s got a broad variety but eh… some of the bands that I prefer to play aren’t necessarily going to be on it so, I always think it’s good to sort of be able to, add your own into the game.</p>
<p>I’m not great at the drums so I just sort of… had it, easy to medium, and then when I moved onto the guitar I started a Jimi Hendrix song on hard [laughs]… and found it quite hard [laughs] so moved to “medium” and just sort of went through the songs on “medium” and it was fine.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Despite frequently alluding to the learning potential of music-games, it is important to note that throughout such instances, the participant was keen to voice that he did not perceive music-games to be a replacement for traditional teaching methods. Rather, he considered them a complementary adjunct or gateway into formal music-making practices:<disp-quote>
<p>[Touches the Pro Guitar] I think this is sort of … it’s going a step further sort of… I don’t really know how to explain it but it’s sort of… almost as if like you were playing a proper guitar in terms of, it’s got the fret board and it’s got the strings, so I think it’s better in that sense.</p>
<p>I think [long pause] I think it is sort of… it’s hard to compare because you aren’t actually playing a proper instrument I mean… it’s the same sort of feeling with the strings [strums the Pro Guitar] but… I think eh… I think it’s more for sort of like use of fun and… awareness of, if you are wanting to learn the guitar, then it’s awareness of the strings and the frets but eh… I think if you were to play a proper instrument then it would feel a wee [little] bit different but em… I wouldn’t, I wouldn’t… solely base it on trying to learn the guitar though like as a basic way just playing this so although it does help your awareness I wouldn’t solely base learning guitar on this before you go straight onto the real thing.</p>
<p>You couldn’t really base the real thing on a game as such… I think it would sort of… eh… it would… it sort of… although it does have the sort of basics of it, it doesn’t have the proper feeling, you don’t hear the proper noise, you don’t… like you couldn’t do the vibrations or the sliding up, so it’s only the really basics that you could use it for, like sort of picking and sort of, … fret using… .</p>

<title>General discussion</title>
<p>The case study participant perceived music-games to be highly engaging, inspiring and relevant, corroborating many key literature assertions of the benefits of music-games to learners. Further, the participant suggested several areas of benefit from music-game participation including potential to enrich intellectual (musical understanding and transferable skill), personal and social development. In terms of the nature of music-game participation, the participant displayed a peak flow experience with Rock Band evident through high levels of enjoyment, perceived challenge and skill. This peak flow experience was observed throughout the duration of the testing phase and subsequently verified through the exploration of the participant’s post-test subjective account of his experience. The participant also reported a high quality of experience through feeling relaxed yet excited, happy, alert and active in the activity, perceiving freedom to explore his musical abilities and preferences.</p>
<p>Such a positive and engaged experience supports the potential of the music-game synergy as a successful and efficacious context for wider intellectual, social and personal development in applied contexts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1321103X13488032">Cowley et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1321103X13488032">Gee, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1321103X13488032">Green, 2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1321103X13488032">2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1321103X13488032">MacDonald et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1321103X13488032">Squire, 2011</xref>). Interestingly, the participant’s main reasons for liking music-games in general, and the studied music-game session in particular, involved the unique game-mechanics. The participant illustrated how Rock Band’s game-mechanics facilitate self-directed, social and playful exploration of musical ability and preference in a “safely” constructive and informal yet challenging context. In this way, the participant was aware of not only the rewarding experience of participating in both music and music-games, but the potential opportunities game-based learning presents to inspire, engage and enrich his opportunities to be exposed to the benefits of music participation. Further understanding of the nature of the music-game flow experience may provide both theoretical insight into which music-game experiences learners enjoy best and benefit the most from, and a methodological framework to measure music-game participation in situ to suggest effective and efficient practice in the classroom and wider musical world.</p>
<p>In terms of music-games inspiring greater engagement with music, the participant was keen to assert that music-game participation did not capture the nuanced complexity and creative freedom of playing a real instrument. However he also emphasized that the constraints of game-based instruments may inspire learners to pick up a real instrument rather than curb or impede further musical participation (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1321103X13488032">Missingham, 2007</xref>). The participant appears to express a perceived relationship between in-game and out-of-game experiences, suggesting Rock Band is a beneficial bridge for youth to discover and capitalize on commonalities between formal and informal music practices. The participant also drew connections between Rock Band and his musical self, suggesting that positive engagement with Rock Band facilitated a “way-in” or “fast-forward” to many rewards of standard musicianship and exploration of musical identity. It appears that Rock Band may provide a context to understand successful “standard” music making in relation to the participant’s wider musical world. Rock Band’s representation of music appeared to help him to engage more deeply with the content of the game and he suggested that this could help him internalize those representations for application to formal music making contexts. In this way, the participant suggests that music-games are a valuable vehicle to connect formal and informal music participation in the 21st century.</p>
<p>In terms of perceived education potential, the participant’s post-test interview observations can be broadly grouped into features perceived to promote the development of wider musical understanding, and those perceived to promote development of specific transferrable skill such as instrumental facility. In terms of musical understanding, the participant felt that Rock Band may foster development of general musical understanding and grammar, suggesting that Rock Band informed his understanding of fundamental musical concepts through a “scaffolding” approach to skill acquisition, simplified peripherals to access across ability, and a focus on rhythmic and melodic form. Furthermore, implicit throughout the participant’s talk was the belief that such skills were harnessed via the self-structured learning context provided by the game itself. For example, the ability to tailor one’s learning experience by controlling the pace at which one learns (through selecting a particular difficulty level), provides an opportunity to engage in “self-directed” and “personalized” learning. Indeed, research surrounding “best educational practice” has frequently alluded to the importance and efficacy of such pedagogical methods, particularly within the realm of music education (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1321103X13488032">Hargreaves et al., 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>Suggested specific transferrable skill development included understanding of the relationship between notated and aural music representation skill transferrable to performance study, and understanding of rhythm, pitch and texture, acquisition of chords (notation), dexterity, and hand-eye co-ordination. In this way, Rock Band seems to represent rather than simulate actual experience, embodying rhythmic concepts central to music education such as “the learning of hierarchical structures, levels of subdivision, units of measurement, and pattern identification” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1321103X13488032">Peppler et al., 2011</xref>, p. 56). Future longitudinal investigation of the impact of entertainment and tuition music-games on instrumental facility would be highly valuable, to shed light on their potential incorporation into existing practice to support and enrich traditional instrumental tuition.</p>
<p>The collective evidence indicates that music-games are of high interest and relevance to learners, with potential benefits including deeper and more meaningful musical understanding and positive musical identity in the classroom and wider world of the learner. It appears that music-games have the potential to: promote inclusive music participation and personal and academic wellbeing; embody fundamental musical concepts in gameplay; and authenticate formal participation to help learners see the relevance of music curriculum to their own experiences and aspirations in the wider world (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1321103X13488032">Consolarium, 2010</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1321103X13488032">2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1321103X13488032">Missingham, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1321103X13488032">Peppler et al., 2011</xref>). While commercial music-games may not directly teach musical skill, they may assist in developing mastery of a myriad of related physical, personal, social and thinking skills, which may be translated to the musical domain. Such transferrable skills include timing, hand-eye coordination, dexterity, rhythmic and melodic awareness, concentration, and performance, ensemble and listening skills (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1321103X13488032">Missingham, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1321103X13488032">Peppler at al., 2011</xref>). Further, music-games may support the development of positive self-identity, from exploration and expression of music identity, to promotion of positive self-esteem, motivation, social interaction and self-directed learning.</p>
<p>The collective findings necessitate further empirical investigation of the effects of music-game participation on parameters of standard music learning and wider cognitive, personal and social wellbeing. Further, there is a need for evidence-based materials to guide educators on the effective and innovative employment of music-games in the classroom, and for recommendations to inform industry on enhanced design of educationally appropriate future music-games. These aforementioned needs will be comprehensively addressed in a wider 24-month EPSRC (European Physical Science Research Council) project, “Music-Games: Supporting New Opportunities In Music Education,” from which the presented case study is taken. The programme of work will undertake a series of usability and classroom studies with music-game technologies aiming to: develop a deeper understanding of the educationally appropriate opportunities and experiences music-games support; highlight the processes and potential outcomes of participation for intellectual, personal and social wellbeing; inform future directions for music-game development; and recommend strategies to overcome constraints of use within existing practice (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1321103X13488032">Dillon, 2003</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1321103X13488032">2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1321103X13488032">Missingham, 2007</xref>). The challenge remains for music educators to harness the new opportunities that music-games present to inspire and engage learners with music, enrich and innovate current practice, and authenticate formal music education to the wider world of the learner.</p>
