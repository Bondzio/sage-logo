<abstract>
<p>This article aims to analyse one specific type of memorial site that furnishes an indexical link to past traumatic events which took place in precisely these places. Such memorials will be defined here as trauma sites. It will be shown how the semiotic trait of indexicality produces unique meaning effects, forcing a reframing of the issue of representation, with all its aesthetic and ethical dimensions. In contrast to other forms of memorial site, trauma sites exist factually as material testimonies of the violence and horror that took place there. The fact they still exist, more or less as they were, implies a precise choice on the part of post-conflict societies regarding which traces of the past ought to be preserved and in which ways. In other words, a decision is made about what politics of memory to adopt in each case. Trauma sites thus become unique, privileged observatories that allow us to understand better the emergence of post-conflict societies. The various forms of conservation, transformation, memorialization of places where slaughter, torture and horror have been carried out are key clues to better understandings of the relationship between memory and history in each post-conflict society studied. This article presents a close reading of three very different trauma sites: the Tuol Sleng Museum of the Crimes of Genocide in Phnom Penh, Cambodia; Villa Grimaldi in Santiago, Chile; and a third, more recent, museum: The Ustica Memorial Museum (Museo per la Memoria di Ustica) in Bologna, Italy. These memorials represent instances of three very different traumatic memory politics: in Tuol Sleng, visitors are relocated in the trauma space, in a sort of ‘frozen past’; in Villa Grimaldi, a process of attenuation is at work, the traces of the past are less evident, and their emotional effects weaker. The Ustica Museum represents yet another option, a movement towards an artistic and creative reinterpretation of the traumatic event itself.</p>

<sec id="sec1-0263276411423035"><title>Trauma Site Museums</title>
<p>AMONG THE new museum forms that this article aims to explore, a special position is occupied by what today are often called <italic>memorial museums</italic>, a specific museum type ‘dedicated to historic events commemorating mass suffering of some kind’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0263276411423035">Williams, 2007</xref>: 8). Over the last 10 years, we have witnessed an impressive growth in such memorial museums; it would be difficult to decide whether this proliferation depends mostly on the obsession with memory that seems to characterize our shared contemporaneity, or on an increase of ‘mass suffering’ of various kinds, from genocides to ferocious repressions by dictatorial regimes.</p>
<p>This paper presents an analytical descriptive reading of three memorial sites characterized by a specific semiotic trait: an indexical link to past traumatic events. This approach requires a re-categorization of memorials of this type, which I shall refer to in what follows as <italic>trauma sites.</italic></p>
<p>Is this ‘just description’, a kind of aesthetic device, to use the words of poet Elizabeth Bishop, or is it something more? My position in this article is that a close descriptive reading is an indispensable starting point for critical understanding of the memory politics trauma sites embody in relation to other memorials and the specific connection between memory and history these places index. In contrast with other forms of memorial sites, trauma sites exist factually as <italic>material testimonies</italic> of the violence and horror that took place there. The fact that they still exist, more or less as they were, implies a precise choice on the part of post-conflict societies regarding which traces of the past ought to be preserved and in which ways.</p>
<p>In other words, a decision is taken about which <italic>memory politics</italic> is to be adopted in each case. But any given politics of memory is never ‘innocent’ or neutral: the past is always remembered and reconstructed from the point of view of the future, of the new post-conflict society to be built, where a need for political reconciliation may play a crucial role. This is why a close reading of these sites must be carried out in parallel with close readings of the specific political conditions of actual post-conflict societies. Once such a situated reading is carried out, trauma sites reveal much more than their structural organization; they become unique and privileged observatories that allow us to understand the evolution of post-conflict societies. The various forms of conservation, transformation, memorialization of places where slaughter, torture and horror have been carried out are key points for understanding better the relationship between memory and history in the case of each post-conflict society.</p>
<p>At the same time, because of their indexical nature, trauma sites force a reframing of the whole issue of representation, its aesthetic and ethic dimensions, which will challenge a number of well known contextual issues from a new and different perspective. In general, memorial museums open fundamental and difficult questions regarding conservation and transformation of a traumatic past and, in the long run, the very politics of memory and remembering. What should be transmitted and how? What kind of attitudes ought to be adopted in relation to victims, in the event that they want to forget? Ought their will to be respected or should truth always be asserted? How can we best present testimony of their suffering without appropriating or even exploiting their experiences? Are justice and truth always compatible with the needs and interests of post-conflict societies, or might traumatic memory conflict with social reconciliation? Is a critical transmission of memory that is capable of overcoming a purely auto-referential commemoration of the past possible, thus re-locating memory in a context of new social, political and institutional needs, while at the same time developing a rigorous and respectful dynamics of remembering? Can memorials escape the risk of ritual forms of commemoration? These and similar questions appear even more crucial in the specific case of those memorials that I have initially characterized as <italic>trauma sites</italic>.</p>
<p>The memorial museum is still rather too large a category, since it may cover a very broad typology of quite different objects: memorials, mausoleums, memory museums, memory parks, and so on. This broad coverage depends on the fact that the definition itself is based solely on the specific nature of the ‘content’ of the museum, i.e. a traumatic event, without any more formal distinction. It can thus extend from the transformation of concentration camps into museums, as is the case for Auschwitz or Treblinka, to more recent purpose-built institutions, such as Libeskind's Jewish Museum in Berlin, or monuments such as The Memorial to the Murdered Jews of Europe by Peter Eisenman, also in Berlin.</p>
<p>At this point I shall make a categorical distinction between (i) memorial museums created <italic>ex novo,</italic> like the Libeskind museum in Berlin, the Holocaust Museum in Washington, DC, or Yad Vashem in Jerusalem, and (ii) memorials built on sites of historical traumas, transforming places originally designated for imprisonment and extermination into museums, such as Auschwitz or the Tuol Sleng Museum of the Crimes of Genocide in Phnom Penh, Cambodia. I will refer to this latter type of museum as <italic>trauma site museums</italic> (or simply <italic>trauma sites</italic>). Obviously, as is always the case with categorizations of this kind, this distinction is not a completely clear-cut one, since we can have partial overlapping, as when a completely new museum is being built on the site of a massacre.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0263276411423035">1</xref></sup> I believe, however, that a distinction along these lines may be useful, as it helps shift focus from pure content elements to more formal features that characterize these places: it is indeed precisely on the diverse <italic>semiotic</italic> natures of these two kinds of memorial that my distinction is based.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec2-0263276411423035"><title> Indexicality</title>
<p>The most relevant feature of trauma sites resides in their <italic>indexical</italic> character: these places maintain a real spatial contiguity with the trauma itself; indeed, they are the very places where the traumatic events in question have occurred, and the demonstration of such a continuity is an essential part of their inherent and constructed meaning, not to say the very reason for their existence. Spatial contiguity also implies a different set of relationships within the temporal dimension. Although we, as visitors, are located in a different time with respect to the traumatic events that took place at the site, a direct link with the past seems to be activated by the indexicality of the places and the objects present there: they are signs of a very particular nature – traces of the past, imprints of what actually happened there. Such traces and imprints are endowed with a direct, causal connection with the particular embodied instance that, at a particular time, produced them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0263276411423035">Eco, 1975</xref>). They maintain, so to speak, an embodied memory of the actual agent that caused them. The past they reveal to us is not a reconstruction or a ‘re-evocation’ of what is no more, as is the case in more commonplace museums or memorials, but something much more cogent, something they have directly <italic>witnessed</italic>: these places are themselves <italic>testimonies</italic> of the past.</p>
<p>This is not, however, a property ‘naturally’ embedded in the physical place: in order to acquire a similar testimonial nature, such places have to undergo a semiotic process that transforms imprints into traces, i.e signs recognized and interpreted as such (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0263276411423035">Eco, 1975</xref>). Here there is at work a double semiotic process of interpretation (trace recognition) and enunciation (transformation of traces into a memorial or a museum). Through interpretation the visitor becomes aware of the indexical nature of the place and this awareness becomes part of her competence as visitor. Through enunciation the physical space is developed into a narrative, and its indexical nature is transformed from a purely causal contiguity into a meaningful element.</p>
<p>In this way indexicality becomes a fundamental component of the <italic>sense of place</italic> (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0263276411423035">Meyrowitz, 1985</xref>) of a trauma site, with important consequences for the <italic>positioning</italic> of visitors. Independently of how much remains of the past, and how carefully it is preserved, visitors know they are in the very place where terrible events occurred, and this knowledge contributes to a complex, multifaceted perception of it. Visitors not only <italic>see</italic> something of this terrible past, they also <italic>imagine</italic> that which cannot be seen. The emotional intensity and pathemic effect characteristic of experiences of visiting trauma sites depend crucially on the evocative power of indexical traces to activate the imagination of the visitors. Visible and invisible aspects of visitor experience become inextricably intertwined. Traces, in virtue of their indexical ‘authenticity’, are at one and the same time visible documentations of the past and powerful activators of imaginary forms of reconstruction.</p>
<p>The <italic>indexical</italic> semiotic character of trauma sites affects many important dimensions of their analysis, marking a difference at three different levels with the memorial museum constructed <italic>ex novo</italic>: at the <italic>epistemological</italic> level, regarding the crucial issue of authenticity, which in turn implies questioning the politics of conservation and restoration; at the <italic>ethical</italic> level, regarding its relationship with the survivors of the place, and the positioning of the visitors, entangled as they are between memory, awe and ‘dark tourism’; and finally at the <italic>political</italic> level, regarding the role and identitary function that such places play in countries that often are facing a difficult historical transition period in a wider post-conflict context.</p>
<p>It should be pointed out, however, that the inherent indexicality characterizing the semiotic nature of trauma sites can be exploited and exhibited in quite different forms: the link to the past remains, establishing a certain degree of ‘fidelity’, and the form of conservation of the original places may vary greatly, according to what I call a <italic>scale of indexicality,</italic> that moves from a maximum of conservation of past traces to a maximum of neutralization. These two extremes on the scale of indexicality constitute two quite different <italic>rhetorics of memory</italic> and <italic>strategies of remembering</italic>. On the one hand, we have sites that conserve almost obsessively all possible elements of the original place, through a literal and realistic representation of the past, without any distancing from it. At the opposite end of the scale there are sites that downplay the rhetoric of original authenticity, operating more through abstraction and allusion rather than through direct exposure of past remains, seeking to transpose memories into a different interpretative framework. The first two cases analyzed in this paper, the Tuol Sleng museum and Villa Grimaldi, can be taken as prototypical cases of these two quite different strategies. The third case, the Ustica Museum, represents a very interesting experiment with a new form of rigorous conservation of the indexical link to traumatic reality, while at the same time transforming it into an experimental field of new discourses, artistic and aesthetic effects.</p>
<p>The scale of indexicality, and therefore the various ways of using causal links with space, objects and remains of a traumatic past, can help in framing some specific dimensions that appear relevant for analysis of trauma sites:
<list id="list1-0263276411423035" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>conservation <italic>vs</italic> transformation</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>realism <italic>vs</italic> symbolic abstraction</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>relation between actual place and trauma</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>relation between present and past time</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>visitor's positioning</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>forms of representation</p></list-item>
</list></p>
<p>The question of which forms of representation ought to be adopted in such cases lies at the very core of any discussion of traumatic memories and opens up the <italic>vexata questio</italic> of the representability of the trauma itself. Often addressed by Trauma Studies, it has become known as the ‘crisis of representation’, alluding to the impossibility of speaking of, or displaying, the horror of the trauma itself, which would be ‘unspeakable’, although probably never before have collective atrocities, beginning with the Holocaust, been more frequently narrated, represented, recounted using different languages and forms of expressions.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0263276411423035">2</xref></sup></p>
<p>On this issue, trauma sites exhibit a fundamental difference from other memorial museums. Strictly speaking, they do not <italic>represent</italic> anything; rather, since the traumatic events happened there, they directly expose some precise material traces of them. In a way, what we have here is a shift from <italic>representation</italic> to <italic>re-presentation</italic>,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0263276411423035">3</xref></sup> which is a consequence of the unique indexical nature of these places and the direct links they maintain with the actual trauma. The re-presentation effect may vary greatly from site to site, according to the previously mentioned scale of indexicality. The more faithfully a trauma site maintains an indexical link with the past, conserving the actual remains of the original place, the stronger will be the effect of the rhetoric of re-presentation.</p>
<p>But theoretically speaking, things are rather more complicated than this. Here we are facing a highly complex issue that goes right to the heart of the aesthetics of trauma representation, addressing the issue of realistic versus more abstract representational forms.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0263276411423035">4</xref></sup> At first sight it appears that re-presentational sites tend to be more ‘realistic’ than representational ones, but this question is incorrectly framed, since representational memorials can also induce highly realistic effects. This is the case, to quote just one example, of the US Holocaust Memorial Museum in Washington, DC, a new museum that has no indexical links at all to a place of extermination. The opposition between realistic and abstract forms does not coincide with the semiotic opposition between indexes and symbols, or between indexes and icons. No semiotic object is entirely reducible to one form of signification, as it always simultaneously embodies indexical, iconic and symbolic elements (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0263276411423035">Peirce, 1931</xref>–58); clearly, re-presentational memorials cannot be seen as purely indexical.</p>
<p>A misunderstanding seems to be involved here concerning the meaning of ‘real’ and ‘realistic’. A representational site can be highly realistic by simulating specific environments, furniture, utensils, clothes and other kinds of material elements as they effectively were, reproducing them right down to their most insignificant details, as many contemporary memorials do. The experiential efficacy of re-presentational or indexical trauma sites does not lie in their alleged ‘realism’ but elsewhere, more precisely in their being a trace linking past and present through persistency of material elements over time. In other words, it relies on the supposed <italic>authenticity</italic> of traces, not the implied <italic>truthfulness</italic> of the representation.</p>
<p>Both types of sites may potentially create a strong <italic>reality effect</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0263276411423035">Barthes, 1986</xref>), but this depends on different mechanisms, presupposing the activation of different forms of positioning on the part of visitors in relation to the place itself. In the case of trauma sites, the reality effect does not primarily depend on what is exhibited there but on visitors’ knowledge of its indexical character. This knowledge facilitates specific modes of interpretation, reading and fruition of the site: in this sense indexicality represents a unique interpretative function that creates a semiotic bridge between the place itself, the knowledge of the visitor and her positioning within it. Accordingly, the principal question in these cases is not ‘how to represent the past’ but rather: ‘what aspects of that past should be re-presented, and how?’ And more than anything else: ‘are these all authentic?’</p>
<p>Regarding the first issue, an opening to the public of a place of extermination in the form of a museum always involves complex decisions regarding what can be displayed or exhibited in this kind of place: instruments of torture and suffering, for example? The meagre everyday belongings of people who lost their lives there? Their mortal remains? All difficult decisions, since the main ‘exhibits’ are indeed often the few traces that remain of people killed in these places.</p>
<p>As Primo Levi first pointed out, a fundamental paradox seems to be lurking here: the dead are the only possible, the ultimate witnesses, while at the same time they cannot themselves bear witness, they have no voice. Only their traces can speak for them, and about them. But which traces are to be chosen to be exhibited, and what aspect of these traces, ultimately, can actually be shown: images of the dead? artefacts of the dead? remains of the dead? This ethical dimension is inextricably intertwined with an aesthetic dimension, since each choice is at the same time a choice about what to show and how to show it.</p>
<p>The second, highly relevant question is that of the conservation and authenticity of the sites in question. Compared to more traditional museums, trauma sites are more difficult to define and have a rather hybrid character: they are neither real museums nor cemeteries, nor places of worship, nor monuments – they are all of these together, and perhaps even more. But first and foremost, they were once places of extermination. For the people who visit them, this implies a kind of overlap between what the place once was and what it now is, between being in a prison and being in a museum: as visitors we see both a museum exhibit – albeit a particular one – and an actual place of extermination. Is it possible to maintain the ‘authenticity’ of such places, or does their conversion into a museum inevitably transform them into something other than themselves? Behind the apparently technical question of restoration are hidden other, more engaging, issues, such as the ethical legitimacy or aesthetic value of the trauma sites in question.</p>
<p>An obsessively conservative restoration, right down to the most gruesome details as, for example, in the case of Tuol Sleng, implies a profound paradox that we could call the authenticity paradox, already noted by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0263276411423035">Assmann (1999)</xref>: the action of trying to conserve the authenticity of such places inevitably involves a loss of such authenticity. This loss derives precisely from the functional transformation of these places into a museum: what is principally preserved is the physical materiality of these places, not their inherent meanings. In a way, what is conserved is transformed precisely because it has been conserved.</p>
<p>While risking a process of monumentalization, trauma sites often seem unable to tell the story and speak of the life-experiences of the real people who encountered their final destiny there. Facing such a paradox, two different answers are possible. The first is to assume as unavoidable the impossibility of recreating the past, emphasizing the distance that separates us from the traumatic events and, possibly, allowing that time gap to create a new space for critical thinking. The second alternative is of an opposite sign, and tries to obliterate the distance between present and past: the past is made present and re-actualized through a variety of devices aiming at strong emotional involvement on the part of the visitor.</p>
<p>These two options are not necessarily coincident with the two extremes of the previously mentioned indexicality scale, although these may well overlap. But not necessarily so. For example, the effect of actualizing the past can be obtained through a transforming intervention altering the past traces, as it is in the case of San Saba, to be shortly discussed in what follows. What is relevant for this distinction is not a mere correspondence with a pre-existing reality but the attempt to actualize the past and the emotional effects produced by this.</p>
<p>Among the most representative advocates of the first position is Ruth Klüger, one of the most acutely attentive witnesses of the Holocaust. In <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0263276411423035">Klüger's (1992)</xref> view, places of this kind cannot be conserved, since it is impossible to recreate any immediate contact with the full reality of trauma, and any attempt in this direction is only an illusion. It should be noticed that comments of this kind are often made from the perspective of a survivor-witness, such as Ruth Klüger. This is, however, a very particular perspective which is not generalizable: trauma sites are after all not kept and maintained only for their survivors. These sites primarily serve a function related to the transmission of documented traumatic events of the past to future generations, as well as potentially playing a role in an extended geopolitical reality, in what is today seen as a complex domain of post-memory processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0263276411423035">Hirsch, 1997</xref>).</p>
<p>In a trans-generational perspective, survivors are no longer ‘ideal visitors'<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0263276411423035">5</xref></sup> to sites of this kind, since they are open to a wider, far more differentiated audience, who may know very little of the actual historical trauma. Not to mention the fact that the places themselves may have many other functions, over and above allowing for remembering. Limiting the discussion here to one case study: Tuol Sleng, particularly in the early days after its opening, was for example primarily designed for members of the international community, not for the survivors themselves or the Cambodian people. In this specific case the memory of a traumatized society became an instrumental component in a complex strategic game of political positioning, aimed at redefinition of core national identity.</p>
<p>For these reasons, which imply a complex politics of memory postulating different kinds of addressees for such museums, and the various political options and functions involved, the position sustained by Ruth Klüger appears to be that of a minority. Today, the second option mentioned above is largely predominant and is generally adopted and diffused with the aim of not only preserving the basic <italic>authenticity</italic> of the sites just as they were, but also of recreating a complex <italic>authenticity effect</italic> by way of a wide range of different enunciatory strategies. What I refer to here as an authenticity effect is a <italic>meaning effect</italic> produced in the experience of visitors, rather than an abstract form of correspondence with some pre-existing reality. It is based mainly on a strong <italic>pathemization</italic> of the actual experience of the visit to the site, which, in some cases, becomes a form of <italic>re-enactment</italic> of aspects of the trauma itself. We shall see, in both the case of the Tuol Sleng prison and particularly in the case of the Ustica Memorial Museum in Bologna, Italy, two different instances of this: in both these museums visitors are offered an emotional, embodied experience which, in the case of the Bologna museum, is certainly also an aesthetic experience.</p>
<p>Offering strong emotional and even corporeal involvement through specific elements that allude to the dreadful experience of victims now seems a recurrent tendency in contemporary memorial museums. At the US Holocaust Memorial Museum in Washington, DC, for example, each visitor is given an ID card of a person who actually lived during the Holocaust, some Jewish, some not, some adult, some children, some survivors, some not, in order to evoke a more personal sense of identification with individual victims.</p>
<p>The desire to evoke an emotional sensory response of this kind has implications for the material form of the restoration itself, as is the case with the site of the Risiera San Saba in Trieste, in north-eastern Italy – the only Nazi extermination camp in Italy.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0263276411423035">6</xref></sup> In 1965 the site was declared a national monument and opened as a museum. In this case the choice of aesthetic strategy was to modify the entrance to the site, building two high walls that did not exist in the original camp (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0263276411423035">Figure 1</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0263276411423035">7</xref></sup>
<fig id="fig1-0263276411423035" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>The restored entrance at Risiera San Saba, Trieste</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0263276411423035-fig1.tif"/></fig></p>
<p>This type of intervention can be seen as a form of <italic>pathemic restoration</italic>: its goal is obviously to affect visitors emotionally and even physically, as they will experience while entering this narrow corridor a feeling of oppression and claustrophobic enclosedness that may be <italic>something like</italic> what prisoners of the Nazi camp might have felt themselves, though for very different reasons. This is another example of an attempt to reproduce in the actual bodies of visitors an almost unimaginable <italic>felt reality</italic> of the past. Using the theoretical notion created by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0263276411423035">Lévi-Strauss (1958</xref>) to describe the effect of the Kuna singing, we could say that this type of restoration has a particular <italic>symbolic efficacy</italic> in relation to those who visit the site, affecting their feelings, emotions and sensory-perceptual reactions.</p>
<p>The three case studies discussed in this paper include two more ‘classical’ trauma sites: the Tuol Sleng Museum of the Crimes of Genocide in Phnom Penh, Cambodia; Villa Grimaldi in Santiago, Chile; and a third, more recent, museum: The Ustica Memorial Museum (Museo per la Memoria di Ustica) located in Bologna, Italy.</p>
<p>The first two sites are interesting examples of very different ways of using traumatic memories in post-conflict societies; the third represents a case of discursive displacement into an artistic form of experimentation. In this last case, the wreckage of an aircraft is itself the spatial location of the traumatic event to be remembered, which is an air crash involving precisely this aircraft. Although, in this case, the ‘site’ is constituted by an object and not a physical place, from the point of view of the formal categorization suggested above, based on the dimension of indexicality, the Ustica Museum belongs to the same conceptual category and is from all points of view a trauma site. Moreover, the Ustica Memorial Museum exhibits in an exemplary way key tendencies now characterizing contemporary trauma sites and memorial museums. Before returning to the Ustica Museum, and considering how it might challenge the aesthetics of memory, the Tuol Sleng and Villa Grimaldi museums will be discussed, in order to distinguish the different poetics of site-specificity that have been tried out.</p>

<sec id="sec3-0263276411423035"><title>Tuol Sleng Museum of the Crimes of Genocide, Phnom Penh</title>
<p>The Tuol Sleng Museum of Genocide Crimes in Phnom Penh is on the site of the infamous ‘S-21’, the largest centre of detention, interrogation and torture established by the Khmer Rouge secret police in Democratic Kampuchea during their dictatorship period from 1975 to 1979.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-0263276411423035">8</xref></sup> The full extent of the Cambodian genocide is still unclear, but it appears to encompass almost two million deaths in a population of eight million inhabitants. S-21, rather than a prison, was mainly a locus for interrogation and torture; in particular, it has been estimated that the number of Tuol Sleng victims was somewhere between 15,000 and 17,000 persons, mainly intermediate cadres of the Party. Only seven survivors were discovered in S-21 by the Vietnamese troops that entered Phnom Penh on 7 January 1979, thus marking the end of the Pol Pot regime.</p>
<p>In early 1979, the Vietnamese and their Cambodian anti-Khmer Rouge allies faced a completely devastated country, with no infrastructure, hospitals, schools, or state organization of any kind. Despite the fact that an emergency situation of this kind might have suggested other priorities, the interim administration and the Vietnamese decided to immediately transform S-21 into a museum; in March 1979, less than three months after the liberation of Phnom Penh, the first visitors entered the museum, which at that time was open only to foreign journalists and international delegations.</p>
<p>For the Vietnamese, what was at stake here was clearly the need to justify their military intervention in Cambodia that, in the face of the horrors of S-21, would appear not only justified but almost a humanitarian duty, transforming them from foreign invaders into liberators. Something similar held for the new government that followed the Khmer Rouge dictatorship, the Cambodian People's Republic of Kampuchea, whose role had to be transformed from collaborators with invaders to liberators of their own country from a prior state of dictatorship.</p>
<p>Right from the start, Tuol Sleng played an important role in the political framing of the post-Khmer context, as part of a more general strategy of identity construction for the new Cambodia, involving a complex rewriting of its past, its national identity, its international legitimacy. The museum is not only a monument to the atrocities of the Cambodian genocide but also a symbol of radical discontinuity with the past and a crucial element in the construction of the future national identity of Cambodia. The museum is located in central Phnom Penh, not far from the Mekong River, in what, before the advent of the Khmer Rouge, was one of the most elegant and affluent residential areas of Phnom Penh, inhabited by members of the middle and upper classes of the Cambodian bourgeoisie. Originally, the building, built in the 1960s, was a French college for education of the future governing class, and it is thus endowed with a certain architectural elegance, a large garden, trees, playing fields and sports facilities for students, all perfectly preserved up to the present day (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0263276411423035">Figure 2</xref>).
<fig id="fig2-0263276411423035" position="float"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p>Tuol Sleng Museum, Phnom Penh. Courtyard</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0263276411423035-fig2.tif"/></fig></p>
<p>The conversion of the college into the notorious torture centre S-21 did not alter the external appearance of the place, which was in turn also kept intact during the later reconfiguration of the place as museum. Everything is now as it was then: we can see some of the instruments of torture, the narrow cells where prisoners were huddled, the interrogation rooms. Even the bloodstains on the floor and on the walls have not been cleaned up, but rather carefully preserved, exactly as they were upon the entry of the Vietnamese troops into S-21 in 1979. When moving inside the museum, a first important element that one notices is the almost total absence of information material. Visitors who do not yet know about the history of Cambodia and the Khmer Rouge regime will not find any help here to understand the fundamental roots of the genocide, its causes, or the complex network of responsibilities concealed within it.</p>
<p>In general terms, museum information materials represent an important interpretative device that makes the place more intelligible by providing historical and geopolitical background for understanding what is displayed there. Explicative documentation of this kind is a semiotic mediation device, an interpretant, in Peirce's sense, making fundamental information accessible for visitors, and also those who come from other cultural backgrounds than the one to which the museum belongs. Nothing of this kind is provided for visitors to Tuol Sleng. Without such transcultural translation, visitors only have impressionistic, immediate access to the exhibits, based mainly on sensations and impressions rather than on cognitive content. Tuol Sleng is, then, a museum to be felt rather than to be known or understood. Accordingly, the material exhibited is largely visual (images, maps), as well as numerous examples of human remains, skulls and bones, contained in large glass cases. The last few rooms at the end of the tour are fully occupied by huge colourful paintings by Vann Nath, one of the seven survivors of S-21 (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0263276411423035">Figure 3</xref>).
<fig id="fig3-0263276411423035" position="float"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p>Tuol Sleng Museum. Painting by Vann Nath</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0263276411423035-fig3.tif"/></fig></p>
<p>Over and above direct exposure to a glass case display of human remains, the most striking feature of Tuol Sleng is probably the thousands and thousands of photographic portraits of victims covering the walls of the four main buildings of the museum, particularly Building B (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0263276411423035">Figures 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0263276411423035">5</xref>).
<fig id="fig4-0263276411423035" position="float"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p>Tuol Sleng Museum. ID photos of prisoners</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0263276411423035-fig4.tif"/></fig>
<fig id="fig5-0263276411423035" position="float"><label>Figure 5</label><caption><p>Tuol Sleng Museum. ID photos of prisoners</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0263276411423035-fig5.tif"/></fig></p>
<p>These portraits were taken by a special service unit of the Khmer Rouge when prisoners entered S-21. Although all the photos were carefully stored together with their personal data, those currently on display in the museum offer no indication of the name of the victim, place of birth or any other demographic data. The absence of prisoners’ names is somewhat surprising because it contradicts a well established tradition that was initiated at the beginning of the 19th century. The names of the fallen or the victims play an important role in all contemporary monuments and memorials, where a ‘Wall of Names’ is a constantly recurrent element, from Yad Vashem to the monument in Washington, DC, for American soldiers killed during the war in Vietnam.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-0263276411423035">9</xref></sup></p>
<p>The vast majority of the photographs at Tuol Sleng are full frontal portraits of faces that are apparently dispassionate, without any visible trace of emotion or feeling, and the contrast between their apparent lack of emotion and the knowledge the visitor has of the place (a knowledge that the prisoners themselves could not have avoided having) is certainly one of the main reasons for the strong emotional impact these photographs produce.</p>
<p>Luc <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0263276411423035">Boltanski (1992)</xref>, in his seminal work on the representation of pain, refers to three different thematic narrative roles: the persecutor, the victim and the spectator. At Tuol Sleng, visitors look at the images of victims from a full frontal position, but since the victims were all staring into the camera at the time the picture was being taken, visitors find themselves in precisely the same visual position as the persecutors at the time, gazing at the victim from exactly the same point of view, almost as if through the eyes of the persecutors themselves.</p>
<p>When looking at these images, the space of enunciation once occupied by the persecutor-photographer becomes coincident with that of the spectator-visitor: we are essentially seeing ‘what he saw’. In this way the actors involved in the scene are not only visitors and absent victims: this visual device also activates, by way of the positioned gaze of the viewer, the imaginary spectre of the absent persecutor. We could say that the meeting of the two gazes of victim and spectator opens a virtual space filled by the third role, that of the persecutor, a space ambiguously occupied by the viewer at the actual moment of his or her gazing at the victim. The visual artefact operates as an activator of implicit traces of the original act of enunciation inscribed in the photographic text itself.</p>
<p>Finally, the images we are looking at are photographs of the dead: people who, when they were photographed, were still alive, but were soon going to die, and are now dead as we look at them. This brings to the fore a quite complex and difficult issue, a basic ambiguity characterizing all trauma sites: the making visible of traces of bodies of those who have lost their lives there. Gazing at these photographic images brings into question our own position as ‘spectator’ with its inevitable ‘voyeuristic’ implications.</p>
<p>In this dynamic movement of meanings, the perspectives of victim, persecutor, and spectator can become superimposed: as visitors we cannot remain purely ‘outside observers’ – we are, paradoxically, located in a kind of middle ground where the gaze of the persecutor met that of the persecuted. We empathize with the suffering and pain of the victims exposed to our naked gaze, sometimes to the point of feeling actual physical discomfort in our bodies, while at the same time gazing at them from the outside, just as their persecutors did.</p>
<p>This mechanism of multiple gazes, and the particular positioning of the visitor within this complex semiotic system, makes Tuol Sleng a very special place that transcends the logic of pure representation and becomes a device for presentification of trauma, where the dead are not only represented, but also re-presented – made present for us through each new gaze that focuses on them, while at the same time questioning the meaning of their demise. This strong effect of presence produces a shift in the role of the visitor, who is immersed directly in the experience through their pathemic involvement.</p>
<p>Visiting Tuol Sleng can hardly leave us indifferent, quite the opposite: it is a deeply disturbing experience that produces an almost physical sense of discomfort. Visitors are invited to participate, at least for the duration of their visit, in a fully embodied immersive experience that can be seen as a form of re-enactment of the traumatic experience itself; in doing so they change roles – they are no longer merely visitors looking around and gathering information, they become, at least to some extent, a part of the historical narrative itself. They become, in a sense, witnesses themselves.</p>
<p>Empirical research recently conducted on visitors to Tuol Sleng by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0263276411423035">Hughes (2008)</xref> confirms these impressions: almost all visitors interviewed complained about the lack of information on the museum but considered the experience of the visit as a significant act of testimony, a symbolic gesture of solidarity and a form of responsible humanitarian tourism. What is perceived as relevant after the visit is not ‘I learned more’, but rather ‘I've seen’, which is precisely the personal positioning that qualifies the role of the witness.</p>
<p>Other elements contribute to the special effect of presence elicited by the photographs of the victims at Tuol Sleng. Firstly, there is the quantitative dimension: thousands of faces cover the walls of the museum, each one different in all their individuality, yet all the same. Here quantity becomes quality, producing a particular meaning effect definable as generalizing typification. The combination of these thousands of photographs, different and similar at the same time, tends to cancel out individual differences and give back to the visitor only one face, one general type instead of a multitude of single tokens: the victim type. This is not a casual choice, but it is part of a complex ideological reconstruction of the past brought into operation through the creation of the Tuol Sleng Museum. Indeed, the multiple S-21 victims may not have been so completely innocent as it might seem, since prisoners at the centre were intermediate or high-level cadres in the Khmer Rouge apparatus. However, through the cancellation of their names and personal life stories, only the endless horror of the past remains, as if it all happened without any individualized apportionment of responsibility.</p>
<p>Perhaps precisely because it does not question the complexity of the past and the controversial nature of the traumatic events that occurred there, Tuol Sleng was able to become a national monument that is now part of contemporary Cambodian identity. It is ‘the central symbolic site of the founding of the modern Cambodian nation, the ruling Cambodian People's Party (CPP) and, officially, of the population's gratitude to Vietnam and the CPP for their defeat of the Khmer Rouge’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0263276411423035">Hughes, 2003</xref>: 186). The powerful symbolic relevance and emotional value of a site of this kind operates as a potent device for constructing a common collective memory instead of a chaos of contrasting and conflicting sets of individual memories. In a way, this museum stands in place of the not yet resolved political process of rewriting the past conflict by assigning legal and other forms of responsibility for the genocide (it must be remembered that it was only in 2009 that a legal process was first instituted in order to try the former commandant of S-21, Kaing Kek Eav, known as Duch).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-0263276411423035">10</xref></sup></p>
<p>The Tuol Sleng complex is today not only a central symbolic site for Cambodian national cultural identity and self representation, but also a topical place in the Phnom Penh urban landscape, and is as such both perceived and represented in the everyday discourse of the city. The fact that the visual integrity of this place has been carefully preserved over time guarantees its integral recognizability and symbolic value as perhaps the most emblematic monument of Phnom Penh and its past history. We could say that Tuol Sleng lies, physically and symbolically, at the very core of the city itself: all the discourses of self-representation of the city – from websites to tourist guides – emphasize the importance for tourists and other visitors to visit the museum.</p>
<p>Tuol Sleng is a museum designed to activate emotions rather than give information, a place that depicts the horror instead of explain why it happened; to use <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0263276411423035">Hughes (2008)</xref> words, Tuol Sleng is more ‘testimonial that epistemological’. Visitors learn very little about the historical background and the policies of the Pol Pot regime during their visit, but perform a symbolic gesture of re-actualization and re-enactment of the trauma experience, and in doing so they become transformed, during the time of their visit, into witnesses of a trauma whose historical reasons and individual responsibility are still partly hidden from both them and the rest of the world.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec4-0263276411423035"><title>Villa Grimaldi, Santiago, Chile</title>
<p>A completely different example of historical trauma site is Villa Grimaldi in Santiago, Chile. The villa, a large building in elegant Italian style with an expansive garden full of flowers and trees, was located in the periphery of the capital city of Santiago. Built in the 19th century by José Arrieta, it passed in the 1960s to the ownership of Emilio Vasallo, who used it as a weekend house. In the 1970s, during the presidency of Salvator Allende, the villa was transformed into a restaurant and meeting place of intellectuals and artists. One year after the Pinochet coup of 11 September 1973, it was acquired by DINA (Dirección Nacional de Inteligencia), the Army secret police, and used as a centre for interrogation and torture until February 1978. In the 1980s the villa passed to the CNI, the national Intelligence Council, the successor of the DINA. It has been estimated that around 4500 persons were imprisoned at Villa Grimaldi, of whom 226 disappeared, either killed during torture, or jettisoned alive into the Pacific Ocean from military aeroplanes.</p>
<p>This site therefore shows a number of similarities to S-21: it is a civil building with originally a different function, later transformed into a centre of interrogation, torture and death. But there is one important difference: in 1987, near the end of the dictatorship, the last head of the CNI, General Hugo Salas Wenzel, sold the villa to his relatives, who owned a construction company. In 1988, just two years before the end of the Pinochet regime, the villa was completely dismantled and all its buildings levelled, in order to construct a high priced condominium, but also in an attempt to cancel all visible signs of the crimes committed there. However, the property speculation project was stopped and after the democratic transition in 1990 Villa Grimaldi was turned over again to the government. It was not until seven years later, in 1997, that the site was transformed into its present form and opened to the public under the name of ‘Parque por la Paz Villa Grimaldi’ (Villa Grimaldi Park for Peace).</p>
<p>The history of the transformation of that empty property into the actual memorial park is worth closer attention, since it casts light on the complex, nonlinear transition to democracy of the Chilean society after the end of the Pinochet dictatorship, as well as on the role civil society and non-governmental social actors can play in preserving and transmitting memory of victims. In 1989 Chile began a negotiated transition to democracy that ended in 1990 with the first civilian government of Patricio Aylwin, who established in the same year the Truth and Reconciliation Commission (Comisión Nacional de la Verdad y la Reconciliatión, or CNVR) to investigate human rights violations during the Pinochet regime. Although the CNVR represented an important first step in acknowledging such violations, its scope was limited and it was not possible to pursue formal prosecutions of perpetrators. These limits have to be framed within the general context of a difficult transition and a still very fragile democracy. Chilean society at the time did not believe it possible to combine a policy of both justice and peace. ‘This was because there was real fear that dealing with the past would destabilize the fragile transition to democracy and would sink the country back into a period of terror’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0263276411423035">Baxter, 2005</xref>: 124).</p>
<p>This was a not unjustified fear, since Pinochet continued to be supported by a large part of the society and the military. Many critics have underlined the fragile character of Chilean democracy during the 1990s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0263276411423035">Drake and Jaksic, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0263276411423035">Winn, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0263276411423035">Portales, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0263276411423035">Paley, 2001</xref>), where pressures to establish justice and truth lived hand in hand with a compulsion to forget and block memories of the past dictatorship. President Aylwin's discourse on the occasion of release of the CNVR report reflects well the current governmental policy of putting the past behind and moving forward. The president said: ‘For the good of Chile, we should look toward the future that unites us more than to the past which separates us’. Aylwin continues by saying that Chileans should not ‘waste our energy in scrutinizing wounds that are irremediable’ (quoted in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0263276411423035">Paley, 2001</xref>: 127). If ‘scrutinizing past wounds’ was perceived as a ‘wasting of energy’, there is little doubt that any attempt at locating, preserving and transmitting the memories of abuses and violations was highly controversial in post-Pinochet Chile, and spaces of memory acquired a residual status, as stated by many authors.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-0263276411423035">11</xref></sup> Chilean democracy appeared ‘amnesiac about the violent past’, and reconciliation ‘a form of concealment … forcing closure over what had yet to be revealed’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0263276411423035">Gómez-Barris, 2009</xref>: 25). A similar point is made by Meade, who claims that there was ‘a deeply contradictory and tentative historical account’ in the way Chile constructed the memory of dictatorship and portrayed in museums its recent history of human rights abuses. ‘Memory sites exist within a society that has not reached any form of reconciliation with the dictatorship, nor held accountable those who carried out its most egregious acts of violence. … The memory sites thus exist as monuments to the contradictions of Chilean society and to the fragility of its democracy’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0263276411423035">Meade, 2001</xref>: 124–5).</p>
<p>The construction of Villa Grimaldi Park for Peace has to be framed and understood within such a larger political and cultural background, where the debate over public history and the way in which victims of the dictatorship should be remembered does not seem to have resulted in any kind of unitary national consciousness. Indeed, despite the CNVR recommendation for an official governmental involvement in symbolic actions aiming at creation of public monuments and parks dedicated to victims, the realization of the Park for Peace was mainly due to engagement on the part of civil society. The government funded the creation of the park as public property, but the role of the organizations representing victims – such as the Association of Relatives of the Detained-Disappeared and the Association of Relatives of the Executed Political Prisoners – was of crucial importance, as well as action by a number of survivors, in particular Pedro Matta, a former detainee at Villa Grimaldi.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-0263276411423035">12</xref></sup> Associations of relatives and survivors played a central role in the decision-making process around how Villa Grimaldi should be transformed into a memory site, a debate involving many different positions and, at the end, different policies regarding traumatic memory. Three different alternatives were discussed: total reconstruction of the villa exactly as it was as a torture centre; construction of a sculpture as a monument to the memory of victims; re-semanticization of the villa in a park, while keeping the few traces left after its dismantlement.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-0263276411423035">13</xref></sup> The last option was the one which was finally adopted.</p>
<p>There is here another profound difference from what happened at Tuol Sleng, where initiative to open the detention centre S-21 as a museum was totally driven by an official policy of the new government, as a tool of political propaganda. In the case of Villa Grimaldi, the agency behind the process was provided by social actors and grass root organizations: associations of relatives, survivors, NGOs, etc. Also the actual choice of name for the site marks an important difference: Tuol Sleng is explicitly defined as a ‘Museum of Genocide Crimes’, while Villa Grimaldi was renamed as ‘Park for Peace’. The different denominations imply a radical shift in the categorization of the place itself, according to a double system of oppositions: ‘museum’ versus ‘park’ on the one hand, and ‘genocide crimes’ versus ‘peace’ on the other, forcing in this way a completely different reading of the site. Starting with the name itself, Villa Grimaldi seems to refuse any externalization of the horror in the form of a trauma site museum, by re-landscaping the estate and reclaiming a primacy of leisure over horror. Despite functional similarities with Tuol Sleng, these two museums could not be more different from one another and, indeed, they play a quite different role in both the overall urban landscapes they belong to and regarding the relevance they assume for the collective memories and cultural identities of their respective countries.</p>
<p>First of all, there is the issue of their location: while Tuol Sleng lies in a very central area of Phnom Penh, Villa Grimaldi is situated in a fairly peripheral area of Santiago. Obviously, these locations were already decided when these places were first chosen to be used as prisons, but physical location comes to play an important role when we look at them in terms of the overall urban landscape. If Tuol Sleng is a fundamental place for the city and for its self-representation, Villa Grimaldi Park for Peace appears marginal and almost hidden in relation to Santiago, since, unlike other memory sites such as the Cementerio General or the Puente Bulnes Memorial Wall, it is not only physically distant from the city centre but is also not particularly well known and rather difficult to find. Although there is a bus route to the area where it is situated, local inhabitants appear unaware of its precise location. When visiting, I could for example not find a taxi driver who knew of the place. In the Santiago tourist guide literature Villa Grimaldi is hardly mentioned at all and it certainly does not have any of the symbolic relevance for Santiago that Tuol Sleng now has for Phnom Penh. Indeed, when I visited Villa Grimaldi there were almost no other visitors there, as opposed to the very large numbers of tourists, Cambodian citizens and school-classes that can be seen each day at Tuol Sleng.</p>
<p>Even more relevant is the temporality and aspectuality characterizing the two trauma sites.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn14-0263276411423035">14</xref></sup> In the case of Villa Grimaldi, the choice to make a park instead of a museum implies a radical shift in the distance between the actual act of remembering and the past atrocities. In Tuol Sleng there is a constant attempt to make the past continuously actual in present time, re-presenting past horrors by keeping everything exactly as it was at the time when torture and death permeated the place. In this way the site seeks to annul the gap between these two temporal phases. Visitors are somehow forced to re-enact the past, in a sort of temporal continuity with its horror. In Villa Grimaldi an opposite strategy is at work: the visitor is in a peaceful park, bearing little sign of the atrocities perpetrated there, located definitely in the past. The act of remembering is situated in a present time marked as radically different from the past: an unbridgeable distance being introduced between the two times. Any form of pathemic re-enactment is in this way foreclosed. The aspectuality dimension is also very different: in the Park for Peace the past is framed within a terminative aspect, and the horror of that time is alluded to long after it has come to an end, and thus does not have any degree of continuity with the present, while in the case of Tuol Sleng the past is actualized as a continuous, never-ending present.</p>
<p>Before discussing in more detail the overall meaning effects of the park, it is necessary to have a closer look at the park space and the way in which it has been constructed. The first thing that can be noticed is the openness of the park, which faces towards the open horizon of the distant mountains: an imaginary contrast with the closedness characterizing the earlier use of Villa Grimaldi as a place of imprisonment. Referring to this particular form of spatialization, Nelly <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0263276411423035">Richard (2001</xref>: 254) questions precisely the relationship between the regular proportions and open plan of the park and the claustrophobic experience of blindfolded victims imprisoned in small cells in the villa. According to Richard the open view is a distancing device producing an effect of remoteness from the traumatic experiences of the past: ‘The homogeneous and geometric spatiality of Villa Grimaldi converts into an ordered <italic>field of vision</italic> what was once a torn <italic>texture of experience</italic>, disembodying the living matter of memory’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0263276411423035">Richard, 2001</xref>: 255, my translation).</p>
<p>The park appears as a pleasant garden full of trees, plants, flowers and coloured mosaics (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0263276411423035">Figures 6</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0263276411423035">7</xref>) which, at least at first glance, does not transmit any sense of a traumatic past, nor bear witness to the many horrendous actions planned and perpetrated there. It is designed in the form of a cross, with a fountain at the crossing point of the two main diagonal paths. The symbolism of the cross is easily interpreted as a religious one, a ‘symbolic place of reconciliation’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0263276411423035">Lazzara, 2003</xref>: 131). According to Gómez-Barris other interpretations are possible, operative within Chile's history of dictatorship and resistance. ‘Meaningfully, the cross summons the slogan “Nunca +”, meaning “Never again” or “No more” that was popularly used by the human rights movement during the military dictatorship’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0263276411423035">Gómez-Barris, 2009</xref>: 62). It seems quite difficult for the visitor, however, to retrieve a similar sense without any more specific information.

<p>Among the few visible signs of what actually happened there is the empty swimming pool, which during the dictatorship was used to torture and kill political prisoners, and a small wooden tower, a recent reconstruction of the original artifact, a water tank for the villa that was transformed into a claustrophobic prison. In each of these places a stone marker indicates what the place was used for: ‘<italic>Piscina: lugar de amedrentamiento</italic>’ (‘Swimming pool: a frightening place’) ‘<italic>La torre: lugar de soledad, tortura y exterminio</italic>’ (‘The tower: place of loneliness, torture and extermination’). These markers are in the form of a mosaic constructed with bricks and tiles from the former villa bathrooms where prisoners were tortured (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-0263276411423035">Figure 8</xref>). These tiles were probably particularly meaningful for prisoners since, being blindfolded, the floor was the only thing they could see (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0263276411423035">Lazzara, 2003</xref>: 134). Other signs of what happened are in the rose garden (<italic>Jardin de las rosas</italic>) where each rose has a small terracotta pillar with the name of one of the women prisoners who disappeared at Villa Grimaldi (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-0263276411423035">Figure 9</xref>). A line from a poem by Gabriela Mistral is written in a small basin surrounded by flowers: ‘<italic>Todas íbamos a ser reinas</italic>’ (We were all going to be queens). Finally, at one end of the park there is a large wall on which are engraved the names of the 226 victims (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10-0263276411423035">Figure 10</xref>).

<p>It is not easy to draw a unitary conclusive reading of the Park for Peace of Villa Grimaldi. Many criticisms have been advanced by different authors on what appear to be the two most critical aspects: the overall aesthetic of the place and a general difficulty in reading and interpreting the site. Nelly <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0263276411423035">Richard (2001)</xref> is among the most critical voices regarding the arrangement of the park, in particular the ‘aesthetic’ use of the tiles and bricks from the villa to compose decorative mosaics with the very same material that belonged to the rooms where prisoners were tortured and killed. According to Richard, we have a disturbing contrast and a striking discrepancy here, between what, in semiotic terms, could be defined as the relationship between expression and content. The result fails to capture the ‘dissolution of the semantic and referential world of the victims, reduced to silence, babbling and shaking by methodical procedures for the eradication of consciousness’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0263276411423035">Richard, 2001</xref>: 255, my translation). The same happens, according to Richard, in the rose garden, where the line by Gabriela Mistral together with the conventional poetic effect of roses produces a rhetoric of femininity sharply in contrast with the memory of the abominable sexual abuse suffered by women prisoners. Similar remarks are made by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0263276411423035">Lazzara (2003</xref>: 134), who equally objects to the ‘aesthetics of embellishment and smoothing’ reproduced in the park, arguing for the impossibility of inscribing horror within the category of ‘beauty’.</p>
<p>The second criticism is related to what could be considered a general ‘lack of sense’, or perhaps more appropriately ‘a sense of lack’, that seems to pervade the site. The visitor encounters a pleasant but unspecified garden, lacking any internal tracks, pathways or other meaningful directions to help ‘read’ the place. Little concrete information is provided to contextualize both the narrative and the history of the place. Interestingly, the only guidebook to the park is in English, by Pedro Alejandro <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0263276411423035">Matta (2000)</xref>, a former detainee at Villa Grimaldi and one of the most active volunteers promoting the park. It is possible that the rationale for this choice is the conviction that the local ‘community of mourners’ is already intimately bonded to the place and does not need the kind of documentation that, on the contrary, would be necessary for a less informed international audience. But the ‘living memory’ embedded in this and similar places is destined to slowly dissolve, as living witnesses disappear and time moves towards post-memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0263276411423035">Hirsh, 1997</xref>). The youngest Chilean generation of 20-year-olds has had no direct experience of the dictatorship and thus may well not know much about it.</p>
<p>In the face of these criticisms, it should be noted that other, alternative readings, are possible. For example, according to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0263276411423035">Gómez-Barris (2009</xref>: 66) the Peace Park<disp-quote>
<p>brackets the experiences at Villa Grimaldi as those of trauma, loss, and victimhood. That is, rather than highlight the national issue of domination, resistance, revolution, and counterrevolution that was at stake at Villa Grimaldi, the architectural elements of the park are framed in this limited understanding of the multifaceted history that the place represents, presenting an important, albeit ultimately limited, view of the past.</p></disp-quote>In this vein, one could claim that the decision to move away from any form of realistic representation, or re-presentation, of the horror and atrocities is a political decision <italic>against</italic> representation and its rhetoric, and thus a conscious turning away from the memorial museum aesthetic.</p>
<p>Depending on which of these two lines of interpretation we adopt, we can reach a very different, almost oppositional, conclusion, reading the place as a successful attempt to redesign the landscape of traumatic memory or as a symbolic monument to the contradictions of Chilean society. For Gómez-Barris, ‘despite the complexities of representation and memory, the Peace Park constructs an alternative public sphere that is enhanced and made salient through spaces of reflection and architectural design’ (2009: 70). For Meade, on the contrary, ‘Considering its horrific past, today the well-tended park is itself a contradiction’, a place where local school children and teenagers come in the early evening to talk and hang out, but where it ‘is unclear how much the park's young visitors understand the history commemorated there’ (2001: 132).</p>
<p>A similar diversity of interpretations opens a series of questions to which there are no easy answers: is it possible to maintain and transmit memories of past atrocities while moving away from direct representation of them, and from an explicit aesthetic of ‘realism of horror’? Can the Park for Peace be seen as a place of ‘reconciled’ memory, or does it fatally become a place of oblivion? A possible answer may lie precisely in the multiple readings, users and practices that the park seems to enable. Survivors and relatives of victims can come to mourn, equally well as schoolboys can come to play football. In this sense the openness characterizing the park space could be taken as a metaphor for an open, non-univocal reading of the overall ‘sense of place’.</p>
<p>The Park for Peace does not aim to produce in the visitor the kind of almost unbearable emotional effect that Tuol Sleng does; on the contrary, it constructs a distancing space from past horror and can thus risk becoming perceived as a space of indeterminacy and contradiction. This is not by chance. The park reflects, in this respect, the ambiguity and complexity of the Chilean transition to democracy: in the first years after the end of the dictatorship, there were diffuse fears that a too direct representation of Pinochet's crimes could destabilize a yet fragile democracy, as many scholars have pointed out. These worries have certainly not been extraneous to the choice that led to the transformation of Villa Grimaldi to the Park for Peace. The difficulties and ambiguities of this process are clearly visible in the urban landscape itself: it is, for example, worth noticing that one of the most important avenues in the centre of Santiago is still called Avenida 11 de Septiembre (Avenue September 11), in memory of the Pinochet coup (11 September 1973). Various attempts on the part of democratically oriented political parties to change the name of this street have not succeeded, due to opposition from the Santiago administration, who have the support of a considerable number of its citizens.</p>
<p>Tuol Sleng and the Villa Grimaldi Park for Peace demonstrate two quite different, almost antagonistic, answers to one key problem: how best to create and transmit a sense of shared memory in a country that still has not yet managed to come to terms with its own traumatic past. The Cambodian museum, through a pitiless, disturbing denouncement of what actually went on there, strongly emphasizes the emotional components embedded in the indexicality of the trauma site, while the Chilean Park for Peace neutralizes and distances itself from the same elements.</p>
<p>The two sites can also be read on the background of two different politics of memory: Tuol Sleng aims to reconstruct a unified, univocal national identity through representation of past horror; Villa Grimaldi forecloses in the most radical sense the very possibility of reconstructing such a unifying symbolic representation of identity, opening up for multiple, almost contradictory, readings.</p>

<sec id="sec5-0263276411423035"><title>The Ustica Memorial Museum, Bologna, Italy</title>
<p>On 27 June 1980 the Itavia DC-9 aircraft on a regular flight from Bologna to Palermo disappeared from view in the national air radar control system and plunged into the Mediterranean between the small islands of Ustica, close to Sicily, and Ponza, which lies midway between Rome and Naples. All 77 passengers, amongst them 11 children between the ages of 2 and 12, and two under 24 months, together with the four members of the crew, died in the crash.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn15-0263276411423035">15</xref></sup></p>
<p>The first hypothesis after the crash was of a sudden collapse of some fundamental bearing structures of the plane; and, indeed, due to this particular suspicion the Itavia company went bankrupt shortly after the event. However, from the very beginning there were serious doubts about the real cause of the disaster, and other hypotheses began taking form, amongst these, an explosive device placed in the plane, or a guided missile from outside.</p>
<p>In 1982 a state commission was charged to investigate what appeared to be one of the most controversial cases of public catastrophes in Italy in this historical period.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn16-0263276411423035">16</xref></sup> For over 15 years a series of inquiries followed one after another, dogged by various cover-up attempts on the part of the highest levels of the national military authorities and military aeronautic command, who, at a certain stage, were accused by the commission of committing acts of high treason.</p>
<p>It was in 1999 that a final sentence, handed down on the case by magistrate Rosario Priore at the Rome Tribunal, stated the real nature of what had happened that night in the sky over the Tirrenian sea: it was not an accident but a real act of war, in an undeclared war taking place at the time, unknown to public opinion, that ‘by mistake’ had killed 81 innocent civilians. The DC-9 was brought down by a missile shot by a military combat plane of a NATO member nation, probably trying to bring down a Libyan plane, supposedly transporting General Gaddafi, and possibly concealing itself behind the Itavia flight.</p>
<p>At the present moment, the identity of the NATO nation involved in the presumed military action at Ustica is still unknown, and there is considerable uncertainty as to whether it might have been the United States or France. A claim for compensation has been recently advanced to the French state, but since the case is classified as an international military affair, common law regulations have no jurisdiction over foreign military command authorities, as is also the case regarding internal affairs of the Italian military command.</p>
<p>During this long legal inquiry and political process, a central role was played by the Association of Families of Victims of the Ustica Massacre (<italic>Associazione Parenti delle Vittime della Strage di Ustica</italic>), founded on 20 May 1988, whose president, Daria Bonfietti, sister of one of the victims of the incident and member of the Italian Senate for many years, fought continually for the establishment of the truth regarding the incident itself and for the construction of the museum as a place of memory.</p>
<p>At a social and political level, a process has been taking place over all these years, not only in relation to the Ustica case itself but also regarding other massacres in Italy. On the one hand there was a fundamental delegitimization of the authority of the state itself, which was seen as inadequate, perhaps even directly involved in perpetuation and covering up of criminal activities. On the other hand, there was a displacement of political initiative on the part of the state regarding such cases over to civil society organizations, for example the Families of Victims Association, and, with regard to management of legal inquiries, over to the magistrates courts. Legal discourse thus became more and more a substitute for a general lack of political recognition and action at state level, with the courts themselves assuming in many cases a role traditionally occupied by political institutions.</p>
<p>Space limitations do not permit the discussion of further details of Italian political life during the last three decades, but some insights from this are nonetheless necessary in order to frame the basic cultural background within which the idea of a museum took root. They are also necessary in order to understand the complex role the Ustica museum project has come to assume in this context, since it has mutated into a postponed, prolonged funeral rite, as well as functioning as an elementary form of compensation for a fundamental lack of publicly enunciated truth.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn17-0263276411423035">17</xref></sup></p>
<p>During the long years of the investigation, starting in 1987, the remains of the aircraft, together with a number of personal belongings of victims, were recovered from the sea floor, and a skeleton fuselage with what remained of the DC-9 was reconstructed in a military hangar at Pratica di Mare, close to Rome. This reconstruction ended in 1991, and at that point the wreckage was put at the disposal of the Families of Victims Association, rather than being destroyed, which would normally have happened in a less controversial case.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the idea of constructing a museum to conserve the wreckage and maintain a memory of the event was put to the local administration at Bologna. Bologna was not a casual choice: the Itavia flight 870 route was from Bologna to Palermo, and since Bologna was the point of departure, most of the victims were from that city. More crucially, the Families of Victims Association was also based there, and the local municipality had always been actively involved in supporting the museum project. After much discussion and a pilot project that was never realized, a final destination for the museum was found in a disused municipal tram terminal in the immediate periphery of Bologna.</p>
<p>In June 2006 the plane wreckage was transported to Bologna by 15 fire-trucks while the whole event was recorded on video.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn18-0263276411423035">18</xref></sup> The artist Christian Boltanski was invited to design an installation based on the plane wreckage within the museum, and on 27 June 2007, 27 years after the disaster, the Ustica Memorial Museum (<italic>Museo per la Memoria di Ustica</italic>) was officially opened to the public. From its day of opening the museum was not connected to other historical museums in the city, but instead to the Museum of Modern and Contemporary Art in Bologna (Mambo). Although this choice certainly depended on the participation and artistic renown of Boltanski, it also represents an implicit indication regarding an intended reading of the museum itself.</p>
<p>The Ustica Memorial Museum comprises only one single large installation space, plus a small lateral room where video documentaries and other digital documentation of the Ustica case can be viewed by visitors. The installation space is a rectangular room, dominated by the immense reconstruction from the wreckage of the plane, occupying the entire area, situated at a level of one meter below the visitors’ walking space, a narrow elevated gallery surrounding the space containing the wreckage (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11-0263276411423035">Figure 11</xref>). From this gallery, visitors can <italic>see</italic> the reconstructed plane wreckage but cannot approach, touch, or enter it. The wreckage is positioned on a strewn pebble floor, which reminds us of the sea floor. Around it, nine large black wooden cases formed like huge coffins are placed side by side on the floor.
<fig id="fig11-0263276411423035" position="float"><label>Figure 11</label><caption><p>Ustica Memorial Museum, Bologna. Interior</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0263276411423035-fig11.tif"/></fig></p>
<p>The spatial opposition created between the two spaces – the lower floor with the wreckage and the visitors’ gallery above – seems to allude to a related system of temporal oppositions, where the wreckage represents the time of the past, while the gallery is the present time of the living visitors. But things are far more complex than that, and the mutual intertwining of present and past, life and death, is much more rich and intriguing.</p>
<p>Before entering into a more detailed discussion of the above mentioned matters, it is necessary to describe in more detail the very first impressions that a casual visitor experiences.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn19-0263276411423035">19</xref></sup> Entering the large room containing the installation, the visitors are captured by a poly-sensorial environment affecting their most primary senses, in particular, sight and hearing. Only slowly is one able to disambiguate the many different sensory effects, by localizing their diverse sources. A strange auditory impression pervades the room: rhythmic whisperings that are not clearly distinguishable as anything meaningful to begin with, but which bring to mind the murmur of ocean waves. The lighting in the space also seems to be rhythmically changing, which is due to 81 hanging lamps that are slowly and regularly pulsating with greater or lesser intensity.</p>
<p>However, the most intense sense impression is certainly due to the first sight of the immense plane wreckage itself, which occupies the whole of the main museum space. The skeletal mass of wreckage is made up of more than 2000 fragments recovered from the sea at Ustica, each labelled with a small piece of paper containing the notes and numbers used by the investigators while they were creating a complete inventory of the found remains of the aircraft. The indexical meaning effect of the wreckage is astonishingly powerful: it is almost impossible not to imagine what it was like to be there, and what must have been experienced by the unknowing passengers on that last, tragic flight. This intense reality effect depends precisely on the fact that what one is seeing is the ‘real’ aircraft, or at least what was left of it, patiently reassembled, piece by piece over time.</p>
<p>But is this the ‘real’ aircraft? Here again one faces the authenticity dilemma mentioned previously. Indeed, the remains of the plane retrieved from the ocean floor originally included much more than what can now be seen in the museum: tons of different materials, including seats, cables, and many other components belonging to the destroyed aircraft. What we see here is therefore a reconstruction of only a part of that reality rather than <italic>reality</italic> itself, which is due to a careful selection process and systematic choices made to produce a very precise <italic>reality effect</italic>.</p>
<p>Walking along the gallery, the visitor soon realizes that the sounds she has heard when entering the room come from 81 black mirrors, hung in a row along two of the walls of the rooms, with the other two walls occupied by large windows covered by translucent white curtains (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12-0263276411423035">Figure 12</xref>).
<fig id="fig12-0263276411423035" position="float"><label>Figure 12</label><caption><p>Ustica Memorial Museum, Bologna. Black mirror balcony</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0263276411423035-fig12.tif"/></fig></p>
<p>Behind each of the black mirrors is hidden a loudspeaker diffusing the sound of one recorded voice, all of which are different: some men, some women, some children, all whispering a series of different sentences. Approaching each mirror, the visitor can hear better what is said and understand what the sentences are: fragments of conversations, or thoughts that the passengers might possibly have exchanged with one another (or themselves) during the flight before the crash.</p>
<p>These voices constitute the aesthetic core of the original Boltanski installation: the artist has given voice to all 81 victims, attributing one imaginary sentence to each, and having a professional actor or actress record these for use in the installation. All these sentences are related to passengers’ possible everyday concerns, small talk and, more than anything else, their plans and projections of their lives into the future, whether part of a long-term plan or just a minor detail in a short-term future never to be realized (‘tomorrow I'll put on my white dress’, ‘in Palermo I'll eat the best ice cream in town’).</p>
<p>In this way the gallery becomes the place where the different temporal dimensions in play confront one another: the voices come from the past, but are enunciated in a circular, repetitive durative present, which in its turn confronts the present time of visitors circling around the wreckage. In this way an initial short-circuit is produced between the past and an endless, circular present, where the different voices are ‘condemned’ to repeat forever their very own same sentence. But at the same time the voices are all whispering about possible futures, part of the larger life project in which all human beings are immersed.</p>
<p>In this complex intertwining of the past moment from which all the voices come, the present moment with their own enunciation in the museum space, and the future they refer to – a future never to be – a kind of temporal rupture begins to materialize. This is the punctual time of the catastrophe itself, absent from the words of the voices since all come from a time just <italic>before the crash</italic>. It is the visitor, the visitor alone, who bridges this gap, connecting, through the immediacy of her presence, different temporal dimensions: the unending projection of the dead passengers’ voices into their never accomplished future lives, and the terminative moment of the crash, the final closure that put an end to all their futures.</p>
<p>Similarly to what occurred in the Tuol Sleng Museum, although through different means, here too the particular positioning of the visitor within the installation system operates as a meaning device that re-enacts one aspect of the victims’ experience. However, in the case of the Ustica Museum, the pathemic effect in the visitor is enhanced by a painful awareness that victims of the crash at that time had no awareness at all of what was about to happen to them. The visitor in this way becomes, rather than a spectator of a represented trauma, a witness of a fragment in time before a tragedy endlessly re-presenting itself.</p>
<p>There is one other very important feature in Boltanski's installation that powerfully reinforces this particular reading of the role of visitors as witnesses, bonding them even more intimately to the position of the victims. In the Ustica Memorial Museum the victims are, apparently, <italic>absent</italic>: they are never represented, their names are never revealed, their photographs never shown. While the wreckage can be seen from all possible positions in the room, the victims are invisible: they occupy the place of absence, they are outside of the realm of representation, the non-representable side of the massacre. However, despite this absence, they are constantly made present through various meaning displacement devices and rhetorical substitution. Indeed, the museum itself could be read as a sophisticated device for creating a displaced re-presentation of the traumatic event, rather than as a representational instance of it.</p>
<p>The first meaning displacement is the substitution of unnamed victims by their whispered voices, bringing to our present time sonic fragments of their imagined life stories. This at the same time produces a shift from the real world the victims belonged to, over to the <italic>fictional world</italic> constructed by the artist. We are not told <italic>who</italic> the victims were, or what their names were, but we are constantly prodded to <italic>imagine</italic> what kinds of concerns and thoughts might <italic>possibly</italic> have occupied them in the last moments of their lives.</p>
<p>A second meaning displacement is present in the sphere of images and visual representations. As mentioned above, no photographs or other representational devices regarding the victims are provided for visitors; the loudspeakers that, in a way, speak for them are all hidden behind 81 black mirrors, which correspond to the number of victims. The mirrors clearly act as an implicit substitution for actual images of each of the victims, and vaguely recall a similar number of gravestones in a cemetery. But at the same time, they are real mirrors that create a reflection of the visitors as they look into them. What the visitor sees when facing one of the mirrors is not the image of a victim but his or her own face looking back. This forces a powerful identification with the victim, bringing into play the possibility of becoming a casual victim oneself of an unexpected massacre of this kind. It is interesting to compare this meaning effect with what was going on in the case of the use of visual imagery of victims at the Tuol Sleng Museum (absent at Villa Grimaldi). At Tuol Sleng, a visitor looking at the photographs of the dead prisoners occupies an ambiguous position previously occupied by a photographer-persecutor. At the Ustica Museum the space of representation of the victim is an empty space, an absence filled by the reflected image of the visitor. Another short-circuit seems to take place here, not on the temporal but rather on the visual plane. The visitor is positioned in precisely the same space where the image of the victim ‘ought’ to be, framed in their empty image. At the same time, in confronting their own face in the mirror, visitors are able to see, reflected in the background over their shoulders, the massive volume of the wreckage, reminding them of the reality of what happened in the past.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn20-0263276411423035">20</xref></sup></p>
<p>Finally, a third displacement involves a metonymical rhetorical substitution from persons to objects: the personal belongings of the DC-9 passengers recovered from the sea floor. As mentioned initially, placed alongside the wreckage of the plane are nine huge wooden cases lying on the floor, each covered with black cloth – nine, of course, being an exact sub-multiple of 81. These cases contain all the passengers’ personal belongings recovered from the crash site, but these will never be directly subjected to the view of the visitor. A choice of this kind seems to extend to these material objects the same sacredness attributed to dead bodies that should be preserved, but out of sight, and thus piously hidden. Personal belongings as well as bodies appear to be seen as too intimate, too personal to be exposed to our view.</p>
<p>Visitors discover what is inside the nine black cases only at the very end of their visit, when they each receive a small booklet entitled: <italic>Lista degli oggetti personali appartenenti ai passaggeri del volo IH870</italic> (‘The list of the HI870 flight passengers’ personal belongings’). All the objects were carefully photographed before being put into the cases, and are reproduced in the book in the form of sub-lists according to their general categories (e.g. shoes, bags, glasses, wallets) without any further reference to their individual owners. The photographs remind us in a way of police photos and, being thus de-contextualized from their normal areas of use and their absent owners, produce a powerful type of meaning effect involving both a sense of estrangement and one of involvement (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig13-0263276411423035">Figure 13</xref>). Visitors are allowed to keep the booklet when they leave the museum, as a kind of rhetorical substitute for the characteristic photographs of the dead persons that in Italy are distributed after a funeral to people who attend.
<fig id="fig13-0263276411423035" position="float"><label>Figure 13</label><caption><p>Ustica Memorial Museum, Bologna. Detail of information booklet</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0263276411423035-fig13.tif"/></fig></p>
<p>To conclude, the visit to the Ustica Museum is first and foremost an intense, complex aesthetic experience, in apparent contradiction to the widespread idea that we do not visit memorial museums because they contain powerful works of art (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0263276411423035">Young, 1993</xref>). It might be argued that the Ustica Memorial Museum, in that respect, is an extreme example: after all, not all memorials have been designed by famous contemporary artists such as Boltanski, or are administratively connected to local institutions for promoting contemporary art.</p>
<p>In this sense the Ustica Museum differs considerably from both the other two case studies mentioned above, and represents a ‘third’ alternative to both the realism of Tuol Sleng and the representational rarefaction of Villa Grimaldi. It may well be the case that the Boltanski installation represents an exceptional and particular case not quite common in the ‘memorial museum landscape’; it certainly challenges this paradigm in its two main variations of figuration of, or abstraction from, past horrors occurring at the trauma site. The wreckage exhibits all the features of indexical realism, while at the same time transcending reality with a move towards a creative, imaginative, fictional work of art. The re-enactment of the past that takes place in this museum is mediated through this fictional work of art, and not through any direct or realistic representation of horror and death.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec6-0263276411423035"><title>Conclusion: Beyond Indexicality</title>
<p>The three site analyses presented here have shown the high level of cultural and political relevance that trauma sites have gained, particularly in the context of post-conflict societies, and their central role in developing a wide range of culturally diverse <italic>memory politics</italic> that affect in significant ways the national, and global, identities of these societies.</p>
<p>In bearing direct witness to the past, trauma sites do not merely depict a given historical and political situation, but they actually take part in its cultural reconstruction and transformation. This active role depends crucially on their indexical nature. Trauma sites are in this respect much more powerful semiotic devices than any other kind of memorial site, since they already exist as genuine signifiers and testimonials of the past inscribed in the urban landscape, and deeply embedded in their wider historical and cultural context. The many complex and quite different strategies of conservation, transformation, museification or, alternatively, cancellation, become an integral part of the memorialization, or obliteration, of the traumatic past, linking past memory to present history. Tuol Sleng, Villa Grimaldi and the Bologna Ustica Museum each bring into play three quite different memory politics, in this order: (i) re-enactment and re-presentation; (ii) distancing; (iii) symbolic transformation into aesthetic experience.</p>
<p>In the first case, at Tuol Sleng, visitors are relocated in the trauma space, in a sort of ‘frozen past’ where they are subject to a strong sense of emotional and sensorial involvement. In the second, Villa Grimaldi, a process of attenuation is at work, since the traces of the past are less visible and their emotional effects weaker. In a way, Villa Grimaldi presents a less pre-determined and less univocal reading of its material and historical space when compared with Tuol Sleng, but there is also a potential risk of neutralizing the past. The Ustica Museum represents yet one more, different, option, a movement towards an artistic and creative reinterpretation of the traumatic event. The Ustica Museum is also just one more instance of a larger, more pervasive tendency to emphasize pathemic, emotional and other forms of sensory experience – a tendency shared by many other memorial museums and trauma sites today. The visit to both Tuol Sleng and the Ustica Museum, although in quite different ways, offers a kind of ‘total immersion experience’ for visitors, involving all their senses, their somatic participation, and their emotions. In this way visitors become living witnesses of the traumatic past, iteratively re-enacted through their embodied experience. What might be missing in this flow of immediate sensory experience is, paradoxically, a more detailed understanding of the trauma itself as a historical event – i.e. its broader cultural, political and other contextual aspects and connotations. The Ustica Museum in this respect is an exemplary case, since its powerful portfolio of complex sense effects seems to rest mainly in its capacity to capture what is most universal in the fundamental incomprehensibility of all forms of dramatic sudden death, rather than informing us about specific details of this massacre as embedded in its unique historical and cultural context.</p>
<p>It is worth noticing that, with regard to this particular point, all three sites analysed above exhibit one key feature: none really take into account the dense informational dimension of the complexity of the combined historical facts. Although in quite different ways, and perhaps for quite different reasons, in all three trauma sites there is a general lack of factual information and any other kind of instructional materials. As a result, it may become rather difficult to understand the historical, cultural and political network of reasons and causes that underlie these events, as well as their internal dynamics. All this is largely left up to the evocative power of the place itself, to its unique capacity for bringing events of the past forward into our present time by way of its indexical links with what happened. But emotional evocation is something quite different from deep understanding. In this sense the power of indexicality as a signifying device may become a limit, a sort of mono-dimensional enclosure system, lacking any active links to the wider historical, cultural and political context that produced the traumatic event.</p>
<p>The Ustica Museum experiment can be seen, from this point of view, as an attempt to open for a new type of discursive dimension, in this case aesthetic and artistic. In this sense the Ustica case may provide us with an important new methodological development. Obviously it is not a question of transforming all trauma sites into artistic installations, but rather to conceive of, and perhaps invent, a memory politics able to go beyond pure fixations on the past, opening up new dimensions and practices, connecting what went on in the past to the present, and the future.</p>
<p>On a recent visit to Chile, in January 2011, I witnessed a similar case of displacement. Villa Grimaldi, like other smaller trauma sites in the Santiago area, was made the location of an extremely engaging theatre performance, as part of the annual Santiago International Theatre Festival. This performance was <italic>Villa</italic>, written and directed by Guillermo Calderón, which brings to the centre of focus a debate regarding how Villa Grimaldi ought to be preserved and transformed. The three young actresses play the daughters of three women formerly imprisoned and abused in Villa Grimaldi. The trauma site in this case is exploited as both the stage for and subject of a meta-reflection on the very politics of memory behind the transformation of such places into museums or parks, questioning critically positions that may be taken, and choices that may be made, from a political, existential, and aesthetic viewpoint.</p>
<p>This experiment carried out with Villa Grimaldi suggests a new and challenging way to give life to re-actualization of historical memory, connecting traumatic experiences of past generations with the lives and experiences of new ones. Through engaging in such intergenerational encounters, memory politics may escape from a too rigid conception of the past as something fixed in stone for once and for all, weaving into it new creative forms from the present, opening up for new discourses, practices and directions for the future.</p>

<fn id="fn1-0263276411423035"><label>1</label><p>This is, for example, the case of the Memorial Hall in Nanjing (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0263276411423035">Violi, 2009</xref>).</p></fn>
<fn id="fn2-0263276411423035"><label>2</label><p>Trauma Studies have been largely dominated by a strong anti-representational, if not openly iconoclastic, bias against visual representation of traumatic experience. It is generally maintained that no representation can transmit the truth of the traumatic experience which is, in fact, unrepresentable. However, more recently, this position has been challenged (see for example <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0263276411423035">Guerin and Hallas, 2007</xref>).</p></fn>
<fn id="fn3-0263276411423035"><label>3</label><p>The distinction between representation and re-presentation has already been discussed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0263276411423035">Derrida (1982)</xref>. Discussing the concept of representation in the philosophical tradition, Derrida claims that ‘<italic>Vorstellung</italic> seems not to imply immediately the meaning that is carried in the re- of re<italic>-praesentatio</italic>. <italic>Vorstellen</italic> seems to mean simply, as Heidegger emphasizes, to place, to dispose before oneself, a sort of theme or thesis. But this sense or value of being-before is already at work in “present”. <italic>Praesentatio</italic> signifies the fact of presenting and re-<italic>praesentatio</italic> that of rendering present, of a summoning as a power-of-bringing-back-to-presence’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0263276411423035">Derrida, 1982</xref>: 307).</p></fn>
<fn id="fn4-0263276411423035"><label>4</label><p>The issue of realism in relation to representation of trauma is a much discussed topic in Trauma Studies: see for example the notion of traumatic realism discussed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0263276411423035">Rothberg (2000)</xref>.</p></fn>
<fn id="fn5-0263276411423035"><label>5</label><p>I am using here the notion of ‘ideal’ visitor paralleling that of ‘ideal reader’ or ‘model reader’ (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0263276411423035">Eco, 1984</xref>).</p></fn>
<fn id="fn6-0263276411423035"><label>6</label><p>I am indebted to Francesco Mazzucchelli, whom I would like to thank for suggesting this interesting site example.</p></fn>

<fn id="fn10-0263276411423035"><label>10</label><p>Kaing Kek Eav was eventually sentenced to 35 years imprisonment on 27 July 2010, to be calculated from the day of his arrest on 10 June 1999. Of this total confinement period, with 5 years remisssion for cooperation with the court and his recognition of the crimes detracted, 19 years of prison now remain (see <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://cambodiamirror.wordpress.com/2010/07/28/the-former-tuol-sleng-prison-chief-is-sentenced-to-serve-35-years-in-prison-tuesday-27-7-2010/">http://cambodiamirror.wordpress.com/2010/07/28/the-former-tuol-sleng-prison-chief-is-sentenced-to-serve-35-years-in-prison-tuesday-27-7-2010/</ext-link>.)</p></fn>

<fn id="fn14-0263276411423035"><label>14</label><p>I am using here two notions borrowed from linguistics, time and aspect, in order to analyze the semantics of space. In linguistics, temporality refers to the relation between the time of utterance and the action expressed by the verb. Aspectuality refers to the different perspectives from which an action can be described, focalizing on the beginning of an action (<italic>I started reading</italic>), on its duration (<italic>I was reading</italic>), on its final state (<italic>I finished reading</italic>). The same action can be described as punctual (<italic>I read</italic>) or as progressive and continuous (<italic>I was reading for ten hours</italic>).</p></fn>

After three levels of judicial process, a fascist terrorist group was found to be guilty and condemned for mass murder.</p></fn>
