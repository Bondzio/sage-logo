<abstract>
<p>Scholars of women’s parliamentary presence have suggested that the proportion of women parliamentarians rests on the interaction between intra-party and party external conditions, and that these can be discussed in terms of necessity and sufficiency. Still, the field lacks systematic cross-case assessments of such relationships. This research takes an explorative approach to necessity, sufficiency and interaction in the field of gender and party. Using fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis to study 57 individual West European parties, it demonstrates that party behaviour is a function of intra-party and party-external conditions. Furthermore, it shows that when the external factors are not present, parties are themselves able to achieve gender-balanced parliamentary delegations. The article reveals that there are several paths to gender balance, and that the absence of conditions sufficient for balance does not explain why parties do not become gender balanced.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The topic of this study is political parties and women’s parliamentary presence. Understanding the mechanisms that produce gender-balanced parliaments in modern party democracies rests on two levels of analysis: individual parties and the party environment. In addition, the idea that some conditions may be fruitfully framed as necessary or sufficient<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-1354068810380094">1</xref>
</sup> for gender-balanced parliamentary representation has received considerable attention. Several scholars have argued persuasively that intra-party factors combine with party-external conditions in inducing gender balance in national parliaments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1354068810380094">Caul Kittilson, 2006</xref>: 37, 121; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1354068810380094">Norris, 2004</xref>: 187–8, 208; 2006: 204).</p>
<p>Although scholars of women’s representation have recently been paying more attention to interaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1354068810380094">Schmidt, 2009</xref>), strikingly few cross-case analyses using methods designed for exploring necessity, sufficiency and multiple conjunctural causation (see, e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1354068810380094">Ragin, 1987</xref>, 2000) have been published (see, however, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1354068810380094">Krook, 2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1354068810380094">2007</xref>). Consequently, a crucial part of our knowledge about how parties achieve gender-balanced parliamentary groups is left without much empirical testing.</p>
<p>This article provides an explorative reassessment of central arguments in the field of women’s parliamentary representation in industrialized party democracies using fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1354068810380094">Ragin, 2000</xref>). New knowledge is presented about the configurations of conditions that have resulted in individual political parties in West European countries achieving gender-balanced parliamentary delegations. Finally, this research offers tentative results pointing to the reasons why some parties failed to reach gender balance.</p>
<p>The empirical analysis is based on data from 57 individual political parties from 11 West European countries during the late 1980s. In that period, several advanced industrial democracies witnessed an increase in women’s representation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1354068810380094">Hughes and Paxton, 2008</xref>) and the parties that reached gender balance then were therefore pioneers in women’s parliamentary representation.</p>
<p>The results show that not one of the studied conditions was necessary or singularly sufficient for gender-balanced parliamentary parties. The analysis further shows that intra-party conditions interact with other conditions in producing gender balance. This research also reveals that the <italic>absence</italic> of gender balance is explained by different configurations from those that explain the <italic>presence</italic> of gender balance.</p>
<p>The article is structured in four sections. The first provides an overview of central theoretical assumptions made in previous research on women’s representation. The second part introduces the analytical technique and gives details on cases, data and operationalization, whereas the third part presents results from analysis of the presence and absence of gender balance in parliamentary delegations. Conclusions are drawn in the final section and suggestions are made for further research.</p>

<title>Party and gender: Lessons learned</title>
<p>Individual political parties are the main architects of parliamentary representation. By selecting candidates for election, they are able to exert a considerable influence over gender balance in parliament. Therefore parties constitute the primary unit of analysis in this study, and the outcome – gender-balanced parliamentary parties – is modelled as a function of both intra-party and party-external conditions (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1354068810380094">Caul Kittilson, 2006</xref>: 121; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1354068810380094">Norris, 2006</xref>: 204).</p>
<p>In this section, the outcome is defined and the variation in women’s representation is explained covering commonly used party external and intra-party conditions. Details on operationalization are given in the second section.</p>
<sec id="section3-1354068810380094">
<title>Gender balance</title>
<p>What constitutes balance in the social world is much debated. The 30 percent level corresponds to a common gender quota threshold among parties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1354068810380094">Dahlerup and Freidenvall, 2008</xref>: 16) and one-third could be a reasonable empirical definition of gender balance. However, women make up roughly half of the world’s population, and there is thus good reason to settle for the more intuitive 50 percent threshold (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1354068810380094">Rosenbluth et al., 2006</xref>: 181). In order to leave empirical leeway to accommodate factors such as size of the parliamentary delegation, parties with 40 to 60 percent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1354068810380094">Kanter, 1977</xref>: 966–7) women parliamentarians are defined here as fully gender balanced.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1354068810380094">
<title>Institutional conditions</title>
<p>Among institutional explanations for the variation in women’s parliamentary presence, proportional electoral systems (PR) have been pointed out as a particularly important factor. Norris argues that although PR systems correlate with higher proportions of women in parliament, ‘by itself the basic type of electoral system is neither a necessary nor a sufficient condition to guarantee women’s representation’; she points out that the effect of electoral laws is likely to be filtered through ‘intervening conditions’, for example, district magnitude (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1354068810380094">Norris, 2006</xref>: 204; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1354068810380094">Norris, 2004</xref>: 208). This assumption, in combination with the fact that most West European countries have implemented some kind of PR system, cues analysis of the details of electoral systems. The most notable differences between proportional systems are ballot structure and district magnitude, both of which are frequently used in studies of parliamentary representation.</p>
<p>As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1354068810380094">Schmidt (2009</xref>: 192) notes, there is no strong consensus on which ballot structure is the more ‘women friendly’, but closed lists are commonly referred to as more favourable for women. It is reasonable to assume that the impact of ballot structure depends on other factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1354068810380094">Matland, 2005</xref>: 104–6; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1354068810380094">Schmidt, 2009</xref>: 194), and that empirical examination could shed light on the exact combinations. When individual parties constitute the unit of analysis, the crucial point is the degree to which parties can use the ballot structure in reaching a particular gender distribution in its parliamentary wing. In systems with open or flexible lists, voters can influence the outcome. With closed party lists, however, full responsibility for the outcome rests with the party. For the purpose of this study, a useful distinction can thus be drawn between closed and open or flexible lists.</p>
<p>District magnitude determines the total number of representatives elected from each district. When a single representative is elected in each district, the chances of newcomers getting elected may be circumscribed. In multi-member districts, however, parties can field new candidates without necessarily putting incumbents at risk of losing their seats, and hence women may be more likely to get elected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1354068810380094">Matland, 1998</xref>: 112–13; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1354068810380094">Norris, 2006</xref>: 205–6; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1354068810380094">Rule, 1987</xref>: 490–1). As the focus of this study is national-level election results, the appropriate indicator is the effective magnitude, which takes complex seat allocation into account (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1354068810380094">Taagepera and Shugart, 1989</xref>: ch. 12).</p>
<p>Finally, gender quotas can change gender distribution in parliament (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1354068810380094">Dahlerup, 2006</xref>: 293). None of the parties studied here, however, was subject to constitutional or election law quotas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1354068810380094">Quotaproject.org, 2006c</xref>). The outcome thus cannot be attributed to such quotas.</p>

<sec id="section5-1354068810380094">
<title>Social conditions</title>
<p>Women’s presence in parliament has been associated with women’s presence in the public sphere and egalitarian values. Referring to education, employment and the women’s movements, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1354068810380094">Caul Kittilson (2006</xref>: 37) argues that ‘in most cases, social forces are necessary but not sufficient’ for women’s parliamentary presence. Women’s own efforts and ambitions to win elected office are likely a prerequisite for women in parliament (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1354068810380094">Lovenduski, 1993</xref>: 14), yet their participation in paid labour and higher education need not be a necessary condition for gender-balanced parliamentary presence. I argue that women’s entry in the public sphere might instead be part of one or several combinations of conditions that induce gender-balanced parliamentary delegations.</p>
<p>The introduction of women’s suffrage represents the formal inclusion of women in electoral politics. Late introduction can indicate social structures that are less favourable for women seeking elected office (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1354068810380094">Rule, 1981</xref>: 67). In all of the cases studied here, this ‘critical period’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1354068810380094">Hughes and Paxton, 2008</xref>: 246–50) did, however, occur within a limited period during the first half of the 20th century (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1354068810380094">IPU, 2006</xref>). Because of the low between-case variation, the introduction of women’s suffrage was excluded from this analysis.</p>
<p>Several authors have also indicated egalitarian values with reference to religion, arguing that religious brands may have different impacts on women’s presence in the public sphere. While Protestantism is pointed out as potentially favourable, Catholicism is mentioned as a social factor that may restrict women’s presence in parliament (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1354068810380094">Rule, 1987</xref>: 401; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1354068810380094">Siaroff, 2000</xref>: 199–201; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1354068810380094">Norris, 2004</xref>: 203–7). Religion is thus a proxy for social climate and may affect women’s employment, education and formal political rights, all of which can be measured more directly in the chosen cases. In addition, in the West European context Protestantism could point more to the secular Scandinavian context than to a particular religious brand, which should be taken into account. Still, to achieve comparability with studies of women’s representation in the late 1980s, religion is used in this framework.</p>
<p>Long-term influence from egalitarian ideas such as social democracy could also be favourable for gender-balanced parliamentary delegations. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1354068810380094">Rosenbluth et al. (2006</xref>: 179, 185) show that a large welfare state correlates with a higher proportion of women in parliament (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1354068810380094">Krook, 2007</xref>: 14; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1354068810380094">Rule, 1981</xref>: 68; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1354068810380094">Siaroff, 2000</xref>: 201–2). Policy that enables women to take part in paid employment is a reasonable indicator of women’s entry into public life, and should be considered a reasonable indicator of egalitarian social structures. In countries with a long history of social democratic government, we should expect to see policies that facilitate women’s entry into politics.</p>
<p>Women’s participation in public life may also be more directly measured using gender distribution in paid labour and higher education. Both highlight gender equality in tangible, socio-economic terms and are frequently assessed in studies of women’s parliamentary representation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1354068810380094">Matland, 1998</xref>: 113–17; Rosenbluth et al., 2006: 186; Rule, 1987: 482; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1354068810380094">Adman, 2009</xref>). Gender-equal participation in paid labour and higher education is likely to raise political awareness, and each thus make sense as conditions that could both increase the influx of women in politics and raise a demand for gender-balanced parliamentary parties.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1354068810380094">
<title>Intra-party conditions</title>
<p>Being complex organizations, political parties offer a number of possible explanations for varying degrees of gender balance. Scholars have discussed such factors in terms of intervening conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1354068810380094">Norris, 2006</xref>: 204; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1354068810380094">Caul Kittilson, 2006</xref>: 121). However, parties are responsive to party external conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1354068810380094">Panebianco, 1988</xref>: 11–14), and the impact of intra-party factors on party behaviour should thus be studied in terms of their conjunction with party external factors.</p>
<p>Studies of parties and women’s parliamentary presence draw on a variety of conditions, not all of which could be used in this study. Before discussing the conditions that are part of the framework – party ideology, candidate selection and party magnitude – a note on other commonly used factors is appropriate.</p>
<p>Party institutionalization is a recurring theme in studies of gender and party. It is often understood as the degree of bureaucratization of the organization, i.e. the extent to which decisions are made according to a transparent and well-known set of rules, as opposed to personal networks and patronage (see, e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1354068810380094">Norris, 1993</xref>). Assessing the influence of delicate intra-party procedures is likely a task for small-<italic>n</italic> research designs. What is more, internal changes such as leadership change could cause considerable changes in the degree of institutionalization of a party, which could render data obsolete almost overnight. Owing to the lack of data suited for comparison across all cases in this study, party institutionalization is not part of the framework.</p>
<p>The proportion of women in a party leadership has been shown to correlate with the proportion of women parliamentarians (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1354068810380094">Caul Kittilson, 2006</xref>: 124). However, parliamentarians may be members of the party leadership (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1354068810380094">Katz and Mair, 1993</xref>: 611–14).<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-1354068810380094">2</xref>
</sup> Without data on the extent of such double membership, explaining the proportion of women in the parliamentary party with the proportion of women in party leadership in a static analysis may be misleading.</p>
<p>Party gender quotas could alter the gender composition of parliamentary parties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1354068810380094">Caul, 2001</xref>: 1221–2). Up until the late 1980s, however, fewer than 20 percent of the cases under study had adopted formal gender quotas for candidacy as part of their statutes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1354068810380094">Katz and Mair, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1354068810380094">Quotaproject.org, 2006c</xref>).<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-1354068810380094">3</xref>
</sup> Because of the low variation, configurational analysis that includes party quotas is therefore not advisable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1354068810380094">Rihoux and De Meur, 2009</xref>: 45).</p>
<p>Finally, efforts made by women’s organizations may affect women’s parliamentary presence. As noted above, women’s own efforts are needed for raising the proportion of women parliamentarians (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1354068810380094">Lovenduski, 1993</xref>: 14). However, Caul Kittilson finds that the presence of a party’s own women’s organization does not predict raised proportions of women parliamentarians. The same author points to the problems associated with measuring the impact of organizations that may have vastly different strategies, and suggests that such studies may be more fruitfully conducted using small-<italic>n</italic> research designs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1354068810380094">Caul Kittilson, 2006</xref>: 45, 124; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1354068810380094">Sainsbury, 2004</xref>). Therefore, this intermediate-<italic>n</italic> study does not take women’s organizations into account.</p>
<p>The three intra-party conditions that are studied in this research are candidate selection, party magnitude and party ideology. Candidate selection is an intricate process that could involve several intra-party players (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1354068810380094">Norris, 1993</xref>: 322). The level of candidate selection may have an impact on women’s chances of entering parliament, and localized selection processes have been pointed out as potentially favourable for women seeking office (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1354068810380094">Caul Kittilson, 2006</xref>: 124–5; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1354068810380094">Lovenduski, 1993</xref>: 12–13; see, however, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1354068810380094">Matland and Montgomery, 2003</xref>: 34; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1354068810380094">Hazan and Rahat, 2006</xref>). When women are more closely tied to family duties, building a personal political network at local level may be their ticket to national politics – a process that could be furthered by candidate selection where personal networks can be set to work, for example, in party primaries.</p>
<p>Party behaviour is likely influenced by party magnitude, i.e. the proportion of seats in parliament. Smaller parties may have incentives to compete on issues that bigger parties do not, for example, gender parity. Conversely, a large party may ‘afford’ to include women on their lists, because it would not threaten their incumbents. Either way, contagion between parties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1354068810380094">Matland and Studlar, 1996</xref>) may occur. Alternatively, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1354068810380094">Matland suggests (2006</xref>: 284; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1354068810380094">Matland, 1993</xref>), in parties that send more representatives to parliament, even candidates that are not at the very top of the list can get elected. In short, while party magnitude may explain how parties become gender balanced, the effect is likely to differ between contexts and parties.</p>
<p>Leftist and green ideology is often described as more favourable for women seeking office. Although ideology is, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1354068810380094">Lovenduski notes (1993</xref>: 13), not a perfect indicator, it can rightly be seen as one of the conditions that are likely to interact in creating gender-balanced parliamentary parties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1354068810380094">Caul Kittilson, 2006</xref>: 121; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1354068810380094">Norris, 2006</xref>: 204; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1354068810380094">Krook, 2007</xref>: 14–20).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-1354068810380094">
<title>Expectations</title>
<p>In the concluding chapter of a seminal study of gender and party, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1354068810380094">Norris (1993</xref>: 314) calls for an understanding of ‘interaction of factors within the political system in a comprehensive model’ to replace ‘simple, deterministic and monocausal explanations’. As outlined above, previous studies have resulted in a broad and detailed picture of conditions that were important for the development of gender-balanced parliamentary parties. They include suggestions on combinations of conditions, and yet few explorative studies using configurational comparative methods have been published. This research seeks to produce a springboard for future comparative study of interactions that characterize the field of party and gender-balanced parliamentary presence.</p>
<p>This study brings with it two major expectations derived from previous research. First, we assume that there are several ways to reach gender-balanced parliamentary parties, i.e. that the field is characterized by equifinality.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-1354068810380094">

</xref>
</sup> Second, previous studies have made it clear that intra-party and party-external factors are likely to interact in determining party behaviour. That is, we expect conditions to form configurations of conditions that may rest on two or more conditions. Three more specific expectations have been formed in relation to the three categories of conditions: institutional, social and intra-party.</p>
<p>Following <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1354068810380094">Norris (2004</xref>: 208; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1354068810380094">2006</xref>: 204), we might expect laws that are closely related to proportional (PR) electoral systems to be neither necessary nor singularly sufficient for gender-balanced parliamentary parties. That is, if this expectation is supported by the empirical analyses, we should find that laws that further PR are present in successful cases – yet that they combine with other factors. In addition, we should expect to see favourable, institutional conditions in configurations that lead to gender-biased parties.</p>
<p>Caul Kittilson suggests (2006: 37) that ‘social forces’ that allow women and men to take more equal part in society may ‘[i]n most cases’ be ‘necessary but not sufficient’ for gender-balanced parliamentary parties. Necessary conditions that make sense in relation to both theory and empirical data are likely to be rare – especially when we expect that factors will operate in conjunction with each other (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1354068810380094">Ragin, 1987</xref>: 27). Hence, it is fair to consider this suggestion within the frames of Western Europe and the early days of gender-balanced parliamentary parties, that is, within the scope of both the quoted research and of this study. The second expectation is, thus, that egalitarian social structures were necessary, but not singularly sufficient, for gender-balanced parliamentary representation in Western Europe during the 1980s. If empirical analysis supports this expectation, we should see gender-balanced parties in egalitarian societies, whereas we should find very few gender-balanced parties in less egalitarian societies.<sup>

</sup> Finally, previous research has made the case that party behaviour is a function of intra-party and party-external conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1354068810380094">Caul Kittilson, 2006</xref>: 121; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1354068810380094">Norris, 2004</xref>: 204; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1354068810380094">Panebianco, 1988</xref>: 11–14). The third expectation is, thus, that intra-party conditions are part of configurations that are sufficient for gender-balanced parliamentary parties. The assumption that party behaviour derives from combinations of intra-party and party-external conditions implies that gender-biased parties are also a consequence of combinations of such conditions.</p>

<title>Methods, case selection and operationalization</title>
<p>While the different conditions that are favourable for gender-balanced parliamentary parties are well researched, the exact combinations of conditions remain an open, empirical, question. An explorative approach to the problem thus requires a technique that allows for openness towards the empirical combinations of conditions, i.e. a technique that does not rest on preformulated interactions. In addition, the research problem necessitates a technique that can handle necessity, sufficiency and equifinality. Finally, in order to achieve generalizable results, cross-case comparison that rests on a large number of cases would be useful. For those reasons, the empirical analysis uses fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1354068810380094">Ragin, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1354068810380094">Rihoux and Ragin, 2009</xref>).</p>
<sec id="section9-1354068810380094">
<title>Fuzzy-set QCA</title>
<p>QCA is based on the idea that, in the social world, conditions combine in causing outcomes. The technique accommodates analysis of necessity and singular sufficiency of conditions, yet the main focus of the analysis remains with combinations of conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1354068810380094">Ragin, 1987</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1354068810380094">2000</xref>).</p>
<p>In QCA, theoretical concepts are operationalized as sets, for example, the set of parties with a gender-balanced parliamentary delegation. Using theory and empirical knowledge about the concept, each set is defined in empirical terms, after which cases are assigned membership of the sets. If a set is crisp, the only thresholds are levels for full membership (1, e.g. gender balanced) and full non-membership (0, non-balanced). If a set is fuzzy, calibration includes creating either a cross over point (0.5, neither balanced nor non-balanced) for continuous fuzzy sets or other thresholds within the set, for example, 0.33 and 0.67 levels for non-continuous fuzzy sets. This allows for making differences in kind, for example, which party is balanced and which is not, and differences in degree, for example, the degree to which a party is gender balanced (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1354068810380094">Schneider and Wagemann, 2007</xref>: 180–3).</p>
<p>Results from QCA are produced in three different versions: complex, parsimonious and intermediate solutions. Complex solutions draw only on empirically observed cases, whereas parsimonious solutions incorporate logically possible yet unobserved combinations of conditions. In contrast, intermediate solutions are produced using empirically observed cases and, in addition, theoretically or empirically justifiable but empirically unobserved combinations of conditions. The intermediate solution can thus be considered a more informed middle way (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1354068810380094">Ragin, 2009</xref>: 111).</p>
<p>Results from a fuzzy-set QCA are scrutinized using calculations of consistency and coverage of the solution. Both measures range from 0 to 1. Consistency levels, which can be compared to significance levels, measure the theoretical relevance of a result by indicating how many of the successful cases display a particular configuration of conditions. Coverage points to the ‘empirical relevance’ of results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1354068810380094">Ragin, 2008</xref>: 44–5). In analysis of necessity, high consistency levels, for example, at least 0.90, are usually preferred, while lower levels can be used in analysis of sufficiency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1354068810380094">Ragin, 2009</xref>: fn. 7; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1354068810380094">Schneider and Wagemann, 2007</xref>: 213).</p>

<title>Cases</title>
<p>The main purpose of this work is to explore the combinations of conditions that led to the first instances of gender-balanced parliamentary parties. In addition, it seeks to assess suggestions about necessity and sufficiency that are based on knowledge derived from studying the pioneering parties. Cases were thus selected to reflect a period in which gender balance was not yet commonplace, but in which there were still enough gender-balanced parties to constitute a trend: the late 1980s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1354068810380094">Hughes and Paxton, 2008</xref>). In addition, cases were selected to achieve comparability with previous comparative research on gender and party, and as a consequence of data availability.</p>
<p>The 57 parties<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-1354068810380094">

</sup> were drawn from 11 West European democracies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1354068810380094">Katz and Mair, 1992</xref>), which excludes analysis of different levels of development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1354068810380094">Matland, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1354068810380094">UNDP, 1990</xref>: 185–8). Parties with more than one seat in the national parliament were selected.</p>
<p>Changing the structures of parliamentary representation affects all of the involved actors. Whereas the research design does not allow for firm conclusions about either macro- or micro-contagion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1354068810380094">Matland and Studlar, 1996</xref>), it is reasonable to assume that women’s inclusion in politics did have an effect on party competition (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1354068810380094">Sainsbury, 2004</xref>: 74). Hence, the cases studied here cannot be considered independent of each other.</p>

<title>Operationalization of sets</title>
<p>Determining thresholds for sets requires either applying a well-specified standard of measurement of the concept at hand or, when no such standard is available, establishing a theoretical and empirical basis for proposing one. In this study, sets have been operationalized using theory, previous research and data from the cases. The framework entails fuzzy as well as crisp sets: when no 0.5 level of membership is specified, the set is crisp. Calibrated data and full details on data sources are available in the <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-1354068810380094">Appendix</xref>.</p>
<p>The outcome is the proportion of women parliamentarians from individual parties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1354068810380094">Katz and Mair, 1992</xref>). It was calibrated following <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1354068810380094">Kanter (1977</xref>: 966–7) and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1354068810380094">Rosenbluth et al. (2006</xref>: 181); gender balance, that is, a successful case, is defined as a party with 40–60 percent women in the parliamentary delegation. A gap in the empirical data indicated that the 20 percent level formed an appropriate cross over point, 0.50 membership of the set. Full non-membership is set at 0 percent women. Fifty-six percent of cases are defined as gender balanced.</p>
<p>The institutional conditions are ballot structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1354068810380094">Beck et al., 2001</xref>) and effective magnitude (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1354068810380094">Taagepera and Shugart, 1989</xref>). Systems that used closed party lists were assigned full membership of the set, whereas the full non-membership was assigned to systems that allowed voters to alter party lists in elections.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-1354068810380094">

</xref>
</sup> The listless UK system was assigned full non-membership. Effective magnitude was calibrated following Rule’s research on average district magnitude (1987: 484–6), assigning full non-membership to cases where the effective magnitude was 6 or lower. Drawing on the distribution of the empirical data, 0.5 and 1 levels of membership were set to 16.5 and 22.5.</p>
<p>The social conditions are Protestantism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1354068810380094">WVS, 2009</xref>), social democratic heritage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1354068810380094">Huber et al., 1997</xref>) and gender-equal participation in paid labour (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1354068810380094">OECD, 2008</xref>) and higher education (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1354068810380094">Statistisches Bundesamt, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1354068810380094">UNESCO, 1999</xref>). Defining whether a majority of the population belonged to a Protestant church, thresholds for 0, 0.5 and 1 membership levels were set at 0, 50 and 100 percent Protestants.<sup>

</sup> Likewise, the set on social democratic heritage shows whether the country has been governed by a leftist government during a majority of years from 1946 to the outcome year: 0, 0.5 and 1 thresholds were set at 0, 50 and 100 percent of the post-war period. Gender equality on the labour market was calibrated using data for women’s share of civilian employment during the outcome year and nine preceding years. The 0, 0.5 and 1 thresholds were set at 30 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1354068810380094">Dahlerup, 1988</xref>), 40 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1354068810380094">Kanter, 1977</xref>) and, finally, 50 percent women in paid employment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1354068810380094">Rosenbluth et al., 2006</xref>). Finally, gender-equal participation in higher education was calculated using data on the proportion of women graduating from higher education during the five-year period preceding the outcome election.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-1354068810380094">

</xref>
</sup> Because data on education refer mainly to people in their 20s, thresholds were set slightly higher: the 0 and 1 thresholds were set at 40 and 50 percent, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1354068810380094">Kanter, 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1354068810380094">Rosenbluth et al., 2006</xref>), and the cross over point to 45 percent women graduates. In the sets in labour and education, variation above 50 percent was truncated to denote full membership of the set.</p>

</sup> The set of large parties was inductively calibrated, based on the distribution of the empirical data. The 0, 0.5 and 1 levels of membership were set at 15, 25 and 33 percent of seats in the national parliament in the outcome election. Last, the set of parties with localized and participatory candidate selection was calibrated using four thresholds: 0, 0.33, 0.67 and 1. Based on the formal rules for candidate selection, parties that used membership ballots and allowed the sub-national party branches full freedom to select candidates were assigned full membership of the set.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-1354068810380094">

</xref>
</sup> The 0.67 level of membership was assigned to parties that used membership ballots but still let the national party organization alter the decisions of sub-national branches and, in addition, to parties that allowed the sub-national party branches full freedom to select candidates, yet without membership ballots. Next, the 0.33 level of membership was assigned to parties where candidate selection was conducted on sub-national levels without membership ballots and, in addition, where the national party could change decisions of the sub-national branches. Finally, full non-membership of the set of parties with localized candidate selection was assigned to parties that allowed individual members and sub-national party branches even less influence over candidate selection.</p>

<title>Configuring gender and party</title>
<p>Conditions that are necessary for the outcome will be present in all successful cases and, also, in some unsuccessful cases. Hence, analysing necessity is logically prior to analysis of sufficiency. What is more, analysis of successful cases does not automatically inform us about the causes of failure to achieve gender-balanced parliamentary delegations: absence of sufficiency configurations does not necessarily explain absence of the outcome. That is, we cannot assume that the problem can be described in terms of causal symmetry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1354068810380094">Schneider, 2009</xref>: 57).

<p>Briefly, the solution confirms, first, that in Western Europe in the late 1980s parliamentary parties became gender balanced as a consequence of several different configurations of conditions. The results further show that intra-party conditions combine with party-external conditions in producing gender-balanced parliamentary parties. The raw coverage levels of the first four paths range from 0.11 to 0.29, while the slightly lower unique coverage levels indicate that some of the cases in each path can also be described by other paths.</p>
<p>The first path builds on four conditions, including only one party-external factor, namely closed party lists. In the four parties that can be described by this path, we find the Austrian and German greens (Grünen and B’90) along with the Swedish and Norwegian left parties (V and SV). In these small parties with egalitarian ideologies, localized candidate selection produced gender balance that voters could not change at the polls. The data also show that the Scandinavian and German parties had adopted quotas already before the studied election, whereas the Austrian Greens adopted a 50 percent quota during the early 1990s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1354068810380094">Quotaproject.org, 2006a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1354068810380094">2006b</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1354068810380094">2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1354068810380094">2008</xref>), which further confirms that these green and leftist parties constitute a consistent group of successful cases with egalitarian ideas. The eighth path presents yet another way to describe the gender-balanced Swedish and Norwegian left parties (V and SV).</p>
<p>In contrast, the second path rests on an egalitarian social structure, large effective magnitude and party lists that can be altered by voters. This path describes the development in Denmark and is apt for describing six gender-balanced parties. The configuration draws on party-external conditions only. It is worth noting that three of the Danish parties can also be described by other paths that build on intra-party conditions: SD by path 3, KRF and FRP by path 7. Hence, we may conclude that within the favourable institutional and structural environment offered in Denmark, women were able to make progress all across the party landscape, but that the strategies differed between parties.</p>
<p>The third path describes five successful parties in the Nordic countries. In these countries, characterized by their egalitarian social structures, large parties with localized candidate selection achieved gender-balanced parliamentary delegations in the 1980s. The cases that display this configuration include the major social democratic parties (SD, SDP, DNA and SAP) and, in addition, the Finnish Conservatives (KOK). The combination of large parties with localized candidate selection can be read as support for the idea that larger parties are able to accommodate newcomers when either their own ideology or the social structures call for change.</p>
<p>The highest coverage in the intermediate solution can be found with the fourth path, which aptly describes 10 successful cases in Norway and Sweden. The cases share an egalitarian social structure and closed list electoral system and, in addition, they all applied highly democratized and localized candidate selection. This particular result shows that in societies that favoured gender equality and where parties allowed local access to candidacy, women could go far in politics regardless of which ideological stances they wished to promote. The unique coverage of the fourth path is still about half of the raw coverage, so some of the cases can also be described by other paths. The Norwegian leftist SV may, for instance, be more aptly described by the second path, whereas the third path might provide a closer description of why the Swedish Social Democrats (SAP) were able to reach a gender-balanced parliamentary party.</p>
<p>Finally, it has to be mentioned that paths 5–7 provide descriptions of cases outside the Scandinavian area, describing the Italian PCI, the Irish Progressive Democrats,<sup>

<p>The fourth path pictures small- or medium-sized, non-leftist parties in countries where participation in paid labour is biased in favour of men. In addition, the configuration includes closed-list systems and non-large effective magnitude. The Belgian PVV<sup>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>This research presents an explorative approach to the combinations of conditions that induced gender-balanced parliamentary parties in Western Europe in the late 1980s. Drawing on data from 57 individual political parties in 11 countries, the article offers a reassessment of previous theory and empirical results. It introduces new knowledge about interaction between the intra-party and party-external conditions that influence party behaviour, and shows that political parties are the primary actors behind change in women’s parliamentary presence (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1354068810380094">Caul Kittilson, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1354068810380094">Norris and Lovenduski, 1993</xref>).</p>
<p>This fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis demonstrates that gender-balanced parliamentary delegations are a product of several different combinations of conditions – endogenous and exogenous to parties – none of which was necessary or singularly sufficient for the outcome. The analysis also tells us that absence of the configurations that caused gender balance does not automatically lead to absence of gender balance. Rather, this study reveals that failure to reach gender balance can be explained by different combinations of conditions.</p>
<p>Leftism had a profound impact on West European parties becoming gender balanced in the late 1980s. The analysis shows that when the social structures did not provide sufficient support, small- or medium-sized leftist parties with localized candidate selection were, with the help of closed party lists, themselves able to reach more balanced proportions of men and women in parliament. In addition, when party structures did not conform to the leftist, egalitarian ideal, women’s participation in the public sphere instead formed a jointly sufficient condition with large parties and localized candidate selection, closed lists and localized candidate selection or, finally, large effective magnitude and open/flexible party lists. On the other hand, analysis of non-balanced parties tells us that non-leftist parties in less egalitarian societies effectively stayed non-balanced with the help of closed party lists. Among the unsuccessful cases we can also find small- or medium-sized, non-leftist parties in less egalitarian societies with closed lists and lower effective magnitude.</p>
<p>This research confirms that while absence of leftism in parties is associated with lower levels of women parliamentarians, egalitarian party ideology is neither necessary nor singularly sufficient for gender balance among parliamentarians. Candidate selection, party competition and women’s presence in the public sphere should also be considered important factors that cue parties to strive for gender balance.</p>
<p>It further confirms that closed party lists can have different impacts in different settings (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1354068810380094">Matland, 2005</xref>: 104–6). Balanced as well as non-balanced parties can be found in closed and open party list systems alike. To square this finding, we have to take intra-party and social conditions into account. In less egalitarian societies, or in parties that do not emphasize egalitarian values, closed lists may prevent the electorate from producing gender balance. In the reverse situation, however, parties’ choices and closed lists can help in changing a lingering male-dominated structure that does not reflect women’s participation in the public sphere.</p>
<p>In sum, this article shows that individual political parties played a central role in the surge of women’s parliamentary presence in Western European parliaments during the late 1980s. Ideally, the next step in this research process should be investigation of the extent to which the results presented here can be generalized outside Western Europe. Future studies may show how well the above applies to contemporary political parties, where other institutional settings, for example, gender quotas, have become more common. Including a temporal dimension could also contribute to a picture where women in party leadership and women’s movements are taken into account.</p>

<p>The cases under study here vary considerably in this respect: some parties had no restriction on the number of MPs in party leadership, while others had explicit limits ranging from none to several MPs. In one case, MPs were obliged to attend meetings of the party executive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1354068810380094">Katz and Mair, 1992</xref>; for contemporary data, see Van <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1354068810380094">Biezen, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1354068810380094">Enyedi and Linek, 2008</xref>). The causal direction between women in party leadership is thus likely to vary significantly between cases and is best determined using single case or small-<italic>n</italic> studies with emphasis on the temporal dimension.</p>

<p>Equifinality means that a particular result can be achieved with more than one combination of conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1354068810380094">Ragin, 2008</xref>: 63).</p>

<p>This suggestion about necessity is interpreted in slightly more probabilistic terms (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1354068810380094">Ragin, 2000</xref>: 226–9), hence the expression ‘very few cases’. Still, as explained in the methods section, the same threshold for consistency applies to all conditions in the analysis of necessity.</p>

<p>Cases from the following countries and elections are included: Austria (1990), Belgium (1987), Denmark (1988), Finland (1987), West Germany (1987), Ireland (1989), Italy (1987), The Netherlands (1989), Norway (1989), Sweden (1988), the UK (1987). Because of aggregation of raw data, Belgian data are based on the number of women in both chambers over the number of seats in the lower chamber. Where data for one or more conditions were missing, cases were excluded. This is most pronounced among Belgian cases, where outcome data were missing for several parties.</p>

<p>Data indicate that there were no Protestants in Finland, but that 85.4 percent were members of free churches. Since Finland is usually considered a Protestant country, free churches were assumed to be Protestant.</p>

<p>Two data points from the outcome year and the preceding four-year period were available. German data refer to both Absolventen and Promotionen. For the UK, data from 1983 and 1985 were used. For Norway, only data for 1985 were available. Swedish data refer to 1980 and 1988.</p>
