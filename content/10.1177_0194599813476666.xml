<body>
<p>Since the introduction of the bone-anchored hearing aid, the surgical techniques describing the placement of a percutaneous titanium implant have continually evolved. A variety of techniques have been described, all of which include significantly thinning the soft tissue around the abutment. Single vertical incision methods simplified the procedure and eliminated graft failures but continued to require tissue thinning.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0194599813476666">1</xref></sup></p>
<p>We describe our preliminary experience simplifying the procedure by placing the fixture and an extended abutment through a small incision created by a punch biopsy instrument. This punch method significantly reduces soft tissue trauma, improves cosmetic results, and minimizes operative times.</p>
<sec id="section1-0194599813476666" sec-type="materials|methods">
<title>Materials and Methods</title>
<p>This study was approved by the Western Institutional Review Board, Olympia, Washington. A retrospective chart review was performed of 15 consecutive adult patients from a private otology/neurotology practice undergoing initial placement of a bone-anchored hearing system. Revision cases were excluded. All operations were performed between January 1, 2011, and December 31, 2011. Charts were reviewed and data collected, including patient demographics, operative times, and complications. All patients underwent placement of a bone-anchored hearing system using the punch method described below.</p>
<sec id="section2-0194599813476666">
<title>Surgical Technique</title>
<p>All cases were performed in the main operating room of a tertiary care hospital, either under general anesthesia or monitored anesthesia care based on patient preference. The intended incision was marked, typically 5.5 cm posterior and superior to the external auditory canal, and the site prepared with shaving of hair and an alcohol wipe. Local anesthesia with 1% lidocaine with 1:100,000 epinephrine was then infiltrated in 4 points peripherally around the incision to create a circumferential block and improve hemostasis while avoiding distortion or edema at the incision site. The site was prepared and draped in sterile fashion. A 12-mm disposable skin punch biopsy instrument was then used to make a circular cut through the full thickness of the scalp. This cylinder of soft tissue was removed and the periosteum dissected with an elevator to expose the cortical bone. In male patients, due to increased scalp thickness, minimal thinning was selectively performed. In those patients, sharp dissection with scalpel or scissors was used to remove soft tissue deep to the dermis (subcutaneous tissue and galea) 5 to 10 mm from the wound edge circumferentially. A pilot hole and counter-sink were then drilled centrally, followed by placement of the fixture and abutment in the usual fashion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0194599813476666"><bold>Figures 1</bold></xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0194599813476666"><bold>2</bold></xref>). A 4-mm fixture was used, followed by an 8.5-mm or a 9-mm abutment. The wound was then closed around the abutment centrally or eccentrically with two to three 3-0 Prolene sutures (Ethicon, Somerville, New Jersey). A healing cap was attached followed by a Glasscock (OTOMED, Lake Havasu City, Arizona) ear dressing. Patients were given postoperative antibiotics (cephalexin or similar spectrum antibiotic) and mupirocin 2% ointment to be applied to the abutment and surrounding tissue twice daily. Sutures were removed 10 days after the procedure.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>Fourteen cases were performed for single-sided deafness and one for atresia in an adult. Nine patients were female and 6 male with an average age of 51 years (range, 22-82 years). Ten implants were performed with the 9-mm Oticon Ponto abutment (Oticon Medical, Stockholm, Sweden), and 5 were performed with the 8.5-mm Cochlear Baha abutment (Cochlear Americas, Centennial, Colorado). The average setup time for each case was 22.2 minutes (range, 18-26 minutes). The average operative time was 15.2 minutes (range, 13-18 minutes).</p>
<p>There were no cases of implant extrusion or failure of osseointegration. All patients had a mild degree of erythema during the immediate healing period, but there were no cases of infection or significant skin reaction (Holgers grade 2 or higher) in the postoperative period or in follow-up.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0194599813476666">2</xref></sup> One patient developed an iodine skin reaction that spontaneously resolved. All incisions appeared well healed at the time of suture removal. Use of the device was not delayed by wound healing in any case. Skin overgrowth has not been seen to date, and no patients have required revision in the clinic or operating room, nor have any patients required steroid ointments or injections. Average length of follow-up was 14.8 months (range, 9-20 months).</p>

<sec id="section4-0194599813476666" sec-type="discussion">
<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The reduction of soft tissues by manual thinning or by excision and grafting causes significant local trauma, and despite its intent, common complications continue to include delayed healing, graft or flap necrosis, and skin overgrowth.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0194599813476666">3</xref></sup> The use of a longer abutment may decrease these complications and obviate the need for more elaborate techniques. Longer abutments have been used successfully in the management of patients with skin overgrowth, and Hultcrantz<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0194599813476666">4</xref></sup> has also shown good results in a small study with initial use of a long abutment and minimal thinning.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0194599813476666">5</xref></sup></p>
<p>In our series, the entire procedure was performed through the punch wound with an average operative time of 15 minutes (compared with 28 minutes in the Hultcrantz<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0194599813476666">4</xref></sup> study). Both methods avoid cumbersome soft tissue work and maintain a more physiologic skin layer. No complications were seen, and enhanced cosmetic results were achieved (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0194599813476666"><bold>Figure 3</bold></xref>).</p>

<p>Our early experience suggests that the punch technique may offer an equally effective procedure with decreased operative times, improved appearance, faster healing, and decreased skin overgrowth compared with earlier techniques. Our approach calls into question the necessity of more complicated methods, and although larger studies with greater follow-up are required, preliminary outcomes are encouraging.</p>
