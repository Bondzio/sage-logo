<abstract>
<p>In <italic>Asylums</italic>, Erving Goffman once famously said that what is prison-like about prisons is found in institutions whose members have broken no law. In <italic>Discipline and Punish</italic>, Michel Foucault gave a more sociological spin on the normality of the prison, by saying that the apparatus of sequestration must manufacture a behavior that characterizes individuals; it must create a nexus of habits through which the social ‘belongingness’ of individuals to a society is defined, that is to say, it manufactures something like norms. Thus, what is sociology, if not the study of society based on the functioning of normative institutions, such as prisons and schools, predicated on integrating individuals into the whole? What is pedagogy, if not the methodology of putting into practice a system of education that represents at the same time the routinization of an ethical world view and the socialization of individuals in the making of society? Foucault’s genealogy in short gave birth to a critical perspective on the evolution of modernity, pointing not only to institutions that sublimated overt spectacles of power but also to the problematic role of the social sciences in policing all aspects of society. In East Asia, education was not just the evolution of a modern regime made compatible with all other socializing institutions, such as the family, military and workplace. Above all, it was a systematic construction of the state, with historical lineages in an imperial system that reproduced a mandarin meritocracy. The omnipresence of the Ministry of Education epitomizes ultimately the hegemonic role of education, especially in the making of the nation-state. More than just socializing, it manufactures a normality of belonging where culture, citizenship and structured modes of routinized behavior perform overlapping disciplinary functions.</p>

<p><disp-quote>
<p>The very existence of obligatory schools divides any society into two realms: sometime spas and processes and treatments and professions are ‘academic’ or ‘pedagogic’, and others are not. The power of school thus to divide social reality has no boundaries: education becomes unworldly and the world becomes non-educational. Ivan Illich, <italic>De-schooling Society</italic></p></disp-quote>There is an abundance of critical literature on education in sociology and pedagogy. The work of Pierre Bourdieu as well as that of Michael Apple, Henri Giroux and Peter McLaren, following the footsteps of Paolo Freire, to name a few, have underscored not only the role of education in reproducing the structure of class domination but also the function of cultural production in this regard.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0308275X13478222">1</xref></sup> However, in this critical literature, there is more attention to efforts to produce <italic>oppositional</italic> educational values and practices that challenge hegemonic authority and less consideration of the <italic>multiplicity</italic> of cultural practices that engender these institutions. The merits of critical pedagogy in the above senses aside, I attempt to present an alternative critical perspective on education and of the role of culture. Ironically, Ivan Illich’s populist critique of education in society is much more compatible with Foucault’s implicit critique of the disciplinary regime of the school in the making of modernity. For Illich, society itself was a hegemonic presence that was reinforced by the school and pedagogical regimes. In Taiwan, the institution of mass education was part of a process of Westernization that brought about the dissemination of the modern nation-state. Perhaps even more so than in Europe, mass education was a top-down construction, defined and regulated by the Ministry of Education, which continued at the same time the main function of former Imperial academies to promote a meritocratic government and cultivate bureaucratic elites. Disciplinary institutions in this sense were not really autonomous evolving modern processes but more precisely regimes that were intimately tied to the maintenance of state power and the cultivation of a particular ethos and culture (societal mindset) compatible ultimately with its nationalist world view. Of the many ‘socializing’ regimes, education played a relatively important role. The norm did not simply mark the legitimacy of social institutions and define social values but cultivated more importantly routinized cultural behaviors and thoughts in the conduct of its everyday practice.</p>
<p>Education is ‘normal’ in multiple senses. Modernity gave birth to a notion of society as the social structural framework upon which various institutions, behaviors, rites and practices were seen as functionally integrative. The idea that society in practice was normal rather than imaginative or inherently violent was maintained by social scientific theories that made the norm sacred (as a mode of thought).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0308275X13478222">2</xref></sup> Objective description and statistical analysis of various kinds reified societal institutions, as the product of a <italic>sui generis</italic> evolution, when they were also impositions of political policy or social order. Within the social ‘system’ and especially in conjunction with the politics of the state, some institutions are more ‘normal’ than others.</p>
<p>In many modern societies, education epitomizes the realm of the normal. In Taiwan, the Normal University is perhaps patterned after <italic>les ecoles normales</italic> of France (otherwise called Teachers’ Colleges). Education not only inscribes the normal; the normal itself becomes in turn the very essence of pedagogy. Normal then is to pedagogy what the norm is to social scientific theory. As methodology, it puts into practice the rites and routines of normal life in ways that complement the ideology of the norm as it is epistemologically constructed. By reinforcing in practice normative rules, education is tied ultimately to socialization, which as a process embodies society into persons, as citizens. Thus, citizenship inscribes socialization, by inculcating in ontological terms the morality and ethics of being a citizen. In the final analysis, education not only performs a seminal role. The normal epitomizes the soci(et)al.</p>
<p>Yet in the realm of the state, normal becomes a political construction par excellence. Its institutional existence and vitality are intertwined with the exercise of political power. It relies not only upon discipline as a mode of administrative and social regulation, backed by sanction. Education is itself a kind of policing that evokes various technologies of power that buttress the state.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0308275X13478222">3</xref></sup> The salience of education in the ideology of the state (and citizenship) differs from place to place, but it can also be seen as a function of changing principles and policies. At an ideological level, educational principles and policies are products of specific cultural and intellectual influences. Their moral and ethical substance is an integral part of the modern form that gives it social shape as well as the process that maintains it in practice.</p>
<p>In this regard, cultural identity and political citizenship are not just national in Taiwan but also Nationalist, insofar as they are in substance products of changing political ideologies and perceptions of society.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0308275X13478222">4</xref></sup> Within the cultural geography of Nationalist identity, citizenship, culture, and ethos occupy different niches yet are mutually intertwined at the same time. As spaces within a social imaginary, they invoke distinct notions of person and personhood that contribute somehow to a social commonality. But as spaces within a political praxis, they entail an adherence to shared values and beliefs that crosscut the hierarchy of social rank and political privilege. In other words, identity aims to be communal within a real world marked by distinctions of class and status. Its nature as a <italic>discursive</italic> fiction should be viewed in terms of its <italic>ideological</italic> substance as well as its <italic>politicizing</italic> functions in maintaining social order.</p>
<p>Identity and citizenship tend to be the language of shared values and mass society, and their relationship to the educational regime has a complex history. In postwar Taiwan, which is in certain basic respects the continuation of the Nationalist polity in early Republican era China, nationalism and nationalist identity have always played an explicitly significant role in defining the nature of the state, even as the state in institutional terms evolved from moments of feudal warlordism to centralized bureaucracy. The evolution of a Nationalist state reached a degree of institutional maturity in postwar Taiwan, and this maturation in institutional terms corresponded to its increasingly explicit articulation of cultural policy in other respects. The adoption of the calendrical system, capitalistic disciplinary routines and new ontologies of the body were all unconscious features of everyday life that inculcated a modern social regime, and they corresponded with overt militarization of society and the development of new rules of social etiquette, as embodied, for example, in Chiang Kai-shek’s New Life Movement, in the political realm. All of these things were <italic>encoded</italic> into what eventually became known as ‘Three Principles Education’ (<italic>sanmin zhuyi jiaoyu</italic>), following the philosophy of Sun Yat-sen. Three Principles Education was not simply the teaching of Sun’s political ideology. It was synonymous with mandatory education by forming the substance of courses in primary school on etiquette and health, secondary level courses on ethics and morality, finally high school courses on citizenship and political thought. The <italic>space</italic> of education then became the <italic>regime</italic> within which citizenship was both taught and practiced, then reproduced in other domains.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0308275X13478222">5</xref></sup></p>
<p>Instead of being the pure product of ongoing cultural influences, as though reflective of a pan-Chinese experience, the discursive-institutional relationship that ties notions of identity and citizenship to the educational system and other regimes of socialization, such as military service, the workplace and bureaus of immigration and customs control, is in large part the historical interplay of events and developments that are peculiar to early Republican China, which carried over into postwar Taiwan. The Cold War served to polarize such developments and politics. Thus if education has epitomized the normal in Taiwan, it is primarily because it is the complex nexus through which both socializing forces and conscious political ideologies collude to shape bodily ontologies and socializing routines of institutional and cultural life.</p>
<p>Early works on the function of ritual in the socializing regime of the school have already pointed to the salience of culturalizing practices. In <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0308275X13478222">Kapferer’s (1981)</xref> study of schools in Australia, she notes that the institution of ceremonial practices and ritual routines in private schools contrasts with the secular policies of state schools by developing collective solidarity that underscores family, class, religion and social values in relation to support communities. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0308275X13478222">McLaren (1999)</xref> terms the role of school ritual performance in social reproduction hegemony. In Taiwan, where the role of the state in standardizing the educational process is different, the same kinds of rituals, nonetheless, have similar socializing functions in relation to the polity. In effect, the state articulates its modernity by actively cultivating <italic>personhood</italic> through rituals.</p>

This routinised, pleasurable legitimation work all too often goes unremarked—e.g., tax forms, census returns, landownership registries, passport photographs, signatures and the murmuring volume around ‘I.D.’ (a word we should always speak in full: <italic>Identification</italic>) are part of the taken for granted <italic>mediations of modernity</italic>. They compel us (there is frequently no choice about it) to represent ourselves in certain, often minutely specific, ways; taken as a whole cartography of power they freeze us through these programmes of power into mythic statuses of sedimented language. We become our I.D. Philip Corrigan and Derek Sayer, ‘From ‘The Body Politic’ to ‘The National Interest’’</p></disp-quote>The educational system in contemporary Taiwan is the result of traditional and modern institutions. The examination-based systems that form the pedagogical framework in other Asian countries, like Japan and Korea, are without doubt a product of its Confucian heritage and Mandarin meritocracy.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0308275X13478222">6</xref></sup> As a competitive, achievement-based regime, this examination system can be seen as the epitome of a standardized knowledge-based educational system that has served as the framework for modernization and of the social dissemination of skills in the postwar era. Pure reliance upon standardized examinations as an evaluative criterion of this system also tends to give the impression that education in such a regime puts a high premium on utilitarian aspects of knowledge acquisition. While one cannot doubt the purely utilitarian aspects that seem to characterize the institutional backbone of this educational system, one cannot ignore as well the evolution of modern Asian education as part of the process of nation building, generally speaking, and the socializing functions of the latter.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0308275X13478222">7</xref></sup> In this regard, the functions of the central state in defining the content and form of education, as epitomized by the dominant role of the Ministry of Education and the hegemonic nature of the standardized curriculum, all point to the existence of a direct relationship between nation building interests and education in general. The practice of education as an institutional regime shows that the scope of education is not limited only to the utilitarian dissemination of knowledge and skills within society. The broadly disciplinary functions of the school in the regulation of everyday thought and behavior also underscore its seminal role as an agent of socialization.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-0308275X13478222">8</xref></sup></p>
<p>In the context of Taiwan, this disciplinary regime, which is a general feature of everyday life in schools everywhere, mimics not only the spread of modernity as the basic pattern of routine life but is intertwined also with militarization and politicization <italic>of all kinds</italic>. The wearing of uniforms, the application of uniform codes of social conduct and obeisance to political authority all make school life a microcosm of a militarized and politicized polity that is already being played out in society-at-large.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-0308275X13478222">9</xref></sup> Wilson’s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0308275X13478222">1970</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0308275X13478222">1974</xref>) work on political socialization of children in Taiwan, in the specific context of the school, has tended to overemphasize the priority of politicization in the socializing process as a whole, with its stress on allegiance and patriotism. It is clear that there is socialization of all kinds, through inculcation of social values, assimilation to culture, appropriation of a certain kind of moral conduct, active involvement in sanctioned institutional activities, in addition to filial respect for authority, from family to teachers and other forms of political authority.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-0308275X13478222">10</xref></sup> The very fact that socialization is part of a totalizing and systemic process that invokes all kinds of cultural rules and moral behavior makes it important for one to analyze this in its systemic totality.</p>
<p>Thus if education in Taiwan is understood less as an autonomous process of knowledge dissemination and instead as an integral part of the state project of nation building, it will be easier to understand how the curriculum is an important framework for the dissemination of social values, cultural identity and political notions of citizenship. The structure of its content within the framework of <italic>mandatory</italic> education, which is known simply as ‘Three Principles Education’, can be read as a <italic>process</italic> of national identity, or what it takes to be a moral person in Nationalist society. More importantly, these values, identities and concepts are inculcated in the process of routine life and throughout the socializing regime of the school. The school, with direct ties to the state in the form of regulation by the Ministry of Education, is in turn a microcosm for Nationalist society-at-large, with its embodiment of Nationalist principles.</p>
<p>So, what is ‘Three Principles Education’? Initial formulations can be found in policy discussions of the early Republican era beginning in the late 1910s and early 1920s. The extent to which Three Principles Education derives from The Three Principles ideology of Dr Sun Yat-sen, the founder of the Chinese Republic, is questionable, since The Three Principles was less a systematic body of writing than an incomplete set of lectures and writings that was compiled after Sun’s death. Its incompleteness and ambiguity became a point of departure for its divergent interpretations on mainland China as a bourgeois revolutionary ideology and in Nationalist Taiwan as blueprint for scientific modernization. It is important to note also that, while notions of Three Principles Education had been debated throughout the Republican era until the onset of World War II, it had not been seriously implemented in practice until after World War II, in Taiwan, by the Nationalist government. By that time, it became part of the implementation of Chiang Kai-shek’s New Life Movement, which was initially formulated in the 1930s. Three Principles Education was then the teaching of revised Nationalist ideology.</p>
<p>In its initial policy formulation as Three Principles Education, ideas such as citizenship (<italic>gongmin</italic>), morality (<italic>daode</italic>), military training (<italic>junxun</italic>) and health (<italic>weisheng</italic>) were repeatedly touted as basic requisites of this moral education, and early policy debates witnessed different attempts to implement the teaching of such concepts. It is not the focus of this paper to detail all the intellectual and political discourses that led to a systematic conceptualization of Three Principles Education but rather to note that, in its implementation as a curriculum in postwar Taiwan, it engendered a systematic Nationalist vision of citizenship and personhood that mirrored the kind of disciplinary and moral society it attempted to invoke and reproduce in the minds and behaviors of people. As a body of ideas, it was not random. The emphasis on bodily health in terms of personal hygiene, civilized etiquette and physical training was part of Chiang Kai-shek’s New Life ethos, which was institutionalized at the primary level of education. Military discipline became an explicit focus in courses at middle and high school levels, while courses on morality and citizenship were rooted in both Confucian ethics and modern political values and disseminated through the middle and high school curriculum, which overlapped with more explicit courses on Sun Yat-sen’s thought and political theory. Minor curricular revisions in the substance and sequence of Three Principles education took place throughout the postwar era, but it is clear that <italic>moral education</italic> in the above senses was a seminal aspect of <italic>nation building</italic> that transcended the pure dissemination of knowledge.</p>
<p>In this regard, it is less important to understand the substance of citizenship and morality as concepts in themselves than to understand how they function in the process of socialization or the state’s project of moral regulation.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-0308275X13478222">11</xref></sup> In other words, what kind of person (or citizen) is being cultivated here ontologically in the process of education as well as morally in terms of ethical behavior? Such notions of citizenship go far beyond the overt pressures of political allegiance and respect for authority that accentuate Wilson’s notion of political socialization. A citizen is also a particular kind of thinking, acting and feeling being. Political correctness is only one aspect of being a citizen. He/she acts in a particular way and in the right contexts of public expression. Mentally identifying with a social collectivity also involves appropriate sentiments of a kind that are often invoked in moments of patriotic fervor and national pride. Such thoughts, actions and feelings are not simply taught in the substance of courses but also routinely played out in everyday practice, in social interactions and performance of activities.</p>
<p>In political intent, moral education was inseparable from the ideological war that the Nationalist regime waged against Communist China. Grounded on the one hand in traditional Confucian values, it also became mobilized on the other hand for overt political purposes as a ‘spiritual weapon’ against socialism. In the context of the ‘cultural renaissance movement’ (<italic>wenhua fuxing yundong</italic>) of the 1970s that was deployed to counter the Cultural Revolution on mainland China, moral education took on an explicitly anti-Communist tone. Culture was part of the explicit political war against communism, and the school became the major venue for initiating political demonstrations that were part of the cultural renaissance movement. It was also during this time that moral education took on heightened importance as a curricular activity. Even after the end of martial law, moral education continued to play a fundamental role in the socializing process. In fact, one might say that the essence of spiritual warfare expanded from the realm of Three Principles education per se to include extracurricular activities of all kinds, even as explicit politicization of cultural renaissance movements gradually waned.</p>
<p>The transformation of moral education from its embodiment of Nationalist ethics to its politicization of Chinese culture underscores in the final analysis the key role of the school per se as a constant locus in the construction of <italic>identity</italic>, the cultivation of moral persons and the socialization of citizens in the making. Its operation as a ‘total institution’ in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0308275X13478222">Goffman’s (1961)</xref> terms makes it an ideal site for understanding the way in which disciplinary control of time (through regulation of curricular and activity schedules) and space (through maintenance of social and spatial hierarchies) function to reproduce the existing sociopolitical order. Its direct relationship to state <italic>control</italic> ties the school into the larger political space of the nation. In the latter context, the school may be a privileged institution of socialization by virtue of its omnipresence in the public domain, but it is at the same time one of <italic>many</italic> institutional nodes of socialization regulated by similar disciplinary regimes that can reinforce notions of cultural identity and moral citizenship. More than just inculcating norms, practices make perfect.</p>
<p>In an early essay, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0308275X13478222">Ruey (1972)</xref> argued that the Chinese notion of culture (<italic>wenhua</italic>) was actually an abbreviation of a Confucian phrase <italic>wenzhi jiaohua</italic>, meaning ‘to govern by literacy and to transform by teaching’. The heavy emphasis in Confucian thought on morality and ritual propriety can explain why Confucian traditions of education have always privileged moral cultivation, in its diverse senses, over pure knowledge. <italic>Jiao</italic>, which serves as the suffix ism in religion (or ideologies classified as such), also makes Chinese notions of learning more rooted in notions of personal transformation than assumptions of <italic>logos</italic> in Western notions of knowledge. While the focus on morality and ritual propriety in modern Chinese educational regimes can be seen as an extension of cultural traditions in this regard, I would argue that it is equally important to show how they overlap with and become transformed by other forms of moral regulation that emerge with modern nationalism and are institutionalized by the state through impositions of political ideology and implementation of socializing practices. In the end, new constructions of identity as citizen serve as seminal core features in such education. The transformative role of education thus engenders the acculturation process in many senses.</p>

<p>The school is a moment in time and space. As social institution, it is partly characterized by its neutrality. At the same time, it is a product of its times, a creation of modern discipline as well as an agent of state hegemonic control. The middle school in the northern Taiwan city of Hsinchu that I observed during the academic year of 1991–1992 had been known locally as a generally high achiever in national school exams, but otherwise it seemed to be a typical state school of its type, whose students represented a broad cross-section of city residents. Peiying Middle School was established in 1959. Built on the site of an old primary school with seven classrooms, it went through minor name changes after its transformation from an all girls’ school to a mixed gender school and as its administration shifted from the county to the city government. The number of students expanded from 300, occupying 6 classrooms initially, to reach its population 30 years later to about 2640, totaling 58 classrooms. In 1990, the faculty and administrative staff members numbered 139. Overall, it is an average sized urban school.</p>
<p>Peiying is one of ten state schools in Hsinchu, and the principal of the school there then, a Mr Xu, had served three years there, having been appointed directly by the provincial Board of Education (<italic>jiaoyu ting</italic>), where he served prior to being principal. Despite its appearance on the surface, the school is anything but an island unto itself. Academic development and school activities are tightly coordinated at three levels of bureaucracy from the Ministry of Education (<italic>jiaoyu bu</italic>) down to provincial Board of Education (<italic>jiaoyu ting</italic>) and local Bureaus of Education (<italic>jiaoyu ju</italic>). Even ‘education’ is not the exclusive domain of the school but one of many various supporting institutions, which include county or municipal cultural centers (<italic>shili wenhua zhongxin</italic>), Anti-Communist Youth Corps ( <italic>jiuguo tuan</italic>), Committee for Cultural Renaissance (<italic>wenhua fuxing weiyanhui</italic>) and school-family associations (<italic>jiazhang weiyanhui</italic>). The internal administrative structure of the school already mirrors the fact that the school is only one node in a tightly knit network. To facilitate vertical integration, each administrative unit in the school answers directly to higher levels of office within the Education bureaucracy. The provincial level Board of Education is composed of 12 divisions (<italic>ke</italic>), which include a secretarial division, military training division, general administration division, personnel division, financial division and academic supervision division that have local offices down to the lowest levels. Educational policy at the county or municipal level is subdivided into five sections, general academic affairs, national education, social education, physical education and academic personnel affairs. Within this hierarchy, municipal level bureaus of education coordinate the activities of a broad spectrum of institutions, such as schools, libraries, social education agencies, youth corps groups, extracurricular activity committees as well as cultural renaissance movement promotion committees. The Head of the local Bureau of Education is the administrator in charge of putting into practice educational policy originating from above.</p>
<p>Vertical integration of all administrative divisions from the highest levels of educational bureaucracy to its lowest level agencies enables official notices to be disseminated seamlessly throughout the system and <italic>uniform</italic> policy to be implemented at all schools. Not surprisingly then, one would also expect the physical and social organization of the school to conform to the same overall patterns and principles. Within such a system, innovation and individuality are unwelcome elements that actually disrupt the effective flow of things and activities.</p>
<p>Perhaps the most significant thing about spatial and temporal organization of the school is its compactness and an environment that is formed to maximize productivity of movement and work. Its linearity and functionality are obvious, just as peoples’ work lives are organized in a way that deliberately leaves little space for idle time. The main campus is a rectangular enclosure that occupies 39,755 square meters total. Its 58 classrooms and various administrative offices as well as science laboratories and library are largely spread across four rows of 2–3 story concrete buildings. Two long rows of buildings run parallel to each other across the long rectangular flat campus. Two other short rows of buildings are situated perpendicular to each other along the front and side ends of the campus in a way that envelops the rectangular public space in the center of campus. The main entrance, which faces a major road and is at the base of a small incline upon which the campus rests, actually faces north (unlike Chinese ritual artifices, there is no particular directionality for schools). It is situated to one side of the center and opens into the one short row of classroom buildings to the right, a large rectangular grass court directly in front, and the auditorium and large meeting hall complex to the left. The rectangular grass court, which is the only large public space on campus, is marked by the placement of three statues. The first one to be encountered, which is situated in the middle of the walkway that leads up from the main entrance, is a statue of Confucius. Further up the concrete walkway in the direction of administrative offices that occupy one end of the first row of long buildings is a bronze statue of Sun Yat-sen, founder of the Republic. In the center of the rectangular grass court is a statue of Chiang Kai-shek, who transferred the Nationalist government over to Taiwan in 1945. Classrooms are clustered according to year. Year One (Grade 7) students’ classrooms occupy the front row of buildings closest to the main entrance, and Year Two and Three students’ classrooms run sequentially along a line within the campus. The administrative wing of offices is somewhat centrally located, in that it is the first set of offices one encounters as one walks directly from the main entrance up the concrete walkway. It is composed of the principal’s office and the school archival office on the first floor, which is surrounded on the ground floor directly below by a general administration office, academic affairs office, extracurricular activities office, student counseling office and teachers’ offices, joined by the personnel office and financial affairs office in an adjacent wing. Science labs and special function rooms such as the computer laboratory, music conservatory and art room are located on various parts of the campus. The track field and sports ground, which is used for school-wide assemblies, is located on the plateau above the main campus and is enclosed by surrounding hills. By the school’s own assessment, there is a shortage of classrooms and special function rooms for students, not to mention specialized sports facilities and technical classrooms. In short, the spatial organization of the school exudes a sense of hierarchy, much of which is expected or obvious. The clearest separation is that between students and school staff. There is also no sense of private space but instead different kinds of public or collective spaces. Its architectural design is functional by maximizing <italic>use</italic> value. Its public spaces are mostly politicized. Teachers have desks in large, collective offices that are arranged in rows. Students sit in numbered seats that are allocated by the teacher according to one’s class rank.</p>
<p>Staff members also occupy particular niches within this spatial organization, and they can be differentiated according to rank and in terms of the respective trajectories that define the course of the work. Of the 139 full-time staff, 132 are considered permanent employees, including the principal, 118 teaching faculty, within which 58 concurrently serve as tutorial supervisors, 13 serve as administrators in the school bureaucracy, and 47 are engaged only in full-time teaching. There are also 13 full-time non-academic clerical staff members, and the remaining 7 non-permanent full-time employees are custodians, who may perform a number of miscellaneous duties. Of those involved in administration, in addition to the principal, 5 hold positions as division heads (<italic>zhuren</italic>), 12 are section chiefs (<italic>zhuzhang</italic>), 5 are clerks (<italic>ganshi</italic>) and 3 are classed as assistants (<italic>zhuliyuan</italic>). Finally, there is at least one military supervisor (<italic>jiaoguan</italic>), a uniformed officer who is usually appointed directly by the armed forces. Although the role of military supervisors has declined over the years, they have been a permanent fixture in most schools beginning from the intermediate level, where courses in military training begin to be taught, up to the university level, where they serve also in secular capacity as masters of student dormitories and assist in security. In the middle school, they are often called on to serve as school policemen and to act as disciplinary (termed in Chinese <italic>xundao</italic>, ‘training and guidance’) advisors, whose role is more often one of putting juvenile delinquents in place instead of offering psychological help. The existence of such military supervisors and the principal, who is appointed by the Board or Bureau of Education and not the school, clearly illustrates the direct involvement of government bureaucracy and military in the operation of the school. While many school principals are themselves former teachers, they are in fact a class of bureaucrats who rarely return to teaching. Their periodic training (<italic>shouxun</italic>) consists more of insuring that they are politically correct (being active members of the Party) and are in tune with various policies handed down from the Ministry of Education.</p>
<p>Of the 13 non-academic clerical staff, the four involved in the personnel and financial accounting divisions were considered specialist jobs, but this is a misnomer that reflects the different routes of specialization that actually mark the work of different kinds of personnel. There is on the one hand a distinct barrier between academic and non-academic staff in terms of their formal training. Academic faculty usually have the appropriate degree that qualifies them in specific fields of learning, and most gain promotion on the basis of work performance instead of advanced degree learning. Non-academic clerical staff have their own formal merit criteria that may suffice as certificate qualification, which they can attain by passing clerical civil service examinations (<italic>gaokao</italic>), but the majority of the non-academic clerical staff rarely pass such exams and move up the system on the basis of work experience (or apprenticeship). Especially among those in the older generation, many could have worked up to positions of high administrative responsibility as a result of long years of apprenticeship, beginning from low entry-level jobs. In this regard, there is a gray area within the administrative bureaucracy that marks the boundary between administrators who have become division or section heads as a result of full-time clerical work and academics who also serve as head of administrative units such as library or academic management on the basis of their overall leadership quality.</p>
<p>While the spatial organization of the school exudes an atmosphere of total containment and internal separation between different strata of people, the mobility of people within the social system, based on general distinctions between academic staff, administrative clerks and political appointees, is in reality more fluid. Curricular and extracurricular activities usually entail coordination and intense cooperation between all categories of people. Work tends to be based on principles of functional <italic>integration</italic> instead of functional specialization. Teachers do not merely teach. They actively take part in organizing extracurricular activities, most of which are initiated directly from the Board of Education, and spend much time supervising students and liaising with parents. The military supervisors do not just teach military training courses. They also serve as campus police and are present at all school activities, especially when called upon to exert ‘authority’. The school principal must also straddle many roles not only as a role model of the ultimate educator but also in internal administrative functions and as interlocutor within various outside educational and government agencies. Even in school activities and sports contests, government agencies routinely send representatives to ‘attend’ these events to underscore their role as omnipresent sponsors and promotional cheerleaders. The active participation of all walks of people in school activities makes education by nature a basic act of socialization. Education is not just about knowledge. This knowledge must be officially sanctioned to conform to standards and political correctness. Most extracurricular activities are similarly <italic>mandated</italic> from above and are organized to promote spiritual education (<italic>jingshen jiaoyu</italic>) and cultural enlightenment of all kinds rather than strict competition and professional sports achievement per se. There is no school activity that does not entail active involvement by people inside and outside. The practice of education makes it socializing.</p>
<p>The temporal organization of the daily schedule is also tightly regulated and leaves little space for personal activity. 7:00 to 7:20 am is when students are expected to come to school and other ‘on-duty’ students are seen sweeping the school ground and picking up trash. 7:20 to 7:50 am is homeroom time, during which students are supposed to be reading. 7:50 to 8:10 am is the flag raising ceremony, during which all students report to the sports field, standing in class formation, to observe the raising of the flag. At this time, the principal usually makes a daily speech. He is then followed by the disciplinary advisor (<italic>xundao zhuren</italic>), who makes assorted announcements, then the academic advisor (<italic>jiaowu zhuren</italic>), if necessary. While this goes on, the military supervisor monitors students’ dress and hairstyle to pick out students who do not conform to regulation. From 8:10 to 12:00 am, there are four successive class periods, each of which is separated by 10 minutes intersession. After lunch (12:00–1:00 pm), there are three successive class periods from 1:10 to 4:00 pm (with an additional hour for tutorial supervision or makeup examinations). On Saturday, there is another half-day of classes, mostly devoted to extracurricular and tutorial activities. There are generally no free or elective class periods.</p>
<p>Spatial containment, social hierarchy and temporal regulation characterize the essential framework by which to understand the ritualized behaviors and etiquettes that represent the nature of social relations between teachers and students as well as between staff members and the system. While the educational system makes students the object of socializing discipline, with teachers and staff being agents of that system, the system also disciplines staff members as well, in the process of work, through similar regimes of supervision and evaluation. These disciplinary regimes operate in parallel, but they are largely predicated by similar principles.</p>
<p>The kind of behavior that epitomizes the relationship of students to teachers and staff in the school can be properly termed as etiquette. Etiquette is not just another term for manners (<italic>limao</italic>) or ritual demeanor (<italic>liyi</italic>) but invokes instead <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0308275X13478222">Elias’ (1986)</xref> concept of it, an expressive behavior whose ritualized restraint is largely the end product of social control of sentiment, as both phylogenetic and ontogenetic process. Student-teacher relationships are symbolized by a face-to-face decorum and attitude of veneration, which reflect mutual hierarchical difference. Decorum dictates that students must greet teachers (<italic>laoshi</italic>), when meeting each other face to face. This applies not just to teachers they know personally but also to all teachers in general. Etiquette extends also to behavioral norms that are the product of disciplinary routines of the system. Etiquette means in this regard knowing when to be silent (<italic>sujing</italic>) and when to speak (<italic>biaotai</italic>). It means conforming militarily to authority in some contexts and being religiously supportive in other contexts. A more accurate way of explaining the kind of etiquette that is cultivated here is to say that the ultimate goal of such socialization (ultimately acculturation, through the inculcation of core cultural values) is one of learning how to ‘act as a person’ (<italic>zuoren</italic>). In the final analysis, ‘acting as a person’ is not just a cliché for behaving properly but more precisely acting appropriately in ways that are consistent with norms and situations. In essence, citizenship and morality (<italic>gongmin yu daode</italic>) form the content of moral education, but the practice of moral behavior as everyday etiquette is the goal of this sini-socialization.</p>
<p>The role of and pressures upon teachers and staff in the system must also be understood in light of the same morally regulative regime of discipline, through its enforcement of spatial orders and temporal schedules. The way in which people survive, adapt and move through the system is also a function of the way they perform or are expected to perform. In essence, the same system of domination and vertical integration that puts students in their place can be seen to put other people in their place as well. Their everyday behavior and ritual demeanor must be seen in the context and as a direct product of a total institutional discipline.</p>
<p>In both processes of socialization, the emphasis is less on work performance in the sense of productive efficiency than moral reward or spiritual gain (<italic>xinde</italic>). Constant self-evaluation through writing of reports places a premium on making conscious one’s personal reflections on work and study. The focus from within on moral cultivation is consistent with Confucian values, as invoked in Three Principles Education. However, the focus from above on total regulation is a product of a modern regime of discipline, enhanced by inherent militarization and Cold War politicization. Seen together, they constitute the crux of nationalizing impulses that are characteristic of Taiwan’s cultural imagination of a Republic of China and its values.</p>

<p><disp-quote>
<p>In his famous passage about Paul Klee’s painting <italic>Angelus Novus</italic>, Walter Benjamin wrote that the appalled Angel of History, who seems to be contemplating in dismay modernity’s piles of wreckage upon wreckage, ‘would like to stay, awaken the dead, and make whole what has been smashed’. But through nationalism the dead are awakened, this is the point—seriously awakened for the first time. All cultures have been obsessed by the dead and placed them in another world. Nationalism rehouses them in this world. Through its agency the past ceases being ‘immemorial’: it gets memorialised into time present, and so acquires a future. Tom Nairn, <italic>Faces of Nationalism: Janus Revisited</italic></p></disp-quote>The recent advent of Taiwanese cultural indigenization that, for many, was epitomized by the election of the first President from the (Taiwanese independence leaning) Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) has had considerable impact on the nature and continuing destiny of Three Principles Education, at least in government policy making circles. Three Principles Education had always been linked with rule of the Nationalist (KMT) Party, not only for its efforts to memorialize the legacy of Sun Yat-sen and his ideology but also for the KMT’s staunch defense of the Republic of China as against an independent Taiwan (Three Principles Education was synonymous with mandatory education in the sense that ‘The Three Principles is what unifies China’ (<italic>sanminzhuyi tongyi zhongguo</italic>)). The rise of Taiwanese consciousness is a complex historical phenomenon that was promoted not only by Taiwanese independence activists but also by a Taiwanese faction dominated KMT regime. Three Principles Education had already been the subject of criticism in the last decade but became officially reviewed and revised after the election of Chen Shui-bian, the first opposition party President. The major result of its review was the introduction of a set of courses entitled ‘Knowing Taiwan’ (<italic>renshi taiwan</italic>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-0308275X13478222">12</xref></sup> Yet the corpus of existing courses on body and health, citizenship and ethics, military training and Sun Yat-sen’s thought did not on the other hand change substantially.</p>
<p>Recent changes in the nature of Three Principles Education indicate that the discourse of mandatory education has centered mostly on the primacy of defining national identity (either as part of China or a culturally, historically distinct Taiwan) and focused less on the nation’s abstract understanding of citizenship and ethics. Not surprisingly, the unchanged substance of existing courses indicates that the new regime’s relationship to the nation and the practice of nation building has remained unchanged for most part as well. The role of the school as an agent of socialization remains active as ever, the normalizing routines that constitute everyday etiquette go on as usual, and the relationships of power that bind the school to the state and its subsidiary units continue to reinforce each other. Its politicization in substance thus appears not to have affected its routinization of form. What does this say about forms and practices?</p>
<p>Moral education, as inculcated above all in Three Principles Education, goes beyond the explicit content of course teachings and everyday etiquette. It is also replicated in various extracurricular activities organized by the Disciplinary Office (<italic>xundao chu</italic>), whose overlap in content has to do with the fact that such activities are labeled a part of ‘honesty education’ (<italic>chengshi jiaoyu</italic>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-0308275X13478222">13</xref></sup> The Bureau of Education holds activities pertaining to honesty education at least once a month. During academic year 1991–1992, this started with an announcement, on 26 September, from the Bureau of Education citing ‘Ministry of Education Special Action Plans to implement the strengthening of honesty education at all school levels’. This was followed, on 8 October, by the Disciplinary Office’s setting up of an ‘Honesty Opinion Box’ (<italic>chengshi yijianxiang</italic>) and the establishment of ‘Public Statutes on Honesty’ (<italic>chengshi gongyue</italic>). The Bureau of Education, on 17 October, then issued a register of names of heads for committees ‘to strengthen the promotion of honesty education’ and a notice from the Board of Education ‘detailing matters for the supervision of honesty education activities by Bureau of Education officers’. Saturday discussion groups (<italic>banhui</italic>), on 26 October, organized forums on honesty education. Officials from both the Ministry and Board of Education, on 29 October, visited the school to view results of the promotion of honesty education activities. The Office on Social Education (<italic>shejiao guan</italic>) sent a letter on the same day to organize an ‘honest spirit, happy spirit’ (<italic>chengshi xin, kuaile xin</italic>) activity in relation with Ministry of Education directives. The Disciplinary Office’s Bulletin of 2 November then asked tutors to use 3–5 minutes in class to announce honesty education activities. The Disciplinary Office, on 3 November, set up a column on the corridor bulletin board to display news of honesty education activities. The Social Education Office sent a letter, on 4 November, planning a forum discussion on honesty education. The Bureau of Education sent a letter, on 7 November, announcing that ‘honesty education’ should be included in the promotional activities of family education (<italic>jiating jiaoyu</italic>). The Bureau of Education sent a letter, on 16 November, to explain assessment guidelines regarding special action plans to strengthen honesty education in primary and secondary schools. The Disciplinary Office, on 17 November, held an art competition in relation to honesty education. The Bureau of Education sent a letter, on 21 November, to hold ‘honest spirit, happy spirit’ writing competitions. It also sent, on 29 November, a letter to announce the fifth theme of Hsinchu’s literary education (leisure education and honesty education). It then sent, on 4 December, a timetable and report form to monitor honesty education activities in all schools. It circulated to all students, on 4 December, bookmarks printed by the Ministry of Education bearing the word ‘honesty’ (<italic>chengshi</italic>). The Office of Social Education sent, on 24 December, a further notice on ‘honest spirit, happy spirit’ writing competitions. That same day, the Bureau of Education sent the Ministry of Education guidelines for promoting honesty education. In this set of guidelines to implement honesty education, on 26 December, the Bureau of Education exhorts the school to be vigilant of cheating, observe traffic rules and uphold respect for teachers. Jianguo Middle School sent a letter, on 30 December, to propose an open forum to exchange ideas and experiences on honesty education.</p>
<p>The frequency, intensity and coordination of activities pertaining to ‘honesty education’ ultimately illustrate how moral education in a broad sense is used to encompass all manner of actions and behavior that are nonetheless linked with school life. Its implementation also transcends the work of any one institution. Institutions interact not only in regard to activities but also abstract processes. More than defining conditions of modernity, the nation-state has welded the function of the school as a disciplinary regime to other parallel institutions.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn14-0308275X13478222">14</xref></sup> The same kinds of socialization can be seen to take place generally in other countries, but culture plays an important part here by specifying the framework of power in which various social institutions interact and overlap. It is too much of a cliché, following Rohlen’s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0308275X13478222">1976</xref>) study of Japan’s high schools, to characterize Asian educational systems simply as collectivist, in the way it fosters both conformity to group consciousness, through deference to authority and peer group pressure, and uniform standards of education, reinforced by an all-determining monolithic exam system.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn15-0308275X13478222">15</xref></sup> The Confucian notion of filial piety (<italic>xiao</italic>) is one that sees various kinds of social hierarchies between ruler and subject, teacher and student, father and son and employer and employee, as a function of the same essential ethical bonds that mirror or work in conjunction with each other. In this sense, it is not surprising that the state, school, family and the workplace function in the same way (as socializing regimes) by reinforcing each other as a process through long-term cultivation of the same kind of ethos, norms and etiquette.</p>
<p>As has already been described in the case of Japanese schools, harmonious relationships between teacher and student rely heavily upon teachers forming good working relationships with parents, who are viewed as an extension of classroom teaching as well as the first line of communication in matters of student behavior and performance. Parents are expected to be an active participant in assisting with a child’s education, thus are seen as morally responsible to some extent for his/her successes and failures. Perhaps like Japan, in Taiwan the brunt of this responsibility usually falls upon the mother, especially if she is a housewife who is in charge of domestic affairs. Her role in actively supervising homework is on the other hand largely a function of the excessive amount of schoolwork that is usually assigned to students, beginning from primary school and accelerating up to the years preceding ‘examination hell’. However, the symbiotic relationship between family and the state in this regard is firstly a function of the fact that these institutions view themselves as being based on the same ethical principles thus should play supporting roles in the larger social order of things. Peer pressure or allegiance to political authority is less relevant than their ethical form and social practice.</p>
<p>Insofar as activities of the school and the Bureau of Social Education overlap (through coordination and direct supervision by the Ministry of Education or its local bureaus), one might say that there is already a strong institutional working relationship between the school and various government institutions regarding education in general. The school has explicit functions to promote ‘social education’ by taking leadership roles in community education or social service in much the same way that families are mobilized as an extension of classroom learning. This includes (1) the advancement of citizenship training and lectures on improving various aspects of national life while making available school facilities to residential groups for certain sports and leisure activities and (2) the offering of guidance on matters pertaining to public health, emergency training, air defense, prevention of epidemics and dissemination of public information on events and activities. According to policies stipulated by the Executive Yuan, on 8 April 1965, themes included within the domain of community services performed by the school include social insurance, employment, social assistance, public housing, welfare services, social education and community development. The school is an <italic>activist</italic> in local life.</p>
<p>In ontogenetic terms, military service is in many ways a continuation of the socialization process patterned in school. In addition to military and physical training, military conscripts spend time in the classroom. In this sense, <italic>shouxun</italic> (literally ‘undergo training’) means more precisely undergoing the same kinds of spiritual indoctrination and political correctness that is part of learning as a whole. The proportion of classroom training tends to be much higher for officers undertaking military service (graduates of military academies as well as postgraduate degree holders in general) than for regular recruits, and the term <italic>shouxun</italic> is also used to refer to periodic training that people in the workplace undergo, especially after gaining promotion or transfer to new positions. Classroom work includes not only learning of required skills but also doing reports, written and oral, where one is typically forced to express one’s feelings of accomplishment (<italic>baogao xinde</italic>). In a military context, bonds of allegiance are based as much on political correctness as moral substance. Both become intricately intertwined in the end.</p>
<p>Ultimately, the kind of socialization (with its emphasis on moral cultivation in a Taiwan context) seen in the routinization of school life and military service forms the rudiments of a disciplinary regime that is in many ways replicated and expanded upon in various kinds of workplaces. It is impossible to generalize on the nature of the latter, given the diversity of institutions that characterize any enterprise (civil service, private corporate, family firm, not to mention its urban-rural setting and cultural (Chinese, Western and Japanese) influences), but in the case of the school it is clear that teachers, clerks and administrators are disciplined and socialized in a work setting in ways that are similar to the way students are ‘subjected’ (if not objectified as well). Not only does the work regime reflect the moral regulation of a school as a particular kind of workplace but also the influences of other institutions (the state and various bureaucratic appendages) that constantly control, nurture and interact with it.</p>
<p>In sum, the ethnography of everyday practice and the role of cultural values and norms in sustaining them are not just objective descriptions of life, as though taken for granted matters of fact. The school is in the long run a microcosm of routines that form the pattern of ritual behavior and normative world view that in turn shape cultural identity in relation to the polity. Their politicization, explicit and implicit, makes them anything <italic>but</italic> neutral. Their hegemonic omnipresence makes their factive existence problematic, if anything. Who says, normative is necessarily normal? It might be easier to argue, from a different perspective, that what we see in ethnographic fact is the end result of the interplay of socially abstract forces, which through elaborate processes of imagination and systematic regulation in practice produce fictions (that one <italic>mistakenly</italic> calls cultural reality). Through identification with these values and behaviors, one ultimately identifies with the underlying imagined community and one’s role in it. In this sense, ethnographic description can be used not just to represent society, as though objective, but rather as a first step that ultimately informs the reflexive, critical project of anthropology.</p>
<p>One of the lesser cited virtues of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0308275X13478222">Marcus and Fischer’s (1999)</xref> <italic>Anthropology as Cultural Critique</italic> was not its explicit promotion of interpretive, reflexive, literary, political-economic, postcolonial and other eclectic <italic>theoretical</italic> approaches to anthropology but rather its parallel contention that the critical <italic>ethos</italic> driving such reflexivity had always existed in anthropology. The anthropological tradition that Boas passed on to a generation of students, which included Edward Sapir, Margaret Mead, Ruth Benedict and others, was not just his historical relativism but a deep seated social critique that pervaded its scholarly work and view of contemporary society.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn16-0308275X13478222">16</xref></sup> Marcus and Fischer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0308275X13478222">1999</xref>: 130) also point to implicit criticisms of British society in the work of Malinowski and Evans-Pritchard, to which one can add Levi-Strauss’ <italic>Totemism</italic> and Dumont’s <italic>Homo Hierarchicus</italic>, which were founded on or developed systematic critiques of scientific or Eurocentric theories of society. Marcus and Fischer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0308275X13478222">1999</xref>: 137) argue that the difference between earlier critical visions of anthropology and contemporary techniques of cultural critique in anthropology resides in the latter’s strategy of ‘defamiliarization’ through epistemological critique and cross-cultural juxtaposition, which entails an <italic>equal</italic> anthropology ‘among us and them’, one that leads to the eventual dissolution of exoticism indicative more of earlier traditions in the study of other cultures. In short, it is really during its ‘repatriation’ (to the home of the authorial self) that anthropology <italic>becomes</italic> cultural critique. Epistemology is the language of cultural defamiliarization, and ethnography serves as the method by which anthropology becomes instantiated, through its cultural relativism, as a critical epistemology. Or as they (1999: 117) phrase it, ‘this insistence on a fundamental descriptive realism is what makes ethnographic techniques so attractive at the present moment in a number of different fields that claim cultural critique as their function’. In other words, it is ethnographic method that really distinguishes anthropology from the cultural critique of other disciplinary theories.</p>
<p>Marcus and Fischer’s advocacy of cultural critique in anthropology, which I subscribe to wholly, is admirable, but it takes for granted the <italic>inherent</italic> nature of anthropology as the study of other cultures while more importantly sanctifying values of its implicit cultural relativism. The dialogical nature of ethnography refers to the reconciliation of outsider and insider points of view in their respective constructions of ethnographic reality. There is on the other hand little consideration of what might constitute a critical perspective from a symbolic (Geertzian) native’s point of view or for a native studying <italic>his own</italic> society. Cultural relativism is a virtue, to be sure, but it has its limitations in <italic>practice</italic>. The neutrality that is attributed to prevailing understandings of the cultural and social <italic>system</italic>, even in the best traditions of interpretive and reflexive anthropology, persistently reflects, in my opinion, our normative definitions of system.</p>
<p>Marcus and Fischer attribute the inadequacy of earlier schools of critical thought to the detachment of intellectual theorists from their object of empirical inquiry, which amounts to a mode of ‘demystification’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn17-0308275X13478222">17</xref></sup> The ungroundedness of critical theory in empirical reality is, to say the least, exaggerated, but contrary to their contention that anthropology’s cultural critique is the product of the defamiliarizing strategies of a reflexive ethnography, I argue that cultural critique is an indispensable element of, if not point of departure, for any ethnographic inquiry. I submit that critical approaches are equally available to all and not dependent on ‘dialogue’. In fact, subjective identification with the norm is a direct impediment to detached judgment.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn18-0308275X13478222">18</xref></sup></p>
<p>What has been missing from cultural criticism and interpretive approach in anthropology is not the ethnographic method but rather a critical theory of society. In this case, the cultural relativism inherent in our neutral (ultimately normative) definitions of culture and society is in the final analysis an obstacle to understanding the disciplinary, morally regulative nature of the modern-state, in fact other culturally constituted polities found elsewhere and historically. This critical theory of the polity must be coupled with a concrete articulation of the collusive relationship between cultural mindsets, behaviors and practices in the maintenance or process of societal reproduction. Cultural critique is in short <italic>not</italic> limited to the struggle of the socially disenfranchised or economically exploited. Institutions operate at many levels of abstraction that engender the production of discourse, transformations of ideology into practice and the regulation of people in place and time. The manifesto of cultural critique is necessarily one that links the total institution to the functioning of a matrix of other relevant phenomena.</p>
<p>In the case of Taiwan, nation-state as imagined community has invoked more specifically complex ethical visions of a polity, ideologically driven or discursively framed in policy and practice that in turn precipitated disciplinary, socializing regimes of life thought and routine.</p>
