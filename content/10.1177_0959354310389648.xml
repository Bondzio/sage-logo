<abstract>
<p>Edmund Husserl’s seminal work <italic>The Crisis of European Sciences and Transcendental Phenomenology: An Introduction to Phenomenological Philosophy</italic> deals extensively with psychology. He even titled his Prague lecture of November 1935—which served as the basis of the book—<italic>The Crisis of European Sciences and Psychology</italic>. Husserl’s work is undoubtedly one of the most important critical assessments of psychology. Husserl criticized not only psychology’s methods (i.e., for mimicking the hard sciences), but also the very place of the discipline. His argument can be condensed as follows: the objectivization of science engendered a problematic subjectivity which, in turn, created a need for a psychology. The very paradox of this, viewed from the perspective of the interwar period, led Husserl to declare a crisis of the sciences and, especially, of psychology. Surprisingly, until now Husserl’s critique and defiance have been rarely discussed within the psy-sciences. This paper aims to reopen the debate, beginning with the concept of the life-world, the main concept developed in <italic>Crisis</italic>. However, as will be argued, that very concept is also the place where Husserl refrains from a radical critique of psychology and where his supposed phenomenological vantage point eventually facilitates the transition from psychologism to psychologization.</p>

<body>
<p>The central argument in <italic>The Crisis of European Sciences</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0959354310389648">Husserl, 1954/1970</xref>) is that the classic conception of a <italic>universal</italic> philosophy was lost in the positivistic wave which swept through the modern sciences following the Enlightenment. For Husserl, modern natural science as such, at the origin of which he situates Galileo’s mathematization of nature, is not to be castigated, as it has resulted in a true revolution in the technical control of nature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0959354310389648">Husserl, 1954/1970</xref>, p. 271). The problem of modernity, however, is that it abandoned the old Greek idea of a universal science which aims at an all-encompassing truth, for a pure objectivism which is estranged from the world. Moreover, the mathematically exact model was also imported as the guiding principle of the sciences of the <italic>spirit</italic>, the so-called <italic>humanist disciplines</italic>. Husserl, writing his <italic>Crisis</italic> in the interwar period, considered this a danger not only for science and philosophy, but also for society as a whole, postulating thus a genuine “European sickness” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0959354310389648">Husserl, 1954/1970</xref>, p. 272). The origin of the crisis of the sciences lies in their inability to deal with the fact that consciousness, rather than merely being an object in the world, is also a subject for the world (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0959354310389648">Husserl, 1954/1970</xref>, p. 178). This failure is for Husserl particularly visible in psychology, which had explicitly sought to become “the universal science of the subjective” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0959354310389648">Husserl, 1954/1970</xref>, p. 112). His earlier critique of <italic>psychologism</italic>—the idea that psychology could underpin logic and science as a whole—culminated, in <italic>Crisis</italic>, in a critique of psychology itself. Psychology, because of its naturalism, missed entirely the radical and genuine problem of the life of the spirit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0959354310389648">Husserl, 1954/1970</xref>, p. 299).</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>[A]s long as psychology does not step back and reflect upon this pre-psychological … life, it will remain in its historical naiveté and bound by the prejudices that modernity since Descartes has … made almost insurmountable. (Husserl, letter to Karl Bühler, 28 June 1927, as cited by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0959354310389648">Feest, 2008</xref>)</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Here we find the—as we will see, problematic—backbone of Husserl’s <italic>phenomenology</italic>, his conception of the pre-scientific and pre-psychological <italic>life-world</italic> which has been obscured by the naturalistic sciences. It is from this perspective that Husserl conceives his <italic>transcendental phenomenology</italic> as the cure for the European sickness, arguing that in the urgency of the crisis, philosophy has a crucial function for civilization as a whole (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0959354310389648">Husserl, 1954/1970</xref>, p. 289).</p>
<p>Regarding this historical task, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0959354310389648">Derrida (2003)</xref> remarks that Husserl’s <italic>Crisis</italic> was issued between “two globalizations or worldwideizations [<italic>mondialisations</italic>] of war” (p. 15). Derrida furthermore assesses our current post-war era as marking the end of the European concept of war (as bound within the horizon of the nation-state), an end, he remarks, which would mean anything but peace. For Derrida, echoing Husserl, in this time and age, the stakes of this are high as they are inseparable from “the future of reason, that is, of philosophy” (p. 15). Derrida asks if we should repeat Husserl’s call, displace it, or simply reactivate it.</p>
<p>Husserl already dealt with globalization in the <italic>Crisis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0959354310389648">1954/1970</xref>), albeit not the globalization of the 20th century but, rather, the globalization connected to the advent of Greek philosophy. In the passage from <italic>reason</italic> as such to <italic>philosophical reason</italic>, tradition and practicality made way for a quest for universal truth. The Greek philosopher thus initiates the critical stance, as his resolve is “not to accept unquestioningly any pre-given opinion or tradition so that he can inquire … after what is true in itself” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0959354310389648">Husserl, 1954/1970</xref>, p. 286). Husserl argues that this philosophical attitude successfully spread in a twofold manner: in the broadening vocational community of philosophers and in a concurrently broadening community educated in the principles of philosophy:</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>[T]he general idea of truth-in-itself becomes the universal norm of all the relative truths that arise in human life. … [T]his will also affect all traditional norms, those of right, of beauty, of usefulness, dominant personal values, values connected with personal characteristics, etc. (p. 287)</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>More and more non-philosophers were drawn into the community of philosophy (p. 287), a movement which spread “throughout the multiplicity of nations” (p. 288). Philosophy brought the first wave of globalization!</p>
<p>Husserl describes what we might call—in analogy to the concept of psychologization—<italic>philosophization</italic>. Anyone familiar with the literature on psychologization should be struck with the similarities here. Late modern psychologization too, although generally not assessed positively, is characterized by a growing community of vocational psychologists and a broadening community educated in psychology; so-called “psycho-education,” for example, stretches from prenatal courses to palliative care (for more on psychologization, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0959354310389648">De Vos, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0959354310389648">Parker, 1997</xref>). Where <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0959354310389648">Husserl (1954/1970)</xref> contends that “what [was] traditionally valid” was taken over by philosophy (p. 288), critiques of psychology today describe how education, art, politics, and so on, have become permeated by psychological discourse. Not only is this a global cultural phenomenon (take, for example, the <italic>psychotainment</italic> shows which dominate television programming around the world), psychologization is also discernible in the very mechanisms of globalization (e.g., the psychologizing tendency in human rights discourses—we are united in a common psychology—or the rise of psychosocial programs in humanitarian aid and disaster relief). These examples furthermore show that contemporary psychologization shares with Husserl’s classical <italic>philosophization</italic> an entanglement with the political. Husserl writes that conservatives satisfied with tradition and philosophical men will fight each other, and that “the struggle will surely occur in the sphere of political power” (p. 288).</p>
<p>But is not the problem here that philosophy risks being both the opening and the closure of the political field? As Husserl contends, prior to philosophy no one posed questions critical of knowledge or questions of evidence. It is only with the emergence of philosophy that traditions are subjected to critical scrutiny. On the other hand, does not the political momentum immediately dissipate again?</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>What is traditionally valid is either completely discarded, or its content is taken over philosophically and thereby formed anew in the spirit of philosophical ideality. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0959354310389648">Husserl, 1954/1970</xref>, p. 288)</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Is this not where the figures of the Master and Tradition are supplanted by the figures of the Teacher and his Knowledge, and where the political moment proper is closed? Thus, the question which will guide this paper is whether Husserl’s phenomenology is able to hold the political space open or whether his conceptualization of the life-world turns out, in the process, to be problematic. Husserl’s insistence on the pre-given world as the “all-inclusive abiding ground of existence” (as cited in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0959354310389648">Moran, 2007</xref>, p. 147) carries the risk of a positivization and thus of becoming the very closure of the critical political moment. Moreover, we will have to examine whether or not a positivized pre-predicative life-world is the very place where transcendental philosophy spills over into the psychological sciences Husserl himself criticizes.</p>
<p>Maybe the problematic political aspect of the paradoxical concept of life-world only comes to full blossom with Heidegger. Heidegger, as Moran writes, takes over many aspects of Husserl’s analysis of the life-world but emphasizes the manner in which <italic>Dasein</italic> is always involved in being lost in the world (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0959354310389648">Moran, 2007</xref>, p. 147). The central difference is that while for Husserl the understanding of the world would give a new orientation to science, for Heidegger it opens up “‘existential’ discussions concerning inauthentic and authentic ways of living as an individual in the world, either caught in <italic>das Man</italic> or somehow authentically oneself” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0959354310389648">Moran, 2007</xref>, p. 147). It is here that Heidegger is often reproached for his semi-pagan and nostalgic longing for communal life. Husserl’s assessment of the objectivistic obscuring of the life-world and the dimension of subjectivity thus clearly opens the way for a problematic perspective of a pre-scientific realm of authenticity. Husserl points, in a compelling way, to the crisis of modernity. However, in an equally compelling but problematic way, he freed the ghost of <italic>real man</italic> and his <italic>real world</italic>.</p>
<p>We shall follow Husserl through his <italic>Crisis</italic>, focusing on the vicissitudes of the antagonist of psychology, as, in the urgency of today’s crisis, we are searching not only for an assessment of how subjectivity is still the (problematic) core of science, but also for the role that phenomenology itself has played in all of this.</p>
<sec id="section1-0959354310389648">
<title>The tragic failure of modern psychology: The enigma of subjectivity</title>
<p>Perhaps Husserl’s most important insight is that the “crisis” of science lies in the loss of its meaning for life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0959354310389648">Husserl, 1954/1970</xref>, p. 5): that is, science “abstracts from everything subjective” (p. 6). Husserl dramatically presents this alienation of modern man when he says that “all the shapes of the spiritual world, all the conditions of life, ideals, norms upon which man relies, form and dissolve themselves like fleeting waves … . [R]eason must turn into nonsense, and well-being into misery” (p. 7). Husserl’s version of “all that is solid melts into air” tries to account for how everyday induction grew into induction according to scientific method (p. 50). The model of this, for Husserl, is modern geometry, the decisive step of which was to supersede the actual praxis of more-or-less measuring the concrete world and shifting attention to the mathematical exactness of the ideal geometrical space as a systematic, coherent a priori. This self-enclosed, theoretical realm and its axiomatic findings were believed to permit, deductively, the univocal construction of every shape in actual space and time (p. 22). Galileo generalized this stance to the whole scientific field, advancing the notion that modern science deals with mathematical idealities which are spread as a <italic>garb of ideas</italic> onto the world (p. 51). Science in this way could envision its mastery of the totality of being “without anything left over” (p. 22).</p>
<p>Does this mean that the exhaustive objectivization of modern science—as it abstracts from everything subjective, reducing everything to merely mathematical propositions—actually leads to de-subjectivation? Or, conversely, did the enigma of subjectivity see light through the objectivizations of science, beyond dignity and freedom? With Galileo the two sides of this become visible. Science not only brings de-subjectivation; the expulsion of the subject is also the primary condition for objectifying mathematical science: “Galileo abstracts from the subjects as persons leading a personal life; he abstracts from all that is in any way spiritual, from all cultural properties which are attached to things in human praxis” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0959354310389648">Husserl, 1954/1970</xref>, p. 51). Both, only seemingly opposed, stances (de-subjectivation as a consequence, de-subjectivation as a condition) point to the fact that modernity inaugurated a structural break regarding subjectivity. Is it not here that we find psychology, and consequently, according to Husserl, its “tragic failure”? Following Husserl, we can see that psychology is not simply another one of the sciences. Rather, psychology emerges precisely because of the de-subjectivation (both as a consequence and as a condition) of modern science. Put differently, the enigma of subjectivity spawned by modern science needed a psychology. For Husserl, however, psychology was wrong to adopt the methodology of the mathematical or natural sciences insofar as psychology tries to solve the problem of subjectivity with the very tools that engendered it. Psychology’s own particular crisis is the “enigma of subjectivity,” leading to the “enigma of psychological matter and method” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0959354310389648">Husserl, 1954/1970</xref>, p. 5).</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0959354310389648">Husserl (1954/1970)</xref> situates this problem within Cartesianism. Galileo’s mathematization of natural science led to Cartesian dualism and, as the world was split into the physical and the psychical realms, this prepared the way for psychology: “[A] psychology in the modern sense, a psychology which, because it had universal nature and a science of nature [as a model], could strive for a corresponding universality, i.e., within a similarly self-enclosed field of its own” (p. 60). Here Husserl does something interesting: he decenters Cartesian dualism by redoubling the antagonism at the site of nature. Leaving behind the classic opposition nature versus psychology (events in nature with their mathematical properties versus their sensible and subjective effects), Husserl opposes <italic>pure mathematics</italic> to <italic>mathematics of spatio-temporal forms</italic>. Nature in its <italic>true being-in-itself</italic> is mathematical and is thus to be contrasted with the more concrete universal lawfulness of nature. Husserl denotes a gap between “mathematically ideal being before all actual experience” and the applied mathematics of inductive natural science dealing with “factual experiential data” (p. 54). He then writes:</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>And yet an uneasy feeling of obscurity gradually asserts itself concerning the relation between the mathematics of nature and the mathematics of spatio-temporal form. … [O]ur knowledge in pure mathematics has only one lack, i.e., that, while it is always absolutely self-evident, it requires a systematic process in order to bring to realization as knowing, i.e., as explicit mathematics, all the shapes that “exist” in the spatio-temporal form. (p. 55)</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>How can we understand this “lack” in the pure idealities of mathematics? Is this not the ultimate place of the crack in the universal, the primary gap in the symbolic which as such engenders the dimension of the subjective? Husserl refuses to situate the lack (and thus subjectivity) within the dualism of nature versus psychology, where the problem is invariably located at the place of the sensible and so-called “subjective” experience of mathematical nature. For, as he shows, dualism offers no place for subjectivity whatsoever: “The world splits, so to speak, into two worlds: nature and the psychic world, although the latter, because of the way in which it is related to nature, does not achieve the status of an independent world” (p. 60). Within dualism the psychical dimension is always under threat from a further encroachment of objectivism. In contemporary terms, subjectivity is always the object of newer and more enhanced brain-scanning techniques. Today more than ever, half-hearted attempts to resist this colonization prove powerless as psychology’s only defense is to resort to borrowing its paradigms from elsewhere (managerial or commercial models, cybernetics…). Here Husserl’s operation beyond the classic dualism is worth reinvoking. Modern subjectivity is not to be understood within the opposition of nature versus psyche precisely because the initial antagonism lies within nature as it was mathematized in modernity. Pure mathematics entails a gap, in that it has to be realized as knowing, and this gap is the very space of subjectivity. The <italic>garb-of-ideas</italic> has to be spread, and because of this very exigency it does not fit the world and this leads to the opening up of interstitial spaces for subjectivity. Does this not boil down to a subjectivization of nature itself? It is a paradox which recalls Marx’s main decentering movement when, in his <italic>Critique of Political Economy</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0959354310389648">1859/1977</xref>), he argues not that the economy should be politicized, but, rather, that the economy is always already political. In the same way, Husserl’s situating the primary antagonism within mathematical nature means that we have to understand nature as such as already subjective!</p>
<p>Husserl’s concept of the life-world should be situated precisely here. As we will see, it is via the concept of life-world that Husserl conceives of subjectivity as that which actually brings about world-validity. So let us now follow how he moves from the enigma of subjectivity to the enigma of the world and conceptualizes his transcendental subjectivity.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-0959354310389648">
<title>Transcendental phenomenology: Tackling the enigma of the world</title>
<p>According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0959354310389648">Husserl (1954/1970)</xref>, the mathematization of the world not only rendered the functioning of subjectivity incomprehensible (p. 67)—insofar as it becomes impossible to understand subjectivity on the basis of a physicalistic naturalism—it also brought to light the enigma of the world experience: how it is that we might explain man’s naïve certainty of the obviousness of the world. Here, in the face of the deadlocks of psychologism, Husserl criticizes Descartes for not having carried through the radicalism of his ideas and not having pursued his notion of universal doubt (<italic>epoché</italic>) to the end. Descartes did not bracket the Galilean certainty of a universal and absolutely pure world of physical bodies. He did not bracket the self “as a whole man as I am valid for myself in my natural possession of the world” (p. 79). Descartes thus stopped short of his ego, the latter being the goal he had envisioned in advance as a kind of purified soul kept free from the <italic>epoché</italic>. In this way, Descartes was stuck in the natural scientist’s or the psychologist’s way of looking at things, which is to say he took the natural ground of the world as pre-given and for granted (p. 80). Descartes only evaded the problem of the obviousness of the world. Husserl thus calls Descartes’s <italic>cogito</italic> a little <italic>tag-end</italic>: Descartes sought to ground objective science within the <italic>cogito</italic>, which at the same time has itself to be grounded “along with everything else as a legitimate subject matter <italic>within</italic> the sciences, i.e. in psychology” (p. 81).</p>
<p>This Cartesian ego, being its own blind ground, from then on started to haunt psychology. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0959354310389648">Husserl (1954/1970)</xref> argues that Locke had already obscured the problematic Cartesian stance in order to establish psychology as the keystone and the “epistemological grounding of the objectivity of the objective sciences” (p. 84). Subjectivity as the inevitable/necessary breach of objectivism has to be contained by psychology and, in order to do so, psychology has to deny the enigma of subjectivity as this is bound to lay bare the very enigma of objectivity and the experience of the world as such. Husserl writes that while Locke with his <italic>tabula rasa</italic> conception of the mind could still uphold the plausibility of a self-enclosed psychology providing the closure of science, gradually, through the idealism of Berkeley and Hume and finally through skepticism, the absurdities could no longer be avoided.</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>No offense was taken if, in Descartes, immanent sensibility engendered pictures of the world; but in Berkeley this sensibility engendered the world of bodies itself and in Hume the entire soul, with its “impressions” and “ideas,” … engendered the whole world, the world itself. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0959354310389648">Husserl, 1954/1970</xref>, p. 89)</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Here the enigma of the world fully burst open. Berkeley’s and Hume’s radicalization of the Cartesian problem shook dogmatic objectivism to the foundations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0959354310389648">Husserl, 1954/1970</xref>, p. 90). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0959354310389648">Husserl (1954/1970)</xref> contends that the key problem became that of how to think together the faculty of pure a priori thinking, or pure reason, and the faculty of sensibility. The fact that we receive sense data from the outside becomes an enigma because it is inconceivable how the “experiential world of the pre-scientific man—the world not yet logicized by mathematics—was the world pre-given by mere sensibility” (p. 93). Or in other words, the problem arose as to how our experience of the world via sensibility makes sense without any recourse to reason. How, for example, does pre-scientific man experience identity in the continuously changing flow of sense-data (p. 93)? The zest of this philosophical discussion is the failure to provide a theoretical justification for so-called “vulgar beliefs.” Hume showed that philosophical inquiry can only lead to skepticism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0959354310389648">Tagore, 1994</xref>). For Kant, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0959354310389648">Husserl (1954/1970)</xref> writes, Hume thus revealed “a gulf of incomprehensibility” as to how reason could guarantee knowledge of things (p. 93). Husserl then glosses Kant’s solution that sense-data are already brought together through a priori forms without any appeal to reason. While “the things in themselves” are unknowable, “the material of the sense-data arises from a transcendent affection by things in themselves” (p. 95). For Husserl, Kant thus made objective science into an accomplishment remaining within subjectivity while opting for a traditional scope for philosophy, “extending even to the rationally unknowable in itself” (p. 95). Husserl, however, claims that the real Humean problem lies elsewhere, namely:</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>How is the naïve obviousness of the certainty of the world, the certainty in which we live—and, what is more, the certainty of the everyday world as well as that of the sophisticated theoretical constructions built upon this everyday world—to be made comprehensible? (p. 96)</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Husserl thus again transcends dualism (here of reason versus sensibility) and, arguing against Kant, centralizes the problem of world-belief. For, according to Husserl, the essence of Hume’s problem is the enigma of a world “whose being is being through subjective accomplishment, and this with the self-evidence that another world cannot be at all conceivable” (pp. 96–97). Where Hume invokes imagination to account for the experience of the world (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0959354310389648">Hume, 1739–1740/2006</xref>, p. 129), Husserl proposes his transcendental subjectivity and his two-stage transcendental <italic>epoché</italic>. The first reduction is the <italic>epoché of objective science</italic>, the bracketing of all theoretical interests and scientific knowledge. Scientific facts are considered as merely facts in the unified context of the pre-given life-world. The second <italic>universal epoché</italic> transcends the life-world itself; it brackets the attitude of natural world-life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0959354310389648">Husserl, 1954/1970</xref>, p. 148). Only with this universal <italic>epoché</italic> are all natural interests put out of play and is the gaze of the philosopher freed from the pre-givenness of the world: the world becomes a <italic>phenomenon</italic>. This is the discovery of the universal, absolutely self-enclosed and absolutely self-sufficient correlation between the world itself and world-consciousness, the discovery of how subjectivity and conscious life effect the validity of the world. In other words, through the second <italic>epoché</italic> the world can be seen as the correlate of subjectivity, the latter giving the world its ontic meaning. For Husserl, objective science thus goes astray as it takes the life-world for granted and consequently ignores the fact that it asks questions on the ground of the world’s existing in advance through pre-scientific life. The essence of the crisis of the sciences is that no objective science (not even psychology, which sought to become the universal science of the subjective) made the life-world thematic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0959354310389648">Husserl, 1954/1970</xref>, p. 110).</p>

<title>A first critique: Against the psychology of children and peasants</title>
<p>A basic assumption of Husserl’s transcendental <italic>epoché</italic> is that science is a human accomplishment among other types of practical accomplishments related to the pre-given world (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0959354310389648">Husserl, 1954/1970</xref>, p. 118). Husserl logically conceives the scientific terrain as not fully equal to the life-world, otherwise there would be no second universal <italic>epoché</italic>. He is thus led to presuppose an extra-scientific terrain where extra-scientific human activity takes place. But is not the problem here that when science is situated as but one of the human praxes, it becomes difficult to understand how the advent of the modern science had such a decisive impact? To further our understanding, let us go back to the Humean problem of understanding sensibility without recourse to reason. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0959354310389648">Hume (1739–1740/2006)</xref> writes in <italic>A Treatise of Human Nature</italic>:</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>[W]hatever convincing arguments philosophers may fancy they can produce to establish the belief of objects independent of the mind, ‘tis obvious these arguments are known but to very few, and that ‘tis not by them, that children, peasants, and the greatest part of mankind are induc’d to attribute objects to some impressions, and deny them to others. Accordingly we find, that all the conclusions, which the vulgar form on this head, are directly contrary to those, which are confirm’d by philosophy. (p. 129)</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Here we have one of the most puzzling philosophical conceptualizations of the Enlightenment: the idea of a common sense belonging to children, peasants, and the greater part of mankind. Modern mainstream philosophy and psychology seem to be based on the invention of the extra-scientific naïve, common man with his folk psychology. However, from a present-day perspective it is hard to maintain the idea of man’s pre-scientific naïve presence in the world. For example, is one not, in the simple act of putting the kettle on, always aware that the water is heated to 100 degrees Celsius? Of course, this is easily refuted by postulating a sub- or unconscious level of doing things and being in world. The question, then, is whether we should call this natural, unmediated, or pre-scientific. A simple glance at the habitat and praxes of children and peasants invalidates the idea of a pre-scientific, naïve being immersed in reality. Do most parents not, for example, prepare a space for their newborn infant, a space which is furnished to be safe, stimulating, and structured according to the insights of pediatrics and psychology? A more important argument, however, is that it is a misconception that science itself deals with the common and the naïve. For, on a closer look, the actual object of investigation of the first psychological theories was precisely the scientific subject itself. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0959354310389648">Husserl (1954/1970)</xref> writes:</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>Naturally, the psychology of Locke—with the natural science of a Newton before it as a model—found particularly interesting subjects for study in the merely subjective aspects of the appearances (which had been maligned since Galileo) and likewise generally in everything coming from the subjective side that interfered with rationality: the lack of clarity in concepts, the vagueness of judgmental thinking, the faculties of the understanding and of reason in all their forms. It was, of course, a matter of the human being’s faculties for psychic accomplishments—precisely those accomplishments which were supposed to procure genuine science and with it a genuine practical life of reason. Thus, questions of the essence and the objective validity of purely rational knowledge, of logical and mathematical knowledge, and the peculiar nature of natural-scientific and metaphysical knowledge belong in this sphere. (p. 117)</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Early psychology was thus already far removed from the naïve layman, child, or peasant. Psychophysics, for example, actually researched how man relates to the laws of Newtonian physics, conducting experiments where people were subjected to stimuli concerning quantities and variables whose laws were revealed by the natural sciences (speed, temperature, sound). Once again, psychology cannot be put on the same plane as the other sciences. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0959354310389648">Husserl (1954/1970)</xref> puts it, psychology’s domain includes “the rational knowing activity and the knowledge of the philosophers, mathematicians, scientists of nature” (p. 67). This means that the call for psychology to abandon its imitation of the natural sciences and to turn to its proper concerns perhaps misses the real issue at stake. The very supposition of a real psychology of the child and the peasant <italic>is</italic> the foundational myth of psychology, obscuring its blind ground. Drawing upon Husserl himself, we could say that the idea of a pre-scientific subjectivity is nonsensical, simply because subjectivity is the enigmatic product of the objectivations of science.</p>
<p>Does this not make Husserl’s second <italic>epoché</italic> highly problematic in that it itself postulates a pre-predicative, pre-scientific life-world? Husserl’s life-world leads to several paradoxes, as can be seen in the following argument concerning the transcendental <italic>epoché</italic>:</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>There are good reasons for my stressing so sharply the vocational character of even the “phenomenologist’s” attitude. One of the first things to be described about the <italic>epoché</italic> in question is that it is a habitual <italic>epoché</italic> of accomplishment, one with periods of time in which it results in work, while other times are devoted to other interests of work or play; furthermore, and most important, the suspension of its accomplishment in no way changes the interest which continues and remains valid within personal subjectivity—i.e., its habitual directedness toward goals which persist as its validities—and it is for this very reason that it can be actualized again and again, at different times, in this identical sense. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0959354310389648">Husserl, 1954/1970</xref>, p. 137)</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Is this strange passage telling us that the bracketing and suspension of the world are not an absolute withdrawal from the world; they are not absolute madness—there is a way back? Phenomenologists will not, of course, see the <italic>epoché</italic> as a withdrawal from the world. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0959354310389648">Jennings (1986)</xref> puts it, the reduction <italic>transforms</italic> the essential acts of consciousness themselves into the subject of rigorous analysis (p. 1237). But do we not have to think through the kind of position this detached gaze boils down to? It is in this respect that <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0959354310389648">Žižek (2007)</xref> speaks of Husserl’s dark dream in the Cartesian Meditations, of the transcendental ego surviving a plague which would have wiped out all of humanity. In this way it is interesting to note how in popular culture the transcendental journey almost invariably turns out to be a one-way street. Frodo, for example, at the closing passage of <italic>The Lord of the Rings</italic>, cannot go back to the Shire to return to the simple and plain life-world. He cannot heal his wounds and must be taken by the Elves overseas to the land of immortality. The same dynamics are discernible with today’s phenomena of psychologization. The modern subject is confronted with psychology and psychologists in all of his or her “other times.” Work and play always can be (and are) scrutinized along psychologizing lines. Just consider the sociopsycho-educational tendency in today’s schooling. From a very young age, children are subjected to theories on bullying, assertiveness, respect for diversity, and so on. This theoretical induction prompts children to adopt a theoretical scrutinizing gaze on their own life and world, after which they are sent back into the world. However, once in the psychology class, there is no way back; the domain of life as it was before the induction in psychology, is, as such, foreclosed.</p>
<p>But, to put it clearly, my main argument is not that the modern subject has lost his or her naïve direct experience of the life-world. Rather, the modern subject is characterized by the endeavor to re-find the naïve experience. This is how we can understand that the phenomenological promise of a straightforward intuition of the world—feeling one’s own body or being in a perspective—had a seminal influence on the 20th century. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0959354310389648">Jaques-Alain Miller (1996)</xref> writes that the popular worship of what is lived and felt, related to the idea of the importance of one’s own body, stems from Husserl. Indeed, the <italic>epoché</italic> is often interpreted as therapeutic: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0959354310389648">Kingwell (2002)</xref>, for example, writes that “the <italic>epoché</italic> does not take the phenomenologist out of the world but, in a sense, more deeply into it” (p. 202). And to be clear, there are certainly passages in Husserl’s <italic>Crisis</italic> which feed these kinds of therapeutic-holistic interpretations of the life-world: “This actually intuited, actually experienced and experienceable world, in which practically our whole life takes place, remains unchanged as what it is, in its own essential structure and its own causal style” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0959354310389648">Husserl, 1954/1970</xref>, pp. 50–51).</p>
<p>This embracing of things as they are and always will be sounds very nostalgic, if not cynical, if we shift our perspective on how today’s globalization—think of the latest financial crisis—affects the concrete life-world of so many people in such a disruptive way. But the worship of the lived and felt can also be connected to the dimension of horror in another way. For is not the joyful “I am here in the world with my body!” returning in the “I am here!” of the monster/ghost/lunatic haunting us? The ghastly image of a figure fully equalling himself, claiming an unmediated presence, is perhaps an echo of the strange double whom Freud depicted in “The Uncanny” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0959354310389648">1919/1955</xref>). Mladen Dolar contends that the Freudian uncanny has to be understood in terms of the advent of modernity. The objectification of man by modern science has reduced him to a horrifying zero-level of subjectivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0959354310389648">Dolar, 1991</xref>). The uncanny double is therefore to be understood as modern man faced with his own being reduced to a puppet-like automaton. If we are thus led to populate the life-world not with the pastoral images of the child and the peasant, but with the horror and the uncanny, we must ask if the always immanent positivation of Husserl’s life-world is not foremost the result of his not thinking through his initial insights regarding the advent of the modern sciences. For, is it not the case that, in focusing on the life-world, Husserl’s original assessment of mathematization as a restless encroaching of the life-world fades away as <italic>Crisis</italic> progresses? Husserl accomplished a brilliant reversal, as David Carr puts it, by deconstructing the common idea that science overcomes the relativity of the “merely subjective” <italic>pictures</italic> of the world. Husserl shows that, with a shift in perspective, the scientist himself is the one who starts from a particular sort of <italic>picture</italic> of the world. For Husserl, both the scientist and his picture are to be situated <italic>within</italic> the “real” world (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0959354310389648">Carr, 1977</xref>). But, it is here, where Husserl is unwittingly pushed to positivize this life-world, that the paradoxes come in.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0959354310389648">
<title>The paradoxes of the life-world</title>
<p>For Carr, the first Husserlian paradox is that, while the world depends on consciousness for its “constitution,” it is this very life-world itself that provides the materials with which consciousness deals. Thus, through the transcendental constitution, the life-world loses one of its originally, firmly stated features: its pre-giveness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0959354310389648">Carr, 1970</xref>). Husserl is of course aware of this paradox, as he asks how a component part of the world, human subjectivity, can constitute the whole world as its intentional formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0959354310389648">Husserl, 1954/1970</xref>, p. 179). But for Husserl, the paradox vanishes once the <italic>epoché</italic> is fully carried out:</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>The <italic>epoché</italic>, in giving us the attitude <italic>above</italic> the subject–object correlation which belongs to the world and thus the attitude of focus upon the <italic>transcendental subject–object correlation</italic>, leads us to recognize, in self-reflection, that the world that exists for us, that is, our world in its being and being-such, takes its ontic meaning entirely from our intentional life through <italic>a priori</italic> types of accomplishments that can be exhibited rather than argumentatively constructed or conceived through mythical thinking. (p. 181)</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>But is the problem really solved with this? As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0959354310389648">Johanna Oksala (2005)</xref> notes, there still remains the problem of how mundane subjectivity and transcendental subjectivity are related to each other, if they cannot be conflated (p. 59). It is on this point that <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0959354310389648">Foucault (1966/2002)</xref> also criticizes Husserlian phenomenology for not being able “to exorcize its insidious kinship, its simultaneously promising and threatening proximity, to empirical analyses of man” (p. 355). For Foucault, the phenomenological project continually resolves itself into a description—empirical despite itself—of actual experience, and into an ontology of the unthought that automatically short-circuits the primacy of the “I think.” Adorno already argued that the strictest concept of the transcendental cannot release itself from its interdependence with the factum. Adorno, however, does not promote a naturalistic interpretation of consciousness. Rather, he contends that “the mind’s moment of non-being is so intertwined with existence, that to pick it out neatly would be the same as to objectify and falsify it” (as cited in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0959354310389648">Dews, 1995</xref>, p. 59). Both Foucault and Adorno point to a fundamental negativity: for Foucault, an ontology of the unthought; for Adorno, a moment of non-being.</p>
<p>That Husserl does not deal with this negativity points to the fact that his concept of the life-world always risks becoming something empirical and positivized. Just consider how Husserl starts off in <italic>Crisis</italic> with the antagonism between life-world and science, the first being unmediated, the latter mediated. Gradually, however, he incorporates culture and even science into the life-world and, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0959354310389648">Carr (1977)</xref> argues, in his culturalizing of the life-world Husserl eventually faces its “cultural relativity” (p. 208). Husserl tries to contain this by postulating that the life-world with all its relative features has a non-relative <italic>general structure</italic> to which everything that exists is bound. For <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0959354310389648">Husserl (1954/1970)</xref>, this general structure can be attended to in its generality and can be fixed “once and for all in a way equally accessible to all” (p. 139). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0959354310389648">Carr (1977)</xref> points to the problem that this only would result in establishing the general structures of the <italic>cultural</italic> world and not necessarily of the world of immediate experience (p. 209). But things get further complicated when Husserl, in addition, places science as a whole within the life-world. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0959354310389648">Carr (1977)</xref> tries to save the conceptual edifice by postulating two different worlds, culture and science, as two mediations which focus on different aspects of the concrete world and have a different historical development. Is the problem here not that Carr, in attempting to differentiate culture from science, like Husserl, passes over the <italic>political</italic> fact that in modernity science became precisely the master discourse which founds culture? While Husserl’s merit was to historicize the advent of science as a decisive turn, assessing the weight of Galileo’s generalization of geometry’s mathematization of the world, gradually, in the progressing of <italic>Crisis</italic>, this insight loses its sharpness exactly where, one can argue, Husserl does not engage with the political implications. One can argue that in modernity scientific knowledge came to fulfill the role of the guarantor and support of various cultural practices and discourses (politics, education, art, etc.).Thus, in accordance with the first sections of <italic>Crisis</italic>, it is exactly where there are breaches in the big Other of Science—in the mazes of the mathematical <italic>garb of ideas</italic>—that psychology enters in an attempt to provide the closure of Science. This latter point is what Husserl admirably assessed. However, in trying to emancipate phenomenology from this problematic, he chose to go beyond mediation by putting forward an unmediated life-world fully equal to itself. Where Husserl ends up with a <italic>general structure</italic>, where both culture and science become mere subfields of the life-world, it becomes more and more difficult to grasp how modern science was itself directly connected to the political and ideological project of the Enlightenment. Focusing on the life-world, Husserl loses his grip on how, in modernity, culture itself is ridden by science and how it is perhaps in the very crossing of the two domains that we find the transcendental dimension of the truth in its very political and ideological meaning.</p>
<p>Is not the crucial point that, where Husserl had rightly posited the life-world as the unrecognized, taken-for-grantedness of the natural sciences, he should have understood the life-world as an <italic>empty</italic> presupposition? This is exactly what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0959354310389648">Slavoj Žižek (1986)</xref> claims:</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>This blending of Lebenswelt with science radically undermines the very notion of Lebenswelt as a field of everyday pre-scientific self-understanding and pre-theoretical life practice, from which science derives its meaning. … Lebenswelt has “lost its innocence” and become inherently defined by science. Reference to the pre-scientific Lebenswelt would today correspond with reference to the pristine and unspoiled domestic environment of Blut and Boden ideology. … Science as such, in the strict hermeneutic sense of the word, is unsignifying and as soon as it inherently begins to encroach on the Lebenswelt, the whole loses its meaning and we find ourselves in a void. (para. 21)</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Here Žižek simply pushes to the limit Husserl’s contention that science is all-inclusive, that it masters the world “without anything [being] left over” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0959354310389648">Husserl, 1954/1970</xref>, p. 22). This is similar to Giorgi Agamben’s argument that in the founding project of modern science there is a fundamental and total expropriation of experience. Science annihilates experience when it identifies the <italic>subject of knowledge</italic> with the <italic>subject of experience</italic>. This loss of experience is, for Agamben, not something partial but something radical and irreversible (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0959354310389648">Agamben, 2007</xref>, p. 47). Is it not clear from this perspective that Husserl’s attempt to establish a transcendental subjectivity based on a ground beyond science is doomed to fail insofar as it attempts to bypass the closing down of the unmediated experience of the life-world? Here Agamben’s stance might be more interesting. For Agamben, the expropriation of experience should perhaps not be deplored as such, as it could be the site of the refusal of the imperative to experience (p. 15). In the same vein, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0959354310389648">Jacques Lacan (1988)</xref> considered the symbolic, mediated, mathematized body which modernity brought us as something which allows the modern subject, although reduced to “something decomposed,” to possess greater freedom (p. 31). The subject <italic>is</italic> the gap, <italic>is</italic> the relation to what defines him or her.</p>
<p>If modern subjectivity cannot be cut loose from the objectification effectuated by the modern sciences, then the zero-level of subjectivity also boils down to a zero-level of psychology. The question then is whether Husserl should be criticized for failing to follow his own assessment of the crisis—as a crisis of psychology—through to the end, considering that his postulation of the life-world eventually harbors the paradox of a psychological-transcendental doublet. In the closing paragraphs of <italic>Crisis</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0959354310389648">Husserl (1954/1970)</xref> postulates a “difference and identity … between the psychological ego (the human ego, that is, made worldly in the spatio-temporal world) and the transcendental ego, its ego-life, and its accomplishment” (p. 205).</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>If I myself effect the transcendental attitude as a way of lifting myself above all world-apperceptions and my human self-apperception, purely for the purpose of studying the transcendental accomplishment in and through which I “have” the world, then I must also find this accomplishment again, later, in a psychological internal analysis—though in this case it would have passed again into an apperception, i.e., it would be apperceived as something belonging to the real soul as related in reality to the real living body. (p. 206)</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>There is, it seems, a way back from the transcendental <italic>epoché</italic> … but it is a way which leads Husserl to psychology. Let us, therefore, in the last section, explore how Husserl’s critique of psychology can even be said to provide the very model of psychologization.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0959354310389648">
<title>From psychologism to psychologization</title>
<p>In <italic>Ideas Pertaining to a Pure Phenomenology and to a Phenomenological Philosophy</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0959354310389648">Husserl (1913/1998)</xref> acknowledges the risk that he might “psychologize the eidetic” (p. 139). In fact, the whole endeavor of phenomenology must be understood within Husserl’s position in the so-called <italic>psychologism</italic> debate. The gist of Husserl’s critique is that psychologism is the confusing of the resulting consciousness of essences (color, shape) with the essences themselves: that is, “ascribing to the flux of consciousness as its really inherent component part something which necessarily transcends it” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0959354310389648">Husserl, 1913/1998</xref>, p. 140). In <italic>Logical Investigations</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0959354310389648">1900/2001a</xref>), Husserl recounts how he came to criticize the underpinning of science with a psychologically founded logic:</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>I became more and more disquieted by doubts of principle, as to how to reconcile the objectivity of mathematics, and of all science in general, with a psychological foundation for logic. In this manner my whole method, which I had taken over from the convictions of the reigning logic, that sought to illuminate the given science through psychological analyses, became shaken, and I felt myself more and more pushed towards general critical reflections on the essence of logic, and on the relationship, in particular, between the subjectivity of knowing and the objectivity of the content known. (p. 2)</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Criticizing the deadlocks of psychologism—skeptical relativism and absurdities—<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0959354310389648">Husserl (1900/2001a)</xref> searches for a “pure logic,” arguing that truths “are what they are,” “whether we have insight into them or not” (p. 150). Starting with <italic>Ideas</italic>, the method of exploring the essences involved in the relationship between <italic>the subjectivity of knowing</italic> and the <italic>objectivity of the content known</italic> is the already mentioned phenomenological reduction. For <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0959354310389648">Husserl (1913/1998)</xref>, the Cartesian <italic>epoché</italic> of doubting all certainties imposed on us by tradition and power has to be extended: the question to be asked is what remains “if the whole world, including ourselves with all our <italic>cogitare</italic>, is excluded?” (p. 63). In <italic>Crisis</italic>, Husserl posits that it is the life-world which remains. On the side of <italic>the subjectivity of knowing</italic>, the <italic>epoché</italic> leads to a “phenomenological residuum,” that of a “pure consciousness” (pp. 63–64). Here Husserl claims to be beyond psychology:</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>As a consequence, it should be well heeded that here we are not speaking of a relation between some psychological occurrence—called a mental process—and another real factual existence—called an object—nor of a psychological connection taking place in Objective actuality between the one and the other. Rather we are speaking of mental processes purely with respect to their essence, or of pure essences and of that which is “a priori” included in the essences with unconditional necessity. (p. 73)</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Husserl wards off the psychological gaze; pure consciousness is beyond the psychological Ego’s reflecting on itself. In this way, criticizing psychologism and psychology’s ambition to be the keystone of the sciences, Husserl instead puts forward phenomenology as the alternative. Furthermore, he claims that once the eidetic work is done, one can return from the phenomenological vantage point and provide psychology with the foundation it was lacking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0959354310389648">Husserl, 1913/1998</xref>, p. 173). Husserl makes a similar point in <italic>Crisis</italic>, where he contends that psychology should be founded on transcendental philosophy as the source of the a priori structural concepts which it must utilize (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0959354310389648">Husserl, 1954/1970</xref>, p. 260).</p>
<p>The question we need to ask now is whether Husserl’s phenomenology is really able to transcend psychology. There is no issue here with the claim for the a priori position, the meta-position from which one looks upon the sciences, and in particular on psychology. This claim in itself is not problematic. Such a position is inevitably claimed in critical engagements with, for example, the psy-sciences. In this sense, I have done nothing here but search for such a position. It only becomes problematic if a return is considered possible; in other words, if the illusion is held that the insight obtained from the vantage point is useful for the terrain itself. Once one has claimed a vantage point, one is moving on a totally different terrain; one has entered, so to speak, another world. Here the fundamental critique is that Husserl, rather than falling back into psychologism—such allegations were made after the first edition of the <italic>Logical Investigations</italic>—actually opens the way to psychologization. For if, in <italic>Crisis</italic>, Husserl eventually underpins the <italic>objectivity of the content known</italic> in the life-world, it is exactly this idea of a pre-given, pre-scientific life-world which can be said to fuel psychologization. Just consider how mainstream psychology and Husserl’s transcendental phenomenology meet each other in the conception and construction of a life-world as a free haven against the encroachment of the sciences. Where the total imposition of science on the life-world gave the world as such worldliness, psychological discourse is the attempt to construct a meaningful habitat for the modern subject. Consider, for example, some recent headlines from the magazine <italic>Psychology Today</italic>: “Weathering the Storm: A Guide to Surviving Tough Times” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0959354310389648">Grierson, 2009</xref>); “The Art of Now: Six Steps to Living in the Moment” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0959354310389648">Dixit, 2008</xref>), “Dare To Be Yourself” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0959354310389648">Wright, 2008</xref>). Mainstream psychology is the attempt to reconstruct a life-world. But here we find a second, more structural parallel. Husserl’s transcendental phenomenology relies on man being embedded in his life-world. At the same time, however, the latter is only to be understood as coming to be via the transcendental stance and the transcendental vantage point. Do we not encounter the same issue with psychology and its seemingly inseparable shadow of psychologization? Psychology, that is, is essentially about the constituting of the <italic>psychological subject</italic>, a subject necessarily looked down upon from a certain vantage point. If psychology is about reconnecting the subject to the world, then this is done in a very peculiar way. Psychology connects the modern subject to his or her double, the naïve <italic>psychological subject</italic>, and this latter is only a presupposition and construction of psychology itself. Psychology thus hails its subject to join the ranks of those who survey the life-world. The <italic>look, that’s what you are</italic> imposes the meta-position, resulting in an <italic>oh really, is that the way I am</italic>? Psychology invites man to look upon himself as a psychologist. Psychology is, as such, the praxis of psychologization, constructing the transcendental residual vantage point from which the subject is seen as connected (in a Husserlian <italic>straightforward</italic> way) to the life-world.</p>
<p>In this way it is not so surprising that Husserl’s transcendental phenomenology in the end turns back to psychology. The transcendental subject eventually shares its structure with the psychologized Ego. For <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0959354310389648">Husserl (1931/1999)</xref>, the splitting of the Ego requires, as an assumed starting point, the Ego as “naturally immersed in the world,” which then establishes itself as “disinterested onlooker” (p. 35). However, if we start from the notion of the closing down of the life-world by science, this “naïve interested subject” cannot but be considered as nonexistent. Husserl’s psychological ego is a presupposition, a construction, a fiction. It is the <italic>look at me now, how my behavior is determined by psycholog</italic>y.The radical critique is thus that Husserl, rightly assessing how empirical and positivistic psychology were caught up in the deadlock of psychologism, provided psychology with a way out. His phenomenological vantage point with its perspective on the pre-given life-world offered psychology a new paradigm, namely psychologization. Husserl’s <italic>epoché</italic> initiated the point beyond psychology from which the modern subject can view him- or herself as a psychological ego:</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>The experiencing ego, in the phenomenologically paradigmatic sense, has naturally not got these events in itself as things mentally lived through, as its real constituent or contents, in the way in which these events are in the things concerned in them. What it finds in itself, what are present in it as realities, are the relevant acts of perceiving, judging, etc. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0959354310389648">Husserl, 1901/2001b</xref>, p. 84)</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Husserl’s eidetic science thus provides the model for a psychology based on psychologization. Phenomenology, rather than catering for the eidetic essences with which psychology could empirically engage, establishes the vantage point from which the modern subject can scrutinize him- or herself, becoming his or her own phenomenologist-psychologist. It is thus no wonder that Husserl’s phenomenology eventually glides into psychological, not to say, semi-therapeutic territories: “Thus every new transcendental discovery, by going back into the natural attitude, enriches my psychic life and (apperceptively as a matter of course) that of every other”(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0959354310389648">Husserl, 1954/1970</xref>, p. 210).</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>If for Marx the starting point of every critique is the critique of religion, Husserl perhaps has shown that in the perspective of late modernity every critique must be a critique of psychology. However, throughout <italic>Crisis</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0959354310389648">Husserl (1954/1970)</xref> clearly oscillates between a fundamental critique of psychology and acknowledging psychology as providing a legitimate access to subjectivity:</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>Psychology, like every objective science, is bound to the realm of what is prescientifically pre-given, i.e., bound to what can be named, asserted, described in common language—in this case, bound to the psychic, as it can be expressed in the language of our linguistic community.… For the life-world—the “world for us all”—is identical with the world that can be commonly talked about. (p. 209)</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>It is, however, problematic to speak of a pre-scientific common language. In modernity, common language cannot be cut loose from the discourse of science. Husserl’s attempt to ground subjectivity in the life-world seems to prevent him from assessing how psychological discourse, in particular, came to decisively permeate the common language and the life-world.</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>As a phenomenologist I can, of course, at any time go back into the natural attitude, back to the straightforward pursuit of my theoretical or other life-interests; I can, as before, be active as a Father, a citizen, an official, as a “good European,” etc., that is, as a human being in my human community, in my world. (p. 210)</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>To which we can counter that there is no natural way of being a father, citizen, or good European. The phenomena of contemporary psychologization show that, as a father or citizen, I am bombarded with psychology; even my European sentiments are the object of psychological research, informing media campaigns to influence them (see for a critique <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0959354310389648">Velikonja, 2005</xref>). In each account of fatherhood or citizenship, which are historically modern constructs, the discursive traces of psychology (and psychoanalysis) will be abundant.</p>
<p>In the end, the fundamental, albeit implicit, shift in <italic>Crisis</italic> is the passage from phenomenology as a philosophical method to phenomenology as a description of human subjectivity. Setting out with his aim to formulate a rigorous method for a universal science, Husserl conceives the transcendental <italic>epoché</italic> more and more as how man relates to the world. It is here that the immanent psychologizing of the life-world emerges, precisely where Husserl turns from universality to particularity, where he attempts to ground transcendentality in a positive life-world, thus returning to the factum and the empirical.</p>
<p>Moreover, when <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0959354310389648">Husserl (1931/1999)</xref> argues that the transcendental Ego’s sole remaining interest is “to describe adequately what he sees, purely as seen, as what is seen and seen in such and such a manner” (p. 35), then his transcendental subject is maybe nothing more than a scientific subject, driven by the desire to know. Husserl’s transcendentalism thus leads not to the subject of the life-world, but to the subject of the sciences and, where he does not himself fully address this insight, he glides into psychology. This danger of tilting over into psychology seems, a fortiori, the case with a specific range of disciplines or discourses, such as politics (e.g., politics focusing on well-being and leaving politico-economic decisions to the market), art (psychologizing the artist and the experience of art), psychoanalysis (considering it[self] as a special kind of psychology). Put slightly differently, modern science manifests its breaches at the very points of its success; the total grip on the life-world opens up the paradoxical empty space of and for subjectivity. It is here that we have different praxes: the praxis of politics, the praxis of love, the praxis of art… All these praxes touch the real of subjectivity, in contrast to science, which has no access to it. Psychology, however, seems to be, above all, the discourse which aims to contain this overflow as it functions as the defense mechanism against subjectivity, always threatening to suffocate politics, art, and love.</p>
<p>Although Husserl starts off <italic>Crisis</italic> with the understanding that the stakes are political, phenomenology eventually loses every political dimension. Claiming a phenomenological access to the <italic>objectivity of the content known</italic>, Husserl does not deal with how in modernity the relation subject—Other was decisively reworked by the sciences. Although he rightfully assesses the deadlock of psychologism and a psychological underpinning of modernity and modern subjectivity, his phenomenology, in the end, only signals the transition to psychologization. The pure phenomenological Ego becomes the vantage point to oversee the psychologized life-world. The crisis is defused. The life-world in the end is the de-politicized phantasm of Academia, the latter being the place of sovereignty in these post-statist times.</p>
