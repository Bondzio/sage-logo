<title>Results</title>
<p>A total of 260 Post-It notes were written, from which 123 concepts were identified and grouped into 24 clusters.

<body>
<p>Diabetes is a serious and costly disease, affecting 25.6 million, or 11.3%, of adults in the United States aged 20 years and older. Projected estimates for the year 2010 showed that the greatest incidence (55% of new cases) was in the 45- to 64-year-old range. In 2007, total (direct and indirect) health care costs of diabetes were approximately $174 billion.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0145721712460100">1</xref></sup> The potential costs associated with diabetes are multifaceted, with likely consequences on health, morbidity, mortality, disability, quality of life, absenteeism, and productivity. However, when diabetes is controlled through diet, exercise, and medication, many of the adverse effects can be avoided. Adherence to these lifestyle modifications has proven to be a challenge. Estimates for medication adherence for persons with diabetes range from 50% to 65%,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0145721712460100">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0145721712460100"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0145721712460100">4</xref></sup> and adherence to lifestyle modifications ranges from 20% to 50%.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0145721712460100">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0145721712460100">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0145721712460100">6</xref></sup> Recommended models in diabetes education advocate for improved adherence by tailoring a diabetes program to an individual or culture.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0145721712460100">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0145721712460100">8</xref></sup> Therefore, developing effective diabetes education is needed to reduce complications and costs, as diabetes is reaching pandemic proportions.</p>
<p>For education to be effective, there should be active involvement of the learner in defining the most pertinent issues to be addressed. For example, in this study, a female Hispanic participant complained that her doctor kept advising her to “quit eating tortillas” as a diet modification. She protested, “Just because I am Hispanic does not mean I eat tortillas.” Tailoring information to a learner’s needs, interests, beliefs, and life situation is central to learning. Cognitive mapping is a method of assessing a person’s level of understanding and perceptions regarding an issue such as living with type 2 diabetes. The information gleaned from the cognitive map may then be used to develop an individualized diabetes education program.</p>
<p>The literature examines components of a person’s perspective on living with diabetes, attitudes, and adherence to diabetes management through the use of surveys,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0145721712460100">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0145721712460100">10</xref></sup> questionnaires,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0145721712460100">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0145721712460100">12</xref></sup> interviews,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0145721712460100">13</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0145721712460100"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0145721712460100"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0145721712460100">16</xref></sup> and focus groups.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0145721712460100">17</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0145721712460100"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0145721712460100"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0145721712460100">20</xref></sup> These studies are limited by the tool or technique used by the researcher—namely, the questions being asked. Cognitive mapping is unique in that the scope of the investigation is limited only by the person living with the illness, the ability to recall issues, and the willingness to share.</p>
<p>Cognitive mapping was used in the current study to identify the issues and perceptions of living with diabetes among adults newly diagnosed with type 2 diabetes. The research hypothesis was that common thoughts or concepts would be found in the group of individuals newly diagnosed with type 2 diabetes as a whole. Additionally, associations would be found between common concepts and demographic factors. Demographics such as age, sex, time since diagnosis, socioeconomic status, and culture have been found to influence an individual’s beliefs and perceptions about diabetes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0145721712460100">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0145721712460100">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0145721712460100">22</xref></sup> The common concepts identified through cognitive mapping may be used to tailor educational programs that may further improve people’s adherence to the intervention by addressing their personal needs, beliefs, and perceptions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0145721712460100">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0145721712460100">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0145721712460100">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0145721712460100">22</xref></sup> Cognitive mapping has been successfully applied in an array of settings, such as substance abuse counseling,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0145721712460100">23</xref></sup> promotion of fruit and vegetable intake,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0145721712460100">24</xref></sup> and depiction of illness.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0145721712460100">25</xref></sup> Currently, no reports were found that used cognitive mapping to evaluate adults with type 2 diabetes and their perceptions of living with diabetes.</p>

<sec id="section6-0145721712460100">
<title>Research Design</title>
<p>This descriptive study is primarily qualitative; however, a questionnaire including demographics and lifestyle questions was also recorded and analyzed. The qualitative portion of the study used an interview technique called cognitive mapping to elicit information from individuals with type 2 diabetes about their perceptions of living with the disease.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-0145721712460100">
<title>Cognitive Mapping</title>
<p>Cognitive mapping is performed by asking the participant to respond to a question or series of questions on a topic by writing down words or phrases that come to mind. The participant is then asked to arrange the words and phrases on a poster board and to draw lines and arrows to indicate their relationships. In this manner, cognitive mapping attempts to elicit a pictorial description of the perception of the participant at that moment in time about an issue such as living with type 2 diabetes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0145721712460100">26</xref></sup></p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-0145721712460100">
<title>Participants</title>
<p>Local medical facilities, physicians, nurses, diabetes educators, and churches in San Angelo, Texas, were asked to post or distribute a recruitment flier to anyone who was newly diagnosed with type 2 diabetes. Prospective participants called the investigator, and the initial screenings were conducted by phone, followed by a face-to-face meeting. Participants were required to be 18 years of age or older, newly diagnosed with diabetes (within the past 3 months), and capable of reading and writing in English. An eliminating factor was that participants could not have any involvement as a patient in a diabetes education program prior to this study. The interviews were conducted primarily on the campus of Angelo State University; however, the study was also carried out in local hospitals and at patient homes. Participants were issued a $10 gift card for meeting with the investigator and a $30 gift card for completing the interview as an incentive.</p>
<p>The primary investigator observed a redundancy in data as the interviews were conducted. Data saturation was confirmed by performing a frequency count comparing the frequency of concepts found in the first 8 participants to the second 8 participants. Hence, recruitment was terminated after 16 participants consented and completed the study.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-0145721712460100">
<title>Procedures</title>
<p>After screening, qualified participants were scheduled for an interview. At the start of the interview appointment, informed consent was obtained, and the demographic and lifestyle questionnaire was completed. The interview consisted of a single question: “When you think of living with diabetes, what comes to mind?” The participant was given a stack of numbered Post-It notes and instructed to write 1 word or phrase on each note in response to the question. The participant was encouraged to write anything that came to mind, even if it did not seem related to the question. When the task was complete, the participant was instructed to arrange the notes (ie, concepts) on a poster board in any manner or design that he or she desired. Next, the participant was asked to draw lines/arrows or group the concepts to indicate relationships among them, if present. Through this process, each participant generated his or her cognitive map. The investigator asked the participant to verbally tell the story of the map, to ensure accurate interpretation of each concept and the relationships. The participant was encouraged to make changes or additions to the map as he or she discussed the meaning. The verbal review of the map was voice recorded and a transcript produced to ensure accuracy of interpretation at the time of data analysis. A computerized version of the cognitive map was generated to be as similar as possible to the map developed by the participant. However, upon completion of the map, if misspellings interfered with the ability to understand the meaning of the concept, they were corrected. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0145721712460100">Figure 1</xref> is a computerized map produced in this study.</p>

<sec id="section10-0145721712460100">
<title>Data Analysis</title>
<p>The concepts from the computerized map were entered into a spreadsheet using 1 line per quote. Keywords from each Post-It note quote were also entered into the spreadsheet by the investigator. It was possible that each quote could have more than 1 keyword contained within it. For example, a quote of “no white bread” was entered as keyword <italic>no</italic> and keyword <italic>bread</italic>. If use of the actual quote did not reflect the meaning of the quote, the investigator coded the quote under the intended meaning. An example of a quote that required coding was “I love to eat cake &amp; pie.” In the transcript of the map, the participant said, “I can’t have cake &amp; pie.” The quote was then coded as keyword <italic>can’t</italic> and <italic>sweets</italic>. Another example of the use of concepts is with the Post-It quote <italic>heavy weight</italic>. Transcript data contain “It feels like there is always a heavy weight. I’m always thinking of . . . I gotta do this . . . I gotta plan ahead now.” The quote was coded as the concepts of <italic>plan</italic> and <italic>negative emotions</italic>. Coding it as <italic>weight</italic> would have had a different implication than the quote “lose weight.” After each quote was examined for proper coding, the keywords and concepts were referred to collectively as <italic>concepts</italic>. A total number of concepts and their frequency among all the maps were calculated. The most common concepts were identified. Clusters were sought among the concepts of the cognitive maps. For instance, the concepts of <italic>soda, Coke</italic>, and <italic>Dr. Pepper</italic> were reduced to one cluster of <italic>drinks</italic>. Transcripts were used to resolve any doubt in the meaning of the concept. Frequency of clusters was calculated and the most common clusters identified. The clusters were simplified into major categories that are mutually exclusive. Each Post-It appears in only one category. The principal investigator and a second analyzer identified categories individually. The categories identified by each investigator were compared and discussed. Final determination of category assignment was made by consensus. The Post-It quote “no soda” was assigned to the category of <italic>the no’s</italic> since the essence of the quote is that the soda is forbidden.</p>
<p>Self reported demographic characteristics and lifestyle data drawn from the questionnaire were analyzed with descriptive statistics. Participants were grouped according to common demographics, such as age, ethnicity, sex, and socioeconomic data. Chi-square analysis was used to examine associations between demographic data and activity, demographic data and category, time of interview since diagnosis and category, and among demographic data. The level of significance was set at α = 0.05 based on a 2-tailed exact test.</p>

<p>Two statistically significant associations were found among age, ethnicity, income, education, insurance, and sex. The first association was between income and educational levels. All 7 individuals with no college education were making $30 000 or less, while 7 of 8 who had any college education were making $30 001 or more annually (<italic>P</italic> = .001). The second association was between age and sex. Six of 7 men were aged 44 years or less, while 8 of 9 women were aged 45 years or more (<italic>P</italic> = .009).

<title>Cognitive Maps</title>
<p>The number of Post-It notes used by each participant to compose the cognitive map was calculated individually, ranging from 5 to 34. Collectively, the total number of notes used was 260, with a mean of 16.25 per map. The total number of identified concepts within the maps was 123. The most common concepts were as follows: <italic>eat</italic> (23), <italic>diabetes</italic> (16), <italic>do more</italic> (14), <italic>no</italic> (11), <italic>diet</italic> (10), <italic>negative emotions</italic> (10), <italic>family</italic> (9), <italic>exercise</italic> (9), <italic>medicine</italic> (8), <italic>loss</italic> (8), <italic>not able to</italic> (8).</p>
<p>The concepts were grouped into 24 clusters, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0145721712460100">Figure 2</xref>. The 5 most frequent clusters were <italic>food</italic> (59), <italic>negative emotions</italic> (54), <italic>diabetes and its complications</italic> (35), <italic>take care and do more</italic> (33), and <italic>the no’s</italic> (limitations; 31). The most common concepts within the <italic>food</italic> cluster were <italic>eat</italic> (23), <italic>diet</italic> (10), and <italic>sweets</italic> (5). The most common concepts within the <italic>negative emotions</italic> cluster were <italic>scared</italic> (7), <italic>worried</italic> (6), and <italic>lonely</italic> (5). Cluster analysis of the first 3 Post-Its that each participant wrote revealed <italic>negative emotions</italic> (13) as the most frequent cluster, <italic>food</italic> (12) second, <italic>the no’s</italic> (limitations) (7) third, and tied for fourth are the concepts of <italic>diabetes and its complications</italic> (4) and <italic>medicine and doctor</italic>.</p>

<p>No difference was found between the categories generated by men versus women. Significant associations were found among age, ethnicity, income, education, insurance, time since diagnosis, and categories. A statistically significant association was found between a younger age and the category of medical management, or <italic>have to</italic> (<italic>P</italic> = .011). All 7 participants who were 44 years of age or less used an <italic>I have to</italic> statement about their medical management. In contrast, only 3 of 9 participants aged 45 years or older made such statements. Another significant difference was found in those who used <italic>have to</italic> statements and educational level. Out of 10 participants who generated <italic>have to</italic> statements, 8 had at least some college education as compared to 2 with no college (<italic>P</italic> = .035). There was also a significant difference in regard to health insurance and statements of loss. Individuals who had health insurance (7 of 8) were significantly more likely (<italic>P</italic> = .041) to write about loss than those without health insurance (2 of 8). A 44-year-old white male participant explained, “Loss of self. I guess I used to be selfish. I didn’t think I was but I used to do what I wanted to when I wanted. Now my life is very regimented and very scrutinized, under the microscope. And maybe it’s not but it feels like it sometimes.” An association (<italic>P</italic> = .007) was found between the category <italic>I’m sick</italic> and the ethnic background of Hispanic. All 7 Hispanic participants had concepts in this category that expressed physical and mental symptoms of diabetes. Additionally, there was an association between the category <italic>I’m sick</italic> and income (<italic>P</italic> = .041). Seven of 9 participants that had concepts in the <italic>I’m sick</italic> category had a lower income, $30 000 or less. Four of these 7 are also Hispanic. Higher income (<italic>P</italic> = .041) and a higher educational level (<italic>P</italic> = .009) were associated with the <italic>need to</italic> (self-management) category. Statements of what the individual will need to do to manage diabetes were generated by 6 participants in the higher-income bracket ($30 001 or more), as compared to only 2 participants in the lower-income bracket. Likewise, 8 participants who wrote of things that they would need to do had at least some college, while only 1 had no college education. Last, a greater span in time (2 weeks to 3 months) from diagnosis to interview was found to be associated with a greater number of <italic>need to</italic> and <italic>have to</italic> concepts generated within the cognitive maps.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>The concept of <italic>eat</italic> had the greatest frequency and when grouped with other concepts, such as <italic>diet, food, sweets, sugar, meal, bread</italic>, and <italic>carbs</italic>, formed the largest cluster: <italic>food</italic>. The frequent concern with food is consistent with findings from a number of studies and has been identified across cultures.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0145721712460100">28</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0145721712460100"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0145721712460100"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0145721712460100"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0145721712460100">32</xref></sup></p>
<p><italic>Diabetes</italic> was the second-most-common concept and was grouped with <italic>complications, sick, amputation</italic>, and <italic>death</italic> to form the third-largest cluster. Participant 6 entitled his map “Criminal Mastermind is Diabetes” and related that “it’s like chess, you make the wrong move and you get killed.” Death or loss of life was expressed as the most feared consequence of having diabetes. This finding is compatible with a study that used conversational interactions with women with type 2 diabetes to determine how it affected their lives. The women demonstrated that death was on the forefront of their minds, by asking questions about death within the first few minutes of the conversation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0145721712460100">28</xref></sup> Hispanic migrant farmworkers mentioned death as a fear, but most often spoke of kidney disease and dialysis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0145721712460100">16</xref></sup></p>
<p>The second-most-common cluster was <italic>negative emotions</italic>, which consisted of the concepts of <italic>scared, worried, lonely, anger, fear, sad, stress</italic>, and <italic>terrible</italic>, as well as less-mentioned concepts. No participant used the word <italic>depressed</italic> in this investigation, yet many of the terms did indicate an emotional distress about their diagnosis. The literature seems to be moving away from connecting depression and diabetes as previously reported<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0145721712460100">33</xref></sup> to categorizing these negative emotions with a newer term <italic>diabetes distress</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0145721712460100">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0145721712460100">35</xref></sup> In one study, women who were diagnosed with a chronic illness reported feeling alone.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0145721712460100">36</xref></sup> Four participants in the current study reported loneliness (2 women and 2 men). One male participant stated, “Don’t have anyone to talk to or to comfort me,” reflecting the loneliness that he felt just days after his diagnosis.</p>
<p>When the clusters found in the first 3 Post-Its were compared to the clusters established among all the notes, <italic>negative emotions</italic> became the most predominant, followed by <italic>food</italic> and <italic>the no’s</italic>. The <italic>negative emotions</italic> cluster reflects the distress reaction to the diagnosis of diabetes. Similarly, other researchers have found feelings of shock, despair, anxiety, worry, or fear at the time of diagnosis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0145721712460100">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0145721712460100">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0145721712460100">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0145721712460100">36</xref></sup> Some researchers propose that the initial shock is so overwhelming that it prevents the individual from benefiting from any information about the management of the disease at the time that the diagnosis is delivered.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0145721712460100">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0145721712460100">36</xref></sup> However, other researchers do not believe that the initial reaction is shock and that patients actually desire more information at the time of diagnosis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0145721712460100">37</xref></sup> <italic>The no’s</italic> cluster comprises the limitations that the participants perceive, things they can no longer have or do, as a result of their diagnosis. A 45-year-old man explaining his map said, “Then I went to the no’s . . . no breads, no sweets, I hate vegetables.” A 33-year-old white woman stated, “That is one of the rules . . . we’re supposed to have no sodas especially those with sugar in it.” The first 3 Post-It notes that each participant wrote show an expanded view of diabetes distress consisting of initial negative emotions, food concerns, and the rules of what they can’t do or can’t have because of their diagnosis of diabetes.</p>
<p>Income and education have been shown to be closely associated in the literature.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0145721712460100">38</xref></sup> An earlier study found that walking was the preferred activity of Mexican American females.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0145721712460100">19</xref></sup> However, in this study, no association was found in sex or ethnicity when walking was the activity of choice. The finding in the current study that men tended to be younger is inconsequential, given that sex was not found to have a significant association with any category. In support of this assumption, a previous study revealed no sex differences in attitude and reactions to diabetes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0145721712460100">10</xref></sup></p>
<p>Several categorical data and demographic associations were found. The <italic>need to</italic> category is associated with higher income, a college education, and a longer time from diagnosis to interview. The <italic>have to</italic> category is associated with younger participants, a college education, and a longer time since diagnosis. Each category contains phrases that require the knowledge and planning for what the individuals will need to do to manage their diabetes in terms of diet, exercise, blood glucose monitoring, and medication. Having a longer time, 2 weeks to 3 months, to begin planning and implementing these changes may have led to the participants mentioning these changes more readily. Also, having at least some college may have prepared them to self-educate, investigate, and have a better understanding of the necessary changes. The younger participants may have reported more <italic>have to</italic> quotes because they will have to perform more medical management, such as taking medication or injections, over their lifetime. Perhaps this seems more ominous with a longer future in front of them.</p>
<p>Those participants who wrote about being sick and not feeling well were more likely to be of lower-income and Hispanic backgrounds, though these two factors were not associated. All of the Hispanic participants expressed thoughts about their physical or mental symptoms as related to diabetes. More research is needed on the relationship of Hispanic race and the focus on symptoms. Low-income participants may be more likely to talk about their symptoms because they may not perceive that they have the means to get medical assistance to improve their symptoms.</p>
<p>No difference was found in the <italic>emotional distress</italic> category between any of the demographic variables including ethnicity. This contradicts a study that used the Problem Areas in Diabetes Scale and found that among Hispanics, low educational level and young age were associated with diabetes-related emotional distress.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0145721712460100">39</xref></sup> This is also in conflict with findings by Beeney et al, who reported that greater emotional distress was associated with a younger age.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0145721712460100">30</xref></sup></p>
<sec id="section15-0145721712460100">
<title>Limitations</title>
<p>The greatest limitation of this study is the small number of participants. This is problematic when looking at associations, as many of the numbers are less than 5. There is a lack of race or ethnic diversity within the participants; however, having a division of White and Hispanic was beneficial when examining associations.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section16-0145721712460100">
<title>Clinical Applicability</title>
<p>The 9 categories mirror the issues of living with diabetes as perceived by persons newly diagnosed with type 2 diabetes. The participants in this study mentioned the following most frequently: (1) the changes they will need to (self-management) make to manage their disease; (2) their concerns about how diabetes would affect their life and those around them; (3) being sick, feeling bad, tired, thirsty, and not thinking clearly; (4) the negative emotional reactions to receiving a diagnosis of diabetes; (5) feelings of loss of control, loss of freedom, loss of spontaneity, and the feeling that their life will be forever different; (6) the limitations (the no’s) of their diagnosis; (7) their fears about diabetes and the long-term effects of the disease; (8) the recommended medical management (have to) strategies for diabetes; and (9) the coping mechanisms to deal with all of the changes and reconciling the loss of an old way of life and the beginning of a new journey. These categories paint a portrait of the multidimensional effect of diabetes on the life of an individual newly diagnosed with type 2 diabetes.</p>
<p>The most common concepts, clusters, and categories from a health professional’s point of view may be used to gain a greater understanding of the issues and perceptions of all individuals newly diagnosed with diabetes and to develop interventions to enhance diabetes education. One suggested application is for the diabetes educator to integrate a series of questions into a diabetes education program that address the common categories listed above. These questions may include “How do you feel emotionally about being diagnosed with diabetes?” “What concerns or fears do you have about living with diabetes?” “What foods or drinks do you think you need to avoid?” “What types of things do you think that you will need to do or must do on a daily basis now that you have diabetes?” and “How are you coping with having diabetes?” Listening to the responses may allow the diabetes educator to tailor the education by dealing specifically with an individual’s fears, emotions, and concerns. Additionally, the individual may have already self-identified a habit that needs to change, such as “no soda,” to which the educator can then assist by providing appropriate drinks or inquiring about other drinks of preference, therefore empowering the person with diabetes and establishing a collaborative relationship to develop change talk, self-directed goals, and interventions for change.</p>
<p>Further research is warranted to apply cognitive mapping to larger and more diverse populations. There is a need to examine different cultures, age groups, and caregivers. In addition, studies may be beneficial that make use of cognitive mapping as an intervention or in combination with other interventions to improve adherence.</p>
