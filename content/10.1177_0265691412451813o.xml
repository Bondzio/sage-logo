<sec id="sec1-0265691412451813o"><title>Patricia M. E. Lorcin and Daniel Brewer, eds, <italic>France and its Spaces of War: Experience, Memory, Image</italic>, Palgrave Macmillan: Basingstoke, 2009; viii + 305 pp., 13 illus.; 9780230615618, £66.00 (hbk)</title>
<p>The 20 essays in this volume, first presented at a 2006 conference, explore the culture of war in modern France, with a particular emphasis on the ‘spaces of war’. Divided into the three sections indicated by the book’s subtitle, they examine the various ways in which the French – combatants, those on the home front, those who represented war in literature, film and other genres – had to engage with fighting and its effects. Two of the essays look at the <italic>ancien régime</italic>: Christine Pichichero’s fine contribution on the <italic>philosophes-militaires</italic> in the 1700s; and Michael Wolfe’s discussion of the (rather gruesome) injuries recorded in the memoirs of a sixteenth-century soldier. The remainder focus on the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, showing the variety of experiences of war, and the issues posed for the participants. Jennifer E. Sessions, for example, interestingly examines whether the French considered that the rules of European war should or could apply in the conquest of Algeria, while Martha Hanna (on peasants in the First World War) and Nicole Dombrowski Risser (on ‘civilian space’ in northern France, also in the 1914–1918 war) make arresting arguments about the overlap between the battlefront and the home front.</p>
<p>Several of the most original papers in this volume look at the wider repercussions of fighting on particular regions of France – a regional focus proves to be a useful approach to investigations about the long-lasting effects of war. Christopher J. Fischer’s essay shows how war, and the experience of being treated as war booty at the time of both French and German victories, had an impact on regionalist sentiment in Alsace, while Bronson Long’s fascinating piece looks at the plans of the head of the French occupation forces in the Saarland either to incorporate that region into France or to make it into new a new mini-state such as Luxembourg in the aftermath of the Second World War. The uncertainties and paradoxes of the end of war are also shown in Patrice Arnaud’s study of the ambivalent attitudes that French labour conscripts in Germany felt about their American liberators in 1945.</p>
<p>The essays on memories of war cover a wide range of subjects, from the effects of war on the artist Fernand Léger to views of war in films such as <italic>La Victoire en chantant</italic> (1976) and <italic>Indigènes</italic> (2006). The history of war memorials, not surprisingly, attracts the attention of several writers. Two stand-out essays on monuments are Annette Becker’s study of ‘artists, commemorations and political culture’ concerning the Great War, and Kirrily Freeman’s reflections on the empty pedestals that remained in Paris after Germans had melted down many of the capital’s bronze statues in the early 1940s, what their hauntingly bare pedestals meant to the public, and what was to be done with them.</p>
<p>This collection offers a diversity of studies pertinent to historians of modern France, of war, of collective memory and monuments, and of literary and visual culture. The works underline the continuing presence of war in French life, from the Franco-Prussian War through to the Second World War and beyond, with colonial wars ever on the horizon, from the invasion of Algeria in the 1830s to the Algerian war of independence 130 years later. No generation until perhaps the present one has been immune from some experience of warfare (including, as Floréal Jiménez Aguilar’s essay points out, reaction to the civil war on France’s doorstep in Spain). Historiographical and political controversies about wars continue to fester, as many of these works show – from residual discord about certain aspects of the Great War (seen here in Becker’s discussion of Lionel Jospin’s controversial acknowledgement of mutineers among French First World War troops), to the still unquiet ideological battlefields of Vichy and Algeria. New films, memorials and historical works provide for a perennial rediscovery of the cult and culture of warfare, a phenomenon surely to be recharged with the upcoming centenary of the beginning of the Great War.</p>
<p>Military history in the strict sense of guns and battle plans has long been the province of specialized historians and avid amateurs. A more widely-based approach concerning war and society, as illustrated by the essays in Lorcin and Brewer’s collection, points the way for further work – on wars in which France was a belligerent and those in which it took some role from the sidelines, on the social history of the military, and on the place of martial (and anti-war) ideologies and perspectives in French life.</p>
