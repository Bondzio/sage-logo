<p>Timothy Rowlands’ <italic>Video Game Worlds</italic> delves into the virtual realm of <italic>EverQuest</italic>, a massively multiplayer online game (MMO), delivering both an account and critique of online gaming culture. While the widely-known MMO <italic>World of Warcraft</italic> supplanted the popularity of <italic>EverQuest</italic> in the late 2000s, Rowlands uses the specific case of <italic>EverQuest</italic> to analyze both the rise and decline of an MMO from its release in 1999 to the present. Ambitious in scope beyond simply an ethnographic record of an MMO, Rowlands’ work has two primary research questions: to identify and describe <italic>EverQuest</italic>’s game culture, and to determine how this culture has emerged through “design decisions made by the virtual world’s producers and by gamers’ collectively negotiated meanings of the rules” (p. 14). Rowlands examines these research questions through both immersive experience and interviews with gamers, imbuing his research with a theoretical framework, including Roland Barthes’ use of myth and values and Jean-Francois Lyotard’s notion of the grand narrative (p. 17).</p>
<p>In his account, Rowlands first describes the strategies and practices that have come to dominate the game, such as the normative “Holy Trinity Camp Group” strategy that combines the efforts of three types of characters to wage attacks on monsters. Rowlands then proceeds to unpack the series of management decisions and gamer practices that led to the formation of <italic>EverQuest</italic>’s social norms that he describes. Moreover, Rowlands seeks to understand why these particular norms have developed and are so entrenched in the game, despite being “a severe curtailment of what is actually possible in the virtual world” (p. 65). Rowlands suggests that a critical shift occurred within <italic>EverQuest</italic>, wherein a player’s actions within the game became institutionalized at the cost of “playfulness” in the game’s virtual world (p. 88). Later in his book, Rowlands examines the ways in which the hegemonic structures of <italic>EverQuest</italic> are connected to global economic forces and the philosophical underpinnings that reinforce these structures, invoking both “a nineteenth century notion of the civilizing mission and a twenty-first century notion of global corporate hegemonies” (p. 128).</p>
<p>This work is engaging, even to those unfamiliar with online gaming, and a comprehensive glossary is beneficial for explaining general gaming and <italic>EverQuest-</italic>specific terminology. This book would be of most interest to scholars of cultural studies, the sociology of knowledge, social psychology, and the role of myth and ritual in the virtual world.</p>
