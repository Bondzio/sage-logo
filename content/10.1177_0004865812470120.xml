<abstract>
<p>Too often the making of laws on serious crime is conducted in haste. Unnecessary, ineffective or invalid laws on serious crime have major negative impacts on both individuals and societies. The processes that permit the creation of such laws clearly need reforming. In order to slow down and bring more rationality to the legislative process for serious crime, a clear and mandatory ex ante deliberative system that enables a thorough assessment of the costs and benefits of legislating and of particular legislative approaches is needed. This article draws on work by Dryzek to identify the elements of a deliberative system – authenticity, inclusiveness and the quality of being consequential. It assesses Australia’s current legislative processes for serious crime against this deliberative standard and concludes that they rarely meet it. Several practical steps that could be taken to incorporate deliberation into serious crime lawmaking are suggested: the creation of guides to legislative approaches for use by policy makers, the introduction of an ex ante impact assessment process (termed a Serious Crime Legislation Impact Assessment or SCLIA), and the establishment of actor networks registers to facilitate consultative processes. The adoption of such a deliberative system would result in better, more evidence-based and impact-sensitive serious crime legislation.</p>

<sec id="sec1-0004865812470120" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title>
<p>Anthony Zervas was murdered on 22 March 2009 during a brawl between warring outlaw motorcycle gangs (‘bikie’ gangs) at Sydney domestic airport terminal. Just ten days later, amidst a media-fuelled ‘moral panic’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0004865812470120">Cohen, 1972</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0004865812470120">Morgan et al., 2010</xref>), the government of New South Wales enacted the Crimes (Criminal Organisations Control) Act 2009, a law designed to enable the state to limit and prohibit associations between members of bikie gangs. Slightly over two years later, in June 2011, this law was held invalid as unconstitutional by the High Court of Australia when it was challenged by a member of the Hells Angels.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0004865812470120">1</xref></sup> It had achieved nothing substantive except the expenditure of a significant amount of taxpayers’ money on the legal costs of defending it.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0004865812470120">2</xref></sup></p>
<p>When incidents of high visibility crime such as the Zervas murder occur, passing legislation often seems to those in power the simplest and most expressive option for allaying public concern and signalling condemnation. But acting ‘in the heat of the moment’ too often has consequences for the legislative product. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0004865812470120">Cowdery (2009)</xref> explains, ‘on occasions the lawmakers have taken their drafting instructions from the most prominent rantings of the tabloid media’. A nuanced approach that pays regard to ‘what works’ and has worked elsewhere is likely to be passed over for a simpler ‘off-the-shelf’ solution, usually involving an expansion of police powers. Scant attention is paid to the likely impacts of the proposed laws, on human rights, on police resources, on the criminal justice system more generally, and on victims and offenders, as well as any potential unintended consequences. Even where existing laws are adequate to deal with the problem, the assumed expressive or symbolic functionality of legislating may prevail. Overall, the result can be unnecessary, ineffective, invalid or in some cases harmful criminal laws. The processes that permit the creation of such laws clearly need some work. This is especially the case for laws relating to serious crime by criminal groups, because it is here that bad lawmaking has its most serious impacts for both individuals and societies.</p>
<p>The haste with which the NSW law was passed is symptomatic of a wider problem concerning the direction in which the criminal law is travelling. Disquiet over the quality, quantity and breadth of the criminal law in Western jurisdictions has been expressed for many years now,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0004865812470120">3</xref></sup> and appears to be growing. However, it is not the intention of this article to describe the many analyses of how and why criminal law has lost its way, or to explore specific issues such as penal populism or the precautionary bent of recent lawmaking on serious crime. Rather, it is accepted that a problem exists.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0004865812470120">4</xref></sup> We move beyond analyses of cause and effect to consider practical steps that might be adopted to bring more rationality to criminal lawmaking on serious crime and take some heat out of the ‘heat of the moment’. Although avoiding bad criminal laws altogether is for many reasons unlikely, little thought has been given to pragmatic ways to address this challenge so that lawmakers might be better able to craft meaningful, evidence-based and non-redundant law in the future.</p>
<p>Bad laws may result from rushing to legislate in the heat of the moment. The costs of such haste are discussed in the first section of the article. Our arguments are limited to serious crime because, as the next section argues, criminal law in this area has the most severe impacts for both individuals and society. One of the major causes of the enactment of bad law on serious crime is the lack of a system for ensuring that policy makers and legislatures take into account a range of relevant considerations in the early stages of the law-making process. This is at odds with the shift to evidence-based criminal justice policy making in recent times, as is discussed next. The article then turns to possible solutions. Ex post assessment of legislation, while not to be undervalued, only goes so far. It is argued that what is needed is a clear and mandatory ex ante deliberative system built into serious crime law-making processes The elements of a deliberative system are then identified. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0004865812470120">Dryzek (2009)</xref> has argued that to be both effective and democratic, a deliberative system needs to be high in authenticity and inclusiveness, and to be consequential. Assessed against these criteria, Australia’s system for developing laws on serious crime such as terrorism and organised crime, it is argued, is demonstrably lacking. In the penultimate section the article suggests the adoption of several steps that would help to restructure decision making ex ante the legislative process. The first is the creation of maps of, or guides to, legislative approaches for use by policy makers and applicable to the particular problem in hand. The second is the introduction of an impact assessment process, termed here a Serious Crime Legislation Impact Assessment (SCLIA), that would be similar to but more comprehensive than regulatory impact assessments currently used for Australian laws impacting on business. Impact assessment would need to involve transparency through public and expert consultations, and so it is suggested that registers of significant actor networks be established to facilitate these consultations. Finally, the conclusion briefly canvasses how such a deliberative system for serious crime laws could be implemented in practice.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec2-0004865812470120"><title>The costs of haste</title>
<p>Few people would argue that every decision about what laws are appropriate for our society should be put to a public vote. After all, one of the reasons we elect politicians is to take responsibility for such matters. But when it comes to some ‘hot’ issues, such as crime, legislators often behave as hostages to moral panic and electoral cycles rather than as the rational reflective public representatives we would like them to be. They enact laws because doing something, anything, quickly is perceived as politically advantageous.</p>
<p>The result may be legislation that is not needed. One cost of unnecessary legislation is that resources are misallocated. With finite resources and under pressure to use new laws, police have to give priority to the new solution embodied in the legislation, channelling resources to it at the expense of already existing solutions. Where the older ways were adequate and effective and the new solution is not, this constitutes a waste of resources. Another cost is an opportunity cost. A more effective better designed solution, one that may or may not require legislation, may be overlooked in the rush to do something.</p>
<p>Haste in lawmaking could also result in legislation that is flawed. Flawed legislation invites expensive legal challenge. Any resulting legal invalidity also has costs in the form of leaving untouched the identified problem and its associated harms. Law enforcement bodies may also encounter operational problems with such legislation. In trying to implement flawed legislation, their resources may be wasted or even inadvertently used to cause harm (for instance, if the law is poorly targeted).</p>
<p>Once a flawed or unnecessary legislative model is enacted, it becomes the framework within which the problem is perceived and managed. Because political legitimacy is invested in that model, few governments are brave enough to admit that a mistake has been made and either return to previous solutions or invest resources in reconsidering ways to tackle the problem.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec3-0004865812470120"><title>Why focus on serious crime?</title>
<p>These problems are at their most disturbing, and also dangerous, when it comes to laws on serious crime, for it is here that bad lawmaking has its most serious impacts at both individual and societal levels. Penalties and the associated stigma are at their most severe under these laws. Criminal laws that impose unjustified or disproportionate sanctions on individuals, either directly or through collective sanctions,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0004865812470120">5</xref></sup> will have the gravest personal consequences in the area of serious crime. Furthermore, as already noted, negative economic consequences for societies may result from attempts to defend bad laws, and issues of political legitimacy can arise for governments that make the attempt. Groups that engage in serious crime often have resources with which to fight, often repeatedly, laws targeting them. Moreover, if bad laws are struck down by courts or, alternatively, if laws are bad because they are ineffective, the significant physical, psychological and economic harm that serious crime inflicts on individuals and on society is left untouched.</p>
<p>At a macro level, laws on serious crime, often the subject of treaties and interstate cooperation, are the domestic criminal laws most likely to gain international attention. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0004865812470120">Fichera (2011</xref>: 10) observes:<disp-quote>
<p>Society needs criminal law to protect its fundamental values. A community of individuals decides to enforce its internal norms through criminal sanctions in order to preserve its integrity and identity. This is why criminal policy and legislation are so important for the self-representation of a community and its projection to the outside world.</p></disp-quote>It is therefore essential that our criminal laws on serious crime properly represent ‘us’ as a society and our guiding values as a liberal democracy.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec4-0004865812470120"><title>Crime policy and criminal lawmaking: Out of step</title>
<p>Bad laws on serious crime are then clearly undesirable; likewise bad crime policy. In relation to the latter, there has been steady movement towards a more scientific model. The University of Maryland 1997 report to Congress on what works in crime prevention provided a rating and review of evaluation studies across several areas of criminal justice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0004865812470120">Sherman et al., 1997</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0004865812470120">6</xref></sup> This was followed by the establishment of the Campbell Collaboration in 2000,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0004865812470120">7</xref></sup> an international research network that prepares and disseminates systematic reviews in a number of areas including crime and justice. Since then, the idea that an evidence base is needed for criminal justice practice has guided criminal justice research in an increasingly scientific direction. Police organisations in particular have been the beneficiaries of the emergent crime science approach advanced by bodies such as the Jill Dando Institute in the United Kingdom and the Center for Evidence-Based Crime Policy in the United States.</p>
<p>Increasingly the need for an evidence-based approach has also featured in academic literature on serious crime over the last decade. Scholars have noted a lack of nuance in understandings of the nature of serious crime, particularly organised crime, and in societal responses. They have argued that alternative conceptions of serious crime that better recognise complexities, connections and specific contexts are needed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0004865812470120">Edwards and Gill, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0004865812470120">Edwards and Levi, 2008</xref>), as is a shift of focus from law enforcement to preventive and regulatory strategies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0004865812470120">Levi and Maguire, 2004</xref>). As well as assisting in the achievement of these objectives, empirical research facilitates a better understanding of the unintended consequences of well-intended interventions and encourages transparency in policy making, reducing the ability of political interests to overinflate the threat of serious crime in order to justify especially tough responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0004865812470120">Beare, 2003</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-0004865812470120">8</xref></sup></p>
<p>In Australia, the promotion and use of an evidence base for decision making on criminal policy as embodied in law seems to be at an embryonic stage. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0004865812470120">Boruch and Lum (2011)</xref> note the need for generosity in the sharing of evidence with other stakeholders – ‘cops, judges, social workers, business leaders’ – but this generosity needs also to extend to policy makers in order to inform and improve the legislative process and the quality of criminal law. Australian policy-setting and law-making processes do not, however, make it a simple matter to share knowledge.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec5-0004865812470120"><title>Reorienting criminal lawmaking towards deliberation</title>
<p>Current systems of lawmaking in Australia provide neither time nor space for proper consideration of all the issues relevant to the scope and content of criminal laws (see below). Underlying philosophical questions such as how to balance freedom against security and what kinds and degrees of security measures are acceptable in a democratic society are rarely asked. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0004865812470120">Goldsmith (2008: 163)</xref> discusses this issue in some detail in the context of counter-terrorism laws in Australia and Canada, concluding that:<disp-quote>
<p>What can shield us ultimately against the excesses of counterterrorist law reform is the further development of reflexive processes dealing with questions such as ‘how much security is enough?’ and ‘why are expanded powers needed?’ Transparent processes, including opportunities for democratic deliberation, will remain crucial to how we operationalize greater caution … and confront public skepticism on government handling of this issue.</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>Goldsmith suggests that, when determining legal and policy responses to terrorist threats, both the public and those who have expertise in the security field should have more input. He also argues that ex post processes of legislative review, such as assessments of effectiveness and fairness, may have more chance of making inroads into decision making than ex ante processes, such as parliamentary committee inquiries. This is because ‘the position of politicians is a difficult one’ (2008: 162) in the face of imminent threat, making it hard to resist the temptation to cave in to public anxieties and provide some reassurance through rapid enactment of repressive laws.</p>
<p>There is no doubt that Goldsmith is right that ex post processes should be strengthened. But this does not mean that the strengthening of ex ante processes should be dismissed as too difficult. What is needed is some kind of mandatory deliberative system to ensure that the issues pertaining to a proposed law on serious crime are explored as fully as possible before the law is enacted, so that the tendency of politicians to leap hastily at punitive options is countered and the very best laws possible are produced. The results of ex post assessment can be fed into these ex ante processes to improve decision making. With some care and a degree of political will, deliberative systems – systems that structure decision-making processes – can be built into the legislative process in relation to serious crime, just as they have been in relation to other areas such as laws that affect business (through processes of regulatory impact assessment).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec6-0004865812470120"><title>What constitutes a deliberative system?</title>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0004865812470120">Dryzek (2009)</xref>, in writing of what is required for a democracy to exist, argues that deliberative capacity is essential. In his view, deliberative capacity is constituted by a political system’s possession of structures that host deliberative processes having three main qualities: they are authentic, inclusive and consequential. The institution of lawmaking (in Australia the legislature), as an empowered space,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-0004865812470120">9</xref></sup> is clearly one of the structures that contributes to the deliberative capacity of a state, or the lack of it, and thus to its democraticness.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-0004865812470120">10</xref></sup></p>
<p>Dryzek’s notion of <italic>authenticity</italic> requires that deliberation, as a form of communication, induces reflection about the preferences that individuals hold and does not permit the imposition of particular views in a coercive fashion. It also connects particular claims to more general principles and enables a true exchange of views (reciprocity). What might this mean for the institution of lawmaking? Authentic deliberation would involve careful thought, research on possible policy options and consideration of how those approaches fit with general community attitudes and liberal traditions, and this deliberation would precede and underpin new laws. The hasty enactment of legislation based on the views of legislators, alone and uninformed, would be excluded by an authenticity requirement. Commands, says <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0004865812470120">Dryzek (2009: 1381)</xref>, are ‘intrinsically anti-deliberative’. Authenticity clearly suggests a process in which alternative views are able to be shared with legislators who in turn can share their views with others.</p>
<p>Thus the idea of authenticity leads on to Dryzek’s second criterion of deliberative capacity, <italic>inclusiveness</italic>. Inclusiveness, writes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0004865812470120">Dryzek (2009: 1382)</xref>, ‘applies to the range of interests and discourses present in a political setting. Without inclusiveness, there may be deliberation but not deliberative democracy’.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0004865812470120">Dagger (2011</xref>: 46), writing from a republican perspective that regards law as a means to attain individual freedom and security, regards criminal lawmaking as an area where public participation is essential:<disp-quote>
<p>Crime, in short, is a threat to a republic insofar as it threatens the rule of law and interferes with the ability to be self-governing. … Crime certainly harms and threatens the persons and property of private individuals, but it also tears at the sentiments that make a sense of common life, under law, possible. Crime is a fitting subject for republican concern, then, because dealing with crime is an important part of the public’s business. For that reason, the public should play a part in passing laws that define what crimes are, that provide for agencies to protect its members from crime, and that establish just procedures for treating those accused of committing crimes, including the proper treatment of those found guilty.</p></disp-quote>Similarly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0004865812470120">Fichera (2011</xref>: 13) argues that decisions about criminal law need to be made in a public forum, following a debate about rights and wrongs, because this is ‘the only way coercion can be reconciled with freedom.’</p>
<p>To say that deliberation by the legislature should be inclusive of the public suggests that there needs to be a way that deliberation in what Dryzek calls ‘public space’ can reach and influence the decision makers in that forum. This process Dryzek terms ‘transmission’ (2009: 1385–1386). He points out that public space features a diversity of viewpoints, and hence it is these that should be transmitted. This does not require the direct involvement of the public in legislative decision making. However it does call for a relationship between empowered and public space and suggests that a number of actors need to be involved in transmission in order for the range of relevant interests to be represented. It also points to the need for empowered space to be accountable to public space (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0004865812470120">Dryzek, 2009: 1386</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-0004865812470120">11</xref></sup> Accountability ensures that collective outcomes are perceived as legitimate. This suggests the need for deliberation to be transparent.</p>
<p>Dryzek’s third characteristic of a democratic deliberative system is that it is <italic>consequential</italic>. He defines this as meaning that ‘deliberative processes must have an impact on collective decisions or social outcomes’ (2009: 1382). It is possible for a system for making policy in an empowered space to involve deliberation (in terms of taking into account a range of voices from public space) but to ultimately have no impact at all on political decision making.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec7-0004865812470120"><title>Assessing Australia’s system against deliberative criteria</title>
<p>In cases where legislation on serious crime is made in a hurry, authentic deliberation is bound to be lacking. The relationship between empowered space and public space is likely to be affected by the perceived crisis and thereby restricted. Those representatives of public space that can affect policy making will generally be few – the tabloid media being the primary one, hardly a trustworthy source for representing a wide range of voices. The other main influence in these circumstances will be the police. Police will often favour expansion of their own powers in situations like these, not because of empire-building but because of greater familiarity with that option than others. Little wonder then that under pressure from the media, politicians will often reach first for solutions that grant greater powers to law enforcement bodies.</p>
<p>However, even in non crisis-driven situations, Australia’s lawmaking system for serious crime could be regarded as lacking in deliberative capacity. In regard to inclusiveness, three avenues (apart from the media) through which transmission of public views may take place can be identified: lobbying of policy makers, parliamentary committee inquiries, and consultation on regulatory impact statements. These are dealt with in turn.</p>
<p>Capacity for lobbying depends, first, on being in possession of appropriate resources to underpin its labour-intensive nature,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-0004865812470120">12</xref></sup> and second, on becoming aware that policy makers in a particular government portfolio are working on an issue of interest. Unlike big business, not many members of the public or community groups have the financial and other resources to engage in sustained lobbying of policy makers for changes in laws. Moreover, direct notice of forthcoming legislation is often given by policy makers only to those known to be interested – stakeholders – and thus is most often the preserve of vested interests. In the context of serious crime laws, easily identified stakeholders are the police and other law enforcement bodies such as customs and regulatory agencies. It is sometimes difficult for policy makers to identify other appropriate parties who should be consulted, particularly in the area of organised crime and terrorism. Yet we know that today, policing is an activity that goes well beyond the public police and involves all sectors of society (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0004865812470120">Ayling et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0004865812470120">Bayley and Shearing, 2001</xref>). Increasingly, the need for private sector involvement to supplement and increase the effectiveness of state policing of serious crime is being recognised at both national and international levels (see, for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0004865812470120">White House, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0004865812470120">UNODC, 2011</xref>). If business was affected by a serious crime law proposal, there would no doubt be both lobbying and consultation. However, more diffuse interests are less likely to lobby and are far less likely to be consulted by policy developers.</p>
<p>A greater breadth of consultation encompassing all significant stakeholders might be possible in the course of a parliamentary committee inquiry into a bill. However, it is not mandatory in every Australian jurisdiction to refer a criminal bill to the committee stage. Moreover, public consultation on a bill can be procedurally limited or completely omitted by government if there is an issue that is particularly contentious or a perceived need to react quickly, as was the case when the NSW government decided to enact its anti-bikie laws following the Zervas murder (the Crimes (Criminal Organisations Control) Act 2009). When consultation does occur, it may be somewhat ad hoc due to the hit-and-miss ability of public advertising to turn up interested parties. Moreover, the time allowed for submissions is often severely constrained, being tied to parliamentary timetables.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-0004865812470120">13</xref></sup></p>
<p>Regulatory impact statements or RISs (also known by other names) are an integral part of an agenda for regulatory reform that began in the mid-1980s in the UK when the predominant Thatcherian mantra was that state regulation was a burden to business (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0004865812470120">Weatherill, 2007</xref>). Despite a change in rhetorical emphasis from ‘less regulation’ to ‘better regulation’ during the late 1990s, the focus has remained on business impacts even as the reform agenda has spread to Europe and around the world. Regulatory impact statements are vehicles for this agenda, being documents required of policy makers to explain and assess the impacts of policy options for dealing with a particular problem. While the primary goal of a regulatory impact statement is to enable more informed decision making (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0004865812470120">Office of Best Practice Regulation, 2010</xref>), an underlying goal of minimising red tape for business enterprises in the name of economic efficiency and growth is observable in Australia, as elsewhere. It can be seen in requirements in several Australian jurisdictions for regulatory impact statements only for legislation that imposes potentially significant costs on business or consumers, or restricts competition. This focus on business impacts can also be observed in the common (but not ubiquitous) exceptions for legislation on criminal matters and police powers. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0004865812470120">Table 1</xref> sets out the author’s analysis of regulatory impact statement requirements in each state of Australia, including relevant exceptions (column 2). Column three of the table notes the requirements for consultations on RISs. The fourth column suggests the extent to which RIS requirements for each jurisdiction would impact upon the making of criminal laws on serious crime in that jurisdiction. With some exceptions, impacts appear to be slight or non-existent.

<p>Without disparaging the important role of lobbying, parliamentary inquiries and regulatory impact statement consultations in bringing clarity and depth to policy development processes, it still seems that the capacity for inclusiveness by current systems of serious crime lawmaking is generally fairly limited. The amount of public input in such laws is likely to vary substantially depending on the particular law and jurisdiction. Sometimes potentially important contributions will not be collected. A more inclusive system would ensure that relevant networks of public actors could make their views known in an ongoing and systematic way.</p>
<p>Are these systems consequential in Dryzekian terms? Let us return to parliamentary committee inquiries into serious crime legislation. This legislation is nearly always presented to the inquiry as a complete bill. A kind of ‘path dependency’ is set up in the lawmaking process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0004865812470120">Van Gestel and Vranken, 2009</xref>) because the bill seems to be a fait accompli, and this is difficult to overcome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0004865812470120">Baldwin, 2005</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn14-0004865812470120">14</xref></sup> Overall, parliamentary committee examination of bills affords little opportunity to consider a legislative scheme holistically and even less opportunity to substantively amend or discard a chosen scheme.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn15-0004865812470120">15</xref></sup></p>
<p>In relation to the impact of laws on social outcomes, the effectiveness of the laws is frequently not the main game anyway. Often that game is the allaying of public anxiety (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0004865812470120">Ericson, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0004865812470120">Garland, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0004865812470120">Weatherburn 2004</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn16-0004865812470120">16</xref></sup> Evidence about what works and does not work in suppression and prevention efforts may be adduced to a committee, but without an opportunity to change the bill in any major way, this is likely to have little effect on the practical social outcomes of the law.</p>
<p>Public consultation is also an aspect of many RIS processes. However, given the extent of exceptions from such processes for criminal laws in many jurisdictions, the impacts of these processes are limited. Where consultations are required, this requirement is often satisfied by consulting with such stakeholders as are chosen by the responsible policy department. The impact of consultation on the assessments of policy options incorporated in RISs dealing with serious crime, in those few jurisdictions that require them, as well as on the final policy choices of relevant decision makers, is a subject that needs further empirical research.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec8-0004865812470120"><title>Practical steps towards deliberative lawmaking</title>
<p>The Parliamentary Joint Committee on the Australian Crime Commission concluded its 2009 report on Legislative Arrangements to Outlaw Serious and Organised Crime with these words (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0004865812470120">PJC-ACC, 2009</xref>: 159): ‘the committee urges that any legislative developments be considered and evidence-based rather than politically driven. Ill-considered legislation risks increasing the problems of Australia’s already piecemeal legislative framework’. Unfortunately these words came at too late a juncture to serve as a timely warning in relation to the spate of anti-association laws that followed and were modelled on South Australia’s Serious and Organised Crime (Control) Act 2008. This legislation has proved in need of major reform after High Court decisions in 2010 and 2011.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn17-0004865812470120">17</xref></sup></p>
<p>Despite criticism of law-making processes and their product in the area of serious crime, little attention has been paid to pragmatic ways to respond to the clear need for a more deliberative system. What might such a system look like? There are several practical steps that could be taken if the political will to do so could be amassed.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn18-0004865812470120">18</xref></sup></p>
<sec id="sec9-0004865812470120"><title>Guides to legislative approaches</title>
<p>The first is the use by policy developers and legislatures of ‘maps’ of, or guides to, possible legislative approaches to the particular problem being addressed. Such guides could clarify the advantages and disadvantages of different legal approaches to serious crime around the world, including reactive, preventive and regulatory approaches. The diversity of crimes involved, the varieties of organising (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0004865812470120">Edwards and Levi, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0004865812470120">Levi and Maguire, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0004865812470120">Vander Beken and Verfaillie, 2010</xref>) and the capacity for harm of different criminal activities could be considered.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn19-0004865812470120">19</xref></sup> This would facilitate a more holistic assessment of how to deal effectively and efficiently with those who commit serious crime, paying due regard to civil liberties issues. It would clarify what works and what does not. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0004865812470120">Robinson (2003)</xref> suggests that the production of policy guides to what works in criminal law is part of the role and obligations of criminologists. Elsewhere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0004865812470120">Ayling, 2011a</xref>) we have begun the development of a map of legislative approaches for serious crime legislation applying to criminal groups such as gangs, organised crime groups and terrorist groups, creating a typology based on the group characteristics used in legislation to open up those groups to disruption and dismantling. The typology is not confined to criminal laws, but covers also the use of civil and administrative laws against criminal organisations. Further work is required to reveal the many practical applications of these legislative responses and their potential (or lack thereof) for successful intervention.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec10-0004865812470120"><title>Impact assessment – the SCLIA</title>
<p>A second practical step that could be taken involves slowing down the law-making process for serious crime by introducing a kind of ex-ante ‘speed bump’ in the form of impact assessment.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn20-0004865812470120">20</xref></sup> One might imagine, for instance, a requirement for policy makers to develop and consult widely on a RIS-type instrument designed specifically for legislation on serious crime, which we will call a Serious Crime Legislation Impact Assessment (SCLIA). Like a regular RIS, a SCLIA would set out the serious crime problem or issues which may give rise to a need for legislation and the desirable objective(s) that would be served in making policy and/or legislation about that problem or those issues. The SCLIA would address all the options for dealing with the problem and achieving the objective. It would ask whether new laws are actually necessary in the light of already existing laws. Options that do not include the making of laws or regulations, and options that involve complementary combinations of policy/regulatory instruments, tailored to particular goals and situations – in other words, ways to regulate ‘smarter’ as well as ‘better’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0004865812470120">Gunningham and Grabosky,1998</xref>) – would be considered.</p>
<p>Each SCLIA would include an assessment of the costs, benefits and risks associated with each of the policy options in relation to each of the different interest holders. In the case of serious crime, these could include the public or community and specific affected sectors of it, and business and government, including law enforcement and other criminal justice institutions (courts and prisons).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn21-0004865812470120">21</xref></sup></p>
<p>The likely effectiveness of the proposed options would also be considered, having regard to both experience in other jurisdictions and community support. The availability of resources for enforcement would be factored in. As the Parliamentary Joint Committee on the Australian Crime Commission commented (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0004865812470120">PJC-ACC, 2009</xref>: 157), ‘legislative tools are only fully effective when law enforcement agencies have the human and technical resources to support them’.</p>
<p>The risk that well-intended public policies may have undesirable unintended consequences has long been recognized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0004865812470120">Grabosky, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0004865812470120">Marx, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0004865812470120">Merton, 1936</xref>). Broader than a RIS, the SCLIA would also assess potential secondary and unintended impacts of the policy options. These would include impacts on the targets of the policy – not only in terms of preventing crime or punishing those targets, but also other less obvious impacts, such as the creation of criminal opportunities.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn22-0004865812470120">22</xref></sup> For example, had a SCLIA been carried out before the South Australian Serious and Organised Crime (Control) Act 2008, it may have brought to light the possibility that anti-association laws could have unintended criminogenic consequences. Issues about potential displacement, the effects of stigmatization on individuals (psychological, criminogenic) and unintended impacts on targeted criminal organisations (such as possible increases in resilience and cohesion: see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0004865812470120">Ayling, 2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0004865812470120">2011b</xref>) could have been worked through.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn23-0004865812470120">23</xref></sup> Potential impacts on innocent third parties such as families of targets may have been given weight.</p>
<p>Assessments of costs, benefits and risks are necessary to bring to light issues about the proportionality of proposed laws to their objectives. Proportionality is a foundational concept in criminal law. However, even where a law is proportional, the question might also be posed: is there a less coercive or less interventionist means of bringing about the same ends? In this regard, consideration might be directed towards the use of non-criminal laws, criminal-civil hybrid solutions and administrative means to achieve the suppression of criminal activity (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0004865812470120">Ayling and Broadhurst, 2012</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec11-0004865812470120"><title>Significant networks registers</title>
<p>In order for impact assessments to meet the challenges of authenticity and inclusiveness, consultations on policy options would need to be conducted early in the process of policy development, before decision makers were even poised to favour a particular option and well before any decision to legislate. Consultations would need to be broad-ranging, with transparency of both processes and outcomes. As an ancillary to the SCLIA process, registers of actor networks of significance to specific serious crime issues could be established so that consultation could become more systematically inclusive. Such registers would be open to any individual or group at no cost. Registers would supplement, not replace, procedures inviting submissions from the public space. The final impact assessment then provided to decision makers would be a comprehensive document, having taken into account a wide range of views.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec12-0004865812470120"><title>Consequential?</title>
<p>That the deliberation embodied in a SCLIA will be consequential cannot of course be guaranteed. For such assessments to have meaning in terms of the final decision (the policy and any implementing legislation), political will is required. In fact, one of the main criticisms of regulatory impact assessment processes more generally is that they are often used to justify preconceived decisions (such as to legislate), rather than in good faith to assist in choosing a course of action. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0004865812470120">Bohne (2009</xref>: 76), for example, comments that ‘ex ante evaluation is merely the continuation of politics with analytical means’, and says it reflects the conflict between formal rationality and political rationality. Political will cannot be manufactured, of course, but the establishment of a more deliberative process that is also fully transparent would make it much more difficult for politicians to ignore the outcomes of that process in favour of their own prejudices or those of powerful lobbyists. It would ensure a degree of accountability which is the key to achieving consequential outcomes.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="sec13-0004865812470120" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0004865812470120">Indermaur and Roberts (2011)</xref> have recently suggested that what is needed in Australia to counter penal populism is a new independent body to review crime policy proposals and bring to bear information about the effectiveness of particular measures from other jurisdictions. While the establishment of a new body is a neat solution, its acceptability in the existing climate of fiscal uncertainty is doubtful. It may be more practical at the moment to introduce rationality through incremental change.</p>
<p>SCLIA is a new take on processes with which policy makers are already familiar, being akin to RIS processes. The emphasis, however, lies not on business impacts but on the effectiveness of proposed laws and the extent to which they serve the public interest. Compared to RIS processes, a more comprehensive assessment of benefits, costs and risks in respect of a wider range of inhabitants of public space is required. This is wholly appropriate, given the importance of serious crime legislation not only to individuals but to how well society itself functions. The familiarity of the processes required by SCLIA should ease the political acceptability of these measures and minimise the need for new institutions. Similarly, the production of maps of potential legislative and non-legislative solutions to particular problems and the development of significant networks registers would require few if any new bureaucratic structures – these could be created either by policy officers in consultation with experts or by groups of experts tasked with that job.</p>
<p>So incremental innovation of the kind proposed here is both feasible and cost effective. It could vastly improve the rationality with which decisions about serious crime law and policy are made in Australia and ensure that more deliberative processes are brought to bear. In the longer term, the formal rationality embodied by these new processes has the potential to both expand and elevate the level of popular and political discourse over serious crime in Australia. As a result, political irrationality under ‘pressure-cooker’ conditions should be reduced. The legitimacy of the resulting legislation should also improve because of the inclusiveness and authenticity of the processes begetting it. Compared to current laws, laws made with these strengthened ex ante processes would have a deeper grounding in evidence and an increased sensitivity to consequences, rendering them less open to criticism. While bad lawmaking in this area is unlikely to be fully eradicated, the prospect of serious crime laws of which we could be proud – responsive, proportionate, well-designed, valid and effective laws – would be well worth the relatively minor efforts required to make deliberative improvements to the current law-making system for serious crime.</p>

These shifts in criminal law, according to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0004865812470120">Hallsworth and Lea (2011)</xref>, are just one part of a burgeoning of securitization processes that are resulting in the emergence of a new state form they term the ‘security state’, a ‘permanent state of exception’ (2011: 151), involving the blurring of war and crime and the hollowing out of civil liberties and due process rights for those on society’s margins. Australian scholars have been similarly critical of the changing nature of criminal law in this country. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0004865812470120">Loughnan (2010: 18)</xref>, referring to New South Wales, notes the recent appearance of ‘a distinctive mode of offence creation and construction’ that has consequences which include ‘the exacerbation of the <italic>ad hoc</italic> and rather incoherent character of the criminal law corpus and the reduction of the social status and communicative power of criminal law’. While these comments concern laws spanning the seriousness spectrum, laws relating to serious crime have attracted the most censure.

Others have criticised recently enacted state laws on organised crime targeted at the ‘bikie problem’ (see e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0004865812470120">Ayling, 2011b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0004865812470120">Cowdery, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0004865812470120">Gray, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0004865812470120">Loughnan, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0004865812470120">Morgan et al., 2010</xref>).</p></fn>

<fn id="fn10-0004865812470120"><label>10</label><p>Dryzek makes clear that in assessing deliberative capacity one must have regard to the whole polity.

However, Dryzek notes that for a system to have a <italic>high</italic> deliberative capacity, both public and empowered spaces need to be authentic and inclusive, and influential in terms of collective decisions (consequential).

<fn id="fn11-0004865812470120"><label>11</label><p>It should be noted that an involvement by non-governmental entities in the processes leading up to lawmaking meshes nicely with a regulatory governance model in which government shares responsibilities with societal actors and ‘steers’ regulation rather than doing all the regulatory ‘rowing’: see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0004865812470120">Osborne and Gaebler, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0004865812470120">Popelier and Verlinden, 2008</xref>. It also fits well with the ‘better regulation’ agenda that has become popular over the last two decades, which regards the participation of business and community groups as part of regulating in ways that are both ‘better’ and ‘smarter’: see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0004865812470120">Gunningham and Grabosky, 1998</xref>.</p></fn>

<fn id="fn16-0004865812470120"><label>16</label><p>This is not to deny that reducing public fear of crime is a social outcome of sorts, in that it can improve quality of life. Much work has been done on fear of crime and its negative impacts. Many scholars argue that fear of crime is a political construct by governments to gain support for their policies (see e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0004865812470120">Mallea, 2010</xref>) or is more broadly socially constructed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0004865812470120">Lee, 2007</xref>). Whether the enactment of legislation itself allays such fears is as yet unanswered. Tough rhetoric and action against crime may generate more fear of crime rather than less (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0004865812470120">Simon, 2007</xref>). Even if legislating does reduce fear of crime, positive effects are likely to be short-lived if the new laws then prove ineffective or invalid.</p></fn>
