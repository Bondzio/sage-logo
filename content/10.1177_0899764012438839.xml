<p>In his book <italic>High Ideals and Noble Intentions</italic>, Peter Elson asks how the voluntary sector in Canada can move beyond the public’s stereotype as a repository of “high ideals and noble intentions” to be regarded by government and citizens as a serious partner and independent actor in its own right. Before arriving at several strategic recommendations, Elson takes the reader on a wide-ranging and readable journey through the history and evolution of the Canadian voluntary sector’s relations with government, beginning in 1600 with its antecedents in the United Kingdom to the present day. Elson presents meticulously researched case studies to expose the issues underlying the three main challenges facing Canadian voluntary organizations: (a) the federal regulatory regime that defines the meaning of charitable purposes, registration eligibility, and related tax benefits; (b) the limits to NGO advocacy in the public interest; and (c) the role of the voluntary sector in providing public services. Elson concludes by identifying seven principles of engagement that the sector must commit to in order to forge a new and constructive relationship with government.</p>
<p>A respected researcher and expert on the Canadian voluntary sector, Elson’s early roots as a practitioner shape the practical questions he poses at the start of his research. “Why,” he wonders, has “the relationship between Canada’s federal government and its voluntary organizations long been weak and/or turbulent?” (p. 1). And when the sector has engaged with government, as was the case during the optimistic years of 2000-2003 when the sector was promised a U.K.-style Compact, he asks why the results of engagement have been so inconsequential and short-term, rarely lasting “beyond the next election and/or a change in the governing party” (p. 1). The sector’s lack of influence and “staying power” is puzzling, since Canada’s nonprofit sector is one of the largest among Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) countries. In Canada, the nonprofit sector constitutes a CDN$86.9 billion industry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0899764012438839">Statistics Canada, 2008</xref>). Elson poses these questions not merely out of academic curiosity or theoretical interest but because of his conviction that “a more sustainable, effective and productive policy relationship between voluntary organizations and governments would benefit all Canadians” (p. 2).</p>
<p>In the first part of the book, Elson explains how the sector’s relationships with government evolved over time and why. Interested in the interaction between history and institutions, Elson uses the framework of historical institutionalism to “identify and verify factors that influence policy development and . . . implementation” (p. 7), and differentiates institutional structures into three categories: formal, nonformal, and informal. He applies this typology to describe the relative institutional structures of the voluntary sector and government at critical junctures in their common history. After developing and analyzing the case studies in chapters 3 to 5, it is Elson’s contention that a more formal voluntary sector institutional regime in Canada could have resulted in more effective representation and more favorable policy outcomes, given that it had to deal with the well-established and formal structures of government.</p>
<p>Chapter 4, aptly named, “Where is the Voice of Canada’s Voluntary Sector?<italic>”</italic> is perhaps the most compelling chapter in the book. In this case study, the author considers the structures and policies that have defined, and in many cases limited, the sector’s capacity to advocate and address systemic injustice and inequality in Canada. As he tells the story, the relationship between charities and Canadian government social policy in the 1960s was “synchronous in many ways and encouraged the development of interdependent partnerships” (p. 60). By the 1970s, the government considered voluntary organizations as legitimate vehicles to help citizens advocate for social rights and to empower communities. During this period, the federal government actively took steps to boost the capacity of the sector by creating a National Advisory Council on Voluntary Action and supporting the creation of the Coalition of National Voluntary Organizations. However, by 1978, the government’s early enthusiasm for collective engagement and citizen participation had waned; some politicians and mainstream media began to refer derisively to nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) as “special interest groups” that were an obstacle to dialogue between citizens and their representatives in government. Efforts by government to undermine the legitimacy of the sector became more frequent and, by the mid-1990s, many NGOs (especially those most critical of government) had been “cut to the core” (p. 88) as part of the government’s deficit-reduction strategy.</p>
<p>Over the years, several initiatives ranging from the government’s Voluntary Sector Initiative to the development by the Joint Accord Table of a <italic>Code of Good Practice on Policy Dialogue</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0899764012438839">2002</xref>), have attempted to revisit the issue of public advocacy by NGOs. Nonetheless, this Code ended up entirely “process-focused,” and the absence of resources for follow-up disappointed many sector leaders and activists. Elson concludes that the sector’s failure to influence policy outcomes is rooted in its nonformal structure and transitory representational arrangement.</p>
<p>Chapter 6 is dedicated to a comparative analysis of the development of the sector in the United Kingdom, focusing on the period when the New Labour government entered into a comprehensive accord (formally known as The Compact) with the voluntary sector. High-level political leadership, supported by substantial resources, led to the signing of the Compact. This accord launched a sustained effort to build the capacity of the sector at both national and local levels through significant and long-term investments in voluntary sector infrastructure, research, and programming. This was the kind of support and partnership that the Canadian sector could only dream about. Elson maintains that the positive outcomes achieved in the United Kingdom were due to the formal, established, and sanctioned institutional structures representing both the government and the sector, respectively.</p>
<p>By this point in the text, however, the author’s thesis feels a little overworked and less than convincing. While Elson finds that the U.K. case demonstrates once again that institutional structures influence policy outcomes, a close analysis of his own case studies reveals that historical institutionalism provides only a partial answer. As he implies elsewhere in the book, ideology often drives policy change. A vivid example of this was Tony Blair’s plan to modernize public services and renew social democracy by allying his party with the voluntary sector, thereby reducing New Labour’s dependence on both unions and the state. In other words, it is not just structures but also differences in objectives and purpose that explain the disappointing policy outcomes in Canada. As Adil Najam has written, the more divergent the objectives between government and the voluntary sector, the greater the likelihood of conflict, and failure to agree on changes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0899764012438839">2000</xref>). Ultimately, it is shortsighted to look at structures only; to answer Elson’s original question about why the sector has not had more influence in policy development, we need also to understand differences in purpose and, ultimately, power. Getting the structures right may go some way to averting outcomes that affect negatively on NGOs and the communities they represent but they are no guarantee.</p>
<p>Elson’s final chapter reaffirms his conviction that “the voluntary sector would benefit from a more formal institutional structure” (pp. 156-157) in its dealing with national government and that this structure must be “broad, consistent and linked to national as well as community organizations” (p. 157). According to Elson, it also needs to be underpinned by solid and shared research, deep stakeholder consultation processes, a clear agenda, and a strong political and media presence.</p>
<p>I recommend this book to a wide audience of scholars, practitioners, and policy makers. While Elson’s focus is the voluntary sector in Canada, his understanding of the complex dynamics that influence government-NGO relations and the important role that national policy has to play, has wide application for decision makers in the public sector, politicians, and NGO leaders. The “seven principles of engagement” with which he concludes the book have value for the voluntary sector not just in Canada but also in many countries around the world, as it strives to move beyond high ideals to greater social justice for all.</p>
