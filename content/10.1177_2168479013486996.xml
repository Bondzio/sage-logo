The topics pertain to DMC roles and responsibilities, membership, training, and communication. DMCs have been monitoring trials using the group sequential design (GSD) for over 30 years. While decisions may be more complicated with novel adaptive designs, the fundamental roles and responsibilities of a DMC will remain the same, namely, to protect patient safety and ensure the scientific integrity of the trial. It will be the DMC’s responsibility to recommend changes to the trial within the scope of a prespecified adaptation plan or decision criteria and not to otherwise recommend changes to the study design except for serious safety-related concerns. Nevertheless, compared with traditional data monitoring, some additional considerations are necessary when convening DMCs for novel adaptive designs. They include the need to identify DMC members who are familiar with adaptive design and to consider possible sponsor involvement in unique situations. The need for additional expertise in DMC members has prompted some researchers to propose alternative DMC models or alternative governance model. These various options and authors’ views on them are expressed in this article.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>data monitoring committees</kwd><kwd>adaptive trials</kwd><kwd>roles and responsibilities</kwd><kwd>membership</kwd><kwd>communication</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="section1-2168479013486996"><title>Introduction</title><p>A data monitoring committee (DMC) is a group of experts who have agreed to protect the scientific and ethical integrity of a clinical trial by monitoring the safety of subjects in the trial and recommending appropriate actions to the trial sponsor. Members serving on these committees are chosen for participation because they have qualifications that make them well suited for providing independent and objective review and recommendations, enhancing the credibility of the trial and its scientific findings.</p><p>The foundation of DMC roles and responsibilities has emerged through the objectives of trials, sponsored by US National Institutes of Health (NIH) in the 1960s, that were designed to examine life-threatening or severe morbidity conditions. Subsequently, the pharmaceutical industry adopted a DMC framework similar to that established for NIH trials. For confirmatory trials to support product approval and marketing authorization, DMCs are typically composed of members independent of the pharmaceutical sponsor and thus at times have been referred to as “IDMCs.” We will refer to such groups simply as DMCs in this paper.</p><p>Adaptive clinical trials are playing an increasingly important role in drug development. The European Medicines Agency finalized a reflection paper on adaptive designs in 2007.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-2168479013486996">1</xref></sup> The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) published its first draft guidelines on adaptive design clinical trials for drugs and biologics in 2010.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-2168479013486996">2</xref></sup> For confirmatory trials, the FDA guideline emphasizes the need to control type 1 error rate and minimize possible operational bias. The draft guideline makes a clear distinction between generally “well-understood adaptive designs” and “less well-understood adaptive designs.” While the final guidance may use a different nomenclature, the current nomenclature suggests a need to address issues associated with data monitoring of trials with novel adaptive designs.</p><p>In this paper, we express our opinions on a range of topics that have emerged recently related to DMCs for adaptive trials. The topics pertain to DMC roles and responsibilities, membership, training, communication, and a recent proposal on a new DMC governance model. We assume that readers are familiar with standard data monitoring processes and conventions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-2168479013486996">3</xref></sup><sup>-</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-2168479013486996">5</xref></sup> We also assume that DMCs are reviewing both safety and efficacy information for a trial, unless stated otherwise.</p></sec><sec id="section2-2168479013486996"><title>Roles and Responsibilities</title><p>Randomized clinical trials with built-in opportunities for design adaptations based on unblinded interim data add a new set of expectations to DMC responsibilities. Ideally, all of the plans for adaptation are engineered with great forethought. The architecture of preplanning presupposes what might be, but even the best laid plans cannot anticipate all that may occur. During the review of an interim analysis, a DMC may not be comfortable in making an adaptation recommendation in the manner that was anticipated, if unenvisioned features of the data confound the original assumptions of the adaptation plan. Any deviations from the plan, however, should be made in a manner that maintains the validity of the adaptive design (see section titled Proactivity of the DMC; apart from its safety responsibilities, a DMC cannot choose to redesign a trial in a manner not accommodated within the prespecified adaptation plan). How a DMC should respond in such challenging situations should be discussed and decided upon in the DMC planning stage.</p><p>In general, the degree of preplanning to be undertaken for an adaptive clinical trial cannot be overstated. This planning should envision what the appropriate actions might be across a broad range of interim outcomes, both expected and unexpected, in order to ensure that the plan is sound and robust and can meet the trial’s ethical and strategic objectives. Thorough planning will lead to the development of a better protocol and companion documents such as the statistical analysis plan and DMC charter. These documents, especially a well-written DMC charter, will have a direct impact on how well the DMC is able to perform its duties while monitoring an adaptive trial. In addition, DMC members with sufficient knowledge of the concept and methods for a particular adaptive design, and with experience in making the relevant decisions, will be better positioned to provide appropriate feedback to the sponsor during the trial based on results of interim analyses.</p><sec id="section3-2168479013486996"><title>Data Monitoring Models</title><p>The most typical data monitoring model adopted for industry-sponsored confirmatory trials is depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-2168479013486996">Figure 1</xref>. In this structure, the roles of different groups are divided into 2 major categories: those who are blinded to the interim analysis results and those who produce and review the interim analysis results.</p><fig id="fig1-2168479013486996" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p>Independent/external model for confirmatory trials with complex adaptive designs.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_2168479013486996-fig1.tif"/></fig><p>Most of the statistical activity takes place within the Independent Statistical Analysis Center (ISAC),<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-2168479013486996">6</xref></sup> sometimes known as the Independent Statistical Center (ISC). The ISAC is typically external to the sponsor in confirmatory trials. The unblinded statistician in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-2168479013486996">Figure 1</xref> is associated with the ISAC and thereby is also independent of the sponsor. This individual is responsible for conducting the interim analyses including running the prespecified computer algorithm and presenting the interim analysis results to the DMC. The unblinded statistician must therefore be intimately familiar with the protocol design, the adaptation plan, the trial analysis plan, and the data collection process. He or she will consult with the sponsor and collaborate closely with the sponsor’s project statistician at the trial planning stage in order to be most thoroughly knowledgeable about the trial to best support the DMC.</p><p>The unblinded statistician has access to the study database through a data management center, through the project statistician, or via an integrated system. The data management center is responsible for collecting, cleaning, and managing the database but remains fully blinded to treatment assignment. This group may reside within the sponsor organization or in an external contract research organization (CRO) or academic institution. Several variants of this model have been seen in regulatory submissions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-2168479013486996">6</xref></sup></p><p>The unblinded statistician may, at the DMC’s discretion, participate in closed sessions to provide clarifications or answer additional questions posed by the DMC as applicable, and this person is bound to the same confidentiality as the members of the DMC with regard to the interim analysis results. The DMC may request additional details or additional analyses (eg, secondary end points, subgroup analyses) from the unblinded statistician as needed.</p><p>Some adaptive designs have very complex decision criteria. These may include decisions that in nonadaptive settings would have been the sponsor’s responsibilities or that may have major commercial implications: for example, dose selection or subpopulation selection. In such cases, the trial sponsor may convene a steering committee that consists of sponsor personnel knowledgeable of the product (but firewalled from the study team) and experts external to the sponsor. The objective of the steering committee is to receive recommendations from the DMC and provide additional input concerning the product and the disease if necessary. The steering committee is responsible for making final decisions and communicating them to the study team. Details regarding the extent of unblinding of the steering committee and the committee’s involvement in the DMC process are described in the section titled Communication Between DMC and Sponsor.</p><p>In exploratory clinical studies not intended to provide definitive evidence of efficacy or to be the basis for product approvals, there may be less motivation for full rigor in restricting knowledge of interim results and lesser regulatory implications (although avoiding operational bias should be an important concern in any trial). An example of a DMC for an exploratory study with a complex adaptive design is given by Shen et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-2168479013486996">7</xref></sup> The full DMC consisted of the core group of 4 sponsor employees (not otherwise involved with the trial) plus 5 external psychiatrists and internists and was scheduled to meet at 4 prespecified interim analyses during the study. The core group’s additional responsibility was to endorse or reject the weekly updates from the design algorithm on the new patient allocation ratios and to advise the study personnel regarding the early stopping recommendations. In exploratory adaptive studies in which the design requires frequent updates based on interim data and adaptations are typically driven by a prespecified algorithm automated through an integrated voice or web response system (IRS), the data monitoring model may be simplified (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-2168479013486996">Figure 2</xref>). The statistical analysis center (SAC) may be internal to the sponsor or external and may even consist of just a single unblinded statistician who is responsible for running the design engine and preparing the interim analysis results and recommendations. Given the need for very rapid data analysis and interim decision making, it may be preferable that recommendations are endorsed by an internal review committee rather than by an external DMC. An internal SAC and DMC are generally acceptable for trials during the exploratory stage of development.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-2168479013486996">8</xref></sup></p><fig id="fig2-2168479013486996" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p>Sponsor-internal model for exploratory studies.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_2168479013486996-fig2.tif"/></fig></sec><sec id="section4-2168479013486996"><title>Proactivity of the DMC</title><p>A question sometimes arises as to how “proactive” a DMC can be in suggesting changes to the trial based on the committee’s review of accruing data. The motivation for the question seems to be that perhaps because of its presumed independence and objectivity, the DMC might be allowed to notice more favorable aspects of the trial data (eg, dose, subgroup, end point) and consider recommending design changes to steer the trial in that direction.</p><p>This type of question reflects a fundamental misunderstanding of adaptive designs. It is precisely because of its access to unblinded data that the DMC is uniquely a party that cannot proactively suggest unplanned changes to the trial’s design. The issue is one of prespecification and is well described in the FDA draft adaptive design guidance,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-2168479013486996">2</xref></sup> which states that a valid adaptive design “includes a prospectively planned opportunity for modification of one or more specified aspects of the study” and that <italic>prospective</italic> “means that the adaptation was planned and details specified before data were examined in an unblinded manner.” It is only through sufficient prespecification, the degree perhaps depending on the nature of the trial aspect that is a candidate for adaptation and the method being used, that potential changes to the trial can be embedded within a rigorous and valid adaptive design plan.</p><p>The DMC is, however, in a natural position to play a role in implementing an adaptation plan that has been thoroughly thought out, planned, and evaluated in advance. The FDA adaptive guidance<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-2168479013486996">2</xref></sup> elegantly summarizes this viewpoint: It indicates that when a DMC is unblinded to interim study results, “it can help implement the adaptation decision according to the prospective adaptation algorithm, but it should not be in a position to otherwise change the study design except for serious safety-related concerns that are the usual responsibility of a DMC.”</p><p>In short, unless an issue arises from a DMC’s ethical responsibilities to ensure patient safety, the DMC should not proactively initiate a change in a trial. Initiating unplanned adaptations should not be viewed as within the scope of DMC responsibilities, and, furthermore, for any party to do this based on access to unblinded data would violate a fundamental tenet of a valid adaptive design.</p></sec></sec><sec id="section5-2168479013486996"><title>Appointment of DMC Members for Adaptive Trials</title><p>The objectives, development stage, and type of adaptive design being implemented in a trial will determine the qualifications, expertise, and experience needed for a particular DMC. Traditionally, DMC members are appointed by the sponsor and/or trial steering committee and are sometimes also selected with input from the investigators. Although the compensation for DMC members comes from the sponsor, the operations of the DMC should remain independent of the sponsor.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-2168479013486996">9</xref></sup> In an adaptive trial, it is important that all DMC members are comfortable with the proposed design and their role in implementation of adaptations. Because of the potential added complexity of issues for DMCs in adaptive trials, we offer the following considerations when establishing a DMC in such trials.</p><sec id="section6-2168479013486996"><title>Qualified Statisticians</title><p>Due to the analytical complexity that may arise when interpreting interim results and making recommendations in an adaptive trial, it is highly desirable that at least 1 statistician with prior DMC experience and a solid understanding of the relevant adaptive trial method be part of the DMC. Trials using a group sequential design typically follow this model, with 1 experienced statistician serving as a member of the DMC. In an adaptive trial, particularly one using a less well-understood adaptive design, it is important to ensure that that the DMC includes a statistical expert with extensive prior knowledge or experience relevant to the adaptation plan and method.</p><p>These considerations could lead to a 2-statistician model: In addition to including a traditional DMC statistician, perhaps one highly experienced in trial monitoring and very familiar with the relevant disease area, the DMC would also include another statistician who is expert in adaptive designs and has primary responsibility for interpreting the behavior of the adaptive algorithm and providing important perspective to the full DMC to help it implement the adaptation decision.</p></sec><sec id="section7-2168479013486996"><title>Other Members of the DMC</title><p>With the exception of statisticians, members serving on a DMC would generally have qualifications similar to those required in traditional trial monitoring; selection of committee members to ensure the representation of relevant expertise would also be similar to that of traditional trial monitoring. A DMC would likely require 1 or more members with clinical expertise in the medical area for which treatments are being studied or in particular adverse events expected to be a point of focus for monitoring. At least some members should have experience serving on DMCs, and this is particularly critical for the chair. To perform their roles ably, members need a sufficient understanding of the adaptive plan being used in the trial; perhaps some advance training can be helpful in this regard.</p></sec><sec id="section8-2168479013486996"><title>Experience and Training</title><p>Throughout this document we have referred to the importance of experience with adaptive clinical trials. While the emergence of these trials is relatively recent, some experience has been gathered. There are an increasing number of statisticians who have both expertise with adaptive methods and experience with monitoring adaptive trials. These statisticians need to be sought out to serve either as members of DMCs or as expert statisticians on ISACs. The experience can be broadened to a wider set of individuals through demonstrations of case studies describing the DMC process that was implemented in completed adaptive trials. This can be done through publications or presentations at conferences and workshops. The FDA can play a significant role here.</p><p>In addition to having a general understanding about adaptive design principles, DMC members need to have full and detailed understanding of the design of the adaptive trial they are monitoring, so that they fully grasp the implications of their recommendations. We recommend that training be made available to all board members prior to the initiation of the trial. Since every adaptive trial should have an adaptive design statistical expert either appointed to the DMC or associated with the SAC, that expert statistician may be well positioned to serve a role in providing this training. Alternatively, the training can be provided by the team responsible for the design of the trial.</p><p>Increasingly, training courses on adaptive designs (and on DMC in general) are being offered at professional meetings organized by nonprofit organizations such as the Drug Information Association and Society for Clinical Trials. Researchers who are interested in serving on DMCs for adaptive trials should consider taking such training courses. Another training opportunity for a researcher is to join a DMC as an observer (ie, a trainee), upon the recommendation of a DMC member and with the agreement of the sponsor. The latter arrangement requires close collaboration between leaders on the subject of DMC/adaptive designs and trial sponsors to increase the available pool of experienced researchers who are qualified to serve on DMCs for adaptive trials.</p></sec></sec><sec id="section9-2168479013486996"><title>Communication</title><p>Proper communication between members of the DMC and other parties with whom they interact—for instance, the statistical staff preparing reports for their review, the study sponsor, the steering committee—is an important issue for any DMC setting. For adaptive designs, the process may be more complex because of the broader scope of potential recommendations. Implementation of adaptations may raise new challenges for interaction among the DMC, sponsor, and other stakeholders. One new concern is that certain changes may convey some knowledge of the interim results, even if the information itself has been strictly controlled. For example, an increased sample size for a study could lead one to infer that an experimental treatment is showing less advantage than expected.</p><p>We believe that the principles are clear and in fact are similar to conventional DMC practice: Unblinded information should be strictly shielded from those with trial management or participation roles; information flow and access should be controlled, documented, and minimized to meet the specific needs of the trial; and the group making recommendations to the sponsor should possess all relevant expertise and experience. The manner in which these principles are applied deserves careful consideration and will vary in different cases based on specific details. In the remainder of this section we consider some of these issues in more detail.</p><sec id="section10-2168479013486996"><title>Communication Between DMC and Sponsor</title><p>Communication between study sponsors and the DMC is a particularly important issue and a particularly sensitive one. At times, sponsor perspective may be relevant to adaptation decisions, perhaps to most fully integrate all relevant knowledge about the treatments in question or to factor in commercial implications associated with different strategies. In such situations, sponsors may be hesitant to accept that certain irrevocable adaptation decisions with major long-term implications are totally in the hands of an external party with no chance for their input or ratification, no matter how expert or well constituted that board might be. From a DMC’s perspective, it is not out of the question that some unexpected aspect of the emerging data might lead them to desire to speak, in confidence, with someone having unique project knowledge and experience within a sponsor organization (this issue may arise in nonadaptive settings as well but perhaps is more likely in adaptive studies given the broader scope of recommendations).</p><p>These can be difficult considerations to reconcile. Advance planning should play an important role in this resolution. As previously described, there should always be extensive advance discussions and scenario planning among the sponsor, DMC, and other parties (eg, trial steering committee, SAC) to make sure there is broad and common understanding of all relevant perspectives. The development of a complex adaptive design is a long and arduous process. The DMC should be brought on board prior to the finalization of the protocol so that the DMC members understand the rationale of the proposed design and can provide input to the design. In addition, the DMC and the sponsor should work together to finalize the DMC charter. Bringing a DMC on board too late in the process is problematic since the DMC may not agree with the proposed adaptations or, more fundamentally, the proposed design overall. This is an important means by which sponsors can provide their perspectives to the DMC in a manner that should not be controversial.</p><p>The FDA Guidance on DMC<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-2168479013486996">4</xref></sup> suggests that interactions between the DMC and the sponsor or steering committee should consist primarily of discussions during “open sessions” of DMC meetings (see section 4.3.1.2). This guidance was published in 2006, before adaptive designs became popular. Our view is that for adaptive designs, there are situations when a DMC may desire to consult with the steering committee that includes a sponsor representative not involved in trial management. The decision on whether the participation of a sponsor representative on the steering committee is appropriate should be made on a case-by-case basis and with prior consultation with the regulators. Details of what unblinded information may be shared with the steering committee, and under what conditions, should also be discussed up front and documented in the charter. In all cases, a guiding principle should be to insulate knowledge of interim results from personnel involved in the design and conduct of the trial.</p><p>The Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America (PhRMA) adaptive design working group described principles by which this issue might be addressed in specific situations.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-2168479013486996">10</xref></sup> The keys are to bring the right perspectives to bear on any adaptation decision and to prevent comparative information from being available to trial personnel and participants. The need for any direct sponsor involvement in data review should be decreased as much as possible by selection of DMC members with expertise and experience in making decisions of all types with which they are charged and by extensive advance planning. Any involvement and access to interim results by the sponsor should have a clear and defensible rationale. This involvement should be limited to the least number of sponsor personnel necessary, who do not have a role in trial management. Strict confidentiality procedures and firewalls should be in place governing all access to unblinded interim data, and documentation should be produced to indicate that those procedures were followed.</p></sec><sec id="section11-2168479013486996"><title>Single Versus Separate Decision Boards</title><p>Questions sometimes arise as to whether adaptive trials should have a single DMC or, in effect, 2 DMCs—that is, one to make more familiar recommendations and the other to address adaptations—because different expertise and experience may be necessary to make different recommendations. There may also be concerns that different decision types can most objectively be evaluated separately and perhaps that conflicts may arise between the different decisions (eg, a preplanned sample size reevaluation algorithm may suggest increasing the number of patients, while another aspect of the data suggests otherwise).</p><p>We see no fundamental reason why either of these models needs to be uniformly enforced or precluded, and details of a situation may argue in favor of one or the other. In general, we view favorably the concept of a single board, with members aggregately possessing any relevant expertise or experience necessary for all of the board’s responsibilities. This is consistent with the principle that DMC members of various disciplines contribute their perspectives to the group’s decisions. Even in traditional settings, DMCs can already be charged with making different types of recommendations—for example, safety monitoring and futility judgments.</p><p>Some may suggest that the potential for conflict between traditional and adaptive recommendations supports the need for separate DMCs. We feel that in such situations, the use of separate committees may just defer conflict resolution to another level, since some person or group will ultimately have to make the decision. Additionally, the potential for such conflict may reflect that the plan was not adequately specified in the first place. Returning to the illustrative case above, which involved a sample size change that conflicted with another aspect of the data, perhaps the possibility of conflict and the joint impact of the 2 aspects could have been factored into the adaptation plan. If so, then potential awkwardness in reconciling the conflict after the fact might have been avoided. Ideally, the adaptation plan should envision what changes would be appropriate and valid based on the totality of all relevant data. Determining the details of the plan should result from extensive discussions of hypothetical scenarios that could be envisioned, generally supported by extensive simulations. We acknowledge that totally unanticipated outcomes could arise that would challenge even the most rigorously developed plans.</p><p>Having 2 boards also raises the possibility of substantial logistical problems: Which board knows what? How do they communicate with each other? Suppose one board disagrees with the other board’s decisions? Moreover, if one board only knows interim safety and the other knows interim efficacy exclusively, neither can make an informed decision based on benefit-risk considerations. The 2 boards may require joint meetings to iron out differences and explain their decisions, but they would then in effect function as a single board. And they will have wasted time and effort getting to that point.</p></sec></sec><sec id="section12-2168479013486996"><title>An Alternate Governance Model Proposal</title><p>The newness and complexity associated with adaptive trials have led some to consider alternate communication and oversight models. One of these includes an additional “level” of governance and communication positioned between a DMC and the study sponsor, such as a committee at a not-for-profit organization that would receive funding from the study sponsor and coordinate DMC activities.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-2168479013486996">11</xref></sup> Although such proposals are still evolving, one version suggests forming an executive committee at the not-for-profit organization, a group possessing a broad view of the development program for a particular therapy, with whom the DMC would communicate its recommendations and seek guidance if needed.</p><p>Under the above model, there would generally be a more flexible degree of communication allowed between the DMC and this committee than is currently in practice between sponsor and DMC. Among the motivations for such a model are cases in which it is alleged that sponsors bypassed DMCs and accessed data directly; another impetus is that the added complexities associated with adaptive trials might lead to a need for the DMC to seek additional input to assist it with carrying out its responsibilities.</p><p>We do not see advantages in broad implementation of such a model, nor do we understand how this would address the perceived problems that led to its proposal. We feel that the model has downsides and could introduce important risks.</p><p>With regard to cases in which study sponsors may have bypassed DMCs, it is already well established that this is inappropriate practice and that a sponsor should not bypass a DMC and make a unilateral decision to access confidential data. This principle should be reinforced by all parties involved in a trial, and it is not clear how the presence of a governance board addresses the problem that has been alluded to in this regard. A comprehensive way to promote procedure compliance in this respect, instilling trial integrity and regulatory trust, is to implement an integrated system that controls access to unblinded data and documents information flow throughout the trial.</p><p>If a motivation is that the nonprofit executive committee possesses some expertise that is expected to be relevant to DMC deliberations, then we would contend that the expertise should already have been represented on the DMC—perhaps the trial might require a larger DMC than would be typical for a nonadaptive trial. We acknowledge that unexpected circumstances can arise that require unanticipated input to DMC deliberations, but there are already mechanisms by which this can be achieved, whether this involves augmenting the DMC with an additional expert or setting up a confidential firewalled communication between the DMC and other individuals. In addition, it is difficult to envision how an executive committee could be identified and established that would have the implied broad knowledge and perspective over a wide range of clinical, statistical, and regulatory issues needed to serve in this role.</p><p>The additional potential layer of communication and the larger set of individuals who would potentially be allowed access to unblinded data are disadvantages of such models. These factors could increase the potential for leakage of information. In addition, just the existence of such an executive committee with whom the DMC might deliberate might undercut the authority of the DMC as the sole party with access to interim results due to the members’ skills and experiences, as well as the motivation to ensure that all types of expertise expected to be relevant are represented on the DMC from the start. This latter point is fundamental to DMC practice; that is, a DMC should be constituted to contain all expertise relevant to carrying out the responsibilities with which it is charged.</p></sec><sec id="section13-2168479013486996"><title>Conclusions</title><p>There is a need for increasing the efficiency of drug development, and introducing flexibility into randomized controlled clinical trials is one means by which this might be addressed. There is increasing experience in successful implementation of adaptive trial approaches, as exemplified in the I-SPY trials<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-2168479013486996">12</xref></sup> in which a new prototype of drug development in oncology is taking place.</p><p>Much experience in the practice of using DMCs to monitor ongoing clinical trials has accumulated in recent decades. While the decision process may be more complicated with novel adaptive designs that are now being considered, the fundamental responsibilities of a DMC to ensure patient safety and protect trial integrity will remain the same. With regard to adaptations, the DMC’s primary responsibility will be to assist in implementation of a prespecified adaptation plan or decision criteria and not to change the study design except for serious safety-related concerns. Nevertheless, compared with traditional data monitoring, some additional considerations are necessary for adaptive designs. They include the following:<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Selection of DMC members qualified to monitor adaptive clinical trials. This is particularly relevant to the role of DMC statistician. It is necessary that the DMC includes at least 1 statistician who has knowledge of and experience with the adaptive trial design and method being used. We discussed several operating models under which this can be accomplished. There may also be a role for training given to DMC members prior to the initiation of an adaptive trial.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Monitoring of trials that have very complex decision criteria which may have major commercial implications, for example, dose or subpopulation selection. We have described the principles that should be followed, have made recommendations on how to best implement decision making in these trials, and have critiqued some recently proposed alternate governance models that were suggested to help address this issue.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Data monitoring of exploratory clinical trials by using a different model if the design requires frequent updates based on interim data. An internal DMC and SAC are acceptable at this stage of development and frequently would be recommended given the need for very rapid decision making.</p></list-item></list></p><p>It is paramount that sponsors ensure the development of well-thought-through designs and adaptation plans and the identification of well-qualified DMCs. It is critical that sponsors, and in fact all trial personnel, follow good adaptive practice principles<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-2168479013486996">13</xref></sup> in conducting adaptive
