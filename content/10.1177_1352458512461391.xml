<title>Background:</title>
<p>Multiple sclerosis (MS) constitutes one of the major diseases that leads to neurological impairment and as a consequence also reduces ability to work.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-1352458512461391">
<title>Objectives:</title>
<p>The purpose of this study was to analyze possible effects on work ability resulting from highly active anti-inflammatory treatment in MS.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-1352458512461391">
<title>Methods:</title>
<p>We analyzed the effects of introducing an anti-inflammatory treatment, natalizumab, in MS, on factors related to work ability. This was done through a comprehensive questionnaire distributed to all patients in Sweden starting on natalizumab treatment between June 2007 and May 2008, identified via the Swedish National MS registry.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1352458512461391">
<title>Results:</title>
<p>MS patients who were receiving sickness benefit and were treated with natalizumab approximately doubled their working ability in relation to their total employment rate. We also documented a significant improvement of their ability to cope with work-related requirements after one year of natalizumab treatment, an improvement which was independent of the previous level of employment. Predictors of a positive effect on work ability were short disease duration, younger age and lower Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) grade at treatment onset.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1352458512461391">
<title>Conclusions:</title>
<p>Our data support the notion that early inflammatory control in MS is essential to preserve a healthy state in MS that counteracts the negative consequences of the disease both at a personal and at a societal level.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The young age of onset makes multiple sclerosis (MS) one of the major causes of reduced ability to work due to neurologic disease in western society. It is thus well documented that MS leads to a significant reduction in both quality of life and work ability.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1352458512461391">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1352458512461391">2</xref></sup> In one Swedish study of a mostly untreated MS population (<italic>n</italic>=307), only one-third (34.5%) of all of those with MS aged 18–64 years were not sick-listed at all. Of all individuals of working age, 31% had a full-time disability pension.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1352458512461391">2</xref></sup> According to another Swedish study, the ability to work in people with MS was about half that of the capacity to work in the general population.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1352458512461391">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1352458512461391">4</xref></sup> Geographical and political factors also have some effect on the availability of suitable jobs for persons with physical or mental limitations.</p>
<p>It is well documented that higher physical disability correlates with an increased rate of sick-listing<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1352458512461391">2</xref></sup> and mental factors such as cognitive capacity and fatigue may also influence work ability.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1352458512461391">5</xref></sup> One of the most important MS-related factors enabling people who are already employed to remain in employment is the stability of the disease.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1352458512461391">6</xref></sup> Several external factors not related to the disease affect ability to work, such as the possibility of sedentary work, flexible working hours and influence on work content.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1352458512461391">7</xref></sup> People with a higher educational level also tend to have a lower risk of becoming sick-listed.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1352458512461391">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1352458512461391">8</xref></sup></p>
<p>The Swedish Multiple Sclerosis Register (SMSreg) is a Swedish Quality Register containing data concerning clinical course, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), laboratory assessments and MS treatment (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.msreg.net">www.msreg.net</ext-link>). About 70% of the Swedish MS population is registered with SMSreg. The data in the register, alongside other data, have been used to conduct studies about the clinical outcome and epidemiology of MS in Sweden.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1352458512461391">9</xref></sup></p>
<p>Natalizumab (Tysabri®) is among the new generation of biological drugs for the treatment of MS. Clinical studies have demonstrated that natalizumab is an effective treatment with respect to preventing relapses and inflammatory activity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1352458512461391">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1352458512461391">11</xref></sup> Moreover, the cost-effectiveness of the treatment has been demonstrated in a previous Swedish study.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1352458512461391">12</xref></sup> We recently showed that there was a net gain of productivity corresponding to approximately €4000 per patient in the first year of natalizumab treatment, calculated on the basis of all patients that belonged to the work force.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1352458512461391">4</xref></sup></p>
<p>Work ability is a central concept for this study and is based on Ilmarinen's theoretical model in which work ability is defined as a person's physical and mental ability in relation to work requirements.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1352458512461391">13</xref></sup> Based on this model we have measured the efficacy of natalizumab treatment on total work ability. As the objective outcome variable we have used the number of hours worked per week of employment. Subjective outcome variables were the patient estimation of perceived physical and mental ability and their perceived fatigue in relation to work requirements. The perception to cope with work-related requirements by the individual patient is believed to reflect the areas that may limit an MS patient's ability to work.</p>

<title>Definitions of terms</title>
<p>Sick leave is defined as temporary absence from gainful employment reimbursed either by the employer (first two weeks of absence due to sickness) or by the state (third week and thereafer), collectively known as sickness benefit and may last for a maximum of 1-2 years. All sickness benefit longer than two weeks is registered by the Swedish Social Insurance Agency (SSIA). For individuals who have a permanent or long-term incapacity for work, a disability pension can be obtained from the SSIA. All these types of benefit are payable at full, three-quarters, half or one-quarter benefit rates, depending on the extent of the reduction of work ability. The regular full-time working week in Sweden is 40 hours and everything less than that is considered part-time. For the calculation of work ability in this study, worked time was defined as the number of hours worked per week as a percentage of the number of hours that constututed the full employment for the individual subject. In <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1352458512461391">Table 2</xref>, different levels of working time are subdivided into “full-time”, “part-time” or “no working time, the worked time was categorized as ‘full-time’, ‘part-time’ or ‘no working time’.</p>

<sec id="section9-1352458512461391">
<title>Recruitment of subjects</title>
<p>Patients were identified through the SMSreg. The sample consisted of all patients who had started treatment with natalizumab during the period June 2007–May 2008, had continued treatment for at least one year and were registered in the SMSreg: in total there were 288 patients. Since registration in the SMSreg is a mandatory part of the Swedish surveillance program for natalizumab treatment, the identified subjects can be considered as a representative sample of MS patients treated with natalizumab in Sweden at that time. The majority of the patients included in this study (88%) were treated with other disease-modifying drugs before starting natalizumab treatment. The study was approved by the regional ethical review board in Umeå as well as the research committee of the SMSreg.</p>
<p>Data about sex, score of Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS), duration of illness and treatment with natalizumab were collected from the register. Data about work ability two weeks before starting treatment with natalizumab and after 12 months of treatment was collected retrospectively through a postal questionnaire using the Work Ability Questionnaire (WAQ) (©Anne Wickström; <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1352458512461391">Table 1</xref>). The questionnaire and two reminders were sent out during 1 September–30 November 2009. Supplementary inquiries by phone were performed in the case of missing or ambiguous responses. In order to ensure that the reported work hours before natalizumab treatment start were not underestimated because of relapse, we also assessed the number of weekly hours worked at a point three months before treatment started. This assessment was done via phone interview one month after receipt of the postal questionnaire. The working hours were the same as two weeks before the start of natalizumab therapy in all except four cases. In these cases, in order to capture mainly the long-term sick leave periods, the values from three month before the treatment start were used.</p>

<title>WAQ</title>
<p>The WAQ is a comprehensive inventory of occupation (employed, unemployed, on parental leave, on sick leave, being a student or retired), the amounts of hours worked per week, sickness absence, a classification of work requirements and, finally, a number of self-rated levels of physical and cognitive abilities in relation to the work requirements and perceived fatigue during the workday (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1352458512461391">Table 1</xref>). The questionnaire was pretested in a pilot study and found to have a high face validity and test-retest reliability. It was also tested in healthy controls to find the cut-off WAQ values corresponding to healthy individuals regarding both work requirements and sufficient work ability.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-1352458512461391">
<title>Statistical analyses</title>
<p>Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS 19. For baseline characteristics, data were analyzed by descriptive statistics (number, percentage, mean, standard deviation (SD)). Changes of variable data before (at baseline) and after one year of natalizumab treatment were analyzed with the paired samples <italic>t</italic> test. Pearson’s correlation was used to analyze the relation between fatigue and other work ability parameters. Linear regression was performed and only correlations that were found to be significant by means of univariate analyses were later subjected to multivariate linear regression analysis. Locally weighted scatterplot smoothing (LOESS) was used to analyze the occurrence of inhomogeneity in the regression line. An α-level of 0.05 was selected for determining statistical significance.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>Information was obtained from 202 respondents (70%) out of the 288 people who were asked to participate in the study. Fifty-six cases were excluded because of unemployment (14 individuals), full-time disability pension (30 individuals) and being students (12). According to our hypothesis, the efficacy of natalizumab could only be evaluated within employment with stable working conditions during the study period of one year. Of the remaining 146 individuals with employment at baseline, 21 individuals were therefore excluded for the following reasons: change of working requirements (12 individuals), parental leave (four individuals), commencement of studies (one individual), loss of unemployment (three individuals) or retirement during the study period (one individual). The analysis of the effects of natalizumab is based on the answers from the remaining 125 respondents. The main characteristics of the investigated population are described in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1352458512461391">Table 2</xref>.</p>

<p>Of the 125 patients included in this study, 61 patients had full or part-time sickness benefit and 64 patients were working full-time at the start of natalizumab treatment. The basic characteristics of these two groups before starting treatment with natalizumab are summarized in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1352458512461391">Table 2</xref>.</p>
<p>We analyzed whether one year of natalizumab treatment affected work ability for the individuals in this study. We divided the patients according to the same principle as in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1352458512461391">Table 1</xref>, which was having sickness benefit to some extent versus not having any sickness benefit at all at the start of natalizumab treatment. In order to give similar weight to each individual regardless of their normal working hours, we expressed the results as a percentage change within their employment rather than absolute hours. The results of this analysis are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1352458512461391">Figure 1</xref>. Individuals with some level of sickness benefit at baseline almost doubled their work amount after one year of natalizumab treatment, from 31% to 60% (<italic>p</italic>&lt;0.001) and decreased their percentage of sickness benefit from 62% to 21% (<italic>p</italic>&lt;0.001; data not shown) while those who worked full-time before the start of natalizumab treatment also stayed in full work ability after one year.</p>

<p>In order to understand if there were certain features that could predict the positive response in work ability from starting natalizumab treatment we performed regression analysis on different disease and work-related factors that could possibly influence the effectiveness of treatment. For this analysis only individuals that had some level of sickness benefit were included since no change in work ability was detected in those who worked full-time at baseline. In the univariate analysis using percentage change within employment as the dependent variable, only age, disease duration and EDSS were significant predictors for that outcome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1352458512461391">Figure 2(A)</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1352458512461391">(C)</xref>). Higher age (<italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup>=12%, <italic>p</italic>=0.006), longer disease duration (<italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup>=11%, <italic>p</italic>=0.01) and higher EDSS (<italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup>=7%, <italic>p</italic>=0.034) all did correlate with a less favorable response to natalizumab measured as improvement in work capacity. Performing LOESS analysis, there was a clear bimodal distribution regarding age and disease duration indicating that these variables had almost all of their impact at ages below 40 years and disease duration less then 10 years, respectively, after which the regression line was virtually horizontal. No significant predictions for the improvement in work ability could be seen for the degree of physical or mental requirements of the work, level of education or gender. Performing multiple regression analysis, including the variables that were significant in the univariate analyses, showed that none of these variables kept their individual significance, indicating a strong interaction between these variables which was expected. The complete model was however highly significant (<italic>p</italic>=0.009) showing that these three variables could explain 18.4% of the improvement in work ability seen after one year of natalizumab treatment in this group of patients (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1352458512461391">Table 3</xref>).</p>

<p>Upper panel shows regression between (A) age, (B) disease duration, (C) Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) and the percentage change in number of hours worked per week in employment. The linear regression shows that these three factors significantly affect the effect of natalizumab treatment on the ability to work. The locally weighted scatterplot smoothing (LOESS) lines show that the impact is highest for young individuals early in the disease course while the EDSS effect is evenly distributed over the whole measured range.</p>
<p>The lower panels, (D)–(F), show that improvement in work-related fatigue strongly correlates with improvement in all other domains of work ability, including actual hours worked at employment (D). Change in perceived physical and mental ability and work-related fatigue was measured using Work Ability Questionnaire (WAQ) mean scores. Each point represents one patient.</p>

<p>Using the WAQ we also measured the effect of natalizumab treatment on perceived physical ability, perceived mental ability and fatigue in relation to the work requirements during the workday. In both of the groups with some level of sickness benefit (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1352458512461391">Figure 3(A)</xref>) and without any sickness benefit (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1352458512461391">Figure 3(B)</xref>) at baseline, all three domains improved significantly after one year of natalizumab treatment (<italic>p</italic>&lt;0.001). Looking at the WAQ scores for these items, it is notable that the mean scores after natalizumab treatment were almost uniformly at the level of ‘sufficient’ (=score 3.0) or higher. Also perceived work-related fatigue improved significantly in both groups after one year of natalizumab treatment (<italic>p</italic>&lt; 0.001; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1352458512461391">Figure 3</xref>) and we wanted to see whether this could be predicted by any disease-related factor. In univariate analyses the variables age and EDSS appeared to be significant predictors for improved fatigue in the group with some level of sickness benefit at baseline. Higher EDSS (<italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup>=12%, <italic>p</italic>=0.006) and higher age (<italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup>=8%, <italic>p</italic>=0.027) did correlate with less effect of natalizumab on perceived fatigue during the working day. The multiple regression analysis showed that these two variables explained 14% of the improvement of perceived fatigue during the working day as a result of natalizumab treatment (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1352458512461391">Table 3</xref>). Finally, there were significant correlations between improved work-related fatigue and improved work ability both measured as number of hours worked at employment and perceived mental and physical ability to cope with work requirements after one year of natalizumab treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1352458512461391">Figure 2(D)</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1352458512461391">(F)</xref>).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In this study we show that treatment with natalizumab may improve working ability in several different aspects. Overall, the amount of working hours per week in relation to present employment was almost doubled in individuals that had some form of sickness benefit, and for those already working full-time their capacity was retained after one year of treatment with natalizumab (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1352458512461391">Figure 1</xref>).</p>
<p>Although the retrospective design of the study may have introduced some recall bias it is unlikely that this can have affected the main results of the study. The actual results in working hours were accompanied by the improvement of several relevant factors that can be linked to work ability which strengthens the validity of the observed improvement in working hours. Furthermore, the almost identical results obtained from the two time points, three months and two weeks, before the start of natalizumab treatment indicate that the reported sick leave levels were long-term rather than temporary and therefore more likely to be remembered correctly.</p>
<p>We believe that there were two major reasons for the observed improvement in work ability observed in this study. Firstly, the inflammatory activity of the disease was attenuated by natalizumab treatment and secondly, different disease-related factors regarding both physical and mental functions were influenced in a positive way after a one-year treatment period with natalizumab. As to disease activity, the majority of the patients started treatment with natalizumab because of insufficient inflammatory control with their previous medication and they experienced, during the following year, no further progression of the disease (data not shown) which is expected from the well-known high efficacy on MS inflammation demonstrated for natalizumab in several studies.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1352458512461391">11</xref></sup> It is reasonable to believe that the perception of disease stability will lead to a higher tendency to engage in long-term strategies for returning to the highest possible working hours. Since increased work-time is synonymous with an improved economy, there is a natural driving force of the system towards the highest possible work level. As to the second factor, this may be an explanation for the improvement in work capacity, as amelioration of important MS symptoms as a result of the treatment is likely to play an important role as well. From our results, key factors appeared to be the relation between the actual requirements of the occupation and the perception of the individual to cope with these specific demands as well as perceived work-related fatigue. It is therefore of practical importance to make inventories of these parameters at an early stage when patients are diagnosed with MS in order to identify risk factors for later sick listing and possibly disability pension which could be dealt with.</p>
<p>An important reason for considering early inflammatory control in MS is highlighted by our results indicating that age and disease duration were the strongest predictors for a positive response on work ability when starting natalizumab treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1352458512461391">Figure 2</xref>). Moreover, it is especially important among young individuals to preserve a high degree of gainful employment, considering the high demands for a firm economic basis that are commonly the rule when planning a family, establishing a home and the like. From a societal point of view an improvement in, or maintenance of, working ability is also profitable. We have previously shown that one year of natalizumab treatment, using the same patient data, did lead to a productivity gain among MS patients with an employment of an average of approximately €4000 per year, and for the subgroup that started natalizumab treatment within 10 years of disease duration this figure was almost double.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1352458512461391">4</xref></sup> There are therefore strong incentives from the point of view of both the individual and society not to withhold the most efficient therapies in the early course of the disease but rather to encourage the initiation of therapy, assuming that there are no particular safety concerns in the individual situation.</p>
<p>We identified several areas of perceived improvement in both physical and mental domains that could be part of the explanation for our findings relating to the improvement in working hours. The individuals participating in the study perceived that they could cope with the physical and mental demands of their work significantly better after one year of natalizumab treatment than before and this factor was positively influenced regardless of whether the individual had sickness benefit before treatment start or not (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1352458512461391">Figure 3</xref>). It is therefore reasonable to assume that even if it was not possible to measure an increase in working hours for those individuals that already worked full-time before the treatment started, the perception of coping better with work-related requirements will make it likely for them to keep their full-time working situation for a longer time. Furthermore, this improvement was paralleled by a decrease in perceived fatigue that also was apparent in both of these groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1352458512461391">Figure 3</xref>) and the improvement in fatigue correlated significantly with improved work ability in all measured domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1352458512461391">Figure 2(D)</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1352458512461391">(F)</xref>).</p>
<p>Previous studies have shown that MS leads to a reduction in work ability which has consequences for both the individual and the society<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1352458512461391">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1352458512461391">14</xref></sup> but these studies have involved mostly untreated populations and the relation between work ability and specific MS treatments is still a largely unexplored area. Similar findings to ours have been reported for the new biological drugs in rheumatoid arthritis (RA)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1352458512461391">15</xref></sup> and it has even been proposed that work ability could be an important outcome measure in clinical trials in RA because of its perceived strong correlation with treatment efficacy and importance in the evaluation of treatment benefit.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1352458512461391">16</xref></sup> We would also like to stress that work ability is likely to be a relevant measure of overall life quality and may serve as a robust measurement of the control of disease activity in MS.</p>
<p>In conclusion, in this study we have demonstrated that individuals with MS that start a highly active anti-inflammatory treatment improve their work ability considerably during the first year of that treatment. The results emphasize not only the importance of early inflammatory control in MS but also that some key questions regarding work-related fatigue and the perception of coping with work-related demands may provide essential information regarding the risk of becoming sick-listed. However, our findings need to be verified in further studies preferably with prospective design and longer follow-up and which are presently ongoing. The issue of work ability is nevertheless an important factor to take into account in the care of people with MS that has a bearing both for the individual and the society.</p>
