<p>Story endings, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1741659011435403">Janet Byars (1991</xref>, p. 20) has noted, ‘call attention to the overlay of narrative and social coding’ embedded in the artefact. Consequently, they can elicit a disruptive moral judgment from their interlocutors. I was reminded of Byars’s invocation as I read the final lines of Michelle Brown’s <italic>The Culture of Punishment</italic> (p. 212):
<disp-quote>
<p>My assessment of punishment and culture has been one that points incessantly and unremittingly at how cultural meanings fail. . . . To point to the fact that when punitiveness takes hold, when discourse hardens into dominant ideology, its grasp, especially in the case of punishment, is difficult to loosen and pain prevails. Simultaneously, however, I take heart in culture – where penal meanings will always be plural and tricky to harness, where dominance will always be susceptible to semiotic subterfuge.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Brown’s normative project is to offer punishment scholars a different ending to the one it seems we are inevitably rushing toward. We must, she argues, ‘change the penal route we have taken’ (p. 7). Rather than the continued mass incarceration of already marginalized groups (p. 199), she asks us to confront our own ‘complicity in the practice of punishment’ (p. 5). She proposes we do so by engaging with ‘penal subjectivity,’ the organizing concept of her text, which refers to the performances of punishment that exist beyond ‘actual punishment’ but nevertheless ‘provide frameworks’ for us to ‘step into or out of self-conscious modes of awareness as moral spectators and deliberative citizens’ (p. 5). Her claim that American citizens ‘access punishment through a cultural remove’ is not altogether novel (see, e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1741659011435403">Bouclin, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1741659011435403">Jarvis, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1741659011435403">Jewkes, 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>What she does contribute, however, to this broader discussion is a description of the more mundane, subtle, and routinized modes and patterns of punishment ‘occurring [in] places that lie outside of the prison-industrial complex’ (p. 4). In short, she grapples with the assemblages and networks of punishment that flow over our contemporary social body. These practices occur within a broader context of acquiesced punishment (through prison tourism, as Brown notes) but also through a broader esthetics of punishment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1741659011435403">Ash, 2010</xref>) as well as shifting social norms around privacy and disclosure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1741659011435403">Simmons, 2007</xref>) which other scholars have addressed. Brown refers to these kinds of practices as ‘the shadow world of moral judgment and penal logics’ we turn to in order to ‘make sense of punishment’ (p. 5).</p>
<p>Several of her seven chapters are case studies devoted to such practices: prison iconography, the prison tour industry, contemporary war prison, and critical criminology. In Chapter 3, she surveys a number of cinematic sites where we experience punishment in a mediated manner. Interestingly she develops a broad definition of prison films which extends beyond a more orthodox definition (films that take place wihtin a prison) to include a range of television programs and films based on the ‘invocation and reliance upon key penal correlates: exclusion, isolation, blame, and the infliction of pain.’ Particularly insightful is her discussion of NBC’s <italic>The Office</italic>, in which she draws parallels between contemporary work culture and prison life: ‘bleak, bland, institutional and institutitionalized, with their failed hierarchies and nonproduction, these spaces remain striking in their basic sociological similarities to spaces of confinement’ (p. 72). The moments of resistance, enacted through satirical transgressions, open a space, she finds, for spectators to contemplate the ‘constraining structures’ of their own lives (p. 73). Chapter 4 critically engages prison tours and distinguishes those that reproduce the prison’s historical function of spectacle from those which can “haunt” spectators into a more critical reflection regarding what punishment means. She points to Eastern State Penitentiary’s jarring art installation and the Inside-Out Prisoner Exchange program which have the potential to transform contemporary penal subjects: tourists leave ‘feeling challenged, disturbed, suddenly and acutely aware.’ She suspects, however, that visitors will uncritically opt for a prison experience that is embedded in the ‘highly sensational discourses’ rather than those which ‘undercut or challenge such assumptions’ (p. 120). Chapter 5, which I discuss below in greater detail, is a thoughtful analysis of penal culture in the global context and especially in the aftemath of the Abu Ghraib scandal. Chapter 6, the least developed chapter, is primarily a descriptive summation of trends in critical criminology and neglects, disappointingly, much critical engagement with shifts in the transformative justice movement. Chapter 7 is devoted to ‘the pursuit and cultivation of a new and more radical’ approaches to punishment (p. 192). One such approach is to “choose to care” rather than to “dominate” our most vulnerable Others.</p>
<p>In many of these chapters, Michelle Brown exhibits her genuine concern over punishment’s implicit and explicit violence as well as a sophisticated understanding of cultural criminology. In so doing, Brown uses law as one of her main tropes. She tackles Guantanamo and Abu Ghraib as sites of a new form of punishment that is ‘increasingly transactional’ and largely defined ‘by how we . . . choose to live’ in light of the “legal ambiguity” constituted through the infamous torture memos. She finds that law’s “secret” is its violence. Yet the memos, though not stated explicitly, are a discursive practice that enact and produce that which they describe and name. Even though they are symbolized in written form, they remain a performative: a ritual constituted through repetition which can never be ‘fully determined’ <italic>a priori</italic> but which occurs nonetheless within structures informing the ‘shape’ of its production (Butler, 2003, p. 13). Rather than show how these structures are in turn informed by a multitude of discursive formations that circulate about and around the practice of torture, she claims instead to ‘expose’ the law as ‘the vague arbiter it is, in the regulation of pain’ (p. 125). Anthropomorphizing aside, this is a goal which she does not achieve. She turns to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1741659011435403">Robert Cover’s (1992)</xref> still trenchant critique that ‘legal interpretation takes place in a field of pain and death’ to support her claim that Abu Ghraib is a lawless place. What Brown neglects is Cover’s equally important contribution to legal theory that every site – including Abu Ghraib – is a normative universe and it is through our daily interactions, our choices, our ways of being within these <italic>nomoi</italic> that we incorporate, reject, refract, and transgress formal legal rules and doctrine. Her framing of “the law” also overlooks one of the key contributions of cultural studies more broadly. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1741659011435403">Paul Kahn (1999)</xref> remarks, the cultural study of law requires that we examine its founding myths, its necessary beliefs, and its internal reasoning. Consequently, in limiting our critical engagement with law as only and always a fixed text, as words on paper, or as an instrument in the hands of those who will do evil, we ignore law’s more powerful aspect: the ‘the imaginative construction’ it reflects and constitutes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1741659011435403">Kahn, 1999</xref>, p. 3). Brown uncritically reinforces a reductive and instrumentalist view of law. Law is, accordingly, reified as state-imposed or judicially enacted and either instantiated in written text or embodied in the actions of conventionally defined legal actors: judges, lawyers, police officers, and security guards. It is something wielded against the poor and against people who are racialized in particular ways by people with social, economic and cultural capital. Law is, as a result, something that exists externally from those “other” constituents – those without power. It is therefore something beyond their grasp. Law can never then be, according to this limited view, a series of processes and knowledges that marginalized groups may themselves also already generate. Law’s <italic>subjects</italic> – those subjected to its force – are thus never reconceptualized as its <italic>agents</italic> – constructing law through their daily interactions. Critical and cultural legal theorists with various ideological and disciplinary commitments (to feminism, critical race theory, empirical research, sociological theories, poststructuralism, and pluralism, to name a few) have long argued that law’s thrust is in how it is <italic>lived</italic> and <italic>performed</italic> and thus favor a less bleak understanding of law: it can be a creative force wielded by all of us and consequently can be transformative. ‘Justice isn’t justice, it is not achieved if it doesn’t have the force to be “enforced”,’ Derrida reminds us (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1741659011435403">1992</xref>, p. 937). Force without justice, he adds, is tyranny. The law of which Brown speaks then, the law and its role in the ‘production of pain’ she seeks to ‘expose’ (p. 140), is not <italic>law</italic> at all. It is tyranny and rather than dismissing law (rules by which we organize how to live together) we must, as she attempts to do, denounce violence. To ‘alter the trajectory of [penal] subjectivity’ (p. 108) as Brown rightly asks us to do, we must also alter our conception of law.</p>
<p>This oversight aside, Brown provides a rich and timely cultural analysis of the cultural conditions under which punishment is constituted. It will, no doubt, be a welcomed addition to reading lists of students and scholars in criminology and cultural studies alike.</p>
