<p>Police officers attending London factory premises in April 2009 discovered a large-scale, well equipped cannabis farm and arrested N., a male of Vietnamese origin who was hiding there. It was apparent that he had contributed to this Class B controlled drug cultivation at the lowest tier of culpability, as a humble ‘gardener’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1365480212474736">1</xref></sup> Several features of this otherwise seemingly routine case complicated the prosecution process, including his age and immigration history. At his initial interview N. claimed to have been born in April 1972 and thus to be aged 37 but he appeared much younger and subsequently changed his account to birth in 1992. He had entered the United Kingdom illegally, apparently at the initiative of his parents who had paid a people smuggler to arrange this in the hope that he would enjoy better life prospects in the UK. He claimed that he had stayed initially with a relative while looking for work and had been quickly recruited to help cultivate the cannabis, not appreciating at the time that this would involve him in a criminal enterprise but believing that he would be assisting in the production of herbal medicine. He worked, ate and slept on site and he claimed that he was unpaid, though £70 was found on him on arrest. The factory windows were bricked up and the single entrance door was kept locked and, by his account, guarded. He said that he had felt too afraid to try to leave, though he acknowledged that he had subtemporarily left for a three day period. He claimed that he had returned following a phone call from his employer/handler because he felt that otherwise his life would be in danger. Following prosecution for being involved in the production of a controlled drug, N. pleaded guilty and incurred a custodial sentence − an 18 month detention and training order.</p>
<sec id="section1-1365480212474736">
<title>Council of Europe Convention</title>
<p>As subsequently became apparent and central to N.’s appeal against conviction, it was a real possibility that N. could have been the victim of trafficking, defined by the Council of Europe Convention (‘the Convention’) on Trafficking in Human Beings 2005 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1365480212474736">Council of Europe, 2005</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1365480212474736">2</xref></sup> and ratified by the UK in December 2008 as:<disp-quote>
<p>… the recruitment, transportation, transfer, harbouring or receipt of persons by means of threat or use of force or other forms of coercion, of abduction, of fraud, of deception, of the abuse of power or a position of vulnerability or of the giving or receiving of payments or benefits to achieve the consent of a person having control over another person, for the purpose of exploitation (Article 4(a)).</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Article 4(a) amplifies that definition by adding: ‘Exploitation shall include at a minimum the exploitation of the prostitution of others or other forms of sexual exploitation, forced labour or services, slavery or practices similar to slavery, servitude …’. Further, Article 10 of the Convention places a positive duty upon Member States to identify and assist victims, with special regard to the protection of trafficked children. Article 10(1) specifies:<disp-quote>
<p>Each Party shall provide its competent authorities with persons who are trained and qualified in preventing and combating trafficking in human beings, in identifying and helping victims, including children, and shall ensure that the different authorities collaborate with each other as well as with relevant support organisations, so that victims can be identified in a procedure duly taking into account the special situation of women and child victims ….</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Recognizing that age may not be readily established, Article 10(3) provides that ‘when the age of the victim is uncertain and there are reasons to believe that the victim is a child, he or she shall be presumed to be a child and shall be accorded special protection measures pending verification of his/her age’.</p>
<p>The Convention applies to trafficking movements <italic>within</italic> a jurisdiction as well as trafficking <italic>across</italic> national frontiers, thus serving to protect those who are nationals of the relevant jurisdiction subjected to intra-territorial trafficking, as well as foreign nationals who experience transnational trafficking. There is also a clear differentiation to be drawn between people <italic>trafficking</italic> and people <italic>smuggling</italic>. N. had certainly been smuggled into the UK but it was less apparent that he had been trafficked. Treating persons as commodities to be exploited commonly involves targeting the vulnerable, including children, and forcing them to work in the sex industry or as toilers in sweat shops or domestic service. As a consequence victims may become unwillingly implicated in criminal conduct, whether prostitution, immigration offences, theft (pick-pocketing being a particular possibility) or drug crime. Anticipating the prospect of double victimization, criminal liability in addition to exploitation, the Convention (in Article 26, entitled ‘Non-punishment provision’) requires a ratifying state:<disp-quote>
<p>… in accordance with the basic principles of its legal system, (to) provide for the possibility of not imposing penalties on victims for their involvement in unlawful activities, to the extent that they have been compelled to do so.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>It will be noted that Article 26 addresses in terms the issue of sentencing, not liability to prosecution. In the latter respect the circumstances of compulsion or coercion may amount to a common law defence of duress by threat,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-1365480212474736">3</xref></sup> that should prompt the prosecutor to opt not to proceed against a trafficked accused person on evidential grounds but that is applied quite restrictively and will not embrace instances of less blatant but nevertheless coercive pressure. In early guidance on human trafficking issues the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) had required prosecutors faced with a ‘credible’ trafficked victim<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-1365480212474736">4</xref></sup> – who appeared convincingly to have committed an offence under coercion short of duress− to consider whether prosecution would be in the public interest. In the case of trafficked young defendants the guidance identified that such children fall within the ambit of child care legislation and are more appropriately dealt with by protective safeguarding if their well-being is at stake.</p>

<title><italic>R v O</italic>.: ‘Shameful Circumstances’</title>
<p>The shortfall between principle and practice in this arena was strikingly illustrated in <italic>R v O</italic>. [2008] EWCA Crim 2835. In February 2008 O. was detained when seeking to leave the UK on a ferry for France in possession of a Spanish identity card in the name of a woman aged 31 to whom she bore no resemblance. Though her command of English was very limited, making communication with her difficult, she admitted in interview that she had sought to travel using a false document and claimed to be aged 22. She stated that she was a Nigerian national who had entered the UK on her own passport but had lost that document when her bag was stolen and so had obtained false ID to enable her to see her uncle in Paris. Though interviewing officers had noted that ‘she appears to be very young and possibly juvenile’, she was charged with an offence of possessing a false identity card with the intention of using it as her own, on the assumption that her stated age was correct. Prior to trial her lawyer was able to establish that she was born in December 1991 (and thus aged 16) and had come to England with her boyfriend to escape from her father, who had threatened to kill her if she did not submit to an arranged marriage in Nigeria to a 63-year-old man with five wives. She understood that work would be available to her when she arrived in the UK so that she could repay her travel debt. Once in the UK she learned that she was expected to work as a prostitute and had run away to avoid this prospect, hoping that her uncle would offer her safe shelter. Her case also came to the attention of the Poppy Project, a charity funded by the Ministry of Justice that supports vulnerable women who have been trafficked into Britain and forced into prostitution. Believing her to be the victim of a sex trafficking organisation, the Project recommended to her solicitor that an adjournment of the proceedings should be sought so that one of its outreach team could visit her in prison (where she had been remanded as an adult) to make an assessment. Notwithstanding these concerns she pleaded guilty at the Crown Court, defence counsel simply asking in mitigation that ‘the inevitable prison sentence be kept to a minimum’. She incurred eight months’ imprisonment.</p>
<p>On O.’s appeal against conviction it was readily apparent that her prosecution and sentence had been flawed on several fronts. By that stage the Poppy Project had undertaken an assessment that indicated she had been brought to the UK by a man who insisted she would have to pay him 60,000 Euros. On arriving she was installed in a flat where she was threatened and raped. She was then told that she would have to work as a prostitute to repay her debt and did so for over a month before she escaped. Though the UK had not yet ratified the Convention it was a signatory to it and was accordingly obliged by Article 18 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties to refrain from acts that would compromise the object and purpose of the Trafficking Convention. Further, the UK has taken some measures expressly to support that purpose, introducing offences of trafficking (see sections 57 and 58 of the Sexual Offences Act 2003 - trafficking into and within the UK for sexual exploitation – and s.4 Asylum and Immigration (Treatment of Claimants) Act 2004 − trafficking people into the UK for exploitation) and incorporating relevant protocols on the prosecution of defendants who might be trafficked victims within the ambit of the <italic>Code for Crown Prosecutors</italic>. Neither the prosecution nor the defence had taken proper steps to appreciate O.’s possible position as a victim of trafficking and as a child or young person.In sum, as the Court of Appeal encapsulated the case:<disp-quote>
<p>The possibility that she might have been trafficked was ignored.There is nothing in the transcript to suggest that any thought had been given to the State’s possible duty to protect her as a young victim. Nobody considered that if she was 17 or less, she should not have been in the Crown Court at all. Counsel for the defence thought it right to refer to ‘an inevitable prison sentence’. The judge passed what she described as an ‘inevitable prison sentence’ of 8 months. If the appellant was 17 or less, a sentence of imprisonment as such was unlawful. For good measure the judge sentenced her without a pre-sentence report.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Allowing the appeal by reference in part to the European Convention on Human Rights Article 6 (right to fair trial), Laws LJ observed:<disp-quote>
<p>… the common law and Article 6… alike require far higher standards of procedural protection than were given here.There was no fair trial. We hope that such a shameful set of circumstances never occurs again.Prosecutors must be aware of the protocols which… are enshrined in their Code. Defence lawyers must respond by making enquiries, if there is before them credible material showing that they have a client who might have been the victim of trafficking, especially a young client.Where there is doubt about the age of a defendant who is a possible victim of trafficking, proper inquiries must be made, indeed statute so required….We hope that this case serves as a lesson to drive these messages home.</p>

<title>Towards a Principled Approach: <italic>R v LM and Others</italic></title>
<p>Though O. served to highlight the plight and scandal of trafficked children, reinforcing the need to take all reasonable steps proactively to identify victims of trafficking, the Court of Appeal subsequently (in <italic>R v N</italic>.) considered that its facts had been ‘too specific for the decision to be treated as providing guidance of general application’ to the approach the courts should take to the exercise of prosecutorial discretion. The opportunity to give generic guidance arose in <italic>R</italic> v <italic>LM and Others</italic> [2010] EWCA Crim 2327 in which the Court of Appeal took the opportunity to consider together three unrelated appeals (by adult appellants) against conviction, each grounded on a claim that Article 26 had not been applied. Two appeals related to false identity documentation while the third (involving three co-defendants) concerned the coercive control in October 2008 of women trafficked for the purposes of prostitution, the co-defendants arguing that they too had been trafficked and compelled to prostitute themselves.</p>
<p>Before addressing the merits of the individual cases the Appeal Court sought to clarify the significance of Article 26. In summary:</p>
<list id="list1-1365480212474736" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Article 26 does not provide blanket immunity from prosecution for trafficked victims, nor does it provide a defence which may be advanced before a jury.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>When a defendant is a trafficked victim and the crime has been committed when he or she was in some manner compelled to commit it, careful consideration must be given to whether public policy calls for a prosecution and punishment.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The application of Article 26 is fact-sensitive in every case. While an exhaustive analysis is thus not feasible, the following general propositions can be asserted:</p>
<list id="list2-1365480212474736" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>If there is evidence on which a defence of duress or necessity is likely to succeed, the case will no doubt not be proceeded with on ordinary evidential grounds independent of the convention (though there are likely to be public policy grounds under the convention leading to the same conclusion).</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The fact that the accused passes the threshold test as a person of whom there are reasonable grounds to believe he or she has been trafficked is not conclusive. Prosecution may nevertheless be justified where this factor has been properly considered and rejected by the Prosecutor on good evidential grounds.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>There is normally no reason not to prosecute, even if the defendant has previously been a trafficked victim, if the alleged offence appears to have been committed outwith any reasonable nexus of compulsion (in the broad sense) occasioned by the trafficking. Such cases do not fall within Article 26.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>If the accused has been a trafficked victim and retains some nexus with the trafficking, but has committed an offence which arguably calls, in the public interest, for prosecution, a more difficult judgment is required.Some cases indicate a cycle of abuse whereby those in charge of trafficking operations turn those who were trafficked and exploited in the past into assistants in the exploitation of others.In such instances the prosecutor has to consider whether or not the offence committed is serious enough, despite any nexus with trafficking, to call for prosecution.‘That will depend on all the circumstances of the case, and normally no doubt particularly on the gravity of the offence alleged, the degree of continuing compulsion, and the alternatives reasonably available to the defendant.’</p></list-item></list></list-item>

<title>Abuse of process safety net</title>
<p>In all criminal proceedings courts in England and Wales have to determine whether a legal process to which a defendant is entitled, or to which s/he has a legitimate expectation, has been neglected to her/his disadvantage. There is thus a procedural safety net, enabling a defendant to seek a stay of prosecution on grounds of abuse of process. This sanction is exercised relatively rarely; a court is not entitled simply to substitute its own view for the prosecutor’s decision regarding the application of relevant public policy in determining that a prosecution is justified. In the context of Article 26, power to stay applies to ensure that the convention obligation under this Article is met. Has the prosecuting authority applied ‘its mind conscientiously to the question of public policy and reached an informed decision’? Has that exercise of judgment been properly carried out and would or might well have resulted in a decision not to prosecute? Has a decision been reached at which no reasonable prosecutor could arrive?</p>
<p>The women appellants −who had been convicted of controlling prostitution − pursued a double-headed approach, arguing that the prosecution had failed to comply with Article 10 as well as Article 26. In respect of Article 10 they claimed that the prosecution should have referred them to an appropriate agency such as the Poppy Project, so that they could be assessed with a view to identification as credible victims of trafficking. Alternatively, they contended that at the least the prosecution should have advised their solicitors of the availability of these referral agencies. The Court of Appeal disagreed. While observing that a breach of Article 10 is certainly to be deplored, that does not, by itself, render a prosecution unlawful or amenable to a stay. In any case, where trafficking is an obvious possibility, the police should enquire into it, as they had in this instance. However, ‘where a defendant has solicitors acting for her, it seems to us that unless there is something unusual about the case the obligation of the police is met by reminding the solicitors of the availability of the identification agencies’.</p>
<p>As regards Article 26 compliance, the prosecution had shown proper regard to the Article in its handling of the case − while the defence were contesting the allegations − having proper regard to relevant CPS guidance. However, matters had changed when the defendants opted to plead guilty but on a particular written basis, namely that there had been no violence, threats or sexual abuse, that they had been trafficked, beaten and coerced into prostitution themselves, and that anything which had amounted to controlling prostitution had been done under pressure, albeit falling short of the defence of duress. The prosecution had accepted these bases of plea. In the Court of Appeal’s view the Article 26 question should have been confronted afresh at this point and, if it had been, ‘there could only have been one conclusion, which was that the prosecution should be abandoned by the offering of no evidence’. The convictions were thus quashed.</p>

<sec id="section5-1365480212474736">
<title>Applying Principle in <italic>R v N</italic>.</title>
<p>In giving the Appeal Court’s judgment in <italic>LM and Others</italic>, Hughes LJ had indicated that the occasions for exercising jurisdiction to stay proceedings ‘ought to be very limited once the provisions of the Convention are generally known’. By the time when N. was arrested (in April 2009) various developments had furthered the fulfilment of state responsibilities arising under the Convention. In particular the National Referral Mechanism (NRM) had been initiated from 1 April 1 2009 as a key framework for identifying victims of human trafficking and ensuring they receive the appropriate protection and support. In summary, referral is initiated by a ‘first responder’ agency, whether governmental or non-governmental, such as the Gangmasters Licensing Authority, a local authority children’s and family services department, a police force, the National Society for the Protection of Children (which operates a national Child Trafficking and Information Line (CTAIL)) or the Poppy Trust. A referral is made to one of two ‘competent authorities’, either the UK Human Trafficking Centre (a multi-agency organization established in October 2006 and led by the Serious Organised Crime Agency) or the UK Border Agency (UKBA). Trained experts within the competent authority will then assess the case and make a decision on whether an individual is a victim of trafficking. It should be noted that referral to a competent authority is voluntary and can happen only if the potential victim gives their permission by signing the referral form.</p>
<p>N. was not the subject of referral under the NRM, the evidence available to the CPS and those representing him indicating that he had been smuggled into the UK as a volunteer and had exercised a degree of choice in taking up the offer of work and accommodation at the cannabis factory. He had broadly reiterated this account when interviewed by a Youth Offending Team worker in preparation for his pre-sentence report, although new light was cast on the circumstances prompting his migration from Vietnam, namely that he had been concerned for his safety because of his father’s involvement in anti-government protest.</p>
<p>Following sentence, N.’s case was taken up by different solicitors and he was referred to CTAIL. That organization’s investigations identified that he had personally participated in anti-government demonstrations in Hanoi, narrowly evading arrest but leaving him and his family in great fear so that arrangements had been made to escape Vietnam. On arrival in London he had felt uncomfortable staying with his relative as this felt like burdensome intrusion and so he had decided he had little choice but to accept the work offered him by a man who he understood was linked with those who had smuggled him from Vietnam. His CTAIL social worker concluded that there were reasonable grounds for considering him to be a victim of international child trafficking, trafficked from Vietnam to the UK for exploitative work at a cannabis farm.On release from custody he was considered at risk of being re-trafficked internally.Further, a clinical psychologist assessed N., establishing that his fearfulness in his home country had in no small part been linked to his father’s torture and death in custody in Vietnam. She considered that he continued to experience post-traumatic stress disorder. CTAIL having initiated the NRM process in respect of N., the UKBA found that he had, on the balance of probabilities, indeed been trafficked.</p>
<p>These developments prompted a belated appeal against conviction on N.’s behalf on grounds of abuse of process, it being argued that he had fallen squarely within the provisions of Article 26 but all concerned had missed the point. The CPS and those representing him should have conducted much fuller investigation into his circumstances. In <italic>R v N</italic>. [2012] EWCA Crim 189 the Court of Appeal in a judgment given by Lord Judge CJ, robustly concluded that:<disp-quote>
<p>… none of the pre-sentence evidence, and none of the fresh material, begins to suggest bad faith or improper motivation on the part of any investigating police officer or the CPS, or even deliberate, or neglectful, or innocent concealment of relevant material from the court, either when the original decision was made that N. should be prosecuted or indeed subsequently.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In contrast to the ‘shambolic’ handling of the case in O., at the date of N’s conviction and sentence ‘it appears that in the light of contemporary understanding of the issues, the forensic decisions were approached in a sensible practical manner’. The decision to prosecute N. on the basis that he was smuggled rather than trafficked could not be impugned.He was not the victim of incompetent legal representation.Further, there was no reason for the trial and sentencing judge to interfere and, in effect, invite either the prosecution or the defence to reconsider its position. A defendant has her/his opportunity to give her/his instructions to her/his legal advisers and it will be:<disp-quote>
<p>… only in the most exceptional cases that the court would consider it appropriate to allow a defendant to advance what in effect would amount to fresh instructions about the facts for the purposes of an appeal against conviction.There is no special category of exceptionality which arises in the context of Article 26.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>N. had appealed long after his conviction and Judge CJ commented that an abuse of process argument in such circumstances:<disp-quote>
<p>… is most unlikely to succeed on the basis that subsequent events show that if the decision to prosecute were to be taken at this later stage, the result might be different from the decision actually taken in the light of contemporary standards and guidance as they existed when it was taken.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Clearly the CPS in this instance had not had the advantage at the time of the UKBA’s subsequent findings. However, Judge CJ observed that even if those findings had been available ‘the CPS would not have been bound by them’. The two agencies exercise different responsibilities and neither can bind the other:<disp-quote>
<p>What is essential is that if at all possible in the relatively constricted timetable, that each should be provided with all the material made available to the other and that both should approach the exercise of their responsibilities on the basis of mutual respect and comity.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>As regards sources of guidance that the prosecution should have regard to, in the Appeal Court’s view:<disp-quote>
<p>… the only publication likely to be relevant to an inquiry into an alleged abuse of process in the context of Convention obligations is the CPS Guidance in force at the time when the relevant decisions were made.It should normally be assumed that the contemporaneous CPS Guidance will have taken account of all the relevant material to be found in all the guidance offered by different authorities with responsibilities in this area, and indeed that it will be updated in the light of any new information.Unless it is to be argued that the CPS Guidance itself is inadequate and open to question because it has failed to keep itself regularly updated in the light of developing knowledge, for the purposes of the court considering an abuse of process for which the prosecutorial authority is responsible, it is the CPS Guidance which should be the starting point, and in the overwhelming majority of cases, the finishing point for any argument of alleged non-compliance with Article 26.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>As regards expert evidence, such as the clinical psychologist’s report on N., the Court expressed ‘great reservations’ about the value of such sources in determining whether there has been abuse of process. Experts’ conclusions are significantly dependent on the subject’s account of events and are likely to have little material bearing on the correctness of the decision to prosecute. ‘We do not anticipate that the CPS would normally be required to seek evidence of the expert nature deployed in N.’s appeal’.</p>
<p>In light of these conclusions N.’s appeal against his conviction was dismissed, leaving only the matter of sentence. The cannabis enterprise to which he had contributed had been on an industrial scale and the Appeal Court considered that an immediate custodial sentence had been appropriate. However, taking account of his age and circumstances, his brief period of involvement in the enterprise and his guilty plea, his term was reduced to four months.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-1365480212474736">5</xref></sup></p>

<title>Concluding Note</title>
<p>Given the abhorrence with which human trafficking is internationally regarded, it is clearly right that the plight of those victimized by this contemporary form of slavery, particularly children, should not be compounded by exposure to criminal sanction for actions which reflect the powerlessness of their predicament. As noted above, policy and procedures have reflected considerable transition and improvement, with important further developments in England and Wales since N.’s arrest in 2009. In pursuit of the UK’s Article 10 commitments under the Convention, the Government has sought to refine its guidance (originally published in 2007) on safeguarding children who may have been trafficked (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1365480212474736">Department for Education/Home Office, 2011</xref>). In line with that guidance the Association of Chief Police Officers has given a specific lead in respect of children ‘recovered’ from cannabis farms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1365480212474736">ACPO, 2010</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-1365480212474736">6</xref></sup> In summary, any child so recovered should be removed to a place of safety (using powers under the Children Act 1989 s.46), so that their welfare needs can be met and an early assessment made regarding whether they have been trafficked.In instances where the age of a recovered person is in doubt −and it is not certain that he or she is a child − they should be given the benefit of the doubt until information to the contrary is available.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-1365480212474736">7</xref></sup> No decision should be taken whether to progress charges until all relevant assessments have been undertaken. Meantime, the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1365480212474736">CPS (2011)</xref> has updated its guidance and sought to reinforce the tenor of care and precaution, adding that ‘the younger a child is the more careful investigators and prosecutors have to be in deciding whether it is right to ask them to become involved in a criminal trial’.</p>
<p>These initiatives are clearly creditable and reflect the shift in the climate of concern since the lamentable approach illustrated in <italic>O</italic>. (above). However, there is not always a reliably ready fit between, on the one hand, painstaking efforts to establish as carefully and definitively as possible the child’s family and social history, including: their migration to the UK from their country of origin and intervening ports of call; their experiences and contacts within the UK and the circumstances in which they became involved with those who may have been coercively using them and, on the other, the pace and momentum required in the interests of criminal justice. A young suspect may have little helpful documentation to assist inquiries, having had passport and papers taken from them or having opted to discard papers that could undermine efforts to remove them because they do not meet immigration criteria. Further, the suspect may be unable or willing to give a clear, prompt, consistent account of their circumstances, for reasons that include: their sense of disorientation or confusion in face of intervention by authorities; their reluctance to cooperate because they are distrustful of agencies in the UK because of their adverse experience of similar agencies in their home jurisdiction; their continuing compliance with coercive instructions from the unscrupulous persons who handled them and may well have coached them in what to say or to withhold; their continuing sense of misguided loyalty to those who exploited them; their fear for the safety of others, particularly their relatives, whether in their country of origin or elsewhere, if they cooperate. Some of these inhibiting elements appear arguably to have featured in the case of N.</p>
<p>It is also worth noting that subjection to gross exploitation in itself does not qualify the accused as a trafficked person. The range and extent of economic exploitation in the labour market is legion and rather more is required amounting to denial of autonomy, thus rendering the subject property used by the exploiter. This was explored in <italic>R v SK</italic> [2011] EWCA 1691, an appeal pursued not by an exploited person but by an appellant convicted of a trafficking offence in respect of a woman who she had recruited from an African country to work as her domestic servant featuring significant drudgery. The Appeal Court identified a descending (and not mutually exclusive) hierarchy of denial of personal autonomy, drawing on <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1365480212474736">Clayton and Tomlinson (2009)</xref>: ‘slavery’ (treating someone as your property); ‘servitude’ (where obligation to the exploiter is enforced by coercion, not involving ownership but less extensive forms of restraint so that it is impossible for the exploited person to change their predicament; ‘force or compulsory labour’, involving the threat of penalty and performed against the will of the exploited person. In the case of <italic>SK</italic> the Court of Appeal concluded that the trial judge had ‘focused too much on the economics of the relationship between the appellant and the complainant, thus diluting the test the jury had to apply to one appropriate to an employment law context but not strong enough to establish guilt of the criminal offence with which the appellant was charged’. Accordingly, the conviction was quashed as unsafe. As <italic>N</italic>. illustrates, in instances of exploitation short of denial of autonomy, the sentencer is required to bear in mind the extent of economic exploitation which should count in mitigation of sentence.</p>

<p>The Convention (Council of Europe Treaty Series No. 197) builds upon other authoritative international measures that seek to combat trafficking. Article 4 of the European Convention on Human Rights specifies that no one shall be held in slavery or servitude or be required to perform forced or compulsory labour (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1365480212474736">Equality and Human Rights Commission, 2012</xref>). Article 31(1) of the 1951 UN Convention and Protocol Relating to the Status of Refugees specifies: The Contracting States shall not impose penalties, on account of their illegal entry or presence, on refugees who, coming directly from a territory where their life or freedom was threatened in the sense of article 1, enter or are present in their territory without authorization, provided they present themselves without delay to the authorities and show good cause for their illegal entry or presence. See also the Protocol (‘The Palermo Protocol’) to Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons Especially Women and Children, supplementing the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime, adopted by General Assembly resolution 55/25 (15 November 2000).See also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1365480212474736">United Nations (2008)</xref>.</p>

<p>As expounded by the Court of Appeal in <italic>R v LM and Others</italic>: Duress is a defence (except to murder and attempted murder) if the offence has been committed as the direct (not indirect) result of a threat of death or serious injury aimed at the defendant or someone sufficiently close to him.But the defence is not established if there was evasive action which the defendant could reasonably be expected to take, including report to the authorities, and nor can it be established if the defendant has voluntarily associated with people in circumstances which amount to laying himself open to the compulsion to commit offences. The separate but allied defence of necessity or ‘duress of circumstances’ is available only where the commission of a crime was necessary or was reasonably believed to be necessary to avoid or prevent death or serious injury where, objectively viewed, commission of the crime was reasonable and proportionate having regard to the evil to be avoided or prevented and the crime would not have been committed without that necessity.</p>

<p>For these purposes CPS guidance indicates 'credible' to mean that the investigating officers have reason to believe that the person has been trafficked.</p>

<p>Another related but unconnected appeal was dealt with in the same judgment, <italic>R v Le</italic>, involving a house part-converted into a cannabis factory enterprise where the appellant, a Vietnamese national had been a ‘gardener’. He claimed consistently that he had been smuggled into the UK where he lost details of whom he was to contact. Having been befriended by two Vietnamese men he had accepted their invitation to work for them, knowing that the crop was cannabis but, by his account, being unaware that this was illegal. Though he claimed on arrest to be aged 15, he was subsequently assessed to be aged 17 at that time.He indicated throughout the prosecution process that he had not been in fear of those he was working for and when arrested he was in possession of a mobile phone and £100. The ‘factory’ had not been locked and barred so as to detain him in conditions amounting to a makeshift prison. He had entered a guilty plea to production of a controlled drug. As the case progressed the court was informed that the UK Border Agency had reason to believe that Le had been trafficked, and the defendant developed his account to suggest some degree of mild pressure or threat against him by his handlers. He opted against changing his plea and the CPS indicated their conclusion that the prosecution remained suitable for sentence, a term of 20 months detention being eventually imposed. Noting the careful way in which the CPS and the judge had considered this case, clearly alert to the trafficking issues, the Court of Appeal concluded that the decision to pursue the prosecution had been ‘amply justified’. The appeal against conviction was dismissed but concluded that a 12 month custodial sentence would better reflect his age, culpability and plea.</p>
