<abstract>
<p>Terrorism involving radioactive materials includes improvised nuclear devices, radiation exposure devices, contamination of food sources, radiation dispersal devices, or an attack on a nuclear power plant or a facility/vehicle that houses radioactive materials. Ionizing radiation removes electrons from atoms and changes the valence of the electrons enabling chemical reactions with elements that normally do not occur. Ionizing radiation includes alpha rays, beta rays, gamma rays, and neutron radiation. The effects of radiation consist of stochastic and deterministic effects. Cancer is the typical example of a stochastic effect of radiation. Deterministic effects include acute radiation syndrome (ARS). The hallmarks of ARS are damage to the skin, gastrointestinal tract, hematopoietic tissue, and in severe cases the neurovascular structures. Radiation produces psychological effects in addition to physiological effects. Radioisotopes relevant to terrorism include titrium, americium 241, cesium 137, cobalt 60, iodine 131, plutonium 238, califormium 252, iridium 192, uranium 235, and strontium 90. Medications used for treating a radiation exposure include antiemetics, colony-stimulating factors, antibiotics, electrolytes, potassium iodine, and chelating agents.</p>

<title>Review of Physics</title>
<p>Atoms are primarily composed of protons, neutrons, and electrons. The protons and neutrons are in the nucleus of the atom. The electrons are in orbits in the shells of the atom. The atomic number refers to the number of protons in an atom. The atomic number defines what element the substance is. For example hydrogen has 1 proton, helium has 2 protons, and lithium has 3 protons. The atomic weight refers to the total number of protons and neutrons. The chemical properties of an element are determined by the atomic number. The number of neutrons for a given element varies. An isotope contains the same number of protons but a different number of neutrons thus a different atomic weight. Regular hydrogen has 1 proton and no neutrons. Deuterium (hydrogen 2) is an isotope of hydrogen that contains 1 proton and 1 neutron. Tritium (hydrogen 3) is an isotope of hydrogen and has 1 proton and 2 neutrons. When an atom lacks the right balance of neutrons and protons it is radioactive. Nuclear fission occurs when the nucleus splits into smaller parts and releases particles and energy. Fission occurs artificially within a nuclear reactor or naturally from nuclear decay. A smaller nucleus is produced and the atom is converted to a new element. The new atoms produced by fission are called the daughters.</p>
<p>Radiation is energy that travels from a source through material or space.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0897190012474238">6</xref>
</sup> Radiation can be described as ionizing and nonionizing radiation.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0897190012474238">7</xref>
</sup> Nonionizing radiation is radiation that possesses enough energy to cause the atoms to vibrate or move atoms within a molecule but not enough energy to remove electrons.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0897190012474238">7</xref>
</sup> Examples of nonionizing radiation are light, heat, ultraviolet, microwaves, and radio waves. Ionizing radiation removes electrons from atoms. This changes the valence of the electrons enabling chemical reactions with elements that normally do not occur. The 4 types of ionizing radiation are alpha radiation, beta radiation, gamma radiation, and neutron radiation.</p>
<p>Alpha radiation consists of particles of 2 protons with 2 neutrons.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0897190012474238">8</xref>
</sup> This is equivalent to the nucleus of a helium atom. Alpha particles tend to be produced when the ratio of neutrons to protons in the nucleus is too low. Alpha radiation is not very penetrating and is stopped by a piece of paper or the skin. Exposure to external alpha radiation is only a low health risk. Alpha radiation is dangerous if alpha emitters are absorbed or inhaled by the body. Alpha emitters include americium 241, plutonium 236, uranium 238, thorium 232, radium 226, radon 222, and polonium 210.</p>
<p>Beta radiation consists of electrons. Beta radiation has some penetration and can pass through the skin or thin clothing.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0897190012474238">9</xref>
</sup> Plastic typically stops beta radiation. Beta radiation is produced when the ratio of neutrons to protons is too high. One of the neutrons converts to a proton and electron. The electron is then released from the nucleus as a beta particle.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0897190012474238">9</xref>
</sup> Higher doses of beta radiation cause damage to the basal layer of the skin. Examples of beta emitters include tritium, cobalt 60, strontium 90, technetium 99, iodine 129, iodine 131, and cesium 137.</p>
<p>Gamma radiation is similar to x-rays.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0897190012474238">10</xref> </sup>Gamma radiation is generated when the nucleus of the atom possesses too much energy. Gamma rays are released during nuclear fission. X-rays are produced by shifts in the electrons among their shells whereas gamma rays are produced from the nucleus. In the past, gamma rays and x-rays were distinguished by wavelength but an overlap exists within the range of x-rays and gamma rays. X-rays and gamma rays are now distinguished by their source in the atom. Gamma radiation is very penetrating and only dense material (eg, lead) stops gamma radiation. The release of a beta particle from the nucleus is often followed by a release of gamma rays. In other words, most but not all beta emitters are also gamma emitters. Examples of gamma emitters include cobalt 60, zinc 65, cesium 137, and radium 226. The Geiger Muller is used for detecting beta and gamma radiation (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0897190012474238">Figure 1</xref>).</p>
<p>Neutron radiation is also very penetrating and requires several feet of concrete to stop. Neutron radiation occurs mainly during nuclear fission and is rarely seen outside of the nuclear reactor. Nuclear radiation can be generated by bombarding beryllium with alpha particles. For example, mixing americium 241 with beryllium produces neutron radiation.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0897190012474238">11</xref> </sup>Neutrons lack a charge and are not directly ionizing but still cause serious damage. As the neutrons move through material they collide with nuclei which possess a positive charge. The nuclei then move around and collide with molecules. The nuclei ionize the atoms of these molecules.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0897190012474238">12</xref>
</sup> Neutron radiation causes 2 to 20 times the tissue damage of gamma radiation.</p>
<p>The physical half-life is the time interval for the radioactive material to decay to half its original value. The physical half-life is not to be confused with the pharmacokinetic or biological half-life. The effective half-life is the time interval required for the radioactivity of a certain amount of radioactive substance distributed in tissues and organs to decrease to half its original value due to radioactive decay and biological elimination. The determination of effective half-life considers both the physical half-life and the pharmacokinetic half-life of the material.</p>

<p>Different types of ionizing radiation may cause more tissue damage than others. This is adjusted for with a quality factor (QF). The QF converts RAD to roentgen equivalent man (rem). For example, alpha particles cause much more damage than beta particles. The QF for gamma and beta radiation is 1. The QF factor for alpha rays is 20. Neutron radiation QF factor ranges between 3 and 20 depending on the type of neutron radiation. For most practical applications the rad and rem are equivalent.</p>
<p>The average natural radioactivity in the body is 40 millirems per year. The annual exposure to cosmic radiation if living at sea level is 24 millirems per year. A standard chest x-ray is 4 millirems.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0897190012474238">13</xref>
</sup> The exposure limits for the general public is 0.1 rem (100 millirems) per year.<sup>

<title>Types of Threats</title>
<p>Radiological related terrorism includes an attack on a nuclear power plant, a concealed radiation exposure device (RED), contamination of food sources, an attack on a facility or vehicle having radioisotopes, dispersal of radioisotopes in a concentrated population area, or the use of an improvised nuclear device. An improvised nuclear device would involve a nuclear reaction with a fission or fusion of atoms. A fission device is only practical for uranium 235, uranium 233, and plutonium 239.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0897190012474238">17</xref>
</sup> A fusion device utilizes deuterium and tritium to form heavier elements.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0897190012474238">17</xref> </sup>Fortunately, numerous engineering hurdles need to be overcome to construct an improvised nuclear device. An improvised nuclear device creates thermal and blast injuries in addition to the radiation. The shock wave from a detonation can rupture of the eardrum or produce intrathoracic injuries. The blast winds result in flying debris physically striking individuals and causing a variety of trauma.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0897190012474238">17</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>A more likely scenario is the use of a radiological dispersal device (RDD).<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0897190012474238">18</xref>
</sup> A common example of a RDD is a dirty bomb. A dirty bomb combines radionucleotides with conventional explosives. The idea behind a dirty bomb is creating an explosion that will spread the radioactive material.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0897190012474238">19</xref> </sup>Many CBRNE experts consider a “dirty bomb” more of a “weapon of mass disruption” rather than a weapon of mass destruction.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0897190012474238">20</xref> </sup>The damage from a dirty bomb will likely produce no more fatalities or injuries than a conventional bomb. The biggest danger is the fear created in the public. A radiation dispersal device is not limited to dirty bombs. A number of methods could be used to disperse radioisotopes such as a release from an airplane.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0897190012474238">20</xref> </sup>A RDD is unlikely to cause massive fatalities. It would cause mass disruption (eg, environmental contamination, economic consequences, psychological reactions, etc) rather than mass destruction. Potential radioisotopes used in a RDD include americium 241, californium 252, cesium 137, cobalt 60, iridium 192, plutonium 238, polonium 210, radium 226, and strontium 90.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0897190012474238">19</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>A RED is a hidden sealed radiation source.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0897190012474238">21</xref>
</sup> The goal of a RED is to expose people to ionizing radiation without their knowledge.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0897190012474238">21</xref>
</sup> An example of a RED would be a brief case with radioactive material placed on a passenger train and left there. Another example is taping a radioactive source under a seat at a movie theater or a sports stadium.</p>

<title>Notable Radiological and Nuclear Incidents</title>
<p>On August 6, 1945, the first atomic bomb, made from uranium 235, was dropped on Hiroshima, Japan.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0897190012474238">22</xref>
</sup> Approximately 90% of the city was destroyed. An estimated 45 000 people died the first day out of a population of 250 000. Another 19 000 died over the following months.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0897190012474238">22</xref>
</sup> Three days later, a plutonium-based bomb was dropped on Nagasaki.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0897190012474238">22</xref>
</sup> An estimated 22 000 people died out of a population of 174 000. In the next 4 months, another 17 000 people died. Most of the deaths resulted from the explosion rather than the radiation. A secondary source of radiation exposure may have been neutron bombardment reacting with iron producing radioactive iron.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0897190012474238">22</xref>
</sup> At least 400 people died from cancers over the next 30 years. Cesium 137 was found in the soil and farm products years after the attacks. The atomic bomb was a key factor leading to the end of World War II.</p>
<p>On March 28, 1979, an accident happened at the Three Mile Island nuclear power plant.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0897190012474238">23</xref>
</sup> No injuries or deaths occurred, but is still the worst nuclear power accident in US history. The cooling system for the reactor malfunctioned resulting in the core overheating. Eventually the core of one of the reactors partially melted. Most of the radiation was contained but small amounts of radiation were released into the environment. An estimated 2 million people in the area were exposed to 1 millirem. <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0897190012474238">23</xref>
</sup> A typical chest x-ray delivers approximately 4 millirems of radiation. Several regulatory changes were made to the nuclear power industry as a result of the accident.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0897190012474238">23</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>In 1985, a private radiotherapy institute located in Goiania, Brazil moved to a new site. The organization left behind a cesium 137 teletherapy unit. The institute failed to notify the licensing authority as required by law. The building was partially demolished and left unsecured. Two individuals seeking valuable scrap metal removed the source assembly from the machine not knowing the material was radioactive.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0897190012474238">24</xref>
</sup> They took the device home and attempted to dismantle it and during the process the capsule containing the cesium 137 chloride was ruptured. The device and the cesium were sold to a junk dealer. The dealer noticed the material glowed in the dark and was fascinated. The dealer shared the cesium with family and friends and later the community. Over the next 5 days individuals started showing gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms from radiation exposure. One individual linked the symptoms to the material and alerted authorities. The material was identified as cesium 137. Several sites of significant contamination were identified and the residents evacuated. A stadium was set up as a triage area for identification of victims. Twenty victims required hospital treatment.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0897190012474238">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0897190012474238">25</xref>
</sup> Many of the patients were administered Prussian blue to enhance the excretion of the cesium 137.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0897190012474238">25</xref>
</sup> Colony-stimulating factors were used in some cases.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0897190012474238">25</xref>
</sup> Four individuals died within the first month. Autopsies revealed hemorrhagic and septic complications consistent with radiation exposure.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0897190012474238">25</xref> </sup>Two of the fatalities were due to <italic>Klebsiella</italic> sepsis.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0897190012474238">25</xref>
</sup> The number of contaminated individuals was 249.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0897190012474238">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0897190012474238">25</xref>
</sup> However, 112 000 individuals eventually showed at the stadium for evaluation. In other words, over 111 000 people, who were not exposed, sought out an evaluation. Environmental contamination was a major issue and 85 homes were found to be contaminated with cesium 137. Over 700 workers participated in the response.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0897190012474238">24</xref>
</sup> The Goiania incident was the worst accident with radioactive material not involving a nuclear power plant or an atomic bomb.</p>
<p>In 1986, an accident occurred at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant in the Ukraine.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0897190012474238">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0897190012474238">27</xref>
</sup> The root cause of the accident was a flawed design and inadequate training of workers. A power surge caused a steam explosion rupturing the reactor. Two workers died the night of the accident and another 28 people died within a few weeks from acute radiation syndrome (ARS). Another 134 people developed ARS but survived. The accident is the largest uncontrolled release of radiation by a civilian organization in the world. Large amounts of iodine 131, cesium 134, and cesium-137 were released from the plant. The radiological half-life of iodine 131 is 8 days, cesium 134 is 2 years, and cesium 137 is 30 years. Lighter radioactive material was carried by wind to Russia, Ukraine, and Belarus. Small amounts of radioactive material were found in Europe. Approximately 200 000 individuals were involved in the recovery and cleanup operations.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0897190012474238">27</xref>
</sup> In the years following the accident, approximately 220 000 people were resettled to less contaminated areas. The only documented long-term public health impact was an increase in the rates of thyroid cancer.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0897190012474238">26</xref>
</sup> However, an increase in cataracts may have occurred in individuals recovering from ARS.<sup>

<title>Biological Effects of Radiation</title>
<p>Ionizing radiation causes atoms to lose electrons. These atoms then react with other atoms that would not normally occur. The ionized atoms react with sensitive areas of the cell such as the DNA.

<title>Exposure Versus Contamination</title>
<p>Exposure results when the patient is exposed to a radiation source such as gamma rays. The person may or may not have tissue damage based on the dose. The patient does not become radioactive from the exposure. Health caregivers are not at risk of radiation exposure from treating the patient.</p>
<p>Contamination means the person has radioactive isotopes on the skin or within the body. External contamination refers to the presence of radioisotopes on the skin, hair, or clothing. External contamination is treated by removal of clothing and washing the patient. Internal contamination involves the inhalation, absorption, or ingestion of radioisotopes. Internal contamination, depending on the element and the dose, may need to be treated with pharmaceuticals to increase the excretion of the material.</p>

<title>Acute Radiation Syndrome</title>
<sec id="section8-0897190012474238">
<title>Pathophysiology</title>
<p>The clinical presentation that appears after radiation exposure is termed ARS.<sup>

</sup> This syndrome consists of hematopoietic, GI, and neurovascular subsyndromes. Each subsyndrome can be divided into 4 stages prodromal, latent, manifest illness, and recovery.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0897190012474238">34</xref>
</sup> ARS is most likely to be caused by gamma or neutron radiation.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0897190012474238">36</xref>
</sup> ARS will only be caused by beta particles or alpha particles if an emitter is absorbed or ingested by the body.<sup>

</sup> A dose of 1 Gy of radiation in most individuals would produce ARS.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0897190012474238">36</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>A radiation dose of approximately 1 to 8 Gy of radiation would produce damage to the hematopoietic tissue in the bone barrow. The hematopoietic is seen within 2 weeks of significant exposure of 1.0 to 2.5 Gy. Prodromal symptoms include nausea, vomiting, anorexia, and diarrhea. The latent period lasted approximately 3 weeks where fatigue and weakness will be present. The manifest illness phase includes pancytopenia. Severe bleeding is a complication from platelet loss. Infections result from a loss in white blood cells. The lymphocytes are affected the earliest. The red blood cells are the last to be affected by radiation. Patients with coexisting burns or wounds have decreased wound healing and an increased chance of infection because of the myelosuppression.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0897190012474238">36</xref>
</sup> Patients receiving 2 to 6 Gy of radiation are the most responsive to treatment.</p>
<p>The GI subsyndrome appears within a week or 2 after exposure to higher doses. The underlying pathology is the destruction of the crypt cells in the epithelial lining of the intestine.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0897190012474238">34</xref>
</sup> A radiation dose of 5 to 20 Gy would produce the GI subsyndrome in addition to the hematopoietic manifestations.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0897190012474238">36</xref> </sup>The prodromal stage involves severe nausea, vomiting, watery diarrhea, and cramps occurring within hours after radiation exposure. A asymptomatic latent period of 5 to 7 days follows.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0897190012474238">34</xref>
</sup> Thereafter, the manifest illness begins with vomiting, severe diarrhea, and fever. Damage to the intestinal lining allows for entry of intestinal flora into the blood. Excessive fluid loss and imbalance of electrolytes follows. Complications from the GI subsyndrome include malnutrition, paralytic ileus, acute renal failure, cardiovascular collapse, sepsis, and anemia.<sup>

<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0897190012474238">36</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>Higher doses of radiation are needed to produce the neurovascular subsyndrome, which consists of irreversible damage to the central nervous system (CNS).<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0897190012474238">34</xref>
</sup> A radiation dose of 20 to 30 Gy produces the neurovascular subsyndrome. Cardiovascular shock occurs at such doses. The condition progresses to edema, increased intracranial pressure, and cerebral anoxia. A burning sensation appears almost immediately after exposure. The stages of the neurovascular subsyndrome are shorter than the other subsyndromes. Nausea and vomiting happen within an hour. The latent period lasts only a few hours. The manifest illness follows within 5 to 6 hours after exposure and includes severe watery diarrhea, respiratory distress, and numerous CNS abnormalities. CNS signs include ataxia, confusion, and convulsions. Death can result within 2 days. The underlying pathology of the neurovascular subsyndrome is destruction of microcirculation. A massive release of histamine may also contribute to the pathology.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0897190012474238">34</xref>

<sec id="section9-0897190012474238">
<title>Assessment and General Treatment Considerations</title>
<p>Any life-threatening injuries are addressed first. The next consideration is whether the patient is contaminated or just exposed. A patient only exposed to radiation does not produce a risk to rescuers or clinicians. A patient contaminated with radionucleotides needs to be decontaminated after the necessary lifesaving procedures has been done. An ingestion or absorption of radionucleotides requires specific treatment to enhance the elimination of the radioisotope.</p>
<p>The timing of the onset of nausea and vomiting needs to be considered because it is a rough estimate of the degree of radiation exposure. Nausea and vomiting within 1 to 2 hours after exposure indicates a massive radiation dose. A drop in lymphocyte count to one-half or one-third of baseline values within 24 hours indicates a life-threatening exposure.</p>
<p>Ondansetron (Zofran®; GlaxoSmithKline, Research Triangle Park, North Carolina) and granisetron (Kytril®; Roche Pharmaceuticals, Nutley, New Jersey) are used to treat nausea and vomiting. Neutropenia occurs and an absolute neutrophil count below 100 is the greatest risk of infection. The current recommendations for neutropenic fever by the Infectious Disease Society of America should be followed. Colony-stimulating factors such as filgrastim (Neupogen®; Amgen, Thousand Oaks, California), a granulocyte colony-stimulating factor, and its long-acting pegylated form can be used to aid in neutrophil recovery. Sargramostim (Leukine®; Genzyme, Cambridge, Massachusetts), a granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor can also be used to shorten the recovery time of neutropenia. Ideally, the start of colony-stimulating factors should be within 24 to 72 hours after exposure. Daily injections should be continued daily until the absolute neutrophil count is above 1000. Patients with ARS should be in isolation rooms. Avoid H<sub>2</sub> blockers, antacids, and proton pump inhibitors to maintain gastric acidity. Sucralfate may be used. <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0897190012474238">36</xref>

<title>Internally Deposited Radioisotopes</title>
<p>Internal contamination occurs when a radioisotope is swallowed, inhaled, or enters via a wound. Internal contamination could result from exposure to a radiation dispersal device or downwind from a nuclear power plant accident. Contamination of food or water sources can cause internal contamination. Treatment is aimed at reducing the absorption or enhancing the elimination of the radioisotope. Another technique is blocking uptake to the organ of interest. There are over 8000 radioactive isotopes.
