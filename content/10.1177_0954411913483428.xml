<abstract>
<p>The amount of pressure exerted on the syringe and the depth of needle insertion are the two key factors for successfully carrying out epidural procedure. The force feedback from the syringe plunger is helpful in judging the loss of pressure, and the depth of the needle insertion is crucial in identifying when the needle is precisely placed in the epidural space. This article presents the development of two novel wireless devices to measure these parameters to precisely guide the needle placement in the epidural space. These techniques can be directly used on patients or implemented in a simulator for improving the safety of procedure. A pilot trial has been conducted to collect depth and pressure data with the devices on a porcine cadaver. These measurements are then combined to accurately configure a haptic device for creating a realistic in vitro experience of epidural needle insertion.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Epidural is commonly used as a form of pain relief during childbirth, for the treatment of chronic back pain or as a means to provide anaesthesia or analgesia during specific operations. The procedure consists of a long Tuohy needle being carefully inserted in the lumbar spine through layers of skin, tissue and ligament into the epidural space. Monitoring pressure and the needle depth during an epidural insertion is crucial because it indicates when the needle is placed precisely into the epidural space. If the needle is advanced too far, it will puncture the dural sac and cause leakage of cerebrospinal fluid. Post-dural puncture headaches may result and can be extremely disabling for the patient. Other risks include bleeding or nerve damage, which may rarely lead to paralysis. If the needle is not within the epidural space, the pain relief may be ineffective or inadequate due to improper placement of the catheter. Data from the Royal College of Anaesthetists revealed that permanent harm from epidurals ranged from 3.1 to 6.1 in 100,000 per year,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0954411913483428">1</xref></sup> and a recent review of claims handled by the National Health Service Litigation Authority (NHSLA) between 1995 and 2007 reported that 366 of 841 cases (44%) were related to regional anaesthesia, and of these, half arose in the obstetric setting.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0954411913483428">2</xref></sup> This highlights not only the potential morbidity from epidurals but also the substantial cost burden to the national health services.</p>
<p>The procedure of inserting an epidural needle requires great skill and prolonged training and can be challenging even for experienced anaesthetists. The operator is required to perceive an anatomical image of the bony alignments and the various tissue layers the needle tip is passing through by feeling the resistances on the needle from skin, through to subcutaneous fat, supraspinous and interspinous ligaments, ligamentum flavum and then to the epidural space as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0954411913483428">Figure 1</xref>. Epidural needle insertion is essentially a ‘blind’ procedure but utilises a well-known technique referred to as ‘loss of resistance’ (LOR). LOR essentially involves identification of the epidural space by the loss of pressure as the epidural needle travels through the various ligaments and potential spaces of the lumbar vertebral column.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0954411913483428">3</xref></sup> There are many risks involved with the epidural procedure due to its complexity. Since the actual insertion is ‘blind’ and the end-point cannot be visualised, the anaesthetist has only his/her perception from sensing and feeling of the needle resistance through the force stimuli in the fingertips and joints. There can be errors of judgement as to the location of the needle, exacerbated by individual patient characteristics of height, weight and body shape. To improve the safety of the procedure, interspinous pressure as well as depth of needle insertion could be monitored electronically without interfering with the procedure for the loss of pressure and for the depth of needle (to a predetermined value taken from ultrasound scanning or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)).</p>

<p>Basic epidural simulators were introduced in 1980 and have been further developed since then. Recently, computer-based simulators have enabled graphic visualisation of the needle as it travels along the tissues. Mediseus<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0954411913483428">5</xref></sup> and Episim<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0954411913483428">6</xref></sup> are examples of such simulators, which were made commercially available, consisting of a haptic feedback connected to a laptop with graphic display. However, one of the weaknesses of Mediseus simulator highlighted in subsequent reports<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0954411913483428">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0954411913483428">8</xref></sup> was the lack of measured data for force feedback.</p>
<p>This article presents the design of a sterile pressure measurement device, which captures the resultant pressures as the epidural needle is advanced through the tissue layers, and a novel image processing technique, which measures the insertion depth of the needle in real time and transmits data wirelessly. The device has been tested on a fresh porcine specimen by experienced anaesthetists and the results are presented. Our preliminary porcine trial results were presented in the study by Vaughan et al.;<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0954411913483428">9</xref></sup> however, this work provides details of the wireless devices and introduces the idea of image processing for length measurement. This also includes configuration of a haptic device based on measured data and the results of force feedback. The graphs describing the path of the needle through to the epidural space are used to recreate a realistic in vitro experience of needle insertion. This could be potentially used to monitor epidural administration in the actual clinical procedure to reduce the risks of failure or to improve the safety of the procedure by providing training with accurately configured epidural simulators. This will help reduce morbidity and risks to patients.</p>

<title>Pressure measuring system design</title>
<p>Our study is the first to use a wireless set-up for interspinous pressure measurement, which uses entirely sterile components. A wireless data transmitter is utilised to minimise the equipment and disruption in the labour room. This uses XBee™ Pro 60 mW with a printed circuit board (PCB) antenna at 2.4 GHz frequency and 250 kbps data transfer rate that allows a maximum of 100 m outdoor range. A computer receives the data remotely with a wireless receiver and displays a real-time graph on screen and simultaneously records the data to a file. The advantage of using a wireless transmitter is that the equipment is not only less cumbersome but also much less intrusive.</p>
<p>In obstetric practice, the LOR technique is performed with a saline-filled syringe connected directly onto the Tuohy needle,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0954411913483428">10</xref></sup> which maintains the plunger pressure until needle reaches the epidural space. Our design aims to minimise changes to this standard set-up. A small standard sterile three-way tap (BD Connecta™) is connected between the needle and syringe (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0954411913483428">Figure 2</xref>). The tap is connected to the pressure transducer via a 1 m length of saline-filled sterile manometer tubing. The transducer’s electrical plug is connected by a short electrical cable to the wireless transmitter box, which measures only 12 cm × 5 cm × 3 cm. At the remote site, a wireless receiver is connected via Universal Serial Bus (USB) to the computer. Our custom-designed software displays a real-time graph on screen and writes the data to a text file for later analysis; data retrieval speed can be varied in the software. The transmission range tested inside the hospital building was large enough to cover the labour ward with numerous rooms and corridors. The receiver equipment is set up in a filing room located at the other end of the labour ward to avoid disruption. Despite several walls, the transmission was very reliable and no data loss was encountered.</p>

</fig>
<p>When the anaesthetist presses on the syringe plunger, the saline inside the syringe is pressurised. The pressure waves propagate through the three-way tap, the manometer tubing and then into the disposable transducer. The transducer converts this pressure into an electrical signal of 0–20 mV, which is sent to the transmitter box. The box contains a 5 V power supply for the transducer, an amplifier that converts the signal into 0–5 V and a transmitter to relay the signal. The UTAH Medical Deltran disposable transducer is used as a pressure measurement device, supplied by Kimal Plc (London, UK). These transducers are commonly used in hospitals to monitor systemic blood pressure and central venous pressure. Transducers produce an electrical signal based on the pressure of the liquid inside the manometer tubing. These disposable transducers are designed to have an accuracy of ±3%. In a study of accuracy of 100 disposable pressure transducers, it was found that ‘even the worst-case transducers were twice as accurate as required by the American National Standards Institute standard, the average output was 100.03 ± 0.55 mmHg, with the worst cases being 98.53 and 101.36 when 100 mmHg was applied.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0954411913483428">11</xref></sup> Standard sterile medical devices such as the disposable transducers, manometer tubing and three-way tap allow a sterile set-up for each patient. All these come packaged in a standard transducer set. The sensor signals were amplified 220 times using LM741 OP AMP integrated circuit, which produces a more usable signal in the range of 0–5 V direct current (DC). The circuitry and components fit neatly inside a small plastic box along with the 5 V battery. A Kimal monitor interface cable (female type) provides an easy interface for new transducers to plug into each time.</p>
<p>The sensor device was calibrated by applying known weights to the plunger of the syringe. The saline-filled syringe was held vertically in place on a vice, and weights were placed on the plunger at 50 g intervals from 0 g up to 1.2 kg. The electrical outputs were recorded after amplification. It was found that voltage increased steadily up to 5 V with 1.2 kg mass, showing a linear relationship between mass and the amplified transducer voltage output. The repeatability and linearity of the device were ensured by conducting several tests under loading and unloading conditions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0954411913483428">9</xref></sup></p>
<p>Pressure can be converted into various units; in the current implementation, the pressure is measured in mmHg or kPa. This directly provides actual pressure measurement of saline inside the needle as applied to the continuum. From the known diameter of the plunger, force applied to the plunger can be obtained. The electrical data signal goes through a series of binary conversions before arriving at the software as a pressure–time graph. The graph shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0954411913483428">Figure 3</xref> is a typical plot obtained from a needle insertion in our porcine trial, described in section ‘Pilot trial for pressure measurement’. The software output shows only for a 20-s time window but the initial pressure is the same as the end pressure (not seen in this plot). Since different layers have different stiffness, the plot shows step changes but this is also due to the step increase in the wireless data display, although more data arrive so there is an option to interpolate the data for later analysis. The resulting pressure–time graph clearly shows when the needle entered the epidural space and the resulting LOR as a sudden drop of pressure on the graph.</p>

<title>Non-contact needle depth measurement</title>
<p>The reason why needle depth is important is that it describes the depths at which each force occurred from the pressure transducer. This can provide information about the change of ligaments or thickness of different layers. During the epidural insertion procedure, the needle is slowly pushed through layers of tissue into the epidural space, which is usually between 40 and 80 mm deep. It is useful to accurately know the needle depth because it can indicate when the epidural space has been reached for different patients. This can be accurately estimated from some non-invasive measurements such as ultrasound scanning or MRI for precise needle placement in the actual procedure. We have developed an image processing algorithm to measure the needle depth in real time during insertion.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0954411913483428">12</xref></sup> The implemented technique uses a single wireless camera to transmit depth data remotely to a host computer. When length and pressure data are combined, this describes which pressure occurred at which depth. The combined data can be used in the actual surgical procedure to accurately guide the needle travel or can be used to accurately configure an epidural simulator for a patient-specific training experience.</p>
<p>The 16-gauge Portex Tuohy needle of 80 mm length (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0954411913483428">Figure 4</xref>) is the most common epidural needle used in hospitals. The needle has brown and silver markings on the metallic shaft at 10 mm intervals, which are used by the software as a reference length. The blue handle is the plastic part at the base, which is held by the operator. This is used for colour detection in the current implementation. There are several problems with needle detection that make measurement hard to accomplish: (1) the needle is a thin object with small width of only a few pixels; (2) the needle is a reflective stainless steel material that reflects colours from nearby objects, light sources and shadows; (3) the needle is circular in cross section with different colours all around, the top is often illuminated while the underside is often shadowed; (4) there are camera noise and blur from the wireless camera; (5) tilting the needle up/down causes colour change with only a small tilt of the needle; (6) tilting towards/away from the camera causes the visible length to decrease, which may be confused with reduced length due to insertion; (7) the needle is not the only object in the foreground, due to the operator’s hands and the patient’s back; (8) lighting conditions vary from room to room; (9) there is no time to configure the camera each time, due to the short notice given when an epidural is going to be performed and the anaesthetist cannot wait because the patient is often in pain and (10) the length is not fixed but changes dynamically as needle is inserted. Solutions to these problems could involve controlling the environment with the use of fixed backgrounds, controlled light sources or restricting the movement. These precautions may not be feasible since they interfere with the operator’s procedure and may not be ethically permissible.</p>

<p>To start the measurement, a wireless camera is placed in the operating theatre between 500 and 1000 mm away from the needle insertion, which transmits to a computer located elsewhere in the hospital. The camera transmits a 640 × 480 pixel image in full colour over a 20 MHz wireless link. The flow chart in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0954411913483428">Figure 5</xref> shows the main processing steps of the image processing algorithms as implemented for depth measurement and are explained as follows.</p>

<title>Background calibration</title>
<p>Automatic calibration lasting for 10 s is necessary, which allows the algorithm to adjust to a new background. There is often short notice and urgency to administer epidurals swiftly as the patient is often in pain or requiring urgent treatment. Calibration solves issues caused by using various rooms with different lighting conditions for epidurals. To achieve background calibration, which works on any cluttered environments, the camera runs for 10 s with no objects in the foreground. During this time, two HSV (where HSV is hue, saturation and value) images, which represents the gradation of colour within the visible spectrum of light, are created: the minimum HSV and maximum HSV values for each pixel. These two images make up a background model. The two images are stored and used later enabling the background to be removed, identifying the foreground objects. To ensure the reliability of the algorithms, movement in the small area of image or changes in lighting during calibration and the procedure itself are kept to a minimum to avoid false detections.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0954411913483428">
<title>Colour calibration</title>
<p>Automatic colour calibration is done once for each new room due to changes in lighting. The blue handle is held in front of the camera and the HSV value of the blue handle is recorded. A threshold value is applied when detecting the blue handle to allow for changes in lighting. The blue handle threshold is defined as a three-dimensional (3D) distance within HSV colour space (see equation (1)).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0954411913483428">
<title>HSV image conversion</title>
<p>A new image is loaded from the camera and converted from red, green and blue (RGB) into HSV online in the software. This is a standard procedure and mathematical relationship is readily available for this conversion.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0954411913483428">13</xref></sup></p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-0954411913483428">
<title>Colour thresholding</title>
<p>Foreground objects are identified by removing the background. This is done by comparing HSV values from every pixel in each image to the minimum HSV background values and the maximum HSV background values. If HSV is outside of the minimum–maximum range, then pixel is part of an object in the foreground. Co-ordinates of the areas containing objects are stored in an array, and the rest of the algorithm is applied only to areas containing objects.</p>

<sec id="section8-0954411913483428">
<title>Blue handle detection</title>
<p>The blue handle is found by scanning pixels within foreground objects for RGB values, which match the blue handle. A match is determined by a pixel being within the defined threshold from the recorded blue handle RGB value. To achieve accurate colour comparison, the blue handle threshold is defined as a 3D distance in the RGB colour space based on the Euclidean distance given by equation (1)</p>

Colour1 is set to the analysed mean colour of the blue handle, which can optionally be updated by the user at run time by clicking on the blue handle pixels. Colour2 is the colour of each pixel in the image, which is being compared to colour1. This equation gives the 3D distance, equating to a spherical region in 3D colour space. Geometrically, this gives a uniform comparison because a sphere has no extreme corner colours and the limits are all equivalent distance away from the central colour. If more or less variation is allowable in one dimension, a prolate or oblate spheroid can be used by a ratio to initial RGB values such as 0.4:0.4:0.2 before applying equation (1).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0954411913483428">14</xref></sup> The centre point of the blue handle is found by taking an average of the <italic>x</italic> and <italic>y</italic> locations of all blue pixels and is stored for object tracking.

<title>Needle rotation on the transverse plane</title>
<p>Rotation of the needle in the transverse plane is frequently used to adjust between midline and paramedian insertions. This causes tilting the needle towards/away from camera, changing the visible length of the needle, which can appear similar to reduced needle length due to insertion. These two cases can be differentiated by the silver and brown markings. If all markings are present, the length change was caused by rotation in the transverse plane. The angle of rotation can be calculated by equation (4)</p>

<title>RGB intensity profile</title>
<p>After metal shaft detection a thin line of the needle image remains. For each column in the line, an average RGB value is taken. This average is used to create four separate intensity profiles for R, G, B and for the total intensity along the length of the metallic needle shaft (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0954411913483428">Figure 7</xref>). The intensity profiles identify sudden changes in colour, caused by the boundaries between 10 mm markings. Intensity profiles make the markings more detectable under reflective conditions. Intensity profiles are less affected by changes in lighting because separate intensity profiles are created for R, G and B to make use of whichever colour is showing the markings most clearly at that time. Occasionally, individual pixels of noise in the camera may cause false detections, and these could be subsequently reduced by a longer calibration.</p>

If the final marking is only partially visible, the partial length is calculated by comparing it to a full marking using equation (5)</p>

<title>Pilot trial for pressure measurement</title>
<p>A porcine trial was conducted on a section of a cadaver for measurement of syringe pressure during insertion. The pig is claimed to be the most representative animal model for human spinal research. Porcine vertebrae can be a representative model when testing instrumentation techniques.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0954411913483428">15</xref></sup> The porcine tissue specimen was a double loin saddle cut. The cadaver was obtained from a livestock farm within 24 h of slaughter without being frozen or modified in any way after slaughter to preserve the integrity of the spinal tissues. The pig was a standard hybrid Large White Cross Saddleback. The specimen contained the entire back in one piece, with the whole spine, and all tissue layers from external skin through to the thoracic cavity. The porcine tissue was mounted vertically against a wooden support to mimic sitting position, resting upon, but not attached onto, a desk beneath as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-0954411913483428">Figure 8</xref>. The wooden support was fixed in place so that the cadaver would not move when pressure was applied during insertion. As time progresses, the back muscles develop rigor mortis, which occurs due to the cross-linking of muscle fibres. It is not known whether or not this had affected the experiment. Internal ligaments such as <italic>ligamentum flavum</italic> and interspinous ligament should remain unaffected due to their differing composition, and their interior position avoids contact with the external environment.</p>

</fig>
<p>The camera and transmitter were set up 1 m away from the site, which mainly focused on the needle part; therefore, needle patterns are easily discernible against the background. A saline drip bag was connected by tubing and flushed to fill the pressure transducer system. The vertical position of the transducer was compensated for the elevation difference between the transducer and the insertion point throughout to cancel any gravitational effect on the pressure readings. Epidural insertions were performed by two experienced anaesthetists. The epidural insertion point was located at L2/3 or L3/4 intervertebral levels, and a Portex 16-gauge Tuohy needle (Smiths Medical International Ltd, Kent, UK) was used following the midline approach.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0954411913483428">16</xref></sup> Subsequently, a number of different vertebral levels ranging from T12 to L5 were targeted. We measured the tissue thickness at L2/3 intervertebral level and assumed that the thickness of tissue layers does not vary much between these vertebral levels and averaged out the measured pressure to produce the data in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0954411913483428">Table 1</xref>. The porcine spine was palpated to locate anatomical landmarks prior to insertion. As is the standard procedure, the Tuohy needle with its introducer stylet was penetrated into the skin, before the syringe and transducer system were attached. The recordings of pressure were then started and continuously recorded throughout needle insertion until after the LOR had been experienced. The majority of insertions located the epidural space in the first attempt. Data from hitting bone were recorded to analyse the effect on pressure. In some cases, the number of attempts to find the space was greater than three. Those recordings were abandoned as per our study protocol, which also covers the obstetric patient trial to reduce the risk of accidental dural taps. The highest pressures were obtained when the Tuohy needle hit bone. In total, 17 epidural needle insertions were performed on the porcine tissue. No more than five epidurals were attempted at a single vertebral level. The trial ceased at this point because it was decided that the presence of previous insertion attempts may begin to interfere with further readings. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-0954411913483428">Figure 9</xref> shows six representative graphs of insertion into the porcine cadaver for force estimation in each tissue layer, the corresponding data are presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0954411913483428">Table 1</xref>. Although this is not the required goal for epidurals, the anaesthetists performed dural taps in porcine by inserting the needle beyond the epidural space, which cut into the dura. The device recorded an increase in pressure, which allowed to capture the data for producing appropriate feedback in the simulator (see lower left graph in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-0954411913483428">Figure 9</xref>). <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0954411913483428">Table 2</xref> shows the mean value of the data collected and the standard deviation from this trial.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0954411913483428">17</xref></sup> This data compared quite well with similar previous studies.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0954411913483428">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0954411913483428">19</xref></sup> To follow on from the porcine trial, a further trial with obstetric patients has begun after obtaining ethical approval from the National Research Ethics Service in the United Kingdom.</p>

<p>The column for insertion force in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0954411913483428">Table 1</xref> was converted from the fluid pressure over the area of the syringe barrel. This force is the total reaction force caused by the operator pushing the plunger with thumb for the needle to traverse the layer that includes cutting tip force, friction and tissue stiffness. Epidural space is quoted as 0 N as this is the potential space where LOR is encountered on the plunger, and once the needle touches the dura, subsequent force starts to build up again. These measurements are processed by the microcontroller, which has a resolution of 10 bits thus giving 1024 possible values for the pressure range, which equates to a force resolution of 15 mN.</p>

<title>Needle depth measurement trial</title>
<p>The image processing algorithm was tested during insertions. The needle was successfully detected and the depth was measured accurately in most frames. The developed software was used to draw a graph of the length in real time and write the length data to a file. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10-0954411913483428">Figure 10</xref> shows length–time graph during an insertion in which the needle was slowly advanced and then rapidly withdrawn. The maximum error in all trial runs was found to be within 3 mm when the needle was 500 mm from the camera. The error of 3 mm was the worst-case scenario, and usually the error was smaller than this. The video recordings allow certain frames to be reviewed afterwards to verify the identified depths. This accuracy was high enough to ensure close approximation of depth in the majority of the frames. The particular graph is chosen to show some erroneous readings at about 3–4 s, which was due to camera noise when the needle shaft was not detected properly, but all other frames were successfully measured and verified by the actual measurement. Such errors can be rectified in the software from the continuity of the graph or by ignoring sudden jumps in the data,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0954411913483428">20</xref></sup> just shown here to represent the extreme measurement shortfall. The total insertion took about 15 s with 10 frames/s. The failure rate was 3 frames out of 150, which gave an overall 97.8% reliability during this insertion.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0954411913483428">12</xref></sup> The graph currently displays length but this can be converted from length to needle depth by simply subtracting the value from 80 mm, which is the total length of the needle.</p>

<p>The distance between needle and camera can be varied between 500 and 1000 mm. At distances over 150 cm, the reliability dropped, this could be improved with a higher resolution camera. The needle can be tilted upwards or downwards to ±30 without any effect. Tilting towards or away from the camera does not affect measurement as long as the brown and silver markings are clearly visible because marking length differentiates between length reductions caused by tilt and caused by insertion. Failures occurred on some frames, due to blur in the image, or at certain angles where markings became merged.</p>

<title>Configuration of a haptic device on the measured data</title>

Haptic devices have been used in epidural simulators previously,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0954411913483428">23</xref></sup> although measured data were not incorporated, making it hard to assess the accuracy of the feedback forces.</p>
<p>A 3-degrees-of-freedom (DOFs) Novint Falcon™ haptic device was set up to move the needle in 3D and provides force feedback to the user during insertion.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0954411913483428">24</xref></sup> As the haptic stylus is moved, the needle moves on the screen, and the depth of the needle tip indicates which tissue layer is being penetrated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11-0954411913483428">Figure 11</xref>).</p>

</fig>
<p>The interaction forces have been approximated to the resultant force obtained during the trial representing the force generated by the haptic device. To apply different forces to each layer, 3D vector regions were defined within the graphics model. As the needle tip enters these regions, the software identifies which tissue layer the needle is in, based on the depth data. The software uses a look-up table (LUT) to find the appropriate force for each layer and interpolates the data to generate the force in the haptic device. The use of LUTs to find the appropriate force for each layer to generate force in the haptic device has been previously attempted as well.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0954411913483428">25</xref></sup></p>
<p>The graph in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12-0954411913483428">Figure 12</xref> shows the discrete forces applied by operator’s thumb and the reaction forces generated by the haptic device. The reaction forces represent the resultant force on the syringe, which is the sum of all resistances to insertion that are equal and opposite to the applied force. For example, if a particular layer has insertion force of 4.3 N, and the user is pressing with only 3.2 N, then the haptic device exerts 3.2 N, so the stylus remains stationary. Only if the user increases the force to over 4.3 N, the stylus will move forward.</p>

<p>In this article, pressure and depth measuring devices have been presented. The data for pressure and depth were successfully captured during epidural insertions. The maximum pressure and depth measurements do match closely with the results from previous related studies. The results confirm correct functioning of our devices and the ability of this set-up to be further used to take measurements from epidural administration in obstetric patients.</p>
<p>For each needle insertion, a graph was produced. The anaesthetists’ feedback was that porcine tissue did feel like a close approximation to human tissue, and the shape of the graphs was similar to graphs previously reported from human insertions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0954411913483428">19</xref></sup> In most cases, the resulting graphs clearly show when the LOR occurred as the needle entered the epidural space (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-0954411913483428">Figure 9</xref>). In some cases, the needle hit bone, causing a peak on the graph, but with re-angulations and further advancement of the needle, the LOR was still achievable.</p>
<p>The developed algorithm for measuring the length of an epidural needle using the markings on its metal shaft is clinically useful as there is currently no other way to measure the needle or monitor the depth in real-time during insertion. This could potentially be useful for precise location of Tuohy needle during epidurals to improve safety of the procedure. The image processing method is more ethically safe and less intrusive than using physical measuring devices that touch the needle.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0954411913483428">19</xref></sup> It also ensures sterility, which is essential for the prevention of infection during epidural insertion. During the 10-s calibration, it is preferable to have no extra object present in the image; however, re-calibration may be required to allow the algorithm to adapt to the background if it has changed during and after the calibration. After calibration, if a light is shifted or objects are moved, the algorithm may not work properly, so this should be avoided.</p>
<p>In the current implementation, the device does not allow angling of the needle. This is often required in vivo since inserting at an angle increases the chances of the needle correctly passing into the space between vertebrae. This cannot be currently achieved with the current 3-DOFs haptic device, but to support this, a 6-DOFs haptic device would be required to allow rotation of the needle at any angles.</p>
<p>A further study with labouring women has now begun for developing a realistic force feedback epidural simulator for the best possible training platform to anaesthetists. The specific aim is to measure pressure differences between various patients, which will allow a generic patient-specific epidural simulator to be developed, which is currently not available. This will offer a high-fidelity simulator based on clinically measured data for a realistic in vitro experience before attempting the procedure on the actual patients, thus improving the safety of the procedure and reducing the morbidity.</p>
