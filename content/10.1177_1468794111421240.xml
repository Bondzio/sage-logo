<p>These two volumes from Left Coast Press, one an edited collection of essays on diverse challenges posed by a social justice politics to qualitative inquiry, the other a dialogic performative text around the ‘betweenness’ of ‘indigenous’ ethnographers, display much of the promise, and some of the obstacles, qualitative inquiry brings to a social justice agenda.</p>
<p>In the Introduction to their edited collection, Denzin and Giardina argue that at the present time ‘the need for social justice has never been greater’. The task is to ‘imagine new ways of doing what we do’ (p. 15), such that transformative inquiries ‘can provide the moral authority to move people to struggle and resist oppression’. Clearly informed by US events and politics, 9/11, the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, a surveillance regime in schools and elsewhere, and government intrusion into research methodologies, as with Scientifically Based Research (SBR), the Introduction offers a very interesting history of ‘paradigm wars’ (an unfortunate phrase), with relevance to qualitative inquirers across the globe. It provides a succinct account of some very difficult debates, engages with different positions, and proposes alternatives through the ‘third moment and new paradigm dialogs’ (p. 29).</p>
<p>The edited collection is organized around three sections: ethics, evidence and social justice; qualitative inquiry in post-disaster America; and human rights and radical performance. The chapters in Section 1 are outstanding. McIntosh and Morse’s profound account of how emotion is integral to unstructured interviews, and yet Institutional Ethical Review Boards fail to acknowledge the specificity of the relational connection, the poly-valences of emotion, and of emotion in everyday life, is compelling. A range of evidence is brought forward to make the case for a revaluation of ethical criteria; this is a must-read not only for those sitting on such Boards, but for all of us making a case before them, for an ethics that ethically retains ‘emotions’ in research. Cannella and Lincoln ask some very difficult questions regarding why ‘much of the critical/critical theorist work has not always resulted in any form of increased social justice?’ (p. 54). They work through a set of ontologies, epistemologies and methodologies that could be considered ‘critical’; most answering to foundational questions about power, including ‘the hidden structures of power deployed in the construction and maintenance of its own power’ (p. 55). Three reasons are given for why ‘so little critical research becomes part of the civic debate’ (p. 57). Strategies such as seeking discursive and other locations from which to become visible again, networking, alliances with a wider public, and dissemination of research are discussed.</p>
<p>Frederick Erickson makes four provocative proposals for policy-oriented qualitative research. He suggests that, first, ‘it is appropriate to report relative frequency of occurrence and the full range of variation in occurrence of similar or analogous instances’ (p. 73). Second, case study research can serve a renewed mission. Since social phenomena, unlike physical sciences are ‘far more contingent and labile’ (p. 74), then a different understanding is required, one that would also support ‘phronesis’. Third, since policy involves issues of value, ‘prudential social inquiry’ is advocated. Explaining the historical rise of instrumental rationality, Erickson concludes that removed as this is from ‘actual local practices’ (p. 79), it will never work. This leaves the space for a vision of qualitative inquiry suitable for policy purposes. Similarly, Joseph Maxwell makes a powerful case for a dialogical postmodern approach to ‘evidence’ through a critical realist perspective. He argues that ontological realism and epistemological constructivism, heuristically compatible, are ‘more effective than a consistent position’ (p. 110). Most useful is the proposal for an ‘evidential pluralism’. Maxwell’s dialogical approach to ‘evidence’, much like Erickson’s advocacy of ‘<italic>prudentia</italic>’, offers a clear direction for those of us seeking to reclaim ‘evidence’ away from SBR. This could not be a more timely contribution.</p>
<p>The three chapters inspired by ‘post-disaster America’ highlight the difficulties of relevance critical ethnographers across the globe face given the intensity and pace of ‘natural’ and social global disasters. Cannella and Perez contrast the swift ‘at the speed of light’ response of the right-wing media, neoliberal policy makers, and disaster entrepreneurs to disaster times and spaces with the far slower reaction of QI researchers. Living in New Orleans since 2007, they find that ‘reading newspapers, completing school volunteer work and attending community meetings’ (p. 168) more productive of knowledge that unmasks the ‘power stealth’ of disaster capitalism than standard methodologies. Following <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1468794111421240">Kincheloe (2008)</xref>, an accelerated QI would employ a multilogical critical perspective using ‘methodological bricolage and theoretical dexterity’ (p. 170), which would also draw more systematically on contextual knowledge. Speedy dissemination of the products of research activism is advocated. Giardina and Vaughan also talk through the contrast between the mediated images of NOLA with the ‘view on the ground’; for them, being present and connected to those whose lives are being wiped out ‘unmasks this latent systemic cultural racism’ (p. 149) and offers hope. It is somewhat disconcerting, however, that having argued against those who use their presence as ‘a cathartic adventure experience’, they depend on the sole story of an, albeit solidaristic, gesture of connection between a young white women volunteer and an old black woman resident of NOLA, as an illustration of a different ‘witnessing to hope’. How this encounter is different from others is not sufficiently explored. Indeed, the most concrete proposals for QI are found in the note (p. 159, n. 17), which rehearses earlier proposals for a ‘repositional cultural studies project’.</p>
<p>Ladson-Billings’ honest pessimism regarding education research and QI’s capacity to offer a valid and timely response to the continuing disaster in New Orleans is important, lest we allow our rhetoric of justice and hope to commit other acts of betrayal. For Ladson-Billings, a modest plan of escape from a paralyzing pessimism could come through a more discerning choice of projects to engage in, including those that disallow an ‘ignorance of poverty’ (p. 136). More optimistic are the four succinct accounts of the ‘perils’ of ethnography in a chapter on risk ‘as a relational dynamic’. Risk can produce new and worthy research sites, relationships, data collection and analysis. Sarah Tracy excites the research imagination when she describes her research settings (with 911 call-takers, on a commercial cruise ship, with correctional officers at a prison), her grounded theorizing on ‘labour emotion’, and the risk posed when data ‘distract’ from theoretical considerations. Employing a challenging twist, Aaron Hess recounts how as a participant observer in the role of a DanceSafe harm-reduction volunteer at rave parties, his lack of knowledge of how drugs worked made him ‘a risk’ to ravers. His message is instructive: ‘Ethnographers who engage advocacy – who intend to actively <italic>perform</italic> advocacy – must understand their personal limitations before they enter the scene’ (p. 208). The tension between a reflexive approach that respects research participants’ wishes and the immediacy demands of visual ethnographies such as photography, are explored in Karen Stewart’s account of the visual research of performance ethnography. Dilemmas posed by honouring participant performers’ own, often contradictory, wishes to be or not be photographed are discussed. The distinction between R (Risk) and r (risk) that Goodall makes, where R is ‘what takes place on the page’ (p. 215) and r is risk in the field, between the risky (to their own careers) power radical ethnographers have when they publish Risky (powerfully challenging the powerful) ethnographies, invites a new consideration of how ‘risk’ could be productive in a social justice project.</p>
<p>The promise of ‘radical performance’ suggested by authors of the third section of the volume is, for me, overstated. Soyini Madison, who has inspired Diversi and Moreira’s work, suggests a shift from what is dangerous to ethnographers to how ethnography can become dangerous, ‘putting power in peril’ (p. 189) through a utopian performance ethnography. According to her, the body, with its vulnerability, evidence of the present, and ‘unmediated’ quality is the only valid starting point for a radical research agenda. Here, there is not the space to contest this notion of ‘unmediated’ bodies, nor that a ‘common’ human vulnerability is shared in the same way by all humans such that it would excite the response-ability Ladson-Billings desires from the audience. It would be interesting to have audience studies of performance ethnography. Do these performances really ‘help people recover meaning in the face of brutal violence’ (p. 195) or are they functioning as another version of a reality TV, or of aesthetically seductive but vacuous infotainment that no longer moves, or invites a critical response? Another chapter that uses performance autoethnography in dubiously beneficial ways is Jean Halley’s interweaving of her own painful history as a child participating in the brutalities of slaughter on a cattle farm and of losing a beloved cat, with the slaughter of cattle and the correspondingly deplorable work conditions of workers in the trade. This is problematic because it makes equivalent these deaths and sufferings. The second proposal for the integration of memory in ethnographic work, albeit not new, is appealing. Here, Cynthia Dillard suggests, especially for scholars of race and cultural memory, that the research act of ‘re-membering’ should complicate the present, taking us to ‘new sites of accountability’. In this sense, to ‘re-member’ is a provocation to a different way of research and analysis, one which re-inscribes in the research ‘what we’ve learnt to forget’. Aware of the dangers of ‘nostalgia’ in this method, Dillard does not, however, consider that it may contribute to an overburdening of the past on the present, to a tendency to a historicism (as with theories of path dependency), neither useful if we wish to critically engage with the present. Indeed, there is the danger that, with some of this work, the conjunctural and contingent would be misinterpreted. Finally, I find it stretching it to place ‘a politic-philosophical excursion’ (p. 248) or discourse analysis of ‘crash words’ in this volume. While Ian Stronach’s piece is fascinating, not least in working through ‘co-ipseity’, ‘semantic collisions’ and others, it is a performance only in so far as Stronach is ‘catching up with myselves’ (p. 272, n. 39).</p>
<p>The volume concludes with a view to the future through a dialogic performance between five pairs of mentor-mentees and one discussant. Here the form itself works as a critical pedagogy, teaching readers how others live as mentors and mentees, as well as how performance may be pedagogic. It has elements of therapeutic group therapy, which is entirely appropriate given the nature of the ‘full-bloodied’ relationships between each dyad discussed, the lives shared, the meanings negotiated and the lasting relationships (parental, sibling, of love) established, and the emotional work of qualitative inquiry itself. Laurel Richardson correctly remarks that not all mentor-mentee relationships have these positive dimensions, but these presented here could teach others how to achieve such remarkably fruitful qualitative inquiry that has a future.</p>
<p>In contrast to the Denzin and Giardina edited collection, I had serious difficulties with (Marcelo) Diversi and (Claudio) Moreira’s text. Chapter 1 combines a theoretical and biographical positioning. It explains the structure of the book. Despite this introduction, I found it confusing going from Marcelo’s stories to Claudio’s fragments, poems and back. The juxtaposition of these in a ‘collage’ form is not always useful. All too often Marcelo’s stories, of which there are usually more than two or three for each theme of class, gender, race and others, are broken by Claudio’s ‘performative’ auto-ethnographical fragments; themselves, as the name implies, terribly fragmented. Often, rather than a cumulative building on previous performances, or discussions, each one was as a first, unless it was, as with many of Claudio’s fragments especially, a repetition. Although about deep social wounds, the repetition was tedious; worse, it trivialized. Not quite as collaborative as the authors claim, these parallel accounts served to emphasize the differences between them and their methodologies. The book closes with an interesting politically informed methodological dialogue, which articulates far more clearly than the introduction, the objectives of the different methodologies and/textual genres.</p>
<p>Marcelo (p. 190) brackets the (auto) of his critical ethnography. His critical approach is more about others than himself; the street children of Campinas, their carers and their tormentors, institutions of power. He trained as a street educator to work with these children; a role he took diligently, investing in it primarily as a committed activist, rather than an ethnographer seeking to maintain participant observation. The stories are truly polyphonic. The subjects speak for themselves; though not through ‘modernist verbatim requirements’ (p. 199). At the same time, different perspectives introduce subtle nuances, which perform the work of analysis by their interrogation of each other’s narrative. Marcelo is more concerned with lasting changes, a history of involvement in rather sterile fixations on positionality, or ‘false generosity’; he is more about who speaks with whom, than who speaks for whom (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1468794111421240">Kobayashi, 1994</xref>). The stories are told in multilayered but coherent ways, such that the unfolding of the story, the connections between the protagonists, and the exposure of the structures and persons that contribute to their persistent oppression, not least their own choices, do produce a new knowledge. This knowledge is accessed not only through the reader’s work of connection and analysis, but also through an affective response, aroused through the gripping and moving short stories. Marcelo is more than justified in his use of the genre, his use of ‘alternative points of view, dialogue, unfolding action, and flashback to attempt to create tension, suspense, delay and voice’ (p. 194). His claim that the short story ‘shows’, more than ‘tells’, is a distinction well made; there is much of the visual in the showing, reminiscent of hyperlink cinema, a technique well-suited to the complex connections across time and space, and the pace of our global lives. As with hyperlink cinema, which has the valuable property not only of ‘connecting’ stories but also of ‘surrounding’ us, the critical ethnographic short story also invites a surrender; a moment where the analytic and the affective combine to reach a moral commitment to social justice.</p>
<p>Having said this, it should be of concern to those committed to social justice that there is a form of anti-intellectualism, an eschewing of analysis in both Marcelo’s ‘I wanted to learn how to write, not analyze stories’ (p. 200) and Claudio’s ‘we believe that the stories are themselves the analysis of the post colonial struggle of everyday life’ (p. 184). This could leave the text without the engagement with structures ‘that shape and produce the violence in question’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1468794111421240">Denzin, 2003</xref>: 237, cited p. 188), an absence that weakens the potential of the book to reach more than a small audience of ethnographers. It tends to privilege the politics of recognition over the politics of redistribution. Stuck in the immediacy of recognition, performance ethnography is no more than a ‘presentism’; this more so when it is claimed that the theory of performance ethnography is the performance itself (p. 70, n. 6). As Nancy <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1468794111421240">Fraser (2005</xref>: 269) puts it, the turn to identity politics and recognition is ‘decoupled from the project of economic transformation and distributive justice’. Marcelo’s stories of the children’s difficult encounters with individuals and institutions in specific structural positions, because they are so well crafted, do this analytic work to some extent. The complex web of oppressive social relations is more than adequately constructed. For example, the accounts of how the Baptist and other recovery shelters have policies of such ‘tough love’ that Lara, age 17, in care since age three (and others like her) could not have the shower necessary to attend a life-changing job interview or court appearance, unless she committed long-term to a drug recovery programme, connect the children, their family history, their social workers, juvenile officers, street educators, institutional operators with an even more complicated colonial legacy and social history of Brazil.</p>
<p>However, there needs to be more work on the categories (called ‘metaphors’ p. 18) of ‘betweeners’ and of ‘indigenous’ ethnographers, both names the authors adopt for themselves; this especially given that they argue that ‘betweenness’ is a condition experienced by all human beings (p. 19), and that a non-essentializing concept of ‘indigenous knowledge’ such as their own, would open the concept to deconstruction. The application, following <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1468794111421240">Denzin (2003)</xref> of Sartre’s concept of the ‘universal singular’ is apt, but again it is undertheorized. In <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1468794111421240">Bourdieu’s (1999)</xref> <italic>The Weight of the World: Social Suffering in Contemporary Society</italic>, this ontology made it possible to see each life as ‘necessary’, at the same time as it retained a focus on social relations rather than solely on the individuals of methodological individualism.</p>
<p>Performance ethnography privileges the body to the extent that there may be both an essentialism and a narcissism, both antithetical to the endeavour of social justice communitarians. Claudio uses his body, his ‘visceral knowledge of oppression’ (p. 27) to refuse any erasure of this on his ‘marked body’. He places his body ‘as the allied other’, where even in Brazil he is a ‘border man, having in one arm my brunette brown-eyed daughter and in the other my blond blue-eyed son’ (p. 57). It was when he was writing his Masters’ thesis about Brazilian working-class soccer fans that ‘memories that were supposed to be buried came to life’ (p. 107). Claudio intersperses his account of the lives of some of the fan members, especially Conde/Zezao, with moving accounts of his own childhood; child poverty, child labour, child bystander watching while another younger child is raped. His accounts, as with the tale of his grandparents and their different genealogies ‘products of colonial rape’, complicate any straightforward theories of ‘race’ or of identity. In this section on ‘betweenness in indigenousness’ (p. 144), the autoethnography replenishes both standard statistical data and anthropological accounts of the myth of racial democracy in Brazil. Claudio attributes the beating to death of Conde/Zezao, the black soccer fan, to his ‘colour’; his account of Roni and the sexual attacks on two young sisters is also used to draw the reader into this complex racial/sexual politics, played through a visceral hierarchy also by those themselves oppressed, themselves black and sexualized. This is a powerful section; the performance culminates in the revelation of the contradictions that the ‘native’ lives in. At the same time, Claudio expresses all too often his unhappiness, his feelings of guilt, his rage at having to conform to academy conventions. He has been told that he ‘whines’, that he is a ‘Brazilian with a chip on his shoulder’, that he needs to edit his text. I wish he had followed this advice. That when he realized his idea of fragments ‘was not more than a gut feeling’ (p.170), he thought about the form of the text further. For all the claims to be writing for change, it is not evident that his own unedited story, powerful though it is, could persuade enough to produce the engagement with him and with his methodology that he desires. Too many of the poems are poor, repetitive and narcissistic; even one of the better ones, about Conde’s death (p. 111) ends up being about Claudio. This is an impulse that, were it more restrained, would allow Claudio to write his own story, a story that in its content does much to trouble the research imagination, without all the pretensions he presents here. While this performance ethnography is the site, as in the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1468794111421240">Denzin (2003</xref>: 13 cited p. 176) quote where ‘felt emotion, memory, desire and understanding come together’, it is also a site that, through its obsession with self, its methodological individualism, can obscure, rather than reveal, the sources of the oppressions. It is disappointing that with such passion for social justice, Diversi and Moreira conclude, not by some political action, nor a report, as with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1468794111421240">Fine and Torres’ (2006)</xref> or <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1468794111421240">Fine et al.’s (2005)</xref> many participant projects, that can move policy makers or global actors to change, nor with a participant project for the street kids or soccer fans, but with a ‘challenge to the categories of knowledge’ (p. 147). It is ironic that the academy, which is so abhorred, is also the only refuge for this work. It may be time to think about the limits of performance ethnography, which is the limit of its audience. When there is more urgent political work to be done, why spend all this energy protesting against the calamities of academic life?</p>
