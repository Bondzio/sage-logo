<abstract>
<p>Some sexually experienced African American females abstain from sexual activity for various reasons and periods of time following sexual debut (secondary abstinence), reducing their risk of HIV/sexually transmitted infection (STI) acquisition. However, few studies have sought to understand secondary abstinence motivations. Furthermore, the scope of existing knowledge may be limited by the quantitative approaches employed. Thus, the purpose of this qualitative study was to investigate secondary abstinence motivations among African American females using a grounded theory approach. Interviews were conducted with 20 young women, aged 18 to 23 years, who recently completed a sexual risk–reduction intervention. Motivations for secondary abstinence not identified in previous studies included feeling used for sex, partner infidelity, and abuse or sexual assault. Also, young women were motivated to abstain to focus on improving certain aspects of their lives. Other motivations similar to those previously identified included not being married or in a committed relationship, separation from one’s partner, and STI and pregnancy experiences or fears. Insight from this investigation can be used to improve measurement of motivations and to develop and refine HIV/STI interventions for this population.</p>

<body>
<p>It has been well documented that African American females are at increased risk for sexually transmitted infections (STIs), including HIV. In 2007, African American women were 22 times more likely than non-Hispanic White women to be diagnosed with AIDS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0095798412454678">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC], 2009a</xref>). Furthermore, African American females continue to have the highest rates of Chlamydia and gonorrhea (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0095798412454678">CDC, 2009b</xref>). This raises concern because gonorrhea and chlamydial infections are cofactors that increase the risk of HIV infection in females (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0095798412454678">Cohen, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0095798412454678">Galvin &amp; Cohen, 2004</xref>). Additionally, treatment of STIs among African Americans has been less than optimal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0095798412454678">CDC, 2007</xref>), and untreated STIs can result in serious health consequences, including pelvic inflammatory disease, ectopic pregnancy, chronic pelvic pain, and infertility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0095798412454678">Roberts &amp; Kennedy, 2006</xref>). Thus, reducing the risk of STIs, including HIV, among African American women and girls has become a public health priority.</p>
<p>An important strategy that may fill a gap in reducing risk of infection in this population is secondary abstinence. Secondary abstinence is a term used to describe choosing to refrain from sexual activity following sexual debut. Although nearly half of American youth are sexually experienced before graduating from high school (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0095798412454678">Eaton et al., 2006</xref>), a national survey found 60% wish that they had waited (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0095798412454678">National Campaign to Prevent Teen Pregnancy, 2007</xref>); and some decide to abstain from further sexual activity. However, little is known about secondary abstinence. Although some researchers have examined secondary abstinence among adolescents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0095798412454678">Haglund, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0095798412454678">Loewenson, Ireland, &amp; Resnick, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0095798412454678">Paradise, Cote, Minsky, Lourenco, &amp; Howland, 2001</xref>), college students (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0095798412454678">Rasberry &amp; Goodson, 2009</xref>), and adult women (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0095798412454678">Nettleman, Ingersoll, &amp; Ceperich, 2006</xref>), these studies represent a small fraction of research on abstinence.</p>
<p>Findings from a few investigations have provided insight about motivations for abstaining after sexual debut. In a predominately African American sample of 197 young women aged 14 to 25 years (mean = 18.2 years) receiving services at a clinic, 13% of participants reported lifetime sexual experience but no sex in the past 3 months (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0095798412454678">Paradise et al., 2001</xref>). Participants indicated one or more reasons for either having or not having sex on a self-administered questionnaire. The two most common reasons given by respondents who were sexually experienced but not currently sexually active were “tried it; decided it was wrong for me now” (25%) and “waiting until I am married or living with my partner” (37.5%).</p>
<p>African American adolescent females participating in an intervention to promote periodic secondary abstinence as a risk reduction strategy reported similar motivations for abstinence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0095798412454678">Haglund, 2008</xref>). This pilot study included a quantitative survey and in-depth interviews with 17 of 33 participants (mean = 16 years) recruited from two alternative schools serving economically disadvantaged youth with poor academic achievement. Survey findings showed avoiding sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) and HIV/AIDS and not wanting to have sex were consistently cited between baseline and 7-month follow-up assessment as key reasons for abstinence. Thematic analysis of interview data not only revealed STI prevention as a reason for abstinence but also showed that participants were motivated to prevent repeat pregnancies and as a way to show respect for oneself.</p>
<p>An investigation of a predominately White sample of high school students where approximately 8% were classified as secondary abstainers yielded similar results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0095798412454678">Loewenson et al., 2004</xref>). Fear of STIs, fear of pregnancy, and no longer wanting to have sex were identified as reasons for secondary abstinence.</p>
<p>Although reasons identified in investigations among those with sexual experience, such as fear of STIs or pregnancy or waiting until a relationship has progressed to a certain point, are similar to those of primary abstainers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0095798412454678">Bassett et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0095798412454678">Blinn-Pike, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0095798412454678">Haglund, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0095798412454678">Loewenson et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0095798412454678">Morrison-Beedy, Carey, Cote-Arsenault, Siebold-Simpson, &amp; Robinson, 2008</xref>), reasons associated with past sexual experiences are unique to sexually experienced adolescents. Therefore, efforts to uncover additional motivations among sexually experienced adolescents are warranted.</p>
<p>Additionally, the scope of the findings from previous research may be limited by the quantitative approaches used in most of the investigations. For example, one of the aforementioned studies focused mainly on fear of adverse consequences and normative beliefs about adolescent sex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0095798412454678">Loewenson et al., 2004</xref>) while the other focused on personal values (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0095798412454678">Paradise et al., 2001</xref>). There may be other salient reasons for secondary abstinence, such as aspects of one’s relationship, which have not been identified by a forced choice survey format where response options are limited to those generated by the researchers and were likely based on knowledge of primary abstinence. Although surveys are important for identifying motivations for secondary abstinence, qualitative methodology provides means for both improving the breadth of responses included in survey research as well as providing depth of understanding of these motivations directly from the experiences of secondary abstainers.</p>
<p>Given that abstinence is the only 100% effective way to prevent STIs, secondary abstinence could prove to be a valuable strategy for reducing ethnic/racial HIV/STI disparities. Thus, understanding secondary abstinence among African American females is of particular importance. Moreover, since motivation is a component of theoretical frameworks that may be used to intervene in this population, such as the information-motivation-behavioral skills (IMB) model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0095798412454678">Fisher &amp; Fisher, 1992</xref>), an in-depth understanding of secondary abstinence motivations is needed. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to explore motivations for secondary abstinence from the perspectives of sexually experienced African American young women.</p>
<sec id="section1-0095798412454678" sec-type="methods">
<title>Method</title>
<p>A qualitative investigation was conducted to identify and understand motivations for secondary abstinence among African American young women. Grounded theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0095798412454678">Glaser &amp; Strauss, 1967</xref>), an inductive approach that consists of systematic data collection and analysis techniques, lends itself to the discovery of motivations for secondary abstinence by allowing motivations to originate from the data instead of being determined a priori. Therefore, this approach was the most suitable given the aims of the study.</p>
<sec id="section2-0095798412454678">
<title>Participants</title>
<p>Participants were 20 sexually experienced African American females aged 18 to 23 years who had participated in a 36-month HIV risk–reduction intervention study. Young women were approached following completion of their final follow-up assessment. Each was informed about the purposes of the qualitative addendum and invited to be screened for eligibility. Purposive sampling was used to ensure that only young women with interest in practicing abstinence were included in the study. Interest in practicing abstinence was established by asking young women to classify themselves as very, somewhat, or not at all interested in abstaining. In addition to interest in secondary abstinence, young women had to be 18 years or older and willing to complete a 45- to 60-minute face-to-face interview to be eligible for the study. All interviews were audio-recorded. Respondents provided written consent prior to their interview. On completion of the interview each received $25 compensation for their time. All study procedures were approved by Emory University’s Institutional Review Board.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0095798412454678">
<title>Data Collection</title>
<p>In-depth interviews were conducted with eligible participants upon completion of their final assessment or at a time more convenient for the respondent. Respondents were asked a series of open-ended questions about their experiences with sex and abstinence as well as reasons for their interest in secondary abstinence. Respondents were also asked to provide their definition of sex. A semistructured interview format was used because it provided a uniform set of topics to discuss with each participant but allowed flexibility in probing and phrasing of questions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0095798412454678">Patton, 2002</xref>). Participants were probed about their thoughts, feelings, and decision-making processes as well as interactions with their partners, peers, and significant others to capture contextual aspects that provide a better understanding of their behavior.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0095798412454678">
<title>Data Analysis</title>
<p>Audio recordings were transcribed verbatim and checked for accuracy. The coding process was guided by a constructivist grounded theory approach as described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0095798412454678">Strauss and Corbin (1998)</xref>. Open coding consisted of a line-by-line examination of each transcript to increase confidence that the codes were grounded in the interview data. Transcripts were read again and codes that appeared frequently were used to code larger segments of text. Categories, such as “sexual health concerns,” and subcategories, such as “got STI” and “pregnancy fears,” were developed during this process. Relationships between categories and subcategories were identified and refined through axial and selective coding. For example, a relationship between “got STI” and “partner infidelity” was identified and then further developed to reveal a pattern among young women of being motivated to abstain after being infected by a partner who was unfaithful. Additionally, to assess the trustworthiness of the coding, the principal investigator (PI) developed a code list from the first six interview transcripts and the interviewer notes. A second researcher independently coded the same six interviews and compared code lists with the PI. The discussion resulted in the addition of one code to capture focusing on the future as a motivating factor. The revised code list was used to code subsequent interview transcripts. Revisions made during the remainder of the data collection and analysis process were minimal.</p>
<p>Since memoing is an integral part of grounded theory, this technique was also used in each stage of coding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0095798412454678">Charmaz, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0095798412454678">Strauss &amp; Corbin, 1998</xref>). Early memos captured insights about potentially significant codes which informed subsequent data collection and analysis by highlighting key issues that needed further exploration. Advanced memos, which are more analytic and permit comparisons between categories or concepts, respondents, or study findings, and the literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0095798412454678">Charmaz, 2006</xref>), were also developed during axial and selective coding. These memos expounded on proposed relationships between categories, explored underlying beliefs and assumptions about sex and abstinence shared by respondents, and were used to determine which motivations for secondary abstinence had not previously been included in the published literature.</p>

<sec id="section5-0095798412454678" sec-type="results">
<title>Results</title>
<p>Both young women who were practicing abstinence (<italic>n</italic> = 11) as well as others who were motivated to abstain but were sexually active at the time of their interview (<italic>n</italic> = 9) were included in this study. Motivations did not differ systematically. Most defined sex as vaginal, anal, and oral intercourse. Four respondents, one of whom self-identified as abstinent, did not consider oral sex to be sex. The mean age of the respondents was 20.25 years (<italic>SD</italic> = 1.8 years). Fifteen young women (75%) reported being in a relationship. There were many reasons underlying interest in abstaining from sex for various periods of time following sexual debut among this sample of young African American women.</p>
<p>Young women discussed a wide range of motivations for secondary abstinence, including physical, psychological, emotional, and spiritual reasons. Furthermore, motivations appeared to be personal, relational, and social in nature. Three primary categories of motivations emerged: relationship or partner-related motivations, STI and pregnancy, and life improvement. Each category is described, in turn, below.</p>
<sec id="section6-0095798412454678">
<title>Relationship or Partner-Related Motivations</title>
<p>To date, relationship-related motivations have received little attention in the secondary abstinence literature. However, the most frequently discussed motivations for secondary abstinence in our study were those pertaining to experiences with males. All were specifically related to a young woman’s relationship with her partner (or potential partner) except for violence, which included male family members or other acquaintances. The main categories for partner-related motivations were mistreatment by males, relationship status, and access.</p>
<sec id="section7-0095798412454678">
<title>Mistreatment</title>
<p>Being mistreated by males was the most common partner-related motivation. Young women commonly referred to themselves as being “tired” of mistreatment from males. The mistreatment described by these young women encompassed negative experiences such as feeling used for sex, infidelity, and violence.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-0095798412454678">
<title>Used for sex</title>
<p>Nearly half of the respondents cited feeling “used” for sex as a motivation for secondary abstinence. Many young women made comments such as, “That’s all a man want is sex” and “. . . boys only look for, like, sex. That’s—to me, that’s the main reason boys date girls: for sex.” A 22-year-old single mother who had become abstinent after a series of unhealthy relationships said, “You thinking that that guy actually loves you and care about you and he really don’t, and all he wants is a little piece of your—your goodies.”</p>
<p>Feeling used for sex led to a sense of frustration and a desire to stop having sex. Comments from one 18-year-old woman captured the sentiment of many:
<disp-quote>
<p>I’m really, like, fed up with everything and the whole sex situation, ’cause then everywhere I go and every boy I meet, it’s all about sex . . . why it gotta be sex? It’s not fair if I don’t have it [sex] I ain’t gotta deal with it.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Consequently, three respondents said they consider abstinence, at least in part, as a way to test their romantic partner’s motives. A young woman who recalled two, year-long periods of abstinence said,
<disp-quote>
<p>I try to test my relationships out to see how long these guys can go without having sex, just to see if they would do it. And if they will do it for me that lets me know they care for me and they like me a lot.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-0095798412454678">
<title>Infidelity</title>
<p>Proven or suspected partner infidelity also had a detrimental effect on young women’s relationships, inspiring secondary abstinence. Seven young women explained that discovering their partner had been unfaithful or even suspecting a partner of having sex with other women created distrust in their relationship that resulted in a desire to abstain. A 22-year-old college student recalled trying to continue having sex with her boyfriend after she found out he had sex with someone else:
<disp-quote>
<p>. . . me and him start messing around with each other again, and then I just realized that I couldn’t do it anymore, because it’s like he probably still cheating, messing around with other girls, so I just stopped. Yeah, it was after, like, the whole drama of trying to forgive and forget, and I was like, “I can’t do this no more.”</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>A young mother of a 2-year-old explained that she was no longer willing to add sex to her romantic relationships since the negative emotional impact of her child’s father cheating on her was amplified because of their sexual involvement: “I’m abstinent because I don’t wanna go through the emotional distress that I went through . . . it’s like I know for a fact that it’s because of sex. Like, sex emotionally bonds a person with a person.” Feelings of betrayal may be difficult to overcome and can influence whether one desires to become sexually involved in future relationships.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-0095798412454678">
<title>Violence</title>
<p>Emotional or physical abuse from a family member, romantic partner, or acquaintance fueled the desire to abstain for one fourth (<italic>n</italic> = 5) of the respondents. A 21-year-old woman recalled an incident with a guy she was dating that led to her becoming abstinent for more than a year:
<disp-quote>
<p>I was talking to this guy. And he just lashed out on me . . . I’m telling you, I didn’t make him mad, or anything. But he just beat on me and beat on me—that’s why I got this across my neck right here . . . it just changed my whole mind, and I just was like, you know what? Hey, I’m gonna be abstinent.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Three others described a rape or sexual assault, two of whom were raped by their sister’s husband or boyfriend. Experiences of violence are important motivations for some young women and should be included in investigations of secondary abstinence motivations.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-0095798412454678">
<title>Relationship status</title>
<p>Sexual involvement beyond the confines of a serious relationship played an important motivational role for most respondents. Sixteen young women said one reason that they were motivated to abstain was because they were not married (<italic>n</italic> = 9) or in a committed relationship (<italic>n</italic> = 7). Relationship status as a motivation to abstain from sex is interesting because this motivation could arise from underlying social or religious beliefs.</p>
<p>For some young women the underlying motivation to avoid sex outside of more serious relationships may be the result of social pressures. Concerns about how their sexual behavior may be perceived by others were mentioned by many of the young women but not directly cited by respondents as motivational factors. Nearly half of the 16 young women who said that a desire to wait until married or in a committed relationship motivated them to abstain expressed negative views of women who had casual sex partners or what they believed to be a lot of partners at some point during their interview. Young women sought to distance themselves from being viewed as a certain “type” of girl. Respondents made statements such as, “. . . men talk a lot, and I didn’t want to be the type of girl that’s already out there having sex with a whole bunch of different sexual partners” and “I don’t wanna be considered a slut from sleeping around with all these men.” In essence, it appeared that the underlying motivation for these young women was to protect their reputation.</p>
<p>Additionally, of the nine young women motivated to abstain because they were not married, three spoke of beliefs about God’s displeasure with their sexual involvement as a strong underlying reason to abstain until they were married. Although a few of the other young women made reference to doing things the “right” way, they did not overtly reference religious beliefs.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-0095798412454678">
<title>Access</title>
<p>Separation from one’s partner may also serve as motivation for secondary abstinence for those in committed relationships. Two young women’s motivation for abstaining was their partner’s absence. One young woman and her partner mutually agreed to abstain while he was serving in the military. Another was abstaining because her partner was away at college. Both young women explained that they have access to other males with whom they could have sex, but have chosen to refrain from sex in their partner’s absence.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section13-0095798412454678">
<title>STIs and Pregnancy</title>
<p>Similar to previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0095798412454678">Loewenson et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0095798412454678">Paradise et al., 2001</xref>), STIs and unintended pregnancy were key motivators for secondary abstinence. For all but four of the respondents, negative experiences with and/or the fear of contracting STIs or becoming pregnant served as catalysts for abstaining or desiring to abstain from sex.</p>
<sec id="section14-0095798412454678">
<title>STIs</title>
<p>STI experiences or fears were a significant motivation for 11 young women. Seven young women had previously contracted STIs and they not only discussed the physical effects of having an STI but also spoke about how it took a mental or emotional toll on them as well. A 22-year-old woman recalled her first herpes outbreak at age 16 saying,
<disp-quote>
<p>The first outbreak was the most serious one. And I was so sore–that was real. I couldn’t walk, I couldn’t sit down. So I came to the doctor, and they told me that it was herpes. So I was depressed for like a month. Like I couldn’t think right, couldn’t eat right, couldn’t sleep right.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>For some young women it appeared that the circumstances surrounding the STI acquisition created additional stress. For four of the seven young women, finding out they had an infection made them aware that their boyfriends had been unfaithful. Negative feelings about getting an STI were intensified by feelings of betrayal. A 19-year-old woman was forced to have a fallopian tube removed as a result of an STI she contracted from her boyfriend that went untreated. She described how this situation created a desire to abstain:
<disp-quote>
<p>Well, my ex-boyfriend, um, I didn’t know he was messing around on me. And we was together for like four years. And he end up giving me something that messed up my inside, which made me lose a tube. So that made me really open my eyes up and like really stop all my sexual activities with him and men period. . . . I didn’t want to have sex after that or have sex with someone who would just not tell me about that that’s going on with their body.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Another 22-year-old woman made similar comments about being infected by her previous partner,
<disp-quote>
<p>I had got tested and something came up. I was just like, “OK, this is not cool. I’m not having sex with nobody else but this guy, and then I get something back.” And that just opened my eyes to just really cooling out, like, just stay low key.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Two young women who had been abstinent for a few months were not in monogamous relationships when they were infected. However, they too described feeling a sort of betrayal. Each young woman explained that although she did not expect to be the only sexual partner she trusted her partner(s) to use condoms with other partners or get tested regularly and treated if necessary, but her partner(s) did not. As a result, both said frustration from repeated infections led them to practice abstinence.</p>
<p>Additionally, some of the respondents mentioned that the fear of acquiring an STI made them recognize the benefits of abstinence. Notably, a few spoke about the seriousness of incurable diseases, namely HIV/AIDS, often in terms of life and death. A 20-year-old woman who expressed concern for limiting her number of lifetime partners and had no history of STIs conveyed a strong fear of contracting HIV because her close friend had been infected at age 15. She repeatedly referred to this friend and went on to discuss her perception of the impact acquiring HIV is having on her friend’s life: “She had sex one time . . . Never had sex before, but with that one man, and that one man messed up her whole life, her whole life.”</p>
<p>Two other respondents also referred to the gravity of becoming infected with HIV. One 22-year-old woman who spoke about her promiscuity in the past had come to realize the magnitude of the risks she had been taking: “People are catching too many STDs and it’s too much AIDS going around. I’m not trying to die of the—AIDS. I mean, not necessarily saying you gonna die when you have AIDS, but it’s just . . . it’s close to death.” A 19-year-old young woman who had previously been infected with an STI made similar comments: “. . . I just want to be safe. I don’t want to catch AIDS or anything like that. I want–I don’t want sex to be the cause of my death.” It appears that HIV prevention messages have inspired some young African American women to consider the severity of potential long-term consequences of sex.</p>

<title>Pregnancy</title>
<p>Negative pregnancy experiences can have a lasting effect on young women and serve as motivation for secondary abstinence. Three young women spoke of painful pregnancies or delivery experiences that sparked interest in abstaining from sex. An 18-year-old mother of one was fearful of becoming pregnant again following an ectopic pregnancy that nearly resulted in her death.</p>
<p>However, over half of the respondents, eight of whom already had children, expressed a desire to delay future pregnancies as one reason for becoming abstinent. For most, this motivation was related to wanting to create a better life for themselves before having their first child or before having additional children. A 19-year-old woman who had already had one child said, “I didn’t want to get pregnant yet. Because I have a 5-year deadline that I’m trying to meet, stay in school, get a job, make sure I’m settled for the next child.” Another 18-year-old mother of a toddler shared the same sentiment saying,
<disp-quote>
<p>I don’t want no more babies ‘cause I already got one, and having two and about to go to college, that’s not gonna work. I’ll never finish. I’ll just chill until I graduate college, get a job, and I’ll have another baby and have sex again.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Building a better life often included starting or completing schooling, improving living situation or current employment status, getting married, or starting a committed relationship with a special person.</p>

<sec id="section16-0095798412454678">
<title>Life Improvement</title>
<p>More than half of the young women referred to their desire to improve their current situation and their future. This, in turn, led to exploring secondary abstinence as an option. Some young women believed sex was the root cause of some undesirable life circumstances that somehow interfered with them reaching their full potential in life. In many ways sex had become a distraction and continuing sexual activity was no longer worth it when they weighed the possible physical, psychological, emotional, spiritual, and social pitfalls of being sexually active at this point in their lives. An 18-year-old woman who recounted the role sex played in her rocky, 5-year relationship with her child’s father believed sex caused her to lose focus. She planned to finish the Job Corps program and continue on to college and believed she would have plenty of time to resume sex later in life.</p>
<p>Young women’s thoughts about what constituted a better life varied. One 22-year-old mother who was 8 months pregnant with her second child described what she wanted her life to be like: “Right now I just want to, like, just enjoy my life and, you know, go to school and get everything right for me and my kids. And, like, sex is, like, not even—it’s beyond last on my mind.” Another young woman’s idea of improving her life was turning her attention back to God saying, “I’m really into my religion. And like God just taught me that I can’t put no man before him, and I’m not doing the right thing throughout—with my life.” She shared how she had started doing Christian devotionals and praying each day to strengthen her relationship with God.</p>
<p>Restoring a positive self-image was a step toward a better life for a few young women who had experienced mistreatment from men in their lives. A 19-year-old woman who admitted occasionally having sex in exchange for money spoke about becoming the person she once was. Another young woman also believed secondary abstinence would be a step toward improving her self-image. When reflecting on how badly she had been treated by men with whom she had sex, a primary motivation for her abstinence, she commented, “. . . if I became abstinence, maybe I can—I can actually be true to myself and respect myself more.” At the time of her interview, she was in a new relationship in which she was practicing secondary abstinence in order to establish a strong foundation for her relationship.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The purpose of this study was to increase the breadth and depth of understanding concerning motivations for practicing secondary abstinence based on the perspectives of a clinic-based sample of young African American women who were abstaining from sex, had abstained in the past, or were motivated to do so for the first time. Findings can help researchers improve instruments used to measure motivation in this population by capturing a wider range of motivations as well as refine existing response options used in previous studies. Refining measurement tools is a necessary step toward understanding why sexually experienced African American young women may choose to abstain because the measures that researchers use dictate which analyses can be conducted and, in turn, the inferences that can be made. Moreover, this information informs the development of interventions to promote secondary abstinence as a pregnancy and disease prevention strategy.</p>
<p>Accounts of sexually experienced African American young women in this study revealed key motivators for secondary abstinence, primarily with regard to those pertaining to one’s relationship with partners or other men, which have not yet been included in published quantitative survey research. Knowledge gained about relationship or partner-related motivation should be used to expand the range of motivations assessed in secondary abstinence research. Mistreatment by men was discussed most frequently, warranting its inclusion in measures. Quantitative researchers should consider measuring the various types of mistreatment identified in this study separately in order to investigate the impact of each. For example, a young woman’s belief that she is being or has been used for sex was one form of mistreatment discussed as a salient motivation for secondary abstinence. Although most young women described sex as a way to give or receive love, many learned during the course of a sexual relationship that their reasons for having sex or expectations for the direction of the relationship were different from those of their male partner. As a result, young women felt used and reconsidered their involvement in sex. Infidelity was another form of mistreatment discussed by young women, which should be assessed as well. Negative emotional and psychological effects of experiencing partner’s infidelity, which were discussed by about one third of the sample, may influence a young woman’s decision to eliminate the sexual dimension of her relationship with her current partner as well as whether to become sexually involved in future relationships. Thus, items assessing experiences with infidelity should also be incorporated in instruments measuring motivations for secondary abstinence. Last, since violence from a male partner or acquaintance was also discussed by a quarter of the participants, this form of mistreatment should also be included when assessing secondary abstinence motivations. Participants’ accounts also suggest that it is necessary to include both experiences of sexual violence and nonsexual violence as each may lead one to desire abstinence.</p>
<p>Relationship status was another salient relationship-related factor that should be incorporated in instruments used in future quantitative studies with this population since the majority of the young women mentioned being unmarried or not in a committed relationship as a motivation for secondary abstinence. Furthermore, since comments by young women imply this desire may be driven by social or religious beliefs, perhaps it is worthwhile to incorporate these underlying motivations as well. For example, some young women spoke about wanting to abstain from sex while they are unmarried because of religious beliefs while others referred only to doing things the “right” way. Doing things the “right” way could reflect a more conservative but nonreligious view of sex or may have been used to convey religious values by those who were not comfortable openly discussing religious beliefs with the interviewer. Although the desire to delay future sexual activity until marriage and the role of religious beliefs have both been measured separately in a previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0095798412454678">Paradise et al., 2001</xref>), it could be useful to provide more specific options for “waiting until marriage” (i.e., waiting until married because of my religious beliefs) that incorporate underlying motivation.</p>
<p>Additionally, it may be advantageous to measure desire to wait until “married” and “in a committed relationship” separately as there could be a differential relationship with STI risk. For example, a young woman may be involved in two “committed” relationships and have two sex partners over a period of 2 years. On the other hand a young woman who is practicing abstinence until marriage would theoretically have no partners during that time unless she marries. This could influence STI risk since resuming sexual activity provides some possibility of STI exposure and those in serious or committed relationships may be less likely to use condoms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0095798412454678">Macaluso, Demand, Artz, &amp; Hook, 2000</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0095798412454678">Morrison-Beedy, Carey, &amp; Lewis, 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>Finally, although access to one’s sexual partner, which was also noted in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0095798412454678">Paradise et al.’s (2001)</xref> study, was not discussed frequently by participants in our study, it should be included in instruments to ensure a more complete range of options. It would be useful, however, to capture intention when phrasing this option. For example, <italic>choosing</italic> to refrain from sex is a hallmark of abstinence. Therefore, it is important to distinguish circumstantial or situational abstinence from intentional abstinence. Some argue that refraining from sex because one’s partner is away should be categorized as circumstantial/situational abstinence. However, this assumption may not be accurate in all cases. In the present study, the young women whose partners were away noted having access to other males with whom they could have sex, but having chosen to refrain from sex in their partner’s absence. Thus, in such cases, it would be appropriate to categorize respondents as secondary abstainers.</p>
<p>Improvements in measurement are important because they have implications for the development of interventions for African American females with elevated risk for HIV/STI acquisition. Since the knowledge derived from survey research is often used to shape intervention approaches (i.e., intervene with dyads instead of individuals) and content (i.e., build self-efficacy), it is important to give careful consideration to the quality of the measures employed in survey research. For example, experiences shared by respondents suggest it may be beneficial to delve deeper into the motivational role of STIs. Findings indicate that a “fear of STIs” response option may be too broad. Some young women referred to getting diseases you “can’t get rid of.” A few referred specifically to HIV avoidance as motivation for abstinence. Despite condoms offering protection from exposure to HIV when used correctly and consistently, any possibility of becoming infected seemed too great a risk. Such comments were not made regarding curable STIs. Perhaps a “fear of incurable STIs” or “fear of HIV/AIDS” option may be more appropriate. Such information would help researchers refine intervention messages. Thus, our measurement of STI motivations must include more precise response options.</p>
<p>Additionally, researchers should inquire about different dimensions of the STI experience when measuring history of STIs as a motivating factor. Assessing the psychological experience of having an STI in addition to physical aspects would allow researchers to evaluate the motivational power of each. Perhaps physical pain, which may be relieved with medication, provides short-term motivation whereas psychological distress, which may be more difficult and take longer to overcome, may be a more powerful motivator. Knowing which aspects of an STI experience are the most compelling is vital because it can inform the development of intervention content. For example, instead of focusing primarily on pictures portraying painful sores on infected body parts, discussion of consequences of STIs could explore the psychosocial aspects as well. This may be achieved through activities where participants receive STI acquisition scenarios and discuss what they would think and how they would feel given the circumstances surrounding their infection, or what they have thought and felt if they had an STI in the past, as well as ways it could affect their relationship with their partner, for instance. Similarly, the primary focus may shift from STIs if that does not provide strong motivation for young African American women to become or remain abstinent. If relationship concerns are most salient for young women, devoting more attention to potential psychological or emotional pitfalls of sexual involvement would be advisable.</p>
<p>Another example is the desire to improve one’s life circumstances, which was discussed by more than half of the respondents. Although the desire to make short-term and long-term improvements in one’s life typically was not mentioned as a primary motivator, it was spoken of as a constant and sustaining underlying motivation in relation to other motivators. For example, for many young women the desire to delay first or subsequent pregnancies was rarely due to the demands of motherhood. Instead, the desire was linked to creating a better life for her and existing and future children. This finding is also consistent with findings from a study with African American adolescent females that revealed protection of future goals and aspirations as a motivation for primary abstinence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0095798412454678">Morrison-Beedy et al., 2008</xref>). Inclusion of this factor could be critical for understanding the maintenance of secondary abstinence. Such information would be valuable when developing interventions as relevant motivations could be integrated into discussions and activities. For instance, young women may identify or create short- and long-term goals for their lives and discuss ways that having sex or abstaining from sex could help or hinder them from achieving these goals. Creating direct links between young women’s personal aspirations and their behavior may be an effective way to motivate interested young women to begin or continue practicing secondary abstinence.</p>
<p>Incorporating motivations that are most meaningful in intervention materials designed to meet the needs of subgroups of African American females who are most at-risk for HIV/STIs may result in interventions that are more relevant and potentially more effective at increasing abstinence and, in turn, decreasing the risk of STIs. Thus, our efforts to reduce HIV/STI disparities for African American young women and girls may be affected by how well we measure motivations for secondary abstinence.</p>
<p>Health practitioners could benefit from improved measures since motivations can be integrated into screening tools used to assess patient needs. For example, a young woman whose motivation for secondary abstinence is psychological abuse from her partner or a sexual assault could be identified and referred for counseling. As a result, a young woman may receive treatment for a mental health need that may have gone undetected.</p>
<p>It is important to note that there were some limitations of our study. First, the sample included young women who had participated in an HIV prevention intervention study. Consequently, heightened awareness about and concern for acquiring HIV or other STIs that emerged in the interviews may be inflated. Also, although the PI’s role as a member of the intervention study staff aided recruitment and building rapport in the interviews, it is possible the PI’s affiliation with the study biased the information provided by respondents. It could be argued that participants may have felt pressure to express interest in secondary abstinence due to participation in the risk reduction intervention. However, the authors do not believe that intervention participation raises significant concern because of the nature of the intervention. Although abstinence was discussed in the intervention, the focus was primarily on reducing risk through condom use since the study targeted young women reporting recent unprotected vaginal sex. As a result, it is likely that participants perceived an expectation to adopt correct and consistent condom use, but not an expectation to become interested in or to begin practicing abstinence as a result of participation in the intervention. Thus, based on the intervention content, demand characteristics may not pose a significant threat to the validity of our data regarding secondary abstinence. Second, data collection and analysis were conducted primarily by the PI. Although steps were taken to increase confidence in validity of the findings, such as transcribing audio recordings verbatim and conducting a validity check of the codebook with an independent researcher, some bias may have been introduced. Finally, as with any qualitative investigation, the findings from this study may not extend beyond this clinic-based sample of African American females. However, the experiences of these young women provided insight about potential motivations for secondary abstinence that could be examined quantitatively to determine whether they are relevant for other African American young women and girls, and possibly other populations.</p>
<p>Research on secondary abstinence is in its infancy. It is important to begin thinking about how to construct secondary abstinence measures that will gather information which will aid researchers, practitioners, and other health professionals encouraging healthy behaviors that reduce the prevalence of HIV and STIs among young African American women and girls. The studies on secondary abstainers’ motivations that are available (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0095798412454678">Haglund, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0095798412454678">Loewenson et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0095798412454678">Paradise et al., 2001</xref>) have provided a solid foundation on which to build. However, more research is needed to understand secondary abstinence and its role in improving health. The current study targeted a segment of the African American female population experiencing the highest risk for infection. In the future, it will be necessary to conduct both quantitative and qualitative studies with other segments of the population to gain a more complete understanding of the potential role secondary abstinence may play in the broader population of African American females. Furthermore, future studies should focus on developing sound, broad-based measures to assess secondary abstinence motivations for young African American women and girls and evaluating the psychometric properties of these instruments. Researchers should also consider incorporating knowledge gained from this investigation into measures administered to and evaluated in other populations to examine its applicability in other populations. By improving measurement in secondary abstinence research we can improve our ability to provide sexual health education that meets the needs of populations at risk for HIV/STIs.</p>
