<p>Clare Stacey’s <italic>The Caring Self</italic> reveals how home care aides construct an affirming workplace identity—what she calls a caring self—within the context of a job that is poorly paid, demanding, dirty, and largely invisible. Based on interviews and ethnographic observation of home care aides in California and Ohio, Stacey’s research contributes both a detailed exploration of a misunderstood and fast-growing occupation, and a study in work and identity. Building productively on previous studies about worker dignity and emotional labor, Stacey discovers that home care aides strategically construct and narrate a positive work identity that proactively builds on the relational dimensions of their work. Her ethnographic approach lends a detailed richness to what “relational dimensions” look like on the ground in home care work. Her primary contribution to the emotional labor literature is her demonstration of how the emotional complexity of home care work is both a resource and a source of risk for home care aides. If a home care aide sustains a positive work identity through allusions to familial relations with clients, then what should that aide do when her client starts calling her at home in the middle of the night? The answer, rather surprisingly, is that many aides embrace the emotional, social, and physical needs of their clients both on and off the clock. In fact, a surprising number of aides end up taking a client into their home or moving in with a client to provide more sustained care, sometimes for pay, sometimes not. Stacey’s close scrutiny sheds light on a little-known, and ordinarily out-of-sight occupation. <italic>The Caring Self</italic> has value as an occupational study, and uncovers implications for the broader society and the conditions of both elders and low-level workers in contemporary U.S. society.</p>
<p>Home care aides share many of the challenges and coping strategies that scholars of labor have uncovered in other service work positions. Stacey builds on these studies successfully, adding a sustained discussion of how “emotions in the context of paid care work produce identity while also reinforcing inequality” (p. 36). Scholars since Hochschild (<italic>The Managed Heart</italic> 1983) have been interested in affective resources in the production and maintenance of workplace identity. What Stacey contributes to these studies is another example of how a service job that is poorly paid ($7.17 is the average hourly rate), stigmatized, and held in low regard, is inhabited by workers who describe themselves as called to the work through their innate caring abilities. Stacey uses stories from her interviews and observations to demonstrate the strength of the bonds that often develop between home care aides and their clients. Home care aides point to these bonds as evidence of their effectiveness and skill. Yet these same emotional linkages between producers and consumers of home care often grow into additional demands that exceed the job description and often the time clock. Workers actively struggle to manage the same resources (affect, emotional capital, fictive kin) that sustain their identities.</p>
<p>While Stacey offers no clear redress for the pull and tug produced by the caring self, she does expand her observations in a final chapter that considers the implications for unionizing low-level workers like home care aides. Unionizing is a pertinent question for this work force because while home care aides represent one of the fastest growing job categories in the country with intense growth expected for another decade, they are paid meager wages that hardly sustain a living. As a result, most aides work multiple jobs. Based on recent unionization efforts and the responses of her participants, Stacey concludes that the caring selves of work must be treated as a movement resource for organizers. Stacey argues that the caring self identity cannot be treated as a form of false consciousness that gets in the way of unionizing, but must instead be taken seriously as a key “hook” for workers and therefore a necessary resource for union organizers to understand and seize upon in the process of organizing workers.</p>
<p><italic>The Caring Self</italic> will be a useful text for scholars and students of service work, and more specifically, sociologists interested in work and identity in an aging society. It would be appropriate in an undergraduate seminar, or an introductory graduate course. As Stacey points out, home care aides “fill in the care gap for families or individuals who cannot provide informal care due to realities of income, geography, or indifference” (p. 6). In a society which, as one home care aide pointed out, “lacks interest in elders,” the people who take care of elders are also often rendered invisible and socially insignificant. Stacey draws their work out of the shadows, affirming not only what they do, but the selves and lives they create in the process.</p>
