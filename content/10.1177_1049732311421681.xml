<abstract>
<p>People in the United States often consult registered nurses (nurses) for advice when they want to explore alternatives to Western medicine, such as traditional Chinese medicine (TCM). Nurses find themselves confronting dilemmas when they are caught between these radically different worlds of medical cultures and thinking. Twenty Minnesota nurses were interviewed to learn how they integrate TCM into their triage process. Symbolic interactionism was the research framework used, and mixed coding methods facilitated data analysis. Several sociological theories explain the findings. The major finding is that nurses use a four-step triage process that begins from the Western medical perspective and includes consideration of TCM use. Nurses’ recommendations are influenced by their situational roles and relationships, and by the cues they read from the person who is asking their advice. The results point to nurses being natural disseminators of TCM information and education in their resource role for others making health care decisions.</p>

<body>
<p>At some point in life, most people need some type of medical care. For many living in the United States, the choice is straightforward. They seek the care of Western (conventional) medical practitioners who use standard treatments and procedures Americans have come to accept and expect. For others, routine Western medical care is no longer the treatment of choice for all conditions. Increasingly, studies find that U.S. adults are privately paying for and using complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) in combination with, or as an alternative to, Western medicine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1049732311421681">Barnes, Bloom, &amp; Nahin, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1049732311421681">Nahin, Barnes, Stussman, &amp; Bloom, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Ferreting out which CAM therapy might yield a positive effect on specific health issues can be challenging for most people—even nurses (registered nurses). Often, patients, friends, and family members seek out a nurse’s advice when they want to explore alternatives to Western medicine, such as traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), for treatment of their medical symptoms and conditions. Because nurses are trained in Western medicine and might have only personal experience with TCM, it is not always clear how to advise those seeking their counsel. Nurses find themselves confronting dilemmas when they are caught between the lines of these radically different worlds of medical cultures and thinking.</p>
<p>Within a larger study of registered nurses’ personal use of TCM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1049732311421681">Bertrand, 2009</xref>), I explored how nurses approach situations in which others ask their advice regarding the use of TCM. The larger study focused on how it is that some registered nurses are willing to step outside of Western medicine to try TCM, and how that experience might affect their professional identities and nursing practices. In the course of that investigation, nurses revealed how they incorporate their personal knowledge of and experience with TCM into their illness assessment and triage process. I discovered that these nurses did not consciously craft or adapt their assessment process to include TCM; nor did they realize that they modified their discussions based on situations and relationships. However, analysis of the data revealed that nurses use a common approach to these consulting situations. In this article, I reveal the way nurses explained how they assessed and incorporated TCM into their triage process.</p>

<title>Background</title>
<sec id="section2-1049732311421681">
<title>Traditional Chinese Medicine</title>
<p>The National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine (NCCAM) assigned TCM to the domain of whole medical systems. Whole medical systems are “complete systems of theory and practice that have evolved over time in different cultures and apart from conventional or western medicine” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1049732311421681">United States Department of Health and Human Services, 2011</xref>, p. 4). Acupuncture, acupressure, and Chinese herbal medicine are among the more familiar TCM therapies. In Western medicine and TCM, health and illness are approached very differently. Briefly, in TCM the body is viewed as a whole. There is a delicate balance of opposing and inseparable yin (cold, slow, or passive principle) and yang (hot, excited, or active principle) forces. Health is maintained by balancing yin and yang forces. Disease is believed to arise from an internal imbalance of the two forces, leading to a blockage in the flow of <italic>qi</italic> (vital energy) and blood along the body’s meridians (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1049732311421681">Beinfield &amp; Korngold, 1992</xref>). TCM practitioners focus on restoring qi flow and maintaining the body in a state of harmony, preventing the root causes of illness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1049732311421681">Kaptchuk, 2000</xref>).</p>

<sec id="section3-1049732311421681">
<title>Nurses’ Personal TCM Use</title>
<p>Nurses personally use many CAM therapies. That said, in this review of the current literature only five studies were found to specifically include nurses’ use of TCM. Among the many different CAM therapies investigated, the studies revealed that acupuncture and acupressure are among the least used CAM modalities (4% and 6%, respectively; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1049732311421681">Brolinson, Price, &amp; Ditmyer, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1049732311421681">Hayes &amp; Alexander, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1049732311421681">King, Pettigrew, &amp; Reed, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1049732311421681">Tracy et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1049732311421681">Tracy et al., 2003</xref>). In these studies, the terms <italic>acupuncture</italic> and <italic>acupressure</italic> were easily recognized by the study participants. However, investigators in three studies did not define terms, or purposely left the terms <italic>TCM</italic> and/or <italic>traditional Asian practices</italic> open to interpretation (Hayes &amp; Alexander; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1049732311421681">Tracy et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1049732311421681">Tracy et al., 2003</xref>). As a result, TCM responses are not included in this analysis.</p>
<sec id="section4-1049732311421681">
<title>Acupuncture</title>
<p>In all five of the reviewed studies, researchers found that nurses personally used acupuncture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1049732311421681">Brolinson et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1049732311421681">Hayes &amp; Alexander, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1049732311421681">King et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1049732311421681">Tracy et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1049732311421681">Tracy et al., 2003</xref>). Use rates varied, with the highest (13%) being reported for Midwestern critical care nurses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1049732311421681">Tracy et al., 2003</xref>). The Connecticut nurse practitioners (Hayes &amp; Alexander) and Ohio nurses (King et al.) in these two studies used acupuncture to manage personal pain. Additionally, the Ohio nurses studied reported having used acupuncture for symptom management.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1049732311421681">Tracy et al. (2003)</xref> asked Midwestern critical care nurses to rate whether they viewed acupuncture as a legitimate alternative or complementary therapy. More than half of the critical care nurses responding in that study rated it as legitimate, with a small minority (7%) viewing it as not a legitimate therapy. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1049732311421681">Tracy et al. (2005)</xref> asked the same question in a national survey of critical care nurses and found that almost 60% viewed acupuncture as legitimate, with a minority (7%) not viewing it as legitimate. In both studies, more than 90% of the critical care nurses who did not view acupuncture as a legitimate therapy reported viewing its overall effects as ranging from neutral to beneficial (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1049732311421681">Tracy et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1049732311421681">Tracy et al., 2003</xref>). Researchers have also explored nurses’ self-reported knowledge of or training in acupuncture, and found that about a third of the critical care nurses in two studies reported having self-knowledge of or training in acupuncture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1049732311421681">Tracy et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1049732311421681">Tracy et al., 2003</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1049732311421681">
<title>Acupressure</title>
<p>It appears from these studies that although nurses reported believing acupuncture is legitimate and beneficial, they tended to use acupressure more frequently than acupuncture. In two studies researchers found that critical care nurses personally used acupressure more frequently than acupuncture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1049732311421681">Tracy et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1049732311421681">Tracy et al., 2003</xref>). In a study of Midwestern critical care nurses, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1049732311421681">Tracy et al. (2003)</xref> found that 24% used acupressure, whereas only 13% used acupuncture. In a national sample of critical care nurses, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1049732311421681">Tracy et al. (2005)</xref> found almost half personally used acupressure and/or used it in their practice, whereas only 29% used acupuncture. The researchers did not mention the reason for this preference.</p>
<p>Nurses seemed to view acupressure as more legitimate and beneficial than acupuncture; however, there was no specific reason reported for this finding in these studies. More than half of the Midwestern critical care nurses reported that they viewed acupressure as a legitimate practice, and an overwhelming majority of them perceived it to be neutral to beneficial as a complementary or alternative therapy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1049732311421681">Tracy et al., 2003</xref>). In a national sample of critical care nurses, more than half of the respondents reported viewing acupressure as legitimate, and almost all viewed it to be neutral to beneficial as a therapy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1049732311421681">Tracy et al., 2005</xref>). Nurses reported having a higher level of self-knowledge of, training in, and interest in gaining further knowledge about acupressure than acupuncture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1049732311421681">Tracy et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1049732311421681">Tracy et al., 2003</xref>). Again, no reason was stated for this preference.</p>

<sec id="section6-1049732311421681">
<title>Nurses discuss TCM with others</title>
<p>At times nurses find themselves in situations in which patients, family members, or friends seek their counsel about which medical options might effectively treat various personal medical conditions or problems. Sometimes this occurs informally, on the bleachers as parents talk while watching the activities of their children. At other times, nurses are more formally consulted by patients or their family members during treatment regimes. In the course of the normal admission nursing assessment, nurses have the opportunity to ask patients about their CAM use, creating openings for discussion.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1049732311421681">King et al. (1999)</xref> found that when patients asked the nurses studied how to manage pain and other symptoms with CAM therapies, the nurses recommended that clients use acupuncture, and less frequently, acupressure. In a study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1049732311421681">Hayes and Alexander (2000)</xref>, Connecticut nurse practitioners tended to recommend acupuncture for treatment of pain and mental health issues. In a national study, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1049732311421681">Brolinson et al. (2001)</xref> found that the majority of the nurses studied never recommended acupuncture; however, about 14% recommended it occasionally. In the same study, there were similar statistics for acupressure, in that 75% of the nurses never recommended it, whereas 14% occasionally recommended it. Even though 17% of patients and families of Midwestern critical care nurses studied requested acupuncture as a therapy, these nurses recommended it only 8% of the time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1049732311421681">Tracy et al., 2003</xref>). Instead, they recommended acupressure about 12% of the time, clearly viewing it as a more mainstream therapy. In another study, almost 17% of a national sample of critical care nurses reported recommending acupressure at some time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1049732311421681">Tracy et al., 2005</xref>). These researchers did not ask why nurses did or did not recommend acupressure or acupuncture, or why they recommended acupressure more frequently than acupuncture. Apparently, oncology nurses were more likely to have engaged in conversations with patients about CAM therapies that the nurses had knowledge of (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1049732311421681">Rojas-Cooley &amp; Grant, 2009</xref>). Variations in nurses’ comfort levels in discussing and making recommendations could be related to differences in nursing subspecialty practice norms, as observed in qualitative studies by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1049732311421681">Bertrand (2009)</xref> and by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1049732311421681">Hirschkorn &amp; Bourgeault (2008)</xref>.</p>

<title>Barriers and openness to nurses’ CAM use</title>
<p>One would expect nurses to have an inherent bias toward using Western medicine because nursing practice lies in that medical domain. Researchers probing for that bias asked Midwestern critical care nurses to respond to a list of 10 possible barriers to CAM use (including acupuncture and acupressure), and reported that the most frequent barriers were lack of knowledge, lack of training, and lack of time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1049732311421681">Tracy et al., 2003</xref>). Sixty percent identified physician reluctance as more of a barrier than either peer (46%) or personal (41%) reluctance. In a national study of critical care nurses, researchers had similar findings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1049732311421681">Tracy et al., 2005</xref>). The most frequently cited barriers to CAM use were lack of training, lack of knowledge, and unavailability of credentialed providers. Again, physicians’ reluctance (78%) to use CAM ranked higher than either peer (61%) or personal reluctance (39%). Despite the barriers, most critical care nurse respondents in both studies were open to the use of CAM therapies, including acupuncture and acupressure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1049732311421681">Tracy et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1049732311421681">Tracy et al., 2003</xref>).</p>

<sec id="section8-1049732311421681" sec-type="methods">
<title>Methods</title>
<p>In this article, I report my findings from a larger qualitative case study of nurses’ personal use of TCM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1049732311421681">Bertrand, 2009</xref>). In the course of the larger investigation, nurses articulated how they incorporated their personal knowledge of and experience with TCM into their illness assessment and triage process to assist those who asked their advice on TCM use. In the study I intentionally used the terms <italic>TCM</italic> and <italic>Chinese medicine</italic> synonymously, to include all forms of TCM. The participating nurses interpreted both terms to mean many forms of TCM.</p>
<sec id="section9-1049732311421681">
<title>Sample</title>
<p>In the larger study, I recruited a purposeful sample of registered nurses who had practiced for a minimum of 5 years (at some point in their career) and who had personally tried some form of TCM. Further participation requirements limited eligibility to nurses who lived in or close to the Minneapolis/St. Paul metropolitan area of Minnesota. Twenty nurses met those criteria and were willing to participate in the study. For purposes of analysis, I grouped participants into two categories: practicing nurses, and nursing faculty members. In the data analysis section of this article I explain the impurity of this division. Without intending to limit the sample to women, no men responded to recruitment efforts. The practice experience level of this sample ranged from 8 to 50 years, with the mean being 30 years in nursing. Participants had many different nursing backgrounds, subspecialty practices, and TCM experiences.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-1049732311421681">
<title>Methodological Framework</title>
<p>Symbolic interactionism was the methodological framework used in this study to understand the nurses’ perspectives of the meanings they gave to their lived experiences. Symbolic interactionism is particularly helpful when analyzing social situations, groups, and individuals because it seeks to unravel an individual’s perspective of a situation. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1049732311421681">Charon (2007</xref>, p. 4) defined perspective as “an angle on reality, a place where the individual stands as he or she looks at and tries to understand reality.” The individual’s range of experiences limits or expands his or her perspective, because one cannot understand what one has not experienced. Examining how the individual describes his or her lived experience is a way to learn how that person assigns meaning to events in his or her life, and to how experience unfolds over time. The meanings individuals make of their lives change with each new experience (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1049732311421681">Bogdan &amp; Biklen, 2003</xref>; Charon; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1049732311421681">Speziale &amp; Carpenter, 2007</xref>). Therefore, symbolic interactionism as a methodological framework effectively captures the changing perspectives of nurses who venture into TCM for personal medical care, and how that experience might influence a nurse’s willingness to share that experience with others.</p>
<p>Each nurse experiences similarities and differences in the practice of nursing. Professional training and socialization cause nurses across various practices to approach some situations similarly, such as conducting nursing assessments, administering medications, interacting with family members, and caring for people with similar disease processes. Yet, individual nursing practices also differ in many ways, such as practice setting, subspecialty practice area, geographic location of practice, and populations served. With these similarities and the inherent dissimilarities of practice, there are opportunities for variation in interpretations of experiences. As such, nursing is a field ripe for the use of qualitative research methods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1049732311421681">Morse, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1049732311421681">Thorne, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>Because registered nurses are similarly trained and socialized, one might think that they would interpret experiences in certain ways. Social interactionists offered a different interpretive lens in their skeptical approach to the extent to which professional values are internalized during professional socialization processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1049732311421681">Granfield, 1992</xref>). This skepticism extends to the degree that nurses internalize and comply with the norms of their subspecialty practice areas, and how those norms might influence a nurse’s willingness to share his or her TCM knowledge. Prior research revealed that oncology nurses shared their knowledge of CAM therapies with patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1049732311421681">Rojas-Cooley &amp; Grant, 2009</xref>). Nurses practicing in other subspecialty practice areas might also be inclined to try CAM therapies and share that knowledge. For example, could the Western medical norms and socialization of an operating room influence an operating room nurse’s willingness to seek medical help outside of Western medicine? Are subspecialty norms so strong that even with personal knowledge of and experience with TCM, an operating room nurse might be unwilling to discuss that experience with someone who asked? If the nurse is unwilling, is he or she unwilling to have that discussion with patients only in a professional setting, or in any setting, no matter the relationship? Would that same nurse be willing to have that conversation with someone if they were in a nonprofessional role—on the backstage, where subspecialty norms are not dominant? Because these questions reflect on personal and professional identity development, social theories presented by symbolic interactionists <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1049732311421681">Goffman (1959)</xref>, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1049732311421681">Mead, Morris, Brewster, Dunham, and Miller (1938)</xref>, might explain how nurses respond to those asking their advice.</p>
<p>Symbolic interactionism has its roots in the Chicago School, where its origins trace to social scientists such as Mead, Blumer, and Goffman (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1049732311421681">Collins, 1994a</xref>). Researchers who studied health care professionals, and nursing specifically, used symbolic interactionism. Prominent among these health care researchers are <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1049732311421681">Becker, Geer, Hughes, and Strauss (1961)</xref>, who studied the culture of medical students; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1049732311421681">Olesen and Whittaker (1968)</xref>, who studied the socialization of nursing students; and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1049732311421681">Olesen (1973)</xref>, who researched the posteducational socialization of nurses.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-1049732311421681">
<title>Interviews</title>
<p>I recruited and obtained informed consent from participants for personal interviews after receiving university institutional review board approval for the study. Over a 4-month period, I conducted 20 primarily in-person interviews, with two accomplished by phone to accommodate on-call status or driving distance. Semistructured, open-ended questions helped participants describe their thoughts and TCM experiences. I assigned pseudonyms to participants to protect their identities. Each interview was audio recorded and professionally transcribed. Participants reviewed their transcripts to ensure they accurately reflected our conversation. Three participants corrected names of places or procedures that were mentioned, and I made the corresponding changes to the transcripts.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-1049732311421681">
<title>Data Saturation</title>
<p>After 15 interviews, I began hearing similar responses. I thought I had reached data saturation until the 16th interview, when an operating nurse told me a story I had not heard before. After consultation with my advisor, we agreed I would continue interviewing, adding a more detailed initial screening process in an attempt to unearth new stories. Data saturation was reached at 20 interviews, when no new information arose.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section13-1049732311421681">
<title>Data Analysis</title>
<p>Mixed coding methods accommodated the nature of the data. Data analysis began immediately after each interview, with natural separation of the raw data into concepts (open coding). Further analysis required coding data more in the manner described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1049732311421681">Creswell (2007)</xref>, as an “in-depth portrait of cases” (p. 172), and later a “within-case theme analysis” (p. 172). At this point, it became clear that data analysis required separation of the data into smaller units to bring common themes to light. I divided study participants into two groups: practicing nurses and nursing faculty members. Although this division is not pure (faculty members spend an average of about 4 hours in the clinical setting with students for every 1 hour in the classroom), it was a means to discovering otherwise indistinguishable employer and employee institutional relationships that might influence a nurse’s willingness to share information. I then used axial coding to examine the within-case themes, looking for relationships between the emerging concepts, and then to begin the grouping process. Once larger themes and patterns began to emerge, I used what Creswell described as phenomenological analysis to develop a master list of significant statements related to each emerging theme. As I compiled more data, this list easily grouped into larger themes that added structural and contextual details. Finally, I wrote composite descriptions of the TCM experiences of these nurses, TCM’s effect on their professional identities, and how TCM influenced their nursing practices and triage processes. Composite description development required combining phenomenological analysis with selective coding to relate the themes to the emerging descriptions (Creswell).</p>
<p>In the coding process, themes began to emerge around several shared experiences, such as (a) how nurses read cues to determine a person’s openness to converse about TCM, (b) how nurses presented themselves and their beliefs in public vs. private settings, and (c) the process nurses used to assess and triage people to Western medicine or TCM. I began to see similarities in nurses’ approaches to discussions about TCM with those seeking their advice. I started to wonder if these nurses were influenced by the environment in which the question arose and/or by the relationship they had with the inquiring individual. I also began to consider if subspecialty practice area had anything to do with how open they might be to discussions. Then I began to recode the data, looking for these types of relationships. I was curious to compare these nurses’ stories to social theories such as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1049732311421681">Goffman’s (1959)</xref> presentation of self, and Mead et al.’s (1938) “the generalized other.” In the process of organizing the coded data into master lists, I recognized that each nurse used an assessment process that included certain elements, with a slight variation in each approach to specific consultation situations. As a result, I divided data into moments in which individual nurses felt their personal experience influenced how they approached these situations.</p>

<title>Triangulation</title>
<p>Because interviews were the primary data source in this study, I used two levels of data sources (multiple levels of person), and application of several theories to achieve triangulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1049732311421681">Denzin, 1989</xref>). The first level of person arose from the 20 nurse participants. Interviewing two nursing CAM experts produced a second level of person. As Denzin suggested, I applied rival theories (multiple levels of theory) to the same set of data to provide a more complete understanding and offer a theoretical explanation for the findings.</p>

<title>Validity and Generalizability</title>
<p>The purpose of validity in qualitative analysis is to ensure an accurate description of the study subject or phenomenon under investigation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1049732311421681">Speziale &amp; Carpenter, 2007</xref>). Although there is no way to guarantee validity of data, I took two steps toward this end. First, I increased the sample size, and second, I used multiple methods of data triangulation. Qualitative research is most often specific to the research subjects and setting under investigation, as was the case in this study.</p>

<title>Sociological Theories Lend Insight Into Findings</title>
<p>Two sociological theories provide insight into why the nurses studied might logically approach the triage assessment process as they described in their interviews. First, Erving <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1049732311421681">Goffman’s (1959)</xref> concept of dramaturgy within his work on presentation of self helps to explain how nurses presented themselves to others once they had personal knowledge of and experience with TCM. Second, Mead et al.’s (1938) concept of the generalized other illuminates how nurses read the cues they received from others to decide if they were willing to reveal their use of TCM with colleagues and others.</p>
<sec id="section17-1049732311421681">
<title>Presentation of Self: Dramaturgy</title>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1049732311421681">Goffman (1959)</xref>, a sociologist, used the theatrical stage as a metaphor to explain how individuals manage the images of themselves that they portray to others. Goffman termed this impression management <italic>dramaturgy</italic>. Furthermore, he asserted that humans have dual selves: a private self, known to the individual, and a public self, known in social settings as the socialized self (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1049732311421681">Lemert &amp; Branaman, 1997</xref>). Goffman theorized that humans enact social roles using these two forms of self. The private self is the backstage self that is our inner core: who we think of as our true self. The more public or socialized self, termed the frontstage self, is what we display socially in our formal interactions with others. The individual refines the social self to be more acceptable based on his or her knowledge of the expectations others hold for his or her performance in specific social situations.</p>
<p>On the frontstage, in the presence of others, the individual adjusts his or her private self to portray a self that fits the presenting social situation. For nurses, it is critical that they learn to properly present themselves in various situations, publicly before colleagues and patients, and privately before family and friends. Nurses must align their behaviors and the messages they deliver to a specific audience to conform to the situational context. For example, on the frontstage with patients and physicians, nurses would naturally yield to the physician and his or her treatment plan, even though they might know that alternatives lying outside the realm of Western medicine could be more effective for treating certain illnesses. With patients, nurses often are obligated to align discussion of treatment options to the frontstage (i.e., what is accepted within the institutional context or their nursing subspecialty practice norms); however, on the backstage, outside their professional practice (with family and friends), nurses might think they have more freedom in discussing and suggesting alternatives unless they know that person is only open to the use of Western medicine.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section18-1049732311421681">
<title>The Generalized Other and Reading Cues</title>
<p>George Herbert Mead, a sociologist who developed the field of social psychology, introduced the concept of the generalized other as a “permanent faculty of the mind making up the institution of society” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1049732311421681">Mead et al., 1938</xref>, p. 259), and accounting for the “complex institutional cooperation” (p. 259) required for society to function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1049732311421681">Collins, 1994a</xref>). Mead et al. explained that by taking the stance of the other (be that individuals, institutional roles, or the norms and rules governing our behaviors in social situations), humans have the ability to view themselves as society perceives them.</p>
<p>Factoring other into the social encounter between a nurse and a person asking a question about TCM could change the resulting conversation. For example, a nurse’s willingness to share information about TCM might be affected by what he or she believes others expect in the social situation. Social constraints (e.g., those imposed by educational preparation, or from subspecialty practice norms) often affect a nurse’s willingness to share. That said, it is possible that the nurse believes the individual’s needs are more important than what the nurse reads as negative consequences he or she could encounter from the other in choosing to reveal his or her knowledge of and experience with TCM. Thus, that nurse might be willing to share his or her TCM experience.</p>
<p>According to Mead, humans form their self-image based on how others in social settings interpret and respond to their use of symbols such as words or gestures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1049732311421681">Collins, 1994b</xref>). Individuals use the responses of others to evaluate themselves, adjusting their behavior accordingly to then form or reform their concept of self. Through taking the viewpoint of the other in a conversation, they are able to assess the other’s reaction to what they have just said, and then decide how they might modify and/or present what they plan to say or do next. For example, in having a conversation with another person a nurse might not have a plan as to what he or she will say if asked a question about TCM. A nurse often makes decisions about what to say by reading cues (e.g., facial expressions, body language) to interpret how the conversation has gone thus far, assessing the other person’s reaction to what he or she has just said. Generally, the nurse tries out a few statements to see how they are received to determine the readiness and willingness of the individual to hear about TCM.</p>

<title>Discussion of Findings</title>
<sec id="section20-1049732311421681">
<title>Where to Begin the Assessment: Western or Chinese Medicine</title>
<p>It is known from the literature that patients, family, and friends routinely consult nurses for advice about which type of practitioner to see and/or what type of therapy to use for medical problems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1049732311421681">Bertrand, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1049732311421681">Brolinson et. al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1049732311421681">Hayes &amp; Alexander, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1049732311421681">Hirschkorn &amp; Bourgeault, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1049732311421681">King et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1049732311421681">Rojas-Cooley &amp; Grant, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1049732311421681">Tracy et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1049732311421681">Tracy et al., 2003</xref>). In consultation situations, be they formal (at work with patients) or informal (in a nonwork setting), the nurses in this study generally approached illness assessment from a Western medical perspective, because that is how they were trained to think and make assessments. However, once these nurses experienced TCM, they reported that they faced a dilemma in deciding whether to include TCM treatment options or deliberately limit their thinking, and the discussion, to Western medical interventions. A faculty member, explaining the essence of this dilemma, said that despite her remarkable success in using acupuncture to manage her pain from a rollover car accident, “My brain thinks in Western medical terms first because that’s where my training and my nursing experience happened.”</p>
<p>Experience with TCM alone, even with a positive result, did not typically cause nurses to abandon Western medicine thinking and swing toward exclusively thinking in terms of CAM healing options. Although many of the nurses studied felt they had amazing outcomes using TCM and would like to encourage it more often, they did not believe they knew enough about it without further study to recommend it. This finding supports the observations in previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1049732311421681">Hirschkorn &amp; Bourgeault, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1049732311421681">Tracy et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1049732311421681">Tracy et al., 2003</xref>). One faculty member said that she did not feel “stuck in Western medicine, but I’m not where I want to be as far as integrating and using complementary therapies. . . . I would like to integrate more when I have more information.” Needing more information and education to feel confident in suggesting the use of TCM was a common theme among the nurses in this study.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section21-1049732311421681">
<title>Consultation Triage</title>
<p><italic>Triage</italic> is an old word originating from battlefields, where war casualties were “classified and sorted to make optimal use of treatment resources and to maximize the survival and welfare of patients” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1049732311421681">Triage, 2007</xref>). According to <italic>The American Heritage Dictionary</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1049732311421681">Triage, 2010</xref>), “triage is a process for sorting injured people into groups based on their need for, or likely benefit from, immediate medical treatment.” Today, triage is a process that nurses use in hospital emergency departments when they meet patients on entry to conduct an initial health assessment to determine the presenting medical problem, and prioritize treatment for that patient. A common theme in this study was that whenever an individual consulted these nurses about a medical problem, the nurses used a triage system of sorts to decide how to respond to questions. Individual triage systems varied slightly by the order in which each nurse opted to approach the steps of the process. All of the nurses interviewed used a triage process similar to a four-step process a practicing nurse said she followed when interacting with patients, and that she modified slightly when speaking with family and friends. She reported that she began her triage by asking a series of questions to discover from a nursing standpoint,</p>
<p>Step 1: Depending on who they are, whether it’s a patient, or whether it’s somebody in my outside life [family members or friends] . . .</p>
<p>Step 2: Depending on what the health issue is, is it chronic or is it acute. Is it [health issue], something to kind of get worried about because it is urgent or serious?</p>
<p>Step 3: What have they been doing for it up until now?</p>
<p>Step 4: If I can get a sense of, what their position [is on use of alternative or complementary medicine] or their open mindedness or lack of open mindedness towards thinking about different ways of doing things.</p>
<p>The information she obtained using this triage process “guides the direction of where [Western medicine vs. TCM] I would talk about treatment options.” Following are details and examples of the triage steps this nurse, as a proxy for most of the nurses studied, described as the assessment process she used to evaluate whether she would discuss TCM or other CAM therapies with people who asked her advice.</p>
<sec id="section22-1049732311421681">
<title>Triage Step 1: Determine the relationship</title>
<p>As mentioned, the nurses studied distinguished between the professional judgment they employed with patients and the personal judgment they used for themselves or with friends and family when considering which type of medical care to recommend. Nurses often were a bit more firm in their insistence that a family member or friend seek out and use medical alternatives than they would have been with a patient, as mentioned in the literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1049732311421681">Hayes &amp; Alexander, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1049732311421681">King et al., 1999</xref>). Determining the relationship before giving advice makes sense when this behavior is examined in the context of the sociological concepts of dramaturgy and reading cues.</p>
<p>A nurse’s professional role and judgment (frontstage) often require that when he or she is consulting with hospitalized patients (on the frontstage), he or she ensures that the patient has consulted a Western physician before suggesting alternatives, even if the nurse thinks that another form of treatment could be helpful in resolving the presenting medical problem. Having a professional work role as an oncology nurse would be more conducive to openly discussing use of CAM therapies with oncology patients (frontstage) than would be the case for an operating room nurse. An operating room nurse or a nurse who might work in a subspecialty practice area where CAM therapies are not well accepted might find him- or herself limited in discussing TCM in his or her frontstage, professional nursing role. Because integrative nurse clinicians work in organizations appearing to promote CAM therapies, one might expect them to be free to include discussion of CAM therapies within their professional role (frontstage). However, in this study, integrative nurse clinicians described confronting different limitations in their practices. One integrative nurse clinician had learned she often needed to change her language and approach to find an acceptable middle ground when discussing possible use of CAM therapies with hospitalized patients. She told me,</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>I walk that Western medical world in my relationship with patients, and if someone [patient] tells me he or she does not believe in, or want to try any of the CAM therapies we offer, I change my language and ask them if they might like a massage. No one turns down a massage. In the hospital, I tend to have to use the language that patients understand to find a therapy that will work and that they are willing to use.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Nurses studied tended to feel more freedom in advising people when they were interacting in nonprofessional roles on the backstage. When speaking with her immediate family [backstage], one faculty member felt free to discuss alternatives based on her own positive experience with acupuncture: “I’d feel more free [discussing CAM] with my immediate family [backstage] than with patients [frontstage], especially in areas [like TCM] where I have not had what I think is adequate training.” An organ and tissue procurement nurse said she clearly looked for and read the signals she observed coming from the person with whom she was speaking, then considered her relationship with the individual and her role (frontstage or backstage) in that situation before mentioning medical alternatives:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>The first thing I do is I read the patient. I mean I really read the body language and the words they are saying. Then I think about the environment we’re in, and my relationship with the person, and I think about whether it’s appropriate for me to respond and if so how I can respond. I always respond; I give them the information they’re seeking. I also recognize that as a nurse, I can give patients certain information but they’ll still probably need to see a [Western] physician. So I give them information but encourage them to see a physician if it’s a medical issue.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>When making choices for themselves, the nurses studied were able to seek care privately, off stage. There, they felt free to explore CAM therapies. For example, a practicing nurse had a disillusioning experience in which she felt that Western medicine had caused her medical problem. She explained that now she seeks alternatives first before she is willing to use Western medicine. In the spring of 2010, she resorted to surgery after first trying everything alternative medicine had to offer, with no results. Despite her choice of surgery, she said,</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Originally, I was quite medically [Western] model focused. Then with the hysterectomy from hell, I really felt disillusioned, let down, and abandoned by Western medicine, so then I did swing more toward using Chinese medicine. After using acupuncture, herbs, moxibustion, and homeopathy with very good results, my thinking now swings more towards the alternative first and then to the allopathic end.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
</sec>
<sec id="section23-1049732311421681">
<title>Triage Step 2: Assess the current health issue</title>
<p>No matter the relationship to the person who is inquiring, the nurses studied conducted a nursing assessment. During assessment, nurses asked people to describe their current health problem and the treatments they had used to ensure that appropriate Western medical options were pursued before being willing to discuss alternative treatment options. All of the nurses studied reported that they directed people to seek Western medical care for acute problems. A practicing nurse said she began by thinking “about the acuity [of the illness], and I think about acute versus chronic pain. . . . If this is acute, they [person asking] need bigger guns [than alternatives]. So first, I see if somebody has an injury.” The same was true for another practicing nurse who gave an example of what she did if she determined that someone was experiencing an acute problem:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>First, if the person says they are having heart palpitations or they’re noticing chest pain or, I mean things that are possibly an acute problem, I’m always saying . . . “Go see your doctor” . . . their primary physician would be a starting place for any kind of a complaint. . . . For less acute problems, where someone has been taking pretty high doses of say Tylenol or something, I would start talking about trying some massage or ask, “Have you thought about this [other type of therapy]?”</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Nurses in this study tended to refer people to TCM for chronic illnesses and for illnesses for which Western medicine has been ineffective, as noted in the literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1049732311421681">Hayes &amp; Alexander, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1049732311421681">King et al., 1999</xref>). A faculty member said she knew “Western medicine well enough to know that there are some things [medical problems] that I can predict what they’re [Western physicians] going to order, and I know it’s not going to get to [resolve] the problem.” As a result, there are some illnesses for which she and her family</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>don’t even go see the Western doctor initially . . . we just go straight to our Chinese physician . . . especially with some chronic or . . . I’ll seek out TCM first to see if I can avoid longer-term problems later.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
</sec>
<sec id="section24-1049732311421681">
<title>Triage Step 3: Determine the treatment history</title>
<p>After determining the medical problem, the nurses studied wanted to know what steps the person had taken to treat the health problem, both from Western medical and CAM perspectives. When nurses begin their discussions with Western medical options, and the person reported they believed they had tried everything Western medicine has to offer and nothing helped, these nurses said they immediately began to consider CAM options. A practicing nurse told me of one such situation, in which she encountered a woman in a pain center who was being cared for by a Western physician:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Still, the woman’s condition was not changing. After thirty-six abdominal surgeries and they [Western medicine] never fixed her problem . . . she came into the pain center and her pain was gone just after a couple of sessions with me [administering acupuncture].</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>This nurse felt she could intervene with acupuncture after ascertaining that the patient had tried Western medicine to resolve the medical problem without achieving results that the patient found acceptable. Another faculty member mentioned alternatives if “all they talk about is allopathic medicine, then I’ll bring up alternatives. I usually start it out by asking something like, ‘Have you ever used acupuncture for anything?’ . . . then go from there.” Like the rest of the nurses in this study, she read the cues the person gave her to decide whether and how to discuss or recommend potential treatment modalities. Reading cues helped the nurses determine how receptive the person was to a conversation about TCM, whether they encountered that person in their front- or backstage roles.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section25-1049732311421681">
<title>Triage Step 4: Assess openness to CAM use</title>
<p>Regardless of practice setting or type of subspecialty, most nurses adopted and incorporated into their nursing practice the healing options they recognized have the potential to help people. The nurses studied mentioned that one of the important parts of their work was to help people make informed health decisions, and doing so required they stay abreast of current healing modalities. One integrative medicine nurse clinician said she was very careful to assess where the patient was in terms of his or her beliefs, and openness to options other than Western medicine. Like all the nurses interviewed, she believed it was not her place to convince anyone to do something he or she might be uncomfortable trying: “I’m very clear. For me it isn’t about one [type of medicine] or the other; there are just different approaches to providing care.” Another faculty member found that some people were shocked when she mentioned CAM therapies, because they were just not open to the use of anything but Western medicine:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>I talk to them about their symptoms and what’s going on and what they have found to be helpful . . . asking them what they are open to . . . have they considered using any complementary therapies. Some people are shocked when I mention acupuncture or acupressure, and then I tell them I am not an expert on it but that I have experienced benefits from it and know others have, as well. I tell them, “It may or may not work for you, but it is another option you may want to consider.”</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In her role as a mental health nurse practitioner, another nurse suggested alternatives only after she established whether the person had first tried Western medical options. She said she “tries different medicines first, and then if nothing is working . . . I ask, ‘Have you tried any types of complementary therapy?’” She noted that although “other therapies can be very helpful, we’re so pill oriented in this society [that patients can be resistant to alternatives].” Consequently, she carefully read the cues she got from patients regarding their openness to other therapies as she began the conversation.</p>
<p>Only one practicing nurse reported that she did not wait to determine how open someone was to CAM therapies before she explored all options with those who asked her advice (i.e., patients, family members, and friends) on the frontstage or backstage. She thought she had an opportunity to raise awareness of options through discussion, enabling others to make informed decisions about their health care:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>If there was an opportunity—if they asked me . . . to share my knowledge, I definitely did share it. So many people would say, “Where else can we go?” and I would always say, “You could always try Chinese medicine . . . acupressure and acupuncture.”</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Because she saw her goal as a nurse as helping others, she was willing to take a chance broaching the subject if she thought it might be beneficial for that individual.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section26-1049732311421681">
<title>Nurses with TCM training</title>
<p>Four nurses in this study had had some form of TCM training. One nurse was Taiwanese. She learned TCM from her family of origin, and then she formally attended school to become a Western medical nurse. This nurse said it was more natural for her to think in “TCM ways when assessing illnesses,” but found she needed to use Western medicine in her professional practice role as a faculty member in Minnesota. Privately, when her friends specifically asked her how TCM might be useful for them or their families, she felt free to make TCM suggestions. Two other nurses who completed a formal, 3-year TCM program said that their triage assessment process was determined by the setting in which they were practicing and their relationship to the individual seeking their advice. One of these nurses said that when she was consulted by someone outside of her formal workplace, on the backstage, she began by considering the presenting medical issue within the TCM framework. When she was at work, interacting with patients in her professional practice, she might think in TCM concepts but speak in Western medical terms, and offered that assessment first. Ultimately, the severity of the person’s illness determined the type of treatment she recommended. She said, “If the issue was an emergent problem, and needed regular [Western] medical care, I would shift my thinking from TCM to recommend that [Western medical care].” This nurse found herself pulled between her Western medical training and socialization, and what she had formally studied and personally experienced with TCM. Still, in each consultation situation, she tried to think about the best approach to treat the illness for the individual asking her advice. The second nurse who had 3 years of TCM training was a mental health nurse practitioner. She said, “I would like to recommend people try TCM but I can’t, because patients come to me and expect I will prescribe Western medications.” The fourth nurse had only one semester of TCM study, and said, “If I had more training, I would feel more comfortable suggesting others try it.” Again, situational and relationship expectations determined how free nurses felt in suggesting TCM use.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>Nurses’ assessments of and recommendations to those who sought their advice were influenced by their professional role in the situation, on the cues they read from the person with whom they were consulting, and were based on their training in Western or Chinese medicine. Eighty-one percent (17 of 21) of the nurses studied indicated that even though they had personally had positive experiences with TCM, when someone asked them how they would recommend treating an illness, they most often began thinking about options from a Western medical standpoint. These nurses said they automatically thought in Western medical terms because that was what they best understood because of their training and nursing practice experience. However, all of the nurses with formal TCM training (4 of 20) said they began with a Western medical assessment when in professional settings but took a TCM approach when their friends or family members specifically sought that information from them.</p>
<p>In this study, nurses often felt they faced a dilemma once they had personal experience in which TCM resolved their medical problem. These nurses then understood the limitations of Western medicine in that particular medical situation, and found they might want to advise others of the benefits they experienced using TCM. Nurses reported that their role as a nurse was to tell individuals of their alternatives to help them make informed decisions about their health care.</p>
<p>Depending on their professional role in the consultation situation, their personal relationship with the individual, and the limitations of their professional education, nurses might feel conflicted in their freedom and ability to discuss TCM as a treatment option. Presenting an acceptable front for others and reading cues of openness to alternatives given by those individuals are critical to most nurses’ decisions as to whether or not to mention TCM as a potential healing avenue.</p>
<p>The nursing assessment and triage process as described by nurses in this study is another example of how nurses have to present fronts, read cues, and factor in how others will accept the information when interacting with people who seek their counsel. Nurses find themselves triaging between the lines of these two diverse medical systems when people seek their advice on confounding medical questions and problems without established triage protocol or best practices for TCM integration. The bottom line for the nurses in this study was that they saw their nursing role as being about assisting people, be they patients, family, or friends, to make informed decisions about their health care. Because people seek out the advice of nurses and because nurses are interested in helping people make informed decisions, nurses worldwide could be a natural starting point for dissemination of information and education about the use of TCM and other CAM therapies.</p>

<title>Recommendations for Future Research</title>
<p>As always, researchers are curious to know if the sample they studied is representative of a similar national sample. A larger study to determine the triage process other U.S. nurses use and their willingness to recommend TCM as a potential therapy could begin to standardize the triage process and establish a best practice for how nurses include CAM therapies in their recommendations. In a national study, nurses studied might need to be separated into subspecialty practice areas to determine how subspecialty area norms influence the ability of those nurses to discuss TCM with patients. Sociologists would be interested to learn how the frontstage role in subspecialty practices and reading cues influences nurses’ triage processes.</p>
<p>Another helpful study would specifically investigate the type of triage process nurse practitioners in the United States, Canada, and the United Kingdom use in consultation situations and how they include TCM recommendations in their triage processes. Knowledge of these processes could further enable establishment of a triage practice standard that would define when nurses need to integrate recommendations to alternative therapies despite their relationship with, or the cues they read from, individuals. This kind of research might need to involve a larger group of health care practitioners to flesh out issues related to who makes recommendations to CAM therapies, although that might become less of an issue as nurses are called to take on more primary care responsibilities in the future.</p>
