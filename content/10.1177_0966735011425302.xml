<abstract>
<p>The spiritual significance of ‘craft’, particularly the everyday acts of making in the ‘feminine’ sphere, has been neglected in mainstream theology and romanticized in feminist discourse. Drawing on literature, feminist theory and personal experience, this article considers how traditionally female crafts, such as knitting and sewing, are a form of self-expression, and a ‘being at home in the world’ which is both spiritually and politically empowering.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Recently my imagination was captured by the 2010 ‘A History of the World in 100 Objects’ programmes on Radio Four, part of a wider BBC and British Museum project. The programmes, narrated by the British Museum curator Neil McGregor, aim to ‘tell the story of our world through the things human beings have made over the last two million years,’ in partnership with web and community-based initiatives encouraging people to think about the historical and social significance of the things they own and use.</p>
<p>I liked the concept of the series, of understanding history through the stuff we make, because I am a knitter, and my love of that craft extends to an interest in the social history of textiles–and because there is something especially transportative and memorable about <italic>things</italic>, objects that can be touched, stroked, held, even if one never actually gets to hold them. I enjoy the odd little folk museums in rural locations around the country, run as labours of love by slightly eccentric locals, where one comes across the coal scuttles, wool carders, tobacco tins, harnesses, butter churns, and other things that give glimpses into the daily lives of ordinary people from the past. Yet these are artefacts from the relatively recent past. Listening to the second instalment of the ‘100 Objects’ series, I was astonished by the beauty and humanity of the 13,000 year-old ‘swimming reindeer’ sculpture, carved from mammoth tusk towards the end of the Ice Age. Looking on the website<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0966735011425302">1</xref></sup> at the image of that carving, I felt a doorway open to 13,000 years ago, the incredible quiet and harsh cold, the play of light on the water, the reindeer in mating season, a person watching, whittling at a bit of tusk. Even that long ago, people found moments in which to live, not just survive, to see the beauty in the world around them, and make beautiful things to represent it.</p>
<p>Thus I was particularly receptive to the deep velvety tones of Archbishop Rowan Williams, explaining on the programme what the swimming reindeer piece says to him about art and spirituality:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>What I think you see in the art of this period is human beings trying to enter fully into the flow of life around them, so that they become part of the whole process of animal life that’s going on around them, in a way which I think isn’t just about managing the animal world, or guaranteeing them success in hunting or whatever. I think it’s more than that. It’s really a desire to get inside and almost to be at home in the world at a deeper level, and I think that that’s actually a very deeply religious impulse, to be at home in the world.</p>
<p>[...]</p>
<p>With that, and in your identification with the processes of the world, you begin to understand or intuit what in the Old Testament (<italic>sic</italic>) is called “wisdom”, a kind of principle of cohesion or cohesiveness underlying it all, and you identify that eventually with the mind of God.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0966735011425302">2</xref></sup></p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>That phrase explaining the human desire to make things–‘to be at home in the world’–resonated with me, and stayed with me, and also helped to explain what ‘making things’ has meant to me.</p>
<p>For a large portion of my life I have just not wanted to <italic>be here</italic>: from about the age of 11, the world was charged with horror for me. A number of factors have been involved with the gradual easing of my clinical depression since my late teens, but it was through teaching myself to knit, in particular, that the world has become re-enchanted. One day when I was 18 years-old I decided, quite at random, to have a rummage through my mum’s old knitting needles and wool, and try to remember that which my grandmother taught me when I was six. With a bit of struggle, and my mum’s help, I did, and I made a scarf for my sister, then one for my friend Jess (purling as well!), then one for myself (made up of patches trying out lots of different stitches), then I made my friend Rosie a ‘Mini-Rosie’ doll, and since then I’ve carried on knitting and never stopped.</p>
<p>I am not sure why knitting, rather than any other craft, has so engaged me: I suppose because of its rhythmic, meditative nature; the fact that it employs some parts of the brain, but leaves the others free to concentrate on other things; the usefulness and enjoyableness of its products (clothes!), and that it can be simultaneously original and part of a long tradition. If something goes wrong, or is not working out as planned, knitting is quite easy to unravel and start again. Whilst a rather skewed perfectionism means that my other creative activities of writing and drawing/painting are fraught with the danger that if the end product is not very good I will feel like a useless human being, I am not nearly so bothered if a knitting project turns out hideously. I suppose this is because of the lesser status that knitting has as a creative art. It is less associated with the ego. My knitting has been a sustaining comfort and distraction during particularly difficult times, and more than anything it gives me a general sense of purpose; a structure to my life that might otherwise have been lacking. I always have something to do that I <italic>enjoy</italic>, something that keeps me engaged, and because I used not to enjoy anything much at all, that is very valuable. Being someone who makes material things has made me more attuned than I was to the beauty of the world, and more able to value beauty for its own sake. Knitting has helped me to <italic>become at home in the world</italic>, when depression made me want to leave the world, and Christianity told me that I should look beyond the world, that it was not of ultimate importance.</p>
<p>In evangelical circles, individuals share their ‘testimony,’ the narrative of how they became a Christian. Many gay people also have a ‘coming out story’. There seems something terribly silly about this knitter’s version of a coming out story, or testimony. But I’ve had those other stories, those other significant turning points of my life, and, ridiculous as it seems, I think that <italic>knitting</italic> may actually have been just as significant for my mental and spiritual health as becoming a Christian and accepting my sexuality. Yet why is that so surprising, so ‘silly’ or ‘ridiculous’? Writers often say far more solemn things about the impulse to write, musicians to play, artists to paint. Is it blasphemous, that making things out of loops of wool has almost certainly been better for me than any number of dogmas of the church? It may be that they–writing, knitting, praying–are not such different things, but all part of the same ‘entering into the flow of life,’ that intuiting of ‘the principle of cohesion underlying it all,’ that Rowan Williams talks about.</p>
<p>And if there still seems something rather silly about valuing knitting as part of the divine flow of life: why? Because (on the whole) knitting is not art, it does not make statements, it does not have immaterial meanings attached to it? Or because (on the whole) only women knit? This paper, on feminism and the spirituality inherent in making things, has come out of my joy in learning to ‘be at home in the world’ through creating with my hands. It is also the result of my profound irritation that academic theology fails to appreciate the value of small, ‘feminine’ acts of making, such as knitting.</p>
</sec>

<title>Theology, Craft and Gender</title>
<p>In recent scholarship there are some intimations of the importance of valuing our daily acts of making, against the overwhelming academic consensus that such things are essentially trivial and uninteresting. On the whole, it is the social sciences, with the emerging field of ‘material culture’, that have highlighted the ethical and spiritual significance of everyday objects and crafts (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0966735011425302">Dant, 1999</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0966735011425302">Miller, 2008</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0966735011425302">Morgan, 2005</xref>), with their place in religious practice examined by works such as Colleen McDannell’s <italic>Material Christianity: Religion and Popular Culture in America</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0966735011425302">1995</xref>) and the recent journal <italic>Material Religion</italic>. Theological and philosophical writing on the spirituality of creating material things usually focuses on high art, the paintings and sculptures deemed worthy of display in galleries, or the liturgical objects and spaces of the church. There is little interest in the things made carefully and patiently by anonymous craftspeople, let alone the things that the theologian might make themselves. In short, when theology does attend to the material things people have made, its concern is with ‘art,’ not ‘craft.’</p>
<p>A notable exception is theologian Stephen Pattison’s <italic>Seeing Things</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0966735011425302">2007</xref>), which argues for the ‘deepening of relations’ with the objects that we make and use. Pattison tells the story of how Western thought has widened the gap between persons and things, between the psycho-spiritual and the material, and how Protestant emphasis on the evils of idolatry has led to a profound mistrust of ‘giving more than instrumental significance to the work of human hands’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0966735011425302">2007</xref>: 159). He suggests that this must change, that this denies the place of material objects in ‘the human world of meaning, emotion and intention’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0966735011425302">2007</xref>: 187); there is an ethical imperative to coming ‘to love and respect the material world better, cherishing the objects within it’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0966735011425302">2007</xref>: 12). As such, Pattison is following Sallie McFague’s ecofeminist call for ‘subject-subject’, rather than ‘subject-object’, relations with material things (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0966735011425302">McFague, 1997</xref>: 47) and Jane Bennett’s assertion that to approach the material world with a ‘mood of enchantment’ is an ethical duty. Bennett explains it thus:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>how does an enchanted sensibility make it more likely that ethical principles will be enacted as ethical practices? [...] Enchantment is a feeling of being connected in an affirmative way to existence; it is to be under the momentary impression that the natural and cultural worlds offer gifts and, in so doing, remind us that it is good to be alive. This sense of fullness [...] encourages the finite human animal, in turn, to give away some of its own time and effort on behalf of other creatures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0966735011425302">Bennett, 2001</xref>: 156).</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Similarly, Daniel Miller observes that, rather than being a distraction from human relationships, the people who put most care and effort into the creation and preservation of material things are those who show the same care towards other people. From one particular family in his ethnographic study,</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>one learns the artisanal form of love, care and devotion, performed with such subtle grace, creativity and imagination that the ways persons become objects of care and objects become subjects of relationships blend imperceptibly with each other in the overall fullness and artistry of these lives (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0966735011425302">Miller, 2008</xref>: 31).</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Attentiveness to material objects is not a frivolous indulgence or a tedious chore, but part of an ethically and spiritually profound way of relating to the world, which is reflected in all aspects of life.</p>
<p>Pattison’s quietly impassioned plea for the religious re-evaluation of everyday objects and artefacts is primarily concerned with relating to things that someone else has made, rather than the practice of making things oneself. Here Pattison’s work does not depart from the vast majority of theological discourse on art, which, even when discussing the nature of creativity, tend do so from the perspective of the viewer rather than the maker. A recent work that does engage with the practice of making things is the philosopher Richard Sennett’s <italic>The Craftsman</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0966735011425302">2008</xref>). Sennett asserts an ethics of craftsmanship (<italic>sic)</italic> as ‘an enduring, basic human impulse, the desire to do a job well for its own sake’, which ‘focuses on objective standards, on the thing in itself’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0966735011425302">2008</xref>: 9). Making things, with care and skill, ‘represents the special human condition of being <italic>engaged</italic>’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0966735011425302">2008</xref>: 20), and Sennett extends the attitude of craft to work such as computer programming. He rejects his teacher Hannah Arendt’s distinction between <italic>animal laborans</italic>, who ‘takes the work as an end in itself’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0966735011425302">2008</xref>: 6) and <italic>homo faber</italic>, whose work is philosophical and political, its end beyond itself. Sennett proposes a balance, in which ‘thinking and feeling are contained within the process of making’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0966735011425302">2008</xref>: 7).</p>
<p>The most persuasive description I have come across of how thinking and feeling (and, in a sense, praying) are implicit in the process of making is that of the potter, Cecilia <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0966735011425302">Davis Cunningham (1995)</xref>. She writes that to be a craftsperson is to enact ‘certain basic values that have informed our humanity and seem worth nurturing.’ The craftsperson uses the ‘the basic materials of the earth’ and tools, skills and disciplines that ‘are part of a long common heritage,’ placing her self into this basic framework: ‘[i]t is the human self that enlarges the humanity of crafts’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0966735011425302">1995</xref>: 8). Making beautiful objects ‘is our modest way of reaffirming the beauty of the larger creation’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0966735011425302">1995</xref>: 10). This, and ‘in the rhythm of my life, the successes and failures of my work, and the constant search for aesthetic perfection,’ is ‘a way of being religious in the world’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0966735011425302">1995</xref>: 11).</p>
<p>It is worth noting that Davis Cunningham refers to herself as a crafts-<italic>person</italic>, whereas Sennett does not consider problematic the use of the term crafts-<italic>man</italic>. The issue is not simply the wider feminist critique of the word ‘man’ as referring to all humanity, but also the place of women in craft traditions. The type of crafts that the lofty notion of ‘craftsmanship’ generally pertains to have not, traditionally, been practised by women, and even the crafts that are today associated with the feminine (such as weaving) began to exclude women upon the establishment of professional artisan guilds (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0966735011425302">Wiesner, 1986</xref>). The popular, romantic image of the skilled craftsman, taking pride in his work, is masculine. In contrast, the terms ‘crafts’ and ‘hobbies’ seem to be interchangeable when it comes to the things that women make. In theological discourse, the symbol of the creator God as Craftsman is no less male than that of Father: if God is a potter, then the hands manipulating the clay belong to a man rather than a woman.</p>
<p>As many feminists, starting with Simone de Beauvoir, have pointed out, in the history of Western thought, men are culture and women are nature; it is men who <italic>create</italic>, in deliberate acts of making, whereas women <italic>generate</italic>: they give birth. Having diagnosed the culture/nature dualism, spiritual feminism has often wanted to choose one side of the divide rather than to dissolve it: saturated in the imagery of the natural, untouched by the social – moon, sea, soil, and so on–speaking of ‘technology’ as the evil tool of patriarchy that has subjugated women and the earth (for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0966735011425302">Griffin, 1978</xref>). Or spiritual feminist reclamation of traditional female crafts has tended to romanticize them as being closer to the natural and part of women’s birth-giving capacities, rather than part of the general human project of negotiating the world through tools and objects that are useful and beautiful. An example of this is the treatment of craft in Melissa Raphael’s <italic>Thealogy and Embodiment: The Post-Patriarchal Reconstruction of Female Sacrality</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0966735011425302">1996</xref>). Raphael is one of the few scholars working in theology to pay serious attention to the sacred quality of women’s acts of making, and she sometimes writes of it beautifully, for example in the foreword:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>[in writing this book] the everyday world began to tell me new and different stories. It began to be resacralized: the property of mediating the sacred was restored to it. The sacral significance of ordinary traditional domestic objects–brooms, cooking pots, needles and so forth–became points of entry into another (largely heretical) women’s religious history, carrying other meanings and other possibilities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0966735011425302">Raphael, 1996</xref>: 19).</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>I am in sympathy with Raphael’s project of restoring the ‘immanent divine intelligence of materiality’ through ‘erotic re-vision and re-mythologization of labour’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0966735011425302">Raphael, 1996</xref>: 128) and with spiritual feminism’s emphasis on ‘female embodiment and its connectedness with other natural forms’ as a ‘source of sacral empowerment’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0966735011425302">Raphael, 1996</xref>: 23). However, despite Raphael’s insistence that religious feminism uses biology as a <italic>metaphor</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0966735011425302">Raphael, 1996</xref>: 67) and that ‘the association of women and nature is not <italic>necessarily</italic> and of itself politically disabling’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0966735011425302">Raphael, 1996</xref>: 143), I find troubling how inextricably she links women’s acts of making to their child-bearing capacity, and this to the generativity of nature as a whole. Raphael’s critique of Western ‘logocentrism’–the ‘emphasis on the power of reason and language to bring things into existence’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0966735011425302">Raphael, 1996</xref>: 81)–results in her privileging ‘organic’ images of creativity over and against deliberate and rational making. This serves to distance embodied creativity–be it in birthing or in crafting–from the thinking and desiring of <italic>homo faber</italic>. This is especially so in Raphael’s naive distinction between the ‘soft’ female crafts of ‘cooking, spinning or weaving,’ as opposed to the male ‘hard’ technologies of butchering, mining, quarrying, and making stone and metal into tools for smashing, pounding, killing and dismembering’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0966735011425302">Raphael, 1996</xref>: 144)–as if, historically and practically, one were ever possible without the other. I would rather that feminist religious discourse sought a balance between the symbolism of natality and artistry.</p>
<p>This is gestured towards in certain moments of Sara Maitland’s magical realist novel <italic>Brittle Joys</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0966735011425302">1999</xref>), in which issues of gender, religion and craft tradition are significant themes. The novel is entitled after a phrase of St. Augustine: ‘in life we must struggle to hold on to brittle joys’ (Sermon III), and the divine yet brittle joys of this novel are beauty, making, and friendship, all of which are encapsulated in the substance of glass (which, like pottery, starts out ‘soft’ and ends up ‘hard’).</p>
<p>The protagonist, Ellie, is a successful and renowned glass-blower, a ‘craftsperson’ who will only employ other women in her studio as a matter of principle, but as a woman in the glass-blowing tradition she continually fears that her work will lapse into ‘prettiness,’ ‘dainty decoration rather than hard form’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0966735011425302">Maitland, 1999</xref>: 21). She insists that glass must be ‘beautiful, transcendent, technical’ rather than ‘pretty.’ To make glass is to be attuned to the sublime. It is also to give reality to thought, and prayer; this ‘every serious craftsperson must know [...], even if they did not have a vocabulary to say it’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0966735011425302">Maitland, 1999</xref>: 123). Ellie makes a glass tear as an act of mourning for each person that she loves who has died, placed it in a box along with the words ‘Jesus mercy, Mary pray,’ never shown to anyone, protected ‘from logic, from reason, and from egotism’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0966735011425302">Maitland, 1999</xref>: 144). The novel opens with a description of the glass-blowing process that emphasizes its character of performance and ritual:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Even though this was the fourth time they had repeated this routine that day, there was the perfect stillness of concentration, which framed and structured the continual movement and flow. It was beautiful and it was dangerous; a ritual and a gamble (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0966735011425302">Maitland, 1999</xref>: 3).</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Ellie is regularly visited by a guardian angel, whose wings, if they were material, would be made of glass, and who has always attended glassworkers. She shows Ellie significant moments in the history and mythology of glass, most of which are related to the divine in some way. One moment belongs to the daughter of Venice’s Murano glassworkers, who has run away to make glass of the kind they want in England:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Not playful, exuberant, airy, coloured, but serious, and so clear [...] that it must be engraved [...] or else you might not see it, but straight through it, like the Sacred Host through which the holy can see straight into the heart of God in Heaven. Glass like that. [...] It will be glass you can hold, turn in your hand [...] filling your hand so that the weight of your thoughts, and of your wines will be resting there, solid with meaning. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0966735011425302">Maitland, 1999</xref>: 52-53).</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Another is the Queen of Sheba, receiving from her glassworkers a dish that she will give to Solomon as a gift, but which will be lost during the exile, then found when the temple is restored. It will go on to bear the head of John the Baptist, then be used by Martha in preparing a meal for Jesus and his friends; he will use it as a blessing cup, ‘and it will become the Holy Grail, the great treasure of the Cathedral Church of San Lorenzo in Genoa’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0966735011425302">Maitland, 1999</xref>: 173). The grand moments of religious history and material objects of beauty are interrelated, part of the same scheme of things.</p>
<p>The blowing of glass was first invented in Palestine ‘at the time when BC and AD met’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0966735011425302">Maitland, 1999</xref>: 147), and Maitland uses this historical fact, playfully yet profoundly, to imagine the first glass blower as a young woman who, blowing down a tube to inflate the molten glass on the end of it, ‘does something very simple that has never been done before’ and transfers the bubble of glass onto another rod, closes the air hole and removes the tube:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Lying on the leather that covers her hand is a sphere, her glowing blue, light-refracting, light-distorting bubble, free of the rod, free and filled with inspiration. It has a navel, a small round scar, that joins it to her and to history, but she has set it free.</p>
<p>She hears a tender, mocking, everlasting angel voice say to her, “Do not be afraid Mary, for you have found favour with God.”</p>
<p>She is pregnant, breathed into, inspired by the spirit. This is the annunciation.</p>
<p>There is a silence at this conception, as intense as the sun, as deep as the blue lake, as translucent as glass, and deep within the blue there is a flash of lightning... (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0966735011425302">Maitland, 1999</xref>: 227).</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Here the moment of divine incarnation is portrayed as a moment of enchantment, a woman’s inspiration in artistic creativity part of her bodily capacity to nurture new life.</p>

<title>Embroidery and Textiles: Memory and Self-Expression</title>
<p>As I write this I am planning a cross stitch sampler. I want to represent in tiny squares of embroidery silk the place I still call home, the place where my mother lives: Tankerton-on-Sea, with its colourful beach huts, sea gulls, windbreakers, stones, limpets and sailboats. This imagined sampler will hang in what was my bedroom, which we are in the process of redecorating. The room is being rearranged and repainted and, when finished, will no longer contain any traces of my teenage self, now that all my things are in my flat in Glasgow, or else my father’s loft. The redecoration will make it a nice room for me, and other guests, to sleep in, but it will also perhaps increase the house’s attractiveness to any prospective buyers when my mum comes to sell it in a couple of years time, after my youngest brother is settled at university.</p>
<p>My family has lived in this house since I was two, and all three of my siblings were born here–one of my brothers quite literally, in my parents’ bedroom. When the house is sold I expect we will feel a great sense of loss, not only because of the person-like relationship that people have with their homes (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0966735011425302">Miller, 2008</xref>), but also because it will represent with great finality the end of our family, in the form that it took when we were still children and when our parents were still married to each other.</p>
<p>I have chosen to redecorate the room with a theme appropriate to the house’s seaside location, the size of the room (tiny), and that most marketable aspect of Whitstable and Tankerton – beach huts, sailing, oysters, and so on. Yet I have to admit that I have not chosen this theme just because of its saleability, but also as a way of managing the emotions stirred by the passing away of my old bedroom: in decorating the room in a manner particular to where it is, and with a child-like design theme, I am commemorating my childhood on this beach, my growing up, my moving on; recreating and mourning at the same time. A sampler is a particularly apt medium for this: in cross stitch, complex and multi-faceted realities are reproduced in charmingly stylized and simple icons, arranged in a composition that commemorates a place or an event. Cross stitch is also significant to my particular childhood in this house, in which hung my mother’s samplers celebrating the births of all four children, my parents’ wedding, and ‘home sweet home.’</p>
<p>As teenagers, when showing in friends who had not been to the house before, my sister and I would explain all the samplers and other embroideries and tapestries on the wall with the throwaway line, ‘Mum was bored in the 80s.’ I suppose there is some truth to this; after all there was in a marked decrease in her needlework production after she went back to university once we were all at school, and stitching must have been a way for her to stay sane during all those years at home with the children. But there is also something dismissive in that explanation of the painstaking and beautiful work that hung throughout our house–that the needlework of stay-at-home mothers is an activity done to stave off boredom, not an artistic endeavour deserving of merit. This encapsulates how ‘women’s work’ has long been regarded by society: as trivial, as craft, as a hobby rather than an art.</p>
<p>My mother’s stitching was not just a convenient activity easy to put down and pick up again inbetween changing nappies, a quiet hobby that wouldn’t disturb sleeping children. It was also an act of meaning-making, of self-expression during a period of her life when she was not (due to the constraints of family and church expectations) able to express herself more loudly or fluently. It was a way of marking and remembering significant occasions in her life. Similarly, I, despite being a somewhat scruffy and impatient needle worker, plan to stitch a sampler celebrating the place where I grew up, because it seems a constructive means of expressing my feelings about changes and losses I have no control over, a way of ritualizing these important events and emotions.</p>
<p>Needlework is one of the few crafts that has–throughout history and across cultures–been practised almost exclusively by women. Its importance in women’s self-expression and commemoration has been well-documented in feminist historical, anthropological and literary scholarship, but this has had to contend with the negative and dismissive attitude that many–male and female–hold towards sewing as trivial, pointless ‘busywork’ (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0966735011425302">Goggin, 2009a</xref>). For feminist thinkers in particular, the work of the needle has represented the difficulties in negotiating with our mothers’ legacy, both in terms of women’s history and relationship with actual mothers. The ‘mothers’ of women’s writing, the heroines of nineteenth century literature–both the writers and their fictional characters–were often portrayed as making a choice between the needle and the pen, between a life of domesticity, symbolized by the needle, or a self-determined life in the public sphere, as represented by the pen, as Elaine <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0966735011425302">Hedges (1991)</xref> has discussed. Yet others argue that this is a false dichotomy, that needlework has functioned (and continues to function) ‘not as an <italic>alternative to</italic> discourse, but as a <italic>form of discourse</italic>’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0966735011425302">Pritash, Schaechterle, and Wood, 2009</xref>:14). While women stitched for economic and social reasons, they also made personal statements with their work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0966735011425302">Pritash, Schaechterle, and Wood, 2009</xref>:15). They were able to take delight in ‘t]he power to perform magic with a needle,’ a power that comes through ‘familiarity with stitches: with their structure, with hand movements required to make them and with their seemingly infinite variation’ (Jennifer Wearden, 1999, <italic>Samplers from the Victoria and Albert Museum</italic>, quoted in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0966735011425302">Goggin, 2009a</xref>: 4).</p>
<p>The way that needlework may be for women a form of discourse, an opportunity for self-expression, is given stark representation in the 1830 piece of work by a 17 year-old woman named Elizabeth Parker, who wrote the story of her life so far–including unnamed abuses at the hands of her employer and the temptation to commit suicide–in tiny red stitches on a linen background (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0966735011425302">Goggin, 2009b</xref> and the Victoria and Albert Museum website<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0966735011425302">3</xref></sup>). The piece opens with the words ‘[a]s I cannot write I put this down simply and freely as I might speak to a person to whose intimacy and tenderness I can fully intrust myself.’ Obviously the meaning of ‘I cannot write’ does not refer to illiteracy, but perhaps to the differing status of needle and thread from pen and ink. Each letter is made up of about 12 cross stitches (hence double that number, due to the way cross-stitch is worked) and the piece would have taken a tremendous amount of patience and skill, even though it reads like a spontaneous outpouring of terrible emotion, couched in biblical terms–‘which way can I turn oh whither must I flee to find the Lord wretch that I am [...] what will become of me ah me what will become of me’. It is both a testament to secret trauma and an anguished prayer, ending with the words,</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>God be merciful to me a sinner but oh how can I expect mercy who went on in sin [...] remind me of my wickedness for with shame I returned to thee O God because I had nowhere else to go how can such repentance as mine be sincere what will become of my soul.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>This piece is unique, and not at all typical of women’s self-expression in embroidery, but as well as being an intriguing and moving artefact of a woman’s life, it symbolizes how needlework has been more than a way of making a living (for the working classes) and relieving boredom (for the middle and upper classes), but as a means for women to express who they are, what has happened to them and what is important to them.</p>
<p>For North American feminists, it has not been embroidery, but quilts, that has most encapsulated their ambivalence towards the domestic material culture of women’s lives. Quilting–also known as piecework or patchwork–has played a central role in the construction of American identity and in the lives of American women (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0966735011425302">Torsney, 1993</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0966735011425302">Torsney and Elsley, 1994</xref>). Women would make quilts for themselves and for their friends and family, together and on their own, to mark life’s most profound events. As such, they are associated with the cycles of birth, marriage and death; they also have a life-cycle of their own, ‘conceived, incubated and brought into being’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0966735011425302">Gordon and Horton, 2009</xref>: 94). A ‘friendship quilt,’ with blocks made and inscribed by different women, often from their old clothes, was ‘not just a reminder of one’s family or friends, but an embodied material representation of their relationships with the recipient’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0966735011425302">Gordon and Horton, 2009</xref>: 94).</p>
<p>This image of women constructing something new together from fragments of experience and scraps of doctrinal and textual traditions has proved attractive to feminist theologians such as Mary <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0966735011425302">Hunt (1991)</xref> and Rebecca <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0966735011425302">Chopp (1995)</xref>. Chopp writes that metaphors of quilting ‘underscore the history of women’s lives in western culture, but also [...] locate the very identity of theology in the context of functional warmth, of common beauty, of daily practices’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0966735011425302">1995</xref>: 74-75). There is a lovely truth to this image of the project of religious feminism, but it is perhaps too cosy and idealistic, forgetting the ways in which quilts were shaped by their culture’s economic and racist oppression. I also think it tends to gloss over the pricked fingers, the worn eyesight, the unkindness and petty rivalry that women can be capable of. Any completed friendship quilt probably contains within its threads a fair share of muttering that one member of the group has not cut her pieces as neatly as everyone else, or that another’s stitches are too big, or that they went along with a certain design because one member of the group argued more loudly than everyone else. A more honest portrayal of quilting probably could provide a more honest imaging of feminist theology. It is often the case that women’s literature is better able than feminist theology to grapple with the more troubling and ambivalent aspects of women’s lives, and some of the quilt’s many literary appearances use it as an image to explore the difficulties involved in piecing together women’s history and identity.</p>
<p>Margaret Atwood’s novel <italic>Alias Grace</italic> (1996), a reimagining of the historical Victorian murderess Grace Marks, takes quilting as a central image, with each chapter named after and illustrating a traditional patchwork pattern. In prison Grace stitches together quilts for the governor’s family and, in interviews with the psychologist attempting to ‘solve’ her case, she accesses her memories through the materials of embroidery, lace, dresses and quilts. By the end of the novel she has secured a place in society that allows her to make a quilt of her own. This quilt will include fabric from her old clothes, and those of the two people she murdered: the book ends with the words ‘And we will all be together again.’ Here there is something chilling about the quilt as an embodiment of friendship and memory.</p>
<p>Another incarcerated seamstress features in Cheryl B. Torsney’s essay, ‘ “Everyday Use”: My Sojourn at Parchman Farm’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0966735011425302">1993</xref>) in which she reflects on her visit to an African-American quilter in the famous Mississippi prison, and its effect on her reading of the well-known Alice Walker short story, ‘Everyday Use.’ The prisoner, Lucille Sojourner, learned to quilt shortly after the start of her life sentence, selling her quilts to send money to her seven children, none of whom visit her. The violent backdrop to this stereotypically peaceful pastime is summed up by an incident in which her free-standing quilt frame was broken up and the pieces used as clubs in a fight amongst the women prisoners. Lucille spends the entire day quilting, stitching by hand rather than by machine, despite the bruises to her fingers. When asked why she does it, she replies, ‘unhesitatingly,’ that ‘[i]t gives me constellation’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0966735011425302">Torsney, 1993</xref>: 70). She may well have meant to say ‘consolation,’ but the malapropism further compounds how quilting provides order, meaning and light to a life otherwise devoid of these; though it is not a mere hobby, and she was very insulted when a prison officer suggested she make her a quilt for free. For Torsney, a New York Jewish woman teaching literature at a Mississippi university, this meeting reinscribed the issues of race and class inherent in Walker’s short story. ‘Everyday Use’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0966735011425302">1994</xref>) tells of a young, radical black woman’s visit to her mother and sister, dismissive of them and their rural life whilst romanticizing their ‘African’ heritage, symbolized by her desire to take away to hang on the wall of her city apartment the quilt that her mother and sister have ‘in everyday use’ on a bed.</p>
<p>This story is about African-American women’s relationship with their history and their mothers, but it can also be read as representative of all the attempts of all feminisms to engage with their foremothers’ needlework–wanting to bestow value on it with the term ‘art,’ while not really understanding what it is for and why it was made. When we peer at cross stitch and caress old quilts, thinking that this brings us back in touch with our ‘heritage’ of women’s work of embroidery and quilting, we must bear in mind that we are making our own samplers and patchwork, altering complex realities for signification in tiny stitches; cutting life’s fabric into pre-determined shapes and sizes, stitching them together along rigorously straight lines. This does not render worthless attempts to re-member women through interpretation of and interaction with their needlework–but these projects can only ever be partially completed, with many gaps in the seams. This is well expressed by Kate Davies, lecturer in English Literature and author of ‘Needled,’ a popular textiles blog, as she describes the experience of unpicking the stitching of a piece of vintage needlework:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>In cutting someone else’s threads, as in wearing someone else’s clothes, there is the frisson of encounter. We don’t know and will never know the person who made or wore the thing, but they are speaking to us nonetheless, in the movement of their hand through the stitches, or in the shape of their body left in the garment. There is something deeply uncanny in the silence of cloth and clothes: the trace of an unknown and never-to-be-known physical presence. [...] As I unpicked the stitches, then, a simple encounter between me and the cloth changed into a more complex one between me and its maker. Because I was un-making a made thing my act seemed an intimate one, but it was an empty intimacy, an intimacy with no content. The embroidered cloth was both speaking and not speaking: of a someone living in those stitches and of the silence of the grave (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0966735011425302">Davies, 2009</xref>).</p>

<title>Knitting and Politics in the Twenty-first Century</title>
<p>I am not unusual in being a young, educated woman who has found enjoyment and satisfaction in knitting: the twenty-first century has seen a resurgence in the popularity of craft, and knitting in particular has been embraced by younger women. In the ‘new wave’ of crafting, making things by hand is regarded as a way of expressing oneself and connecting with foremothers and a previous way of life. Yet it is also about making statements about the present and the future: in other words, knitting has become political.</p>
<p>Despite the flaws in Melissa Raphael’s exposition of spiritual feminism’s reclaiming of craft, I find helpful her definition of feminist crafting as ‘an act of spiritual-political dissent and as a form and metaphor of transformatory praxis’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0966735011425302">Raphael, 1996</xref>: 138). At the time she wrote these words–1996–this would only have applied to the craft practice of a relatively small number of women in the West, mostly within the goddess movement and New Age subcultures. In the first decade of twenty-first century, however, the concept of craft as dissent from consumerism, and as something spiritually empowering for women, has had much wider currency. Among young women in North America and Western Europe, making things by hand has become an important mode of self-expression, locus of community and resistance to capitalist modes of production. The DIY ethic and aesthetic has been formed by punk as much as the green movement, by Naomi Klein’s <italic>No Logo</italic> as well as E.F. Schumacher’s <italic>Small Is Beautiful</italic>. The ‘Craftifesto’ printed in <italic>Handmade Nation: The Rise of DIY, Art, Craft and Design</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0966735011425302">Levine and Heimerl, 2008</xref>):</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>The power is in your hands!...</p>
<p>Craft is powerful – we want to show the depth and breadth of the crafting world. Anything you want you can probably get from a person in your own community.</p>
<p>Craft is personal – to know that something is made by hand, by someone who cares that you like it, makes that object much more enjoyable.</p>
<p>Craft is political – we’re trying to change the world. We want everyone to rethink corporate culture and consumerism.</p>
<p>Craft is possible – everybody can create something!!</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Powerful, personal, political...the poetics of feminism has never been far away from that of the contemporary craft movement, and the book that has done most to encourage the resurgence of what is probably the most popular of those crafts–<italic>Stitch ‘n’Bitch: The Knitter’s Handbook</italic>–was by the editor of the feminist magazine <italic>Bust</italic>, Debbie Stoller. In the introduction to her book of knitting techniques and patterns, Stoller explicitly links knitting with feminism, as a source of pleasure and connection between women:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Whenever I would take up the needles I would feel myself connected not only to my own mother, grandmother and great-grandmother, but also to the women who had developed the craft, the women who had known, as I did, the incredible satisfaction and sense of serenity that could come from the steady, rhythmic click-click-click of one’s knitting needles. [...]</p>
<p>Betty Friedan and other like-minded feminists had overlooked an important aspect of knitting when they viewed it simply as part of women’s societal obligation to serve everyone around them–[...] that knitting served the knitter as well (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0966735011425302">2003</xref>: 9).</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>What has most distinguished the contemporary resurgence of knitting from other revivals, such as in the 1950s or 1980s, is in its becoming a communal practice among (mainly) women, with the knitting groups (many named after Stoller’s book) that have sprung up all over America and then Europe, and online, such as the e-zine <italic>Knitty,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0966735011425302">4</xref></sup></italic> and now with the social-networking and cataloguing site <italic>Ravelry</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0966735011425302">5</xref></sup> Knitters get together–usually in public places such as pubs or cafes–to discuss projects, yarns, patterns and techniques, but mostly just to knit together and talk about their lives. As a group made up mostly of women, the knitting circle may be like a twenty-first century version of the consciousness-raising group. Admittedly, as the popularity of contemporary knitting has increased, I would think that it has had an inverse effect on the proportion of its practitioners that expressly link knitting with politics. However, there is something encouraging to the values of feminism about women getting together regularly, doing something because they enjoy it, and clothing themselves in a manner counter to disposable and sweatshop-produced fashion.</p>
<p>There is, whether intentionally or unintentionally, a political aspect to the fact that most contemporary knitting groups meet in public. As an activity that is unusual, countercultural and challenges common notions of what sort of person knits, knitting in public is ‘micro-revolutionary.’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0966735011425302">6</xref></sup> Not only knitting groups, but also individual knitters, for example, on public transport, often note that strangers are more likely to start talking to them–to ask what they are making, or reminiscence about learning to knit as a child. This is subversive because people on trains and buses often do not talk to one another: the knitting makes a point of contact between people in a world that is so often very isolated and isolating. The rhetoric of public knitting also applies to the more deliberately political and subversive activity of ‘knit graffiti’ or ‘yarn bombing,’ in which knitted pieces are surreptitiously placed on statues, lamp-posts, railings, and so on, as a cheeky way to add warmth to the human environment. ‘Knitta,’ the Texas-based group thought to have originated the practice, explain it thus: ‘we are wrapping things with love. It’s humanizing. We’re adding a human element so you are not disconnected with your everyday environment’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0966735011425302">Levine and Heimerl, 2008</xref>: 100).</p>
<p>The reclaiming of the urban landscape from the depersonalizing aspects of modern society leads back to the deeply spiritual import of acts of making as a means of reconnecting with the world. It emphasizes that ‘being at home in the world’ through acts of making is not only fulfilling for the individual person, but for society as a whole.</p>
