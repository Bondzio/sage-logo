<p>Dear Colleagues,</p>
<p>This first issue of Volume 18 reflects the diverse challenges and opportunities in correctional health care today. Although the need for services continues to increase, fiscal constraints have required programs and practitioners to do more with less. Diminished resources and budget constraints have heightened the focus on the development of partnerships with community providers and programs to fill the gap. Volume 18 will seek to highlight successful corrections and community health partnerships that can serve as best practice models. We will seek to provide you with insights and examples to enable you to sustain critical programs and help inmates link to community services upon release. In an era of budget deficits and service reductions, it is more critical than ever for correctional health to be recognized as a major contributor in maintaining the health of the larger community. Not an easy task in any situation, but particularly daunting in rural communities. I encourage you to share your successes and insights in case studies, best practices, or commentaries.</p>
<p>The <italic>Journal</italic>’s goal is to publish articles of relevance to the day-to-day practice of correctional health care. As a peer-reviewed journal, it depends on the quality of the manuscript reviews made by independent reviewers. Our peer review process is blinded and is strictly confidential. Qualified expert reviewers are essential in helping us maintain our editorial standards. The purpose of peer review is to provide the editor with an expert opinion about the quality of the manuscript under consideration. A review should also give authors constructive feedback on how to improve their papers so they are acceptable for publication. As editor, I rely on peer reviewers to help me select manuscripts and to encourage and help authors to strengthen their papers to meet our publication criteria.</p>
<p>A reviewer considers these aspects of the manuscript:
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item>
<p>Quality: Importance of the subject, originality of the work, appropriateness of the methodology and analysis, quality of the data, soundness of the interpretations and conclusions, relevance of the discussion, and comprehensiveness of the references</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Presentation: Appropriateness of the title, quality of the abstract, writing standard, organization of the paper, its length, and quality and usefulness of the figures and tables</p>
</list-item>
</list>
</p>
<p>Additional reviewers are needed in all subject matter areas. If interested, please send a copy of your CV and areas of expertise to thejchc@bellsouth.net.</p>
<p>The <italic>Journal</italic> will continue to feature original research, case studies, best practices, and literature reviews, and to publish more frequent “special emphasis” sections to keep correctional health professionals up-to-date on trends and developments important to their field. I believe you will find this issue very informative, and I welcome and appreciate your comments.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>John R. Miles, MPA</p>
<p>Editor</p>
