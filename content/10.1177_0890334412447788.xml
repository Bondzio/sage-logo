<p>They say write what you know, so, erring on the side of safety with <italic>JHL</italic>’s first special issue under my tenure, I chose a theme I thought I knew: the Baby-Friendly Hospital Initiative. However, as submissions started to trickle in, I soon realized that what I “knew” was US-centric and hospital bound, and it ultimately amounted to little more than an admirable ability to correctly position the hyphen in Baby-Friendly.</p>
<p>Trickle soon turned torrent, and Special Reports, Reviews, and Original Research swept in with an exhilarating array of international perspectives. Although multiple nations still struggle with basic implementation, even recognition, of the Baby-Friendly Hospital Initiative, in others, Baby-Friendly postpartum care is the established norm. In “early initiator” nations, federal, regional, and volunteer-based organizations are collaborating around the World Health Organization (WHO)’s 2009 mandate,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0890334412447788">1</xref></sup> to bring the Baby-Friendly Initiative into neonatal intensive care and take it out to the community. Special reports in this <italic>JHL</italic> include a historical perspective from Norway; news from the Nordic/Quebec international working group on the Baby-Friendly Neonatal Intensive Care Unit initiative; and a description of Italy’s Baby-Friendly Community Initiative, which recently accredited its first Baby-Friendly Community, the Regional Health Authority of Milan. The RoundTable offers additional insights from 5 nations on Baby-Friendly activity, from Singapore’s new legislation banning free formula in maternity hospitals to the UK’s accreditation of university courses.</p>
<p>Interestingly, issues around reassessment and recertification exist in “early initiator” and “under initiator” nations alike. Where Baby-Friendly care is the norm, it can be a struggle to enforce recertification, or even to keep Baby-Friendly on the national agenda, once a “been there, done that” mentality settles in. In some parts of the globe, an initial WHO-inspired push for BFHI certification was not followed by ongoing quality assurance, calling into question the legitimacy of currently accredited sites. And almost everywhere, the 2009 updates mean many established sites must meet higher standards for re-accreditation,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0890334412447788">1</xref></sup> which can present motivational challenges for certified hospitals that need to make improvements—without the impetus, excitement, or reward of becoming Baby-Friendly for the first time.</p>
<p>Although the 2009 changes have brought us all more into line, international variation in Baby-Friendly standards does exist. Currently, not all nations enforce a 75% exclusivity rate for hospital certification, and although to breast “within 1 hour” is standard in some places, the WHO version of the Ten Steps still recommends infants go to breast “within one half hour of birth.”<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0890334412447788">2</xref></sup> Aficionados we are, but eyebrows are occasionally raised over perceived “lower standards” in “other places” and comments like, “It takes them a whole hour in Nation X!” versus “In Nation Y, they shove those babies onto the breast before they’re ready!” are not unheard of!</p>
<p>United, however, in the fight for optimal mother-infant care, we can surely foster a flexible, “<italic>vive la différence</italic>” attitude. Inevitable disparities do exist, in a world where poorer nations doggedly persist with no resources, endemic HIV, and the renewed attentions of the infant formula industry; in a world where, in one European breastfeeding desert, a group of volunteer physicians runs the national Baby-Friendly Hospital Initiative from a private home, whereas almost literally down the street, the government takes responsibility in a nation with sky-high breastfeeding rates.</p>
<p>Reassuringly, amid expansion, adaptation, struggles, and successes, regardless of whether we are planning national electronic recertification systems or convincing truculent colleagues that breast milk is good for babies, the timeless simplicity of the Ten Steps keeps the initiative grounded and consistent. Thanks to their universality, the Baby-Friendly Hospital Initiative thrives as one of the greatest international health initiatives ever, uniting clinicians, researchers, and advocates around a simple set of guidelines, with the unique purpose of creating healthier human beings from day 1. And it works. As former <italic>JHL</italic> Editor in Chief Jane Heinig said in a previous editorial, “In one area, we appear to have the closest thing to a consensus opinion as is possible in clinical science; nearly all of the studies indicate that implementation of Baby-Friendly Hospital policies results in increased breastfeeding rates.”<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0890334412447788">3</xref></sup> Long may the Baby-Friendly Initiative flourish under our united, untiring international collaboration.</p>
