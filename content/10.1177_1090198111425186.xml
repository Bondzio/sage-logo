<abstract>
<p><italic>Background.</italic> Quitlines offer evidence-based, multisession coaching support for smoking cessation in the 50 U.S. states, Canada, and several other countries. Smokers who enroll in quitline services have, <italic>ipso facto</italic>, shown readiness to attempt to quit, but noncompletion of coaching services appears widespread and has not been widely investigated. The current study explored the magnitude and correlates of quitline service abandonment. <italic>Method.</italic> A state’s quitline intake, coaching, and nicotine patch/gum utilization data were obtained for smokers who enrolled during the period July 2007 to June 2008 (<italic>n</italic> = 20,882). Analyses examined demographic, socioeconomic status, nicotine dependence-related, and nicotine replacement therapy—utilization factors associated with completion of only one coaching session (of five offered). <italic>Results.</italic> Almost half of enrollees (47.8%) completed only one session. All significant predictors together explained less than 4% of variance; not being sent nicotine replacement therapy was most strongly correlated with completion of only one session. A framework is proposed for directing research toward reducing quitline service nonadherence. <italic>Conclusions.</italic> Premature user abandonment of coaching calls is widespread within a quitline. Further research should determine the extent of the problem in national quitline systems, increase knowledge of mediators of nonadherence, and develop strategies for increasing coaching completion.</p>

<body>
<p>Telephone quitlines (QLs) provide tobacco cessation treatment that is effective compared with minimal or no counseling or self-help (odds ratio = 1.6, 95% confidence interval = 1.4-1.8), and QL–medication combination therapy is more effective than medication alone (odds ratio = 1.3, 95% confidence interval = 1.1-1.6; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1090198111425186">Fiore et al., 2008</xref>). Optimal QL service timing and duration have not been established, but experimental studies have found better outcomes with delivery of more than one counseling or coaching session (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1090198111425186">Stead, Perera, &amp; Lancaster, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1090198111425186">Zhu et al., 1996</xref>). Similarly, quit rates are higher among callers who self-select multiple sessions versus one session (25.6% vs. 16.1%, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1090198111425186">Zhu, Melcer, et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1090198111425186">Zhu, Tedeschi, et al., 2000</xref>).</p>
<p>Although national guidelines in the United States recommend at least four sessions with 90 minutes total contact time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1090198111425186">Fiore et al., 2008</xref>), multisession QL coaching services are rarely completed. In a trial of three versus five sessions, with and without additional “booster” calls, only 1 in 10 study participants completed all assigned sessions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1090198111425186">Rabius, Pike, Hunter, Wiatrek, &amp; McAlister, 2007</xref>). The average number of completed calls is often half or less of the available sessions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1090198111425186">An et al., 2006</xref>). In one California study, 21% of callers (who also received nicotine replacement therapy [NRT]) discontinued after one counseling call (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1090198111425186">Zhu, Melcer, et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1090198111425186">Zhu, Tedeschi, et al., 2000</xref>), and in another, approximately one third did not complete the first scheduled counseling session (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1090198111425186">Zhu et al., 1996</xref>).</p>
<p>Studies of treatment nonadherence may be guided by a World Health Organization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1090198111425186">WHO, 2003</xref>) framework, which was based on a critical review across chronic conditions. The framework identifies five interrelated domains of adherence factors: patient, condition, therapy, health system/health care team, and social/economic context. Although not explicitly guided by this framework, most of the considerable research on nonadherence has focused on patient factors across a variety of medical treatments and contexts. Despite this emphasis on patient factors, nonadherent patient subpopulations remain hard to predict (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1090198111425186">Bosworth, Weinberger, &amp; Oddone, 2006</xref>). Demographics typically do not strongly predict adherence, according to a meta-analysis across diseases and conditions including diabetes, cardiovascular disease, cancer, and infectious disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1090198111425186">DiMatteo, 2004</xref>). There are exceptions, though. In studies of antihypertensive medication or medications in general among older patients, nonadherence was more common among Blacks than among Whites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1090198111425186">Bosworth, Dudley, et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1090198111425186">Gerber, Cho, Arozullah, &amp; Lee, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>Cognitive and psychosocial factors may also play a role in treatment nonadherence. A systematic overview of research on adherence to chronic disease treatment found nonadherence related to issues with managing the treatment regimen (such as forgetting), cognitive motivation, symptoms, and social support (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1090198111425186">Dunbar-Jacob et al., 2000</xref>).</p>
<p>The few studies of adherence to smoking cessation treatment suggest that demographic, smoking, and quitting characteristics may predict adherence. A randomized controlled study of prescription smoking cessation medications identified younger age, not achieving abstinence for at least 2 weeks, and more prequit cigarettes per day (CPD) as predictors of nonadherence (defined as not taking at least one dose of the medication for at least 80% of days in the 12-week treatment; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1090198111425186">Hays, Leischow, Lawrence, &amp; Lee, 2010</xref>). A population-based study of NRT use in Colorado found that certain demographic subpopulations, including adults younger than 45 years, non-Latino non-Whites, and people with low socioeconomic status (SES; &lt;200% poverty level) were more likely to discontinue treatment for reasons other than quitting smoking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1090198111425186">Burns &amp; Levinson, 2008</xref>). Other factors associated with nonadherence may include higher cigarette consumption and nicotine dependence, failure to stop or reduce smoking during treatment, and depression or other psychiatric comorbidities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1090198111425186">WHO, 2003</xref>). Finally, treatment intensity may play a role; one intervention study found that smokers who received “community care” consisting of a self-help and referral had lower rates of initiating and continuing cessation medications compared with a group receiving face-to-face counseling in an autonomy- and competence-supportive manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1090198111425186">Williams et al., 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>To our knowledge, no study has investigated reasons for QL service nonadherence. The current study used existing data to explore available demographic, smoking, and quitting characteristics as potential correlates of nonadherence to QL coaching calls. Based on published studies, we expected that lower SES, higher nicotine dependence and being younger would be associated with higher rates of nonadherence; the magnitude of the association as well as associations of other covariates with QL nonadherence were largely unknown based on little published evidence.</p>
<sec id="section1-1090198111425186" sec-type="methods">
<title>Method</title>
<p>Institutional review board approval was obtained for secondary analysis of one state’s existing data maintained by a multi-state QL provider (National Jewish Health, Denver, Colorado). The study period was July 2007-June 2008. The study population included callers who enrolled in the QL program during the study period, smoked cigarettes, and were 18 years or older. Participants with more than one enrollment during the period were limited to the most recent enrollment.</p>
<p>The free coaching program included five sessions, and enrollment was a prerequisite to receipt of free NRT. The first, smoker-initiated QL call began with intake data collection (demographics, contact information), then usually transitioned directly into the first coaching session which included collection of additional smoking and cessation history variables. A total of approximately 30 questions were asked throughout this initial session, requiring at least 30 minutes to complete. Subsequent sessions were proactively initiated by a coach at scheduled times based on participant preference. Coaches made up to three call attempts to conduct a scheduled session; if no contact was made, the participant was disenrolled but could reactivate enrollment by calling the QL. Free NRT was offered to all eligible enrollees during the first call and mailed to the participant’s home address; physician approval to receive NRT was required for enrollees with heart conditions, uncontrolled hypertension, or pregnant smokers. The amount of NRT was determined by smoking level: 4-week supplies for ≤20 CPD, up to 8-week supplies (in two separate mailings) for &gt;20 CPD. Self-help materials were mailed to all enrollees.</p>
<p>Coaches were college graduates who were trained in a 3-week curriculum on addiction, tobacco cessation techniques, motivational interviewing, customer service, and working with different cultural and disparate populations. Coaching content was based on Clinical Practice Guidelines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1090198111425186">Fiore et al., 2000</xref>), which support smokers to develop confidence and coping skills for quitting. The initial coaching session included setting a quit date, planning the cessation process, and ordering NRT (if appropriate). Subsequent session protocols were tailored to the enrollee’s stage of change and status in the process of quitting. Prepare sessions completed and extended the quit plan, verified receipt and proper use of NRT (if appropriate), and discussed coping strategies. Support sessions included updating quit status and NRT use, reinforcing NRT benefits, and addressing problem-solving skills. Support/relapse sessions addressed barriers to long-term abstinence, lessons from past quit attempts, and motivation for quitting again after relapse.</p>
<p>For the current study, descriptive and regression analyses were conducted in 2009 using SAS 9.2 (SAS Institute, Inc., Cary, NC). Descriptive analysis compared proportions of available characteristics with number of completed coaching sessions (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1090198111425186">Table 1</xref>). For logistic regression analysis, the outcome of interest was number of completed coaching sessions, coded dichotomously as one vs. more than one session, because almost half of participants completed only the initial session. Potential predictors of completing only one session included available demographic characteristics (age, sex, race/ethnicity, sexual orientation, children in home, rurality); SES (education, insurance status); smoking characteristics (CPD, time to first morning cigarette, living with a smoker, motivation to quit); cessation history (number of previous quit attempts, quit attempts in the past year); origin of first QL contact (self-initiated or fax referred by a health provider); and whether NRT was mailed. Based on preliminary results of NRT mailing analysis, a further post hoc analysis examined medical conditions (heart conditions, pregnancy) that required physician approval to receive NRT. All contrasts and tests used two-sided <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05 as the significance criterion.</p>

<p>A multivariate regression model was built by examining each potential predictor (covariates with significant chi-square associations from <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1090198111425186">Table 1</xref>) separately and adding univariately significant predictors in a forward stepwise manner.

<title>Results</title>
<p>Study participants were more often female (57.9%), aged 25 to 44 years (46.7%) or 45 to 64 (34.3%), White (68.8%), and nonrural residents (83.4%); the majority smoked ≤20 CPD (74.0%), smoked within 30 minutes of waking (77.9%), had multiple previous quit attempts (75.7%), and were very motivated or motivated to quit (89.5%). Almost half lived with another smoker (44.3%) and/or had children at home (44.3%). Nearly half (47.8%) completed only the first coaching session. Most were sent NRT (86.4%).</p>
<p>Characteristics significantly associated with number of sessions included sex, race/ethnicity, age, education level, insurance status, CPD, children in the home, living with a tobacco user, number of lifetime quit attempts, and being sent NRT (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1090198111425186">Table 1</xref>). Completion of only one call occurred among more than half of the following groups: Black (55.3%), callers aged 18-24 years (56.3%), callers with children in the home (50.5%), those who had never tried to quit (53.2%), and those who were not sent NRT (65.8%).</p>
<p>Logistic regression factors that univariately predicted completion of only one session included not being sent NRT; being 18 to 24 years old, female, or Black; having no more than high school education; having no insurance, no previous quit attempts, or any children in the home; smoking ≤20 CPD, and living with a tobacco user (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1090198111425186">Table 2</xref>). None accounted alone for more than 2% of variance. The final multivariate regression model retained all of the initial significant univariate predictors with little change in odds ratio estimates for any predictors compared with univariate values; no interactions were present. The model had good fit (Hosmer–Lemeshow goodness of fit <italic>p</italic> = .13) and explained 4.7% of variance.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>This large study of a state’s QL users found that almost half of enrollees completed only the first of five available coaching sessions. Being aged 18 to 24 years, Black, or smoking 20 or fewer cigarettes per day weakly predicted coaching discontinuation; not being sent NRT was the strongest predictor. Other available demographic, socioeconomic, smoking, and cessation history characteristics did not strongly predict discontinuation; together all the available predictors explained little of the overall variance of call completion.</p>
<p>Despite strong efficacy evidence and wide availability, smoking cessation treatments are underutilized. The current study adds to evidence that those who do initially adopt one of these treatments may still receive only a fraction of the potential benefit because of nonadherence, a problem that is starting to be documented (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1090198111425186">Tinkelman, Wilson, Willett, &amp; Sweeney, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1090198111425186">Williams et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1090198111425186">Zbikowski, Hapgood, Smucker Barnwell, &amp; McAfee, 2008</xref>), but remains underinvestigated in smoking cessation research. Study of treatment adherence in general as well as the results of the current study cast doubts on the WHO patient domain (demographics, personal history, etc.) and socioeconomic domain as fruitful areas of inquiry. Although socioeconomic factors in particular were expected to be associated with nonadherence, perhaps there is a selection effect based on the study population having already called the QL. In other words, socioeconomic status may be trumped by the characteristics of the population that led them to initiate contact with the QL in the first place.</p>
<p>Our current findings lead us to speculate that the condition domain, when defined as smoking dependence variability, may also be less informative given the small magnitude of the association between cigarettes per day and adherence. In addition, the finding that lighter smokers were actually more likely to discontinue after one coaching call was contrary to our proposed hypothesis. Other studies show mixed results on nicotine dependence and cessation success (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1090198111425186">Biener, Hamilton, Siegel, &amp; Sullivan, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1090198111425186">Hyland et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1090198111425186">Hymowitz et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1090198111425186">Levy, Romano, &amp; Mumford, 2005</xref>). Because of the lack of association of nonadherence with nicotine dependence, individually focused domains may need to be expanded to include loss of motivation as well as perceived completion (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1090198111425186">Table 3</xref>).</p>

<p>The WHO domains of therapy and health system/care team, that is, coaching protocols, telephone–computer infrastructure and coaches, remain promising areas of research related to nonadherence to QL coaching that were not able to be explored in this study of secondary data. Across these domains, we propose that the most relevant categories of inquiry include protocol failure to accommodate enrollee needs/preferences and system failure, defined as deviance from service protocols. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1090198111425186">Table 3</xref> summarizes these four factors related to nonadherence to QL services; further research in these domains will delineate the relationships between the domains, the prevalence and impact of each domain, and will lead to interventions that will improve adherence to QL coaching.</p>
<p>The positive findings of this study suggest initial places for improvement in nonadherence. Coaching discontinuation was more than twice as prevalent among enrollees who were not mailed NRT. Slightly more than one fourth of this non-NRT group comprised pregnant women or smokers with heart conditions requiring physician approval. This finding may be an example of protocol failure; further research should determine the extent to which the physician consent process poses an unnecessarily high treatment barrier in light of safety evidence for NRT among most smokers with cardiovascular disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1090198111425186">Fiore et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1090198111425186">Ford &amp; Zlabek, 2005</xref>). Additionally, alternate protocols may need to be developed for those who do not want or qualify for NRT. Another protocol failure related to NRT may be NRT distribution protocols; perhaps the reason that lighter smokers more often discontinued coaching calls was because they did not have the possibility of receiving a subsequent supply of NRT like the heavier smokers did. NRT distribution protocols may be designed to maximize adherence to coaching calls while simultaneously delivering NRT in cost-effective doses.</p>
<p>Young adults and Blacks had approximately 30% greater odds of discontinuing coaching after one call. Enrollees older than 44 years exhibited the exact opposite trend, and those older than 64 years were half as likely as young adults to discontinue coaching after the first call. This finding supports speculation that system failure might play a lesser role in QL nonadherence, since such failures are unlikely to be age or race related. Protocol failure might be a more helpful domain, suggesting a potential need for alteration or flexibility in coaching call timing, frequency, content, or delivery for young adults and/or Black enrollees.</p>
<sec id="section4-1090198111425186">
<title>Limitations</title>
<p>The factors examined in this secondary data analysis were based on responses to multiple choice or short-answer questions without further probing. Coaching nonadherence is probably influenced by factors that were not asked or are difficult to measure, as described in detail throughout the framework and discussion. Nevertheless, the results provide an important starting point for research and suggest action steps even at this early stage.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1090198111425186">
<title>Implications for Practice</title>
<p>Nonadherence to QL coaching is widespread, may occur after just one session, and affects most subpopulations of smokers. Campaigns to get smokers to call a QL may need components specifically designed to promote adherence and completion of coaching programs. For enrollees who need medical approval for NRT, QLs should examine their protocols and physician referral systems to ensure that they are accessible and efficient. In states that link coaching with NRT, protocols may need to be changed for enrollees who do not want NRT. Finally, young adult, Black, and lighter smokers who enroll in the QL may be more adherent to coaching protocols designed specifically for these groups.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1090198111425186">
<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>Nonadherence to QL coaching calls is significant across almost all subpopulations of QL enrollees; further research should explore if cessation outcomes are improved by increasing adherence to QL coaching which is nationally available. Furthermore studies should expand understanding of mediators of nonadherence to coaching calls with the goal to design interventions for the first call or shortly thereafter to improve adherence to coaching calls.</p>
