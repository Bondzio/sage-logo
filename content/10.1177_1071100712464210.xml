<title>Background:</title>
<p>Numerous reconstructive techniques for midfoot collapse secondary to Charcot neuroarthropathy have been described, but few have been studied biomechanically. The purpose of this study was to biomechanically compare 2 of the most common techniques.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-1071100712464210">
<title>Methods:</title>
<p>Seven paired below-knee specimens were amputated through the talonavicular and calcaneocuboid joints. The nonligamentous soft tissue was stripped proximal to the metatarsal heads and disarticulated through the tarsometatarsal (TMT) joints. For each paired specimen, the TMT joints were fused by plantar plating or intramedullary screw fixation for the contralateral side. The specimens were mounted, loaded, and cycled, and fixation stiffness was determined. Load versus displacement graphs were used to calculate overall construct stiffness, and data were analyzed by Student t tests.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-1071100712464210">
<title>Results:</title>
<p>There was no failure of hardware. All failures were at the bone-implant interface. Failure was either by screw pull-out, bone fracture, or a combination of the two. There were no notable differences between the 2 fixation techniques with respect to stiffness or loads to failure. There was a trend toward a stiffer first TMT construct using the plantar plating method. Five of the 7 screw fixations failed by pullout of the base of the first metatarsal and the other 2 by pullout of screws from all MT bases. Seven of the 7 plantar plate fixations failed by separation of the fifth to third MT bases originating at the fifth, and 3 showed fracture of the fifth metatarsal base.</p>

<p>Midfoot collapse secondary to Charcot neuroarthropathy is a challenging clinical scenario. A notable number of patients can be successfully treated with total contact casting to achieve a stable foot that accommodates a shoe or brace. Unfortunately, a subset of patients fail nonoperative treatment and develop an unstable midfoot that leads to ulceration, infection, and possibly amputation. Operative treatment has included gastrocnemius recession without fusion as well as fusion with external fixation or internal fixation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1071100712464210">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1071100712464210"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1071100712464210"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1071100712464210"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1071100712464210"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1071100712464210"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1071100712464210"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1071100712464210"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1071100712464210"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1071100712464210"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1071100712464210">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1071100712464210">13</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1071100712464210"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1071100712464210">15</xref></sup></p>
<p>Numerous classification systems exist with an attempt to predict which patterns will most likely fail nonoperative treatment. Although there is no agreement on a standard classification system, most surgeons agree that achieving a union is difficult due to neuroarthropathy, poor bone quality, vasculopathy, impaired nutrition in diabetic patients, and poor compliance with non-weight-bearing status postoperatively. As a result, a strong fusion construct is required to maximize the chance of union.</p>
<p>Multiple techniques have been described for midfoot Charcot fusions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1071100712464210">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1071100712464210">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1071100712464210">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1071100712464210"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1071100712464210">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1071100712464210">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1071100712464210"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1071100712464210"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1071100712464210">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1071100712464210">13</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1071100712464210"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1071100712464210">15</xref></sup> Marks et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1071100712464210">4</xref></sup> showed plantar plating to be stronger than standard screws.

<sec id="section6-1071100712464210" sec-type="methods">
<title>Methods</title>
<p>Seven paired below-knee specimens were chosen for testing. The specimens were disarticulated through the talonavicular and calcaneocuboid joints. The nonligamentous soft tissue was stripped from the feet with the exception of that over the (MT) heads. The specimens were then disarticulated through the tarsometatarsal (TMT) joints and denuded of cartilage. For each paired specimen, 1 foot underwent plantar plating of the TMT joints while the contralateral foot was “fused” using retrograde 5-mm partially threaded, cannulated screws across the TMT joints. The plantar plating construct consisted of a 4-hole ACE DePuy (DePuy/ACE, Warsaw, IN) one-third tubular plate across the plantar aspect of the first TMT joint with two 3.5-mm cortical screws in the medial cuneiform and 2 screws in the base of the first MT after the joint was anatomically reduced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1071100712464210">Figure 1</xref>). The second TMT joint was held reduced, and a Lisfranc 3.5-mm cortical screw was then placed from the medial cuneiform through the base of the second MT. Each of the lesser TMT joints was then held anatomically reduced with a 3.5-mm cortical screw placed from dorsal and distal in the MT base into each respective cuneiform or cuboid that it articulated with. The base of the fifth MT was secured with two 3.5-mm cortical screws given its large area of articulation with the cuboid.</p>

<p>The cannulated screw construct consisted of 5-mm (DePuy/ACE) partially threaded, cannulated, cancellous screws. The TMT joints were held anatomically reduced, and 2.0-mm guide wires (DePuy/ACE) were placed retrograde, starting at the MT heads, intramedullary, and across the first through fifth TMT joints (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1071100712464210">Figure 2</xref>). A 3.8-mm cannulated drill was then passed over the guide wire and across the TMT joint. A partially threaded, cancellous screw of appropriate length was then placed across each TMT joint, ensuring that all threads were across the joint. Radiographs were taken to ensure proper placement of the screws in each construct.</p>

<title>Testing</title>
<p>Our testing model was designed to load the MT heads in a controlled manner by maintaining a constant moment arm for all constructs, unlike that which would occur with intact specimens.</p>
<p>The forefeet were mounted in Al channel foot holders with acrylic cement incorporating: navicular + one-half of cuboid and cuneiforms (care was taken not to embed the fixation devices, ie, screws/plate, by applying a thin layer of modeling clay over any of their exposed surfaces) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1071100712464210">Figure 3</xref>).</p>
<fig id="fig3-1071100712464210" position="float">
<label>Figure 3.</label>
<caption><p>Testing apparatus with mounted specimen.</p></caption>
<graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1071100712464210-fig3.tif"/></fig>
<p>The holders were affixed to a foot carrier with multiple set screws, its position adjusted so that the point of contact of the inferior pad of the first MT head was 20 cm from an eyebolt attachment point to the carrier, whose position was also adjustable. This distance was an average value measured from the intact feet and provided a consistent moment arm for testing. The eyebolt was connected to a steel cable that acted as a simulated Achilles tendon that was attached at the other end to the MTS (MTS Systems Inc, Eden Prairie, MN) load cell.</p>
<p>The carrier had 2 upright posts located at the approximate position where the talus would have been located, each post having a pivot hole at the average level of the talar flexion-extension axis. These holes were oversized to permit ±10 degrees of internal-external rotation and inversion-eversion of the carrier to ensure that all the MT heads would contact the base platform when the constructs were loaded by the cable. The carrier was attached to a holding frame with an axle pin, the frame being attached to the MTS test platform.</p>
<p>Indexed 10-cm-long K-wires (1.1 mm) were driven perpendicular to the forefoot on either sides of the first, second, and third MT-cuneiform joints. This technique enabled small angular motions of the joints to be measured by the magnified linear displacement of the K-wire ends. In this case, due to the removal of cartilage and bone for joint fusion, this movement was likely due to plantar gapping, not rotation.</p>
<p>The position of the test platform was adjusted so that the eyebolt was beneath the load cell and a flat plate introduced beneath the MT heads for initial support. The MTS was operated in load control to apply a constant 50-N force on the steel cable, causing the foot to plantar flex. The distances between the paired K-wires were measured at fixed points 9 cm from joint centers with digital calipers after allowing the specimens 2 minutes to equilibrate to calculate angular displacements of the joints from the initial, no-load state. This was repeated for loads of 100, 150, and 200 N and used to create load-angular displacement curves for the 3 joints to determine fixation stiffness, that is, slope of curves. The specimens were then cycled from 50 to 200 N for 5000 cycles at 1 Hz, and the fixation stiffness was redetermined. The specimens were finally loaded to failure at a rate of 10 cm/min, failure being defined as the maximum load sustained by the midfoot fixation; sometimes this was relatively constant plateau and sometimes it was followed by an abrupt decrease in applied load. During this loading, load versus displacement graphs were generated by the MTS and used to calculate overall construct stiffnesses. These values are a factor not only of fixation stiffness but also of the bones themselves and the mounting fixture. Specimens were removed from the holders, photographed, and radiographed again to document failure.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>There was no failure of the hardware, and all failures were seen at the bone-implant interface. Failure was either by screw pullout, bone fracture, or a combination of the two. There were no notable differences between the 2 fixation techniques with respect to stiffness or loads to failure, although the plates appeared to have stiffer fixation at first MT (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1071100712464210">Table 1</xref>). None of the specimens failed during cycling. Five of the 7 screw fixation specimens failed by pullout from the base of the first MT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1071100712464210">Figure 4</xref>), the other 2 by pullout of screws from all MT bases.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>We found no notable difference between the 2 fixation techniques with respect to stiffness or load to failure. However, there was a trend toward a stiffer first TMT construct using the plantar plating method. Furthermore, the intramedullary screw construct failed at the first TMT 5 of 7 times, whereas none of the plantar plating constructs failed at the first TMT. All 7 plantar plating specimens failed between the third and fifth TMT joints. Stability of the first TMT was also found by Marks et al,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1071100712464210">4</xref></sup> who noted that only 1 of 8 of their plantar plating specimens failed at the first TMT. Their study only instrumented the first and second TMT joints, but in this study all 5 TMT joints were instrumented since the intramedullary screw technique popularized by Sammarco involves fixation of all 5 joints.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1071100712464210">10</xref></sup> The plantar plating technique used in this study has been described by Schon and colleagues.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1071100712464210">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1071100712464210">13</xref></sup></p>
<p>Medial column stability has been emphasized by multiple authors. Pinzur and Sostak<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1071100712464210">8</xref></sup> recently reported their results on operative stabilization of midfoot Charcot deformities. Their operative indication was a foot that was not plantigrade based on the lateral talar–first MT angle. The Schon classification assigns a beta stage if 1 of 4 criteria is met, 2 of them being that the lateral talar–first MT angle is 30 degrees or more or the anteroposterior talar–first MT angle is 35 degrees or more.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1071100712464210">12</xref></sup> Both of these measurements highlight the importance of the medial column stability. It has been proposed that cases in the beta subgroup have less favorable outcomes with nonoperative management and are the more challenging surgical cases where the strongest fixation is required for success.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1071100712464210">12</xref></sup></p>
<p>Clinical data are available for the intramedullary screw technique. Sammarco et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1071100712464210">10</xref></sup> described mechanical failure in a subset of patients with advanced disease along the medial column (lateral talar–first MT angle) and recommended an 8.0-mm screw versus a 5.0-mm screw. The authors proposed that the intramedullary screw technique required less soft stripping than plantar plating. Unfortunately, no clinical data have been reported for plantar plating. It would be interesting to determine whether the intramedullary technique has fewer wound complications than plantar plating.</p>
<p>This study had the limitation that it did not incorporate active muscle forces except for a simulated Achilles tendon force. The hindfoot was not incorporated into testing because we felt that this would better isolate the midfoot. Eliminating the hindfoot could potentially have altered force vectors since it is a source of clinical movement. Only the neutral position of the foot was tested, excluding rotation, inversion, and eversion. Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry scans were not performed to determine the effects of bone density.</p>
<p>Further studies are needed to determine the optimal treatment for operative reconstruction of Charcot midfoot rocker deformities. Clinical data need to be reported for plantar plating. Ideally, a prospective clinical trial will be performed comparing these 2 popular techniques as well as gastrocnemius resection without fusion. Alternate studies could examine a combination of these techniques since there was a trend for the intramedullary screws to fail medially and the plantar plating technique to fail laterally.</p>
