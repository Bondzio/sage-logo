<abstract>
<p>I present the findings from a study that explored the experiences and decision making of street-involved women navigating the health care system. Data were drawn from a larger qualitative study situated in a western Canadian inner-city neighborhood that examined the health-management strategies of street-involved women with a history of crack cocaine use. Data were collected over a 17-month period and included ethnographic methods of participant observation, group interviews (<italic>n</italic> = 57), and in-depth interviews (<italic>n</italic> = 10). Inductive thematic analysis derived two major themes: power and punishment, and organization and delivery of care. The themes illustrate how women’s experiences and decision making were located within a nexus of power relations that operated across women’s shared social location as downtown eastsiders. Implications of the findings are discussed in relation to supporting women’s efforts and improving health outcomes.</p>

<p>The health disparities among women who are street involved (women who experience severe poverty, significant public visibility, and inadequate shelter) remain a significant public health issue.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1049732313493352">1</xref></sup> More street-involved women have died from potentially treatable illnesses than women in the general population in North America (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1049732313493352">Beiser &amp; Stewart, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1049732313493352">Teruya et al., 2010</xref>), and research has demonstrated that they continue to carry a disproportionate burden of blood-borne and sexually transmitted infections, unplanned pregnancies, mental health problems, problematic substance use, malnutrition, and chronic illnesses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1049732313493352">Butters &amp; Erickson, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1049732313493352">Falck, Wang, Siegal, &amp; Carlson, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1049732313493352">Schlosser, Ben Abdallah, Callahan, Bradford, &amp; Cottler, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1049732313493352">Shannon et al., 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>Economic and social deprivation are often severe and have been noted to be accompanied by high degrees of unstable housing, poverty, survival sex work, violence, and involvement in illegal activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1049732313493352">Bungay, Johnson, Varcoe, &amp; Boyd, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1049732313493352">Bungay et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1049732313493352">Cooper, Moore, Gruskin, &amp; Krieger, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1049732313493352">Shannon et al., 2009</xref>). Additionally, women who are socially located within racialized groups<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1049732313493352">2</xref></sup> have been reported to be significantly overrepresented (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1049732313493352">Khandor &amp; Mason, 2008</xref>), a situation that illustrates the longstanding implications of colonial politics, policies, and practices for women’s health (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1049732313493352">Adelson, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1049732313493352">Kelm, 1998</xref>).</p>
<p>Over the past several decades health researchers and practitioners internationally have investigated and modified health services to address health disparities among women who are street involved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1049732313493352">Ambrosia, Baker, Crowe, &amp; Hardill, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1049732313493352">Bungay et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1049732313493352">Shannon et al., 2009</xref>). Despite innovative health programming, however, there has been minimal change in women’s health status, and there is ample evidence that street-involved women have actively avoided accessing and delayed seeking health care (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1049732313493352">Bungay et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1049732313493352">Butters &amp; Erickson, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1049732313493352">CHASE Project Team, 2005</xref>). Researchers have consistently reported problematic interactions with health care providers as a substantial barrier to women’s engagement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1049732313493352">Ensign &amp; Panke, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1049732313493352">Goodman, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1049732313493352">Khandor &amp; Mason, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>Street-involved women have also experienced considerable oversights in health service delivery, including limited referrals for specialist services (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1049732313493352">Temple-Smith et al., 2007</xref>) and insufficient mental health, addiction, pain management, and preventative health services (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1049732313493352">Bungay et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1049732313493352">Shannon et al., 2009</xref>). Fragmented service delivery, prolonged wait times, and geographical barriers to health care agencies have also been reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1049732313493352">Achat, Thomas, Close, Moerkerken, &amp; Harris, 2010</xref>). Examination of these influential factors highlights a problem at both the interpersonal and structural levels of health care.</p>
<sec id="section1-1049732313493352">
<title>Situating the Problem: Relations of Power</title>
<p>To date, scholars concerned with health service delivery among street-involved women have emphasized women’s service utilization patterns, with a particular focus on health clinic attendance patterns and adherence to treatment regimens (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1049732313493352">Achat et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1049732313493352">Teruya et al., 2010</xref>), and to a lesser extent on organizational barriers (e.g., health clinic hours of operation and location; policing practices) that limit health care access (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1049732313493352">Shannon et al., 2009</xref>). More recently, scholars (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1049732313493352">Browne, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1049732313493352">Cooper et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1049732313493352">Smye, Browne, Varcoe, &amp; Josewski, 2011</xref>) have illustrated the need to expand our understanding of the complexity of women’s health care as situated within ideological and structural relations of power that shape the organization and delivery of health services, health provider practices, and women’s engagement in the health care system. There is growing evidence, for instance, that ideologies of deviance and difference have shaped health care programming and providers’ practices in ways that serve to further marginalize people’s health care and exacerbate health disparities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1049732313493352">Browne, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1049732313493352">Lloyd, 2010</xref>). This has been particularly evident in relation to drug and alcohol addiction, which is common among many who are street involved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1049732313493352">Fiddes &amp; De Siato, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1049732313493352">Shannon et al., 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Street-involved women who seek health care have frequently been stigmatized and dismissed by health care providers as drug-seeking, regardless of their stated health concern (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1049732313493352">Lloyd, 2010</xref>) and the compelling evidence discounting drug seeking as a functional concept (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1049732313493352">Alford, Compton &amp; Samet, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1049732313493352">McCaffery, Grimm, Pasero, Ferrell, &amp; Uman, 2005</xref>). Ideologies of deviance and difference concerned with drug use are also value laden, and have been shown to negatively influence the organization of health services and health programming (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1049732313493352">Boyd, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1049732313493352">Cooper et al., 2005</xref>). Significant oversights in public health attention and funding to support gender-sensitive harm-reduction programming, for example, have contributed directly to street-involved women’s inabilities to engage in safer drug use and limited their opportunities to engage with health care (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1049732313493352">Boyd, Johnson, &amp; Moffatt, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1049732313493352">Bungay et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1049732313493352">Leonard et al., 2008</xref>)—situations that have been associated with increased vulnerability to violence and HIV infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1049732313493352">Cooper et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1049732313493352">Shannon et al., 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Researchers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1049732313493352">Cooper, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1049732313493352">Pauly, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1049732313493352">Varcoe, 1997</xref>) have also demonstrated that liberal ideologies of individualism and egalitarianism and marginalizing discourses of blame and personal responsibility influenced care providers’ assumptions and beliefs regarding the health behaviors of street-involved women. Nonadherence to prescribed treatment regimens and nonattendance at health care appointments have often been identified within health literature as lifestyle attributes among women with limited acknowledgment of the complex web of social relations that influence these behaviors. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1049732313493352">Raphael (2008)</xref> highlighted that such a liberal politic of people’s actions regularly overlooks the social and structural contexts in which people’s behaviors occur, particularly in relation to gender, class, and racialization.</p>
<p>Poverty, for instance, remains the most common shared experience among street-involved women (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1049732313493352">Fiddes &amp; De Siato, 2002</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1049732313493352">Collins (2000)</xref> and others concerned with health disparities (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1049732313493352">Fraser &amp; Honneth, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1049732313493352">Weber &amp; Parra-Medina, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1049732313493352">Young, 2000</xref>) have argued that hierarchical power relations and socially grouped concentrations of economic power represent insidious networks of ideologies and structurally mediated practices that limit some individuals’ freedoms and opportunities. Moreover, researchers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1049732313493352">Bungay et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1049732313493352">Plach, Stevens, &amp; Keigher, 2005</xref>) have illustrated that these structural inequities in the allocation of economic and social resources necessary for health (i.e., poverty), including income, stable housing, food, and medication, have contributed to competing demands within women’s health decision making that limited their opportunities to engage with the health care system or adhere to prescribed treatment regimens. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1049732313493352">Pauly (2008)</xref> and colleagues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1049732313493352">Pauly, MacKinnon, &amp; Varcoe, 2009</xref>) further argued that policy makers’ and health care providers’ omissions regarding the combined effects of inequities, and discriminatory assumptions regarding people’s actions and social locations, have translated directly to challenges among women for health care engagement.</p>
<p>Examining women’s health care experiences within the context of hierarchical relations of power does not, however, negate their agency. Although research regarding women’s strategies in navigating the health care system as situated within relations of power is scarce, the limited research that has explored these dynamics has shown that women who suffered significant marginalization were aware of the perceptions and misperceptions held by care providers, and that this knowledge shaped their approach to engaging with the health care system.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1049732313493352">Alexander (2010)</xref>, in a study concerned with primary care interactions, for example, illustrated that women learned over time how to communicate in approach and language with care providers so as to be actively engaged in their health care. In another study, Aboriginal women modified their dress and manner of speaking as a means to obtain credibility and legitimacy within the health care encounter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1049732313493352">Browne &amp; Fiske, 2001</xref>). In a subsequent study that examined the interrelationships between crack cocaine use and health, the author and colleagues demonstrated that women avoided health care unless severely ill, and instead used crack to manage health issues such as pain, fatigue, and depression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1049732313493352">Bungay, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1049732313493352">Bungay et al., 2010</xref>). Thus, it appears that women’s agency and autonomy in health care engagement were not separate from how their actions were socially and structurally situated within specific social locations and dominant ideologies that directly influenced their overall health. Given the sustained health disparities experienced by street-involved women, there is an urgent need to investigate further the interrelationships between relations of power and women’s opportunities for health.</p>

<title>Purpose</title>
<p>In this paper I build on the aforementioned research to discuss findings from one aspect of the findings of a larger qualitative study that explored the interrelationships between the social, political, economic, and personal contexts and the health experiences and health management strategies of street-involved women who had a history with crack cocaine use in a western Canadian inner-city neighborhood. The objectives that guided this aspect of the study were to (a) examine women’s experiences of and decision making about engagement with the health care system, and (b) analyze these experiences within a wider sociopolitical context to understand how these contexts shape health care and opportunities for health among street-involved women. An in-depth analysis of women’s health experiences and intersections between structural and interpersonal violence, drug use, and health have been reported elsewhere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1049732313493352">Bungay et al., 2010</xref>).</p>

<title>Method</title>
<sec id="section4-1049732313493352">
<title>Research Design</title>
<p>The research protocol received approval from the University of British Columbia’s Behavioural Research Ethics Board, and data collection and analysis occurred in 2006–2008. I collected the data over a 17-month period and included field notes and interviews with 63 women who at the time of the study were street involved in the city’s downtown eastside (DTES). The DTES remains one of Canada’s poorest neighborhoods, and is home to a large homeless population. The area contains deteriorating housing, including single-room-occupancy (SRO) hotels, and active commercial sex and drug industries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1049732313493352">Small et al., 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>Recruitment occurred with the aid of a research project advisory committee comprised of representatives from a drug-user-led women’s support group. Data collection occurred in two ways: participant observation, and unstructured group interviews with 18 unique groups of three to four women (<italic>n</italic> = 57) engaged in the construction of crack cocaine harm-reduction kits that were part of the larger project (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1049732313493352">Bungay et al., 2009</xref>, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1049732313493352">Johnson et al., 2008</xref>, for a full discussion of the project methods and sampling strategies). Women were purposefully recruited with the aid of the advisory committee and by staff members of the agencies where the kit-making sessions occurred. Eligibility criteria included women living in the DTES who were 18 years or older, spoke English, and had a history of using illegal drugs.</p>
<p>I took extensive field notes, recording the women’s conversations during kit-making sessions and paying particular attention to health information and their perceptions and experiences of engaging with the health care system. I also documented women’s physical appearance, including the presence of health issues (e.g., bruising, limping, the use of walking aids) and their clothing, and descriptions of the kit-making locale. My role in the kit making was not passive, as women regularly included me in their discussions, providing me with the opportunity to pose questions about their experiences (e.g., clinic hours, specialist referrals) and clarify meaning of language or topics (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1049732313493352">Bungay et al., 2009</xref> for a full description of the kit-making process and data collection). I collected demographic data during kit-making sessions, drawing on how women talked about themselves and the factors influencing their health. Women in the group interviews ranged in age from 20 to 50 years. Their housing situations included being homeless, socially funded low-barrier (not requiring abstinence) and supportive housing, emergency shelters, and SRO. Women were either receiving social income assistance or had no formalized source of income. The majority of women self-identified as Aboriginal.</p>
<p>As kit making progressed and initial data analysis was occurring, I conducted in-depth, conversationally oriented interviews with 10 women (months 10 to 16) to explore their health care experiences and their decision making in greater detail. Four of the women were recruited from kit-construction sessions because they represented a diversity of health issues (e.g., HIV, tooth abscesses, pneumonia) and experiences with the health care system (e.g., barriers in access, consistent vs. random primary care provider) that were identified within group interviews and field notes. As the project continued I shared preliminary analytic themes with advisory members, and together we recognized the need to capture the experiences of women who were exceedingly socially isolated, particularly those with more severe health issues and others who had minimal interaction with health care and other services. With the aid of the advisory members, an additional 6 women who had not participated in kit-making sessions were recruited to add depth and breadth to the data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1049732313493352">Morse, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1049732313493352">Thorne, 2008</xref>) with regard to the variation of women’s experiences within the DTES.</p>
<p>Each of the 10 participants completed a brief demographic profile. Their ages ranged from 38 to 59 years. All lived in poverty and received social income assistance. Six lived in SROs, 3 in low-barrier housing, and one was homeless, slept outside, and had minimal engagement with the health care system. Interviews lasted between 1 and 2 hours and were digitally recorded, transcribed verbatim (excluding any identifying information), checked for accuracy, uploaded to NVivo software, and labeled with an identifier code. All participants provided verbal consent for interviews and observations and received a CAD$20 honorarium.</p>
<p>As data collection was drawing to an end (Month 17), three in-depth interviews were also conducted with outreach health service providers whom the interview participants had identified as important to their health care decision making and accessing primary care. The interviews focused on their experiences of working with the study population and afforded me an opportunity to expand on important topics about health care that were raised by the other participants from a provider perspective. Such topics included the operations of health clinics and emergency rooms, interactions with other care providers, and their roles in supporting health care.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1049732313493352">
<title>Data Analysis</title>
<p>Analysis began early in the data collection process and continued throughout the project in an iterative manner using an interpretive thematic approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1049732313493352">Thorne, 2008</xref>). As data were continually gathered, I read interviews and field notes repeatedly to identify any recurring patterns (similarities) or unusual events and differences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1049732313493352">Carspecken, 1996</xref>). Data were reread for linkages to theory and to highlight illustrative examples that depicted patterns and differences for exploration in future interviews. I constructed initial codes that were thematic descriptions of women’s experiences and activities that attended to the variation and similarities within and between women’s experiences.</p>
<p>As analysis progressed, I refined codes to reflect a more theoretical approach to illustrate how these shared and differing experiences that were situated within relations of power operating across multiple and intersecting social locations influenced women’s health and engagement with health care. Two additional meetings to discuss the analysis were held with the advisory group (at Month 17 and to review the final analysis). Women reflected on the analysis, highlighting accuracy for most themes. Women actively challenged my interpretations regarding positive interactions with providers, provided coding refinement to illustrate the factors that contributed to continued engagement with a care provider, and identified categories that warranted further elaboration (which resulted in the interviews with care providers).</p>
<p>To guide my analysis, I drew from the critical perspectives of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1049732313493352">Collins (2000)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1049732313493352">Crenshaw (1991)</xref>, who argued that relations of power are significant factors of all social organizations that regularly operate across various social locations (e.g., age, class, race, gender) to justify and sustain inequities within society. I specifically employed the framework known as the matrix of domination (Collins) to interrogate the complex web of social relations in which women’s experiences were situated. According to Collins, there are four interrelated domains of power within the matrix of domination that encompass both macro and micro social relations that are historically and socially specific. The hegemonic domain incorporates dominant ideologies (bodies of ideas, assumptions, and beliefs) that represent the interests of a particular social group. The structural domain refers to the organization of social institutions such as law and health care. The disciplinary domain represents the policies and practices of social institutions, and the interpersonal domain comprises people’s social interactions and personal relationships (Collins).</p>
<p>Examining women’s experiences within the domains of power afforded me several analytic benefits. I was able to explore the specific interrelationships between dominant ideologies, organizational policies, and health care provider interactions as influential for women’s engagement with the health care system. I further analyzed these interrelationships for their significance to women’s overall health and well-being. In keeping with the interpretive descriptive approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1049732313493352">Thorne, 2008</xref>), my aim was not to capture all possibilities in variation, but to continue to build on the knowledge concerned with relations of power and street-involved women’s health, illuminating aspects of the problem of health disparities that can serve to inform future interventions and research in the field.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>The women’s experiences of decision making and engaging with the health care system were rich and varied, and were influenced by the nature of the health issues experienced, the providers they interacted with, the services available, and the experiential learning that occurred over time with repeated engagement. Embedded within this variation was their shared social location as street-involved women, or as they and the provider participants described, their shared position as “downtown eastsiders.” The idiom of downtown eastsiders referred to people who lived in the DTES, were extremely poor, were often homeless, might have been involved in illegal activities, engaged in substance use and abuse, and experienced an array of health issues—particularly mental illness. Hegemonic ideologies of deviance and difference were evident in how this social location was interpreted. All of the street-involved women and the provider participants perceived that in most situations, health care providers, police, and mainstream society viewed downtown eastsiders as dangerous people who had little self-control and lacked agency or capacity to act in their own best interest.</p>
<p>Understanding women’s social location was of utmost importance to the overall analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1049732313493352">Collins, 2000</xref>). It was from this position that I analyzed the processes by which hegemonic ideologies operated through structural, disciplinary, and interpersonal domains of power to regularly constrain women’s options for relevant and meaningful health care. To this end, I developed two interrelated analytic categories—power and punishment, and organization and delivery of health care—which I discuss in detail below.</p>
<sec id="section7-1049732313493352">
<title>Power and Punishment</title>
<p>The women had regular and sometimes frequent engagement with health care because of the multitude of health issues they experienced. Primary care clinics were the chief sites of engagement, although street outreach nurses; mental health services; emergency room services; and specialized substance abuse, HIV treatment, and perinatal care services were also utilized. Women’s strategies to navigate the health care system were substantially influenced by their desires to have their health care needs met. These strategies, however, were also influenced by the ideologies of deviance and difference that underpinned their social location as downtown eastsiders. For instance, being perceived as lacking in self-control or capacity to act in their best interest contributed to relations of power that afforded care providers with control regarding the type of care received in a provider–patient interaction as well as access to care in the future.</p>
<p>Fear of being refused health care during a current interaction or at some point in the future was a significant motivator underlying women’s activities. One important strategy to reduce the risk of not receiving care was to influence providers’ perceptions of their social location. Upon presentation at the triage desk of an emergency room or a walk-in primary care clinic, women frequently provided a false address so they would not be identified as a downtown eastsider. Women reported that by doing so they received faster care, more attention focused on their health issues, and less focus on substance use. Women continuously experimented with this strategy to test its effectiveness, and altered it as necessary in other health agencies where they were not known by the staff.</p>
<p>In their attempts to hide their social location, the women also regularly withheld information about their drug use and methadone maintenance treatment (MMT).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-1049732313493352">3</xref></sup> Women knew that by withholding information, some health concerns (e.g., drug withdrawal, burns, and seizures) might not be addressed, but they perceived this strategy as essential to being treated with respect, having other health issues addressed, and avoiding “feeling less than human in their [health care providers’] eyes.” The implications of being situated as using drugs were further articulated by a woman during an in-depth interview:<disp-quote>
<p>They [nurses] talk to you, all condescending, like the only health issue that you have or ever will have has to be an addiction-related thing. I mean, I actually went in and refused to say that I did drugs, and hid it because I felt like they were looking at nothing else in my health except something that was addiction related. . . . I mean, if you are lying you’re obviously not going to receive the services you need, right? And unfortunately most of the health care I’ve accessed I’ve felt like I have to lie; I had to make up a different person so I could access care.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The withholding of information was a limited strategy. In the current health care structure, the development of electronic patient records afforded the women little privacy and reinforced the status hierarchy between provider and patient. Providers’ access to previous medical records offered information about the women’s previous addresses and substance use; the women had no control over what information was shared. They perceived being prejudged by providers who accessed their health records, and experienced despair that they would never be seen as a real person instead of the ascribed label as an addict or downtown eastsider.</p>
<p>The women also navigated hegemonic relations of power that assumed them as deviant and the provider as knowledgeable, and power to ensure continued access to care by avoiding what they termed as “getting too involved” in their care. They sat demurely while being lectured by a provider for using drugs, or were silent when their questions were ignored or when a provider was physically rough when performing an examination. The provider participants, in their descriptions of accompanying women to primary care settings, recounted numerous stories of witnessing these types of events, and further described these interactions as “unethical and dehumanizing.” The women however, perceived their strategy as one of strength and endurance so as to get what they needed to manage their health:<disp-quote>
<p>I’m not going to lose out again. I’m not going to focus in on how they talk to someone. I am just going to focus on what I need from them and be strong. You know, they think they [physicians] are God or something. So if that is the way they are, well, I’m not going to lose because of an asshole doctor. I’ll just take the way he talks and get what I need.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The fear of losing access to care also contributed to the women acquiescing with physicians’ opinions about a health issue, even when they recognized they were not experiencing that particular problem. The women accepted prescriptions for medications they believed were unnecessary, or which they knew to be ineffective based on past experience. This strategy was important to ensure that “physicians felt like they were in control,” to establish a positive rapport for future interactions, and to maintain access to health care. In such cases, prescriptions remained unfilled or were filled and sold for income.</p>
<p>The fear of not receiving care was well substantiated. Inequities within the structural relations of power afforded providers ultimate control over specific aspects of care that were exercised within the disciplinary domain of power. Care providers had the capacity to ban a woman from a clinic or to refuse to provide care. Women reported perceptions of “being punished” for advocating on their own behalf, or for challenging the normative practices and policies of clinics and providers. The reality of this was illustrated in the comments of an interview participant discussing her interactions with a physician with regard to her MMT:<disp-quote>
<p>I had to go on his schedule every week. He only came in four hours a week. I could have come once per month because I was stable. So it was a money thing for him, and because I was late for my appointment I stayed at the same level [of methadone]. He didn’t know me like my counselor knew me, and just the way he talked to me . . . it’s like he had something against me, and for no reason. It’s like that the respect was not there. And I was like, “I don’t have to put up with this.” But I was on sixty-five [mg] and I was supposed to go up to seventy, but he kept the prescription of sixty-five, and he goes, “You were supposed to go up to seventy. That was planned today.” But I was late, so it was sixty-five. So that had nothing to do with my health, nothing to do with getting me better. . . . It had to do with if I pissed him off or if I pleased him. So I learned how doctors treat you as drug addicts, even when you try and do it right [access drug treatment programming].</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The matrix of domination left women with little recourse but to accept provider control over their care. The women’s agency in seeking alternative care providers was limited by the disciplinary relations of power that justified and sustained physician dominance. At the time of this study, only a limited number of physicians had prescribing privileges for methadone, and patients receiving MMT were not permitted to switch prescribing physicians as long as that physician was available within the locale. These physicians were usually available within a limited 4-hour period once per week. Without MMT, women experienced an increased likelihood of severe “dope sickness” (withdrawal), which only enhanced the probability that they would resume the use of illegal opiates. In contrast, within the disciplinary domain of power physicians had explicit rights regarding the termination of the doctor–patient relationship, as outlined within the <italic>Methadone Maintenance Handbook</italic> prepared by the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1049732313493352">College of Physicians and Surgeons of British Columbia (2004)</xref>:<disp-quote>
<p>If patients are verbally abusive or threaten staff with violence, the taper schedule should be at the discretion of the prescriber. If any prescriber feels unsafe . . . he or she may offer a rapidly witnessed ingestion methadone taper and discontinue the doctor–patient relationship. (p. 40)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The hegemonic relations of power concerning deviance and difference for people living with addictions were thus embedded within the disciplinary domain of power that shaped this health policy. People were portrayed as violent and out of control, thereby justifying the power and status afforded to providers and the constraints to women’s freedoms in relation to health care.</p>

<title>Organization and Delivery of Health Services</title>
<sec id="section9-1049732313493352">
<title>Structural relations of power</title>
<p>Structural relations of power, defined previously as the organization of the health care system and institutions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1049732313493352">Collins, 2000</xref>), influenced the nature and type of health services available to women and the physical location of care providers. Each of these factors further influenced women’s strategies for health care engagement. In several instances, the women identified a range of positive resources that reflected some of the pressing health issues embedded within their social location (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1049732313493352">Bungay, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1049732313493352">Bungay et al., 2010</xref>). Several health care agencies, for example, provided a breadth of services, including primary care, a pharmacy, and nutritional and social work support. These agencies enabled women to engage in health care in a timely and effective manner. The agencies that women perceived positively were women-only services and those where interpersonal relations were less hierarchical; those that were “nonjudgmental” and were “able to see me as a person,” and “where providers genuinely want to help you.”</p>
<p>Women-only services were also places that women could take a break from being on the street, be free from violence, and socialize with friends. Many of the comprehensive programs that were women-only, however, provided services primarily to pregnant women or those with young children. Other positive programs were identified for women living with HIV. Although all women perceived these programs as important and effective, the oversight in services for women over age 40 and those who were not living with HIV left the majority of participants with little access to comprehensive health care. These oversights reinforced hegemonic ideologies regarding women’s reproductive role, ageism, and misconceptions of the diversity of health issues experienced among women socially located in the DTES. Two group interview participants in their late 40s commented on this:</p>
<speech>
<speaker>Participant (P) 1:</speaker>
<p>Nobody talks about women getting older. There is nothing for us. We don’t matter anymore. Older women need more services. When I was twenty, I didn’t need health care. I have nowhere to go.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>P 2:</speaker>
<p>There is just way too much focus on HIV/AIDS when way more people are dying with hep [hepatitis] C and other stuff. Everything, all the services, the research, everything is all about HIV and AIDS, but that is not really what the issue is for lots of us down here.</p>
</speech>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-1049732313493352">
<title>Disciplinary relations of power</title>
<p>Disciplinary relations of power, infused with assumptions about women’s social location as chaotic substance abusing people, intersected with provider practices to influence women’s health care engagement. Primary clinic policies and staffing procedures caused inconsistencies in women’s access to a regular primary care provider. Women were often unable to develop rapport or a history with a provider, which contributed to misunderstandings concerning their health issues. The women described an overemphasis on substance use, regardless of whether or not they were currently using drugs, which further aggravated misperceptions about drug seeking and women’s capacities to participate in their health care decision making. Women experienced extreme frustration over what they described as “constantly needing to prove yourself.” This frustration resulted in significant delays in seeking care, and in some instances in acting assertively:<disp-quote>
<p>When my doctor is not available and I can’t manage any more, I go in and see any of the doctors there. I just tell them, “You don’t want to do this [provide health care], you want me to die, fine.” That makes them pay attention. What else am I going to do? It is not like I have a lot of choice at that point.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The small number of women who reported having a consistent primary care provider who addressed their complex health issues in a respectful manner went to great lengths to maintain this relationship. Traveling and relocation were important actions that in some instances kept women located in the neighborhood despite their desire to relocate to a place they felt was safer. One interview participant noted, “I used to go to my doctor in my old neighborhood, but now I have to see him down here. I live down here now so I can see him.”</p>
<p>Primary care clinic “no-appointment” policies also affected women’s engagement. According to the provider participants, these policies were established initially to create a more flexible environment that permitted convenient access to clinics. The providers also noted, however, that the policies were based on problematic assumptions that people positioned as downtown eastsiders were “ruled by drug use,” and as a result incapable of organizing themselves for appointments. Provider and street-involved participants noted that although a no-appointment policy might be suitable for some residents, accessing primary care was incredibly difficult and time consuming, particularly because of the excessive wait times in these settings. As a result, women frequently delayed seeking health care, often to the point of requiring hospitalization, as illustrated in the following:<disp-quote>
<p>I felt so sick. I just couldn’t stand the thought of sitting there for hours waiting. So I stayed home. By the time I got to see my doctor, I was in so much pain. She listened to my chest and checked me out and called an ambulance right away. I ended up in the hospital for weeks with pneumonia. She said I almost died.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The long wait times also conflicted with women’s capacities to manage other basic needs such as income, hygiene, food, and shelter that were influenced by their poverty. For instance, most women received social income assistance (in the amounts of CAD$500 to CAD$600 per month) as their primary source of income (primarily because of their ineligibility for engagement in the formal labor market; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1049732313493352">Bungay, 2008</xref>). The bureaucratic processes of applying for and maintaining social income assistance required meetings with advocates to ensure access to the assistance. Many women were also dependent on drop-in centers’ schedules to obtain food, shower, and use laundry services, all of which also had wait times of 2 to 4 hours.</p>
<p>Women’s experiences of poverty also necessitated that they spend considerable time seeking additional income opportunities. The participants noted spending time working as volunteers in shelters to clean, cook, and do dishes for a small stipend (e.g., CAD$28 per 4 hours of work). Some of the women also engaged in survival sex work, which required them to be on the street throughout the night. Securing shelter was a consistent priority, and women were dependent on shelter policies regarding timing and access (disciplinary domain). Furthermore, the complexity of chronic health conditions warranted visits to numerous health care providers, not all of whom were centrally located, thus requiring substantial time and travel. The “chaos” of women’s lives seemed to negate the dominant discourse that identifies substance abuse as the major contributing factor to women’s busyness. Instead, women’s schedules were hectic and varied because of the interrelationships between managing basic resources necessary for health and navigating the bureaucracy of health and social services. Women’s disengagement with health care was in some instances forced as they made difficult decisions regarding how to obtain basic necessities for living.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In this article I illustrate the importance of situating our understanding of street-involved women’s engagement with health care within the realm of relations of power. Research in this field has been focused almost exclusively on individual actions that are studied and presented in the absence of larger interpersonal and structural contexts that influence women’s health and everyday life. This individualized approach has assumed a freedom of choice by an individual that has recently come under critique by scholars (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1049732313493352">Fraser, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1049732313493352">Pauly et al., 2009</xref>) concerned with a neoliberal ideology that underpins much of the discourse about the health of street-involved women. By employing a critical perspective on relations of power, I have demonstrated that the women’s practices were embedded in specific social locations and influenced by dominant ideologies of street-involvement, drug use, and poverty. Similar to the findings reported by other researchers concerned with health care among women who are street involved (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1049732313493352">Cooper, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1049732313493352">Ettore, 2004</xref>), I noted that the women’s engagement with the health care system was situated within inequitable concentrations of economic, social, personal, and political power that served to reinforce dominant ideologies of women as deviant and of lesser status. This translated directly into experiences of discrimination and oversights in health care delivery.</p>
<p>Additionally, access to and utilization of health care have long been considered important to the health of women who are street involved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1049732313493352">Kidder, Elifson, &amp; Sterk, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1049732313493352">Shannon et al., 2006</xref>). Discussions of health care access and uptake of services, however, have rarely been situated within the realm of the necessity for women to balance the competing demands of engagement with the health care system with securing essential and basic life resources. It is only recently that these discussions have begun to examine how health care and social service institutions are increasingly bureaucratic and disconnected from each other. Instead, the operations of each institution might create barriers for women in accessing one or the other of these important services (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1049732313493352">Bungay et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1049732313493352">Pauly et al., 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Novel approaches are needed to maximize the delivery of health and social services in a manner that is mutually interactive and supportive for women’s health. These approaches must reduce the time demands placed on women, thereby contributing to a reduced need for women to choose social services or health care. Models currently exist—albeit primarily within a perinatal context—that support comprehensive health and social service delivery (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1049732313493352">Flavin, 2002</xref>). The development and testing of models that respond to the needs of women outside of a perinatal context are warranted.</p>
<p>The experiential knowledge that women gleaned over time and through frequent contact with various health agencies and care providers must also be considered. Women intelligently and creatively navigated relations of power (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1049732313493352">Alexander, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1049732313493352">Browne &amp; Fiske, 2001</xref>). Their strategies, however, highlighted a problem of control that is justified and maintained within the matrix of domination at play in health care. Within this article I have illustrated the reality of women’s fears of punishment and lack of control over the timing and effectiveness of health care access and treatment. Although I do not doubt the authenticity of these results, there is need for caution in how the results are translated into recommendations. There is an urgent need to further interrogate the policies and practices within primary care clinics, particularly in addressing the no-appointment policy and providers’ power to ban women from care or withhold requisite treatment.</p>
<p>It is at no time appropriate to engage in discriminatory and unethical care. Further exploration of the historical evolution of policies and the processes by which we can alter the disciplinary relations of power that normalize such practices is urgently needed. Since this research was conducted, one local primary care clinic has substantially altered its policies to provide more comprehensive care, offering women-only hours once per week and emphasizing a range of health issues vs. only perinatal care. Investigating the decision-making processes among the staff and administrators and measuring the effectiveness of this clinic for improving women’s health could provide a critical starting point.</p>
<p>As has been reported by others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1049732313493352">Butters &amp; Erickson, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1049732313493352">Goodman, 2005</xref>), in this study the women related providers’ consistent emphasis on substance use. Women were creative in avoiding this emphasis on some occasions, but their strategies were often limited. Those strategies will be of less value in the future, as technology increases access to the intimate details of women’s lives. Although the benefits of electronic health records are regularly recognized, it is also important to question how this technology might increase the surveillance of street-involved women, reinforce oppressive interpersonal relations with care providers, and affect their health care. Further research that examines how the use of electronic medical records might exacerbate stigma and discrimination is required.</p>
<p>In summary, the issue remains of how best to ensure that health service delivery addresses the breadth of women’s health issues, including those for aging women that extend beyond substance use. Several researchers have recommended that providers be educated to debunk drug-seeking myths (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1049732313493352">Alford et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1049732313493352">McCaffery et al., 2005</xref>). Others (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1049732313493352">Smith, Edwards, Martens, Varcoe, &amp; Davies, 2008</xref>) have recommended change at education entry level, teaching cultural sensitivity and greater emphasis on the relationships between the social determinants of health and health outcomes. Education, although important, is insufficient to address these issues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1049732313493352">Bungay, 2008</xref>). Degrading interactions with health service providers is unacceptable, because they negate women’s personhood and contribute to the perpetuation of oppression. Although the providers’ perspectives were underrepresented in this project, the number of narratives highlighting degrading interactions highlights the fact that disrespect remains a substantial problem.</p>
<p>It is important to build on existing knowledge concerning the underpinning ideologies that inform patient–provider interactions, and to explore the normalization of ideologies of deviance and difference that might underpin providers’ knowledge, beliefs, and practices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1049732313493352">Browne, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1049732313493352">Varcoe, 1997</xref>). It is also essential that this work be informed by perspectives that permit researchers to expose relations of power. These strategies are necessary for sustainable social change that supports women’s abilities to exercise full citizenship rights of equitable opportunities for health. Without social change, women will likely continue to independently manage health issues until their health deteriorates to the point that they require emergency services, thereby exacerbating the health disparities that currently exist.</p>

<p>For the purpose of this article I define “street-involved” as a shared social location that infers a high degree of public visibility. Street-involved women might circulate between home and the street, have no connection to a home, and/or have inadequate or insecure shelter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1049732313493352">Higgit, Wingert, &amp; Ristock, 2003</xref>). Street-involved women might or might not have connections to mainstream society. The term street-involved is not meant to infer a homogenous population of women, but instead describes a shared social location. Each woman is recognized for having an individual history, and individual characteristics and skills (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1049732313493352">Bungay et al., 2006</xref>).</p>
