<abstract>
<p>This study examined the relationship between nurses’ ethical decision-making levels and their professional behaviours. Data were collected from 225 nurses who were recruited from university hospitals in Ankara using proportionate sampling. Data were analysed using descriptive statistics and Pearson correlations. Most of the nurses were familiar with ethical dilemmas in nursing practice. The Nursing Principled Thinking level was above average, while the Practical Consideration level was average. Nurses’ professionalism level was low. There was a positive but weak correlation between professional behaviours of the nurses and their ethical decision-making levels. Increasing nurses’ professionalism level can provide a positive contribution to the ethical decision-making level.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Ethics are of utmost importance in health care due to the moral questions raised by the advances in science, medicine and biotechnology.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0969733012455562">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0969733012455562">2</xref></sup> Life-prolonging treatments and technologies, organ transplantation, genetic testing and stem cell research, for example, raise ethical problems that are confronted by health-care professionals. Therefore, it is crucial for health-care professionals to be aware of ethical problems, to have the ability to apply moral reasoning to those problems and to develop ethical decision-making skills.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0969733012455562">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0969733012455562">4</xref></sup></p>
<p>According to the International Council of Nurses,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0969733012455562">5</xref></sup> nursing includes the promotion of health, prevention of illness and the care of ill, disabled and dying people. Explicit in this definition is caring for people who are in need. Caring requires more than theoretical knowledge and technical skills; caring has an affective component that includes awareness of others’ vulnerability, attentiveness to caring needs and a moral response to the needs.</p>
<p>As caring is a continual process, nurses spend more time with patients than any other health-care professionals. The close relationship between nurses and patients enables nurses to witness illness experiences and suffering of patients, all of which demand that nurses make moral judgements with and for those patients.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0969733012455562">6</xref></sup> In the meantime, because of the complex ethical issues raised by developments in medicine and biotechnology, it is essential for nurses to be involved in ethical decision-making processes. Ethical decision-making is requisite for being a professional, and it is interrelated with professional competency and autonomy. Thus, it is important to investigate nurses’ ethical decision-making levels and professionalism.</p>
<p>Studies report that nurses increasingly confront ethical problems in nursing practice. The relationship between nurses’ ethical decision-making levels and their professional conduct is also well acknowledged.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0969733012455562">7</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0969733012455562"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0969733012455562"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0969733012455562">10</xref></sup> However, little is known about the relationship between nurses’ professional behaviours and their ethical decision-making levels within a secular country with a diverse culture that is mainly affected by Islamic religious and Mediterranean patriarchal values. As ethical orientation is strongly related to one’s cultural background and professional behaviours are influenced by various factors, it is of interest to ethicists and nurses across cultures to understand the relationship between nurses’ ethical decision-making levels and their professional conduct.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-0969733012455562">
<title>Background</title>
<p>Nurses have been striving for professionalism for over a century. Although there is no consensus as to what constitutes the proper attributes of a profession, Pavalko<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0969733012455562">11</xref></sup> offered the following criteria: a profession should involve a specialized theory and intellectual technique, should be relevant to basic social values and processes, should reflect the nature of preparation in terms of the amount and specialization of training and should motivate members through their service to society, autonomy of practice, sense of commitment, sense of professional community and codes of ethics. Other investigators also identified similar characteristics of a profession.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0969733012455562">12</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0969733012455562"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0969733012455562">14</xref></sup> While all of these characteristics are interrelated, the code of ethics is essential for autonomy, which allows professionals to make their own judgements and decisions about the services they provide.</p>
<p>Decision-making is a rational process and includes sequential phases of problem recognition, problem identification and evaluation of alternatives and the selection of an alternative. Ethical decision-making is also a rational process involving cognitive activity; however, it also involves moral judgement and justification of the decision.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0969733012455562">15</xref></sup></p>
<p>Kollemorten et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0969733012455562">16</xref></sup> argue that a clinical decision has an ethical component if it is based on a value judgement, either to assess the value of the consequences of a decision or to assess the extent to which the duties of the decision maker and the rights of others are fulfilled. They point out that a value judgement is based on non-scientific premises.</p>
<p>Lawrence Kohlberg<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0969733012455562">17</xref></sup> suggests that individuals progress through three levels in the ability to make moral judgements: (a) the pre-conventional level, when moral decisions are based on rewards and punishments and obedience to authority; (b) the conventional level, when individuals recognize societal laws and rules and are concerned regarding collective welfare and (c) the post-conventional level, when moral decisions are based on internalized moral values and abstract principles. Principled thinking occurs at the post-conventional level; Kohlberg argued that few people attain this level, especially as moral reasoning is stimulated by cognitive conflicts. For Kohlberg, the highest stage of moral development involves a concern for justice and human rights based on internalized universal principles. Although Kohlberg did not link his model of moral development to a process of ethical decision-making, his stages are often used as a measure of moral judgement.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0969733012455562">15</xref></sup> However, Kohlberg’s assumption that moral thinking is equated with a justice perspective has been criticized. For example, Gilligan,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0969733012455562">18</xref></sup> who studied with Kohlberg, questioned his research findings because they were focused solely on males. She found that the moral reasoning and development of women and men differed; women placed more importance on relationships and caring for themselves and others than on rules and principles. Gilligan has focused on the consideration of care for particular persons within the context of particular relationships. Some nurse scholars believe that ethics of care can be used as the basis of ethical decision-making, while critics argue that caring is too subjective<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0969733012455562">19</xref></sup> and is limited as an ethical basis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0969733012455562">20</xref></sup> Others suggest an integrated approach of ethics of justice and ethics of care as a theoretical basis to inform ethical decision-making.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0969733012455562">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0969733012455562">22</xref></sup></p>
<p>Although there is no consensus on which ethical theory or moral perspective decisions should be based, nurses are confronted with ethical problems and are expected to make ethical decisions. However, the nature of ethical problems that involves complex situations and moral dilemmas, in which the moral solution is ambiguous, may influence the ethical decision-making process. In addition, how nurses respond to ethical problems varies by professional experience, autonomy and competency. Social and cultural factors can influence nurses’ professionalism and ethical decision-making. Thus, it is important to examine the relationship between nurses’ ethical decision-making and their professional behaviours from different cultural contexts.</p>
<p>There are numerous instruments for measuring the moral reasoning and moral judgement of individuals, which have been adapted into Turkish, including the short version of the <italic>Defining Issue Test</italic>, which was devised by James Rest<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0969733012455562">23</xref></sup> in 1979 and adapted into Turkish by Cesur<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0969733012455562">24</xref></sup> in 1997, and the <italic>Moral Judgment Abilities Test</italic> (<italic>MJT</italic>; <italic>Moralischer–Urteil–Test</italic> (<italic>MUT</italic>)), developed by Lind<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0969733012455562">25</xref></sup> in 1977 and adapted into Turkish by Çiftçi in 2001.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0969733012455562">26</xref></sup> There are also two instruments, which are specific to nurses and can be used in Turkish context, including the <italic>Moral Sensitivity Questionnaire</italic> developed by Lützen et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0969733012455562">27</xref></sup> in 1994 and adapted into Turkish by Tosun in 2003,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0969733012455562">28</xref></sup> and the <italic>Nurses Ethical Sensitivity Test</italic>, developed by Byrd<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0969733012455562">29</xref></sup> in 2006 and adapted into Turkish by Orgun and Khorshid<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0969733012455562">30</xref></sup> in 2009. However, none of these instruments are specific to nurses’ ethical decision-making. Validated measures of nurses’ ethical decision-making in a different culture could be helpful for nurses to monitor and develop their ethical decision-making skills and professional conduct.</p>

<title>The study</title>
<sec id="section4-0969733012455562">
<title>Aim of the study</title>
<p>Turkey has a collective and paternalistic culture, which emphasizes interdependence, cohesion and loyalty within social groups, and gives priority to collective interest over individual autonomy.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0969733012455562">31</xref></sup> As cultural values are internalized through the process of socializing, culture can influence individuals’ beliefs, values, ethical decisions and professionalism. The aim of this study was to investigate the correlation between nurses’ professional behaviours and their ethical decision-making in a different cultural context by adapting the Nursing Dilemma Test (NDT) into Turkish.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0969733012455562">
<title>Design</title>
<p>This study was descriptive and correlational in design and was conducted in two phases. Phase I, in 2008, included the adaptation, content validity and reliability testing of the NDT. Phase II, in 2009, investigated the correlation between nurses’ professional behaviours and their ethical decisions.</p>
<sec id="section6-0969733012455562">
<title>Study phase I</title>
<p>The first phase of this study included the translation–back translation, content validity and reliability study and preliminary testing of the NDT, which was developed by Patricia Crisham in 1981 at the University of Minnesota. Using interviews with 130 registered nurses who were asked to provide actual experiences with ethical dilemmas in nursing practice, Crisham<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0969733012455562">32</xref></sup> formulated six scenarios. Each scenario presents a situation that is likely to generate moral confusion for nurses who are caring for the patient and family. The ethical dilemmas are as follows: (a) newborn with anomalies, which considers the issue of defining and promoting the quality of life; (b) forcing medication; (c) adults’ requests to die; (d) orientation of a new nurse; (e) medication errors and (f) terminally ill adults. The ‘newborn with anomalies’, ‘forcing medication’ and ‘adult’s request to die’ dilemmas involve issues regarding the client’s right to autonomy. The ‘orientation of a new nurse’ and ‘medication error’ dilemmas consider maintaining professional and institutional standards and the fair distribution of nursing resources in paediatric and surgical nursing. The ‘terminally ill adult’ dilemma addresses a client’s right to know about his personal health care.</p>
<p>In the NDT test, nurses are asked to respond to three sections of questions after each scenario. Section A of each dilemma asks what a nurse should do. Nurses are expected to choose one of three items. For example, the dilemma of forcing medication asks whether the nurse should forcefully give the medication or remain undecided.</p>
<p>In section B, nurses must consider six common items in relation to ethical dilemmas in clinical practice. Nurses are asked to rank the six items in order of importance. The nurses’ responses to this section indicate their <italic>Nursing Principled Thinking</italic> (NP) and <italic>Practical Consideration</italic> (PC). NP refers to an individual level of reasoning and behaviour that reflects the post-conventional level of Kohlberg’s theory of moral development. PC refers to environmental factors, including available resources, institutional policies and perceived management support, that affect ethical decision-making.</p>
<p>In the NDT rankings, the item ranked as the most important for each dilemma received 6 points; each subsequent ranking was given one point less such that the item ranking sixth received 1 point. The NP score was calculated by adding the scores of the NP items across the six dilemmas. The NP index represents the sum of weighted item ranks and is interpreted as the relative importance given to principled moral considerations. The highest possible NP score is 66, and there are two NP items for each dilemma. The relative importance given to PC was indexed in a similar process. The PC index represents the sum of weighted PC ranks and is interpreted as the relative importance given to PC in making a nursing moral decision. The highest possible PC score is 36 with one PC item for each dilemma.</p>
<p>Section C requires nurses to indicate familiarity with the ethical dilemma. Similar to the NDT, familiarity refers to nurses’ previous experiences with the ethical dilemmas. To measure the nurses’ degree of previous involvement with a similar dilemma, a 5-point Likert-type scale was used with each dilemma: ‘1’ indicated ‘made a decision in a similar dilemma’, ‘2’ indicated ‘knew someone else in a similar dilemma’, ‘3’ indicated ‘not known anyone in a similar dilemma but dilemma is conceivable’, ‘4’ indicated ‘difficult to imagine the dilemma as it seems remote’ and ‘5’ indicated ‘difficult to take the dilemma seriously as it seems unreal’. The Familiarity (F) score was calculated by adding the points that indicated the participants’ degree of familiarity across the six dilemmas, and the F index represents the sum of the familiarity scores. The classification of the subject as familiar or unfamiliar with the dilemmas was based on the properties of the F scale: a score of 6–17 indicated familiarity with the dilemmas and a score of 18–30 indicated a lack of familiarity with the dilemmas.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0969733012455562">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0969733012455562">33</xref></sup></p>
<p>In phase I of this study, the NDT was separately translated from English to Turkish by three English language experts. After the translation, researchers prepared the first Turkish version of the NDT by comparing and assessing three translations. The Turkish version of the NDT and its original English version were submitted to three experts in areas of nursing, deontology and history of medicine and Turkish language and literature. These experts checked the first Turkish version of the NDT to measure its compatibility with Turkish language and its content validity. The test was then revised by the researchers to address the critiques and suggestions of the experts. The Turkish version was translated into English by another English language expert to determine whether it corresponded with the original content.</p>
<p>For the assessment of <italic>content validity</italic>, the NDT was pilot tested with a purposeful sampling of 50 volunteer nurses who were employed at a public hospital. Nurses stated that they did not have any difficulties understanding or completing the six dilemma test. Therefore, there was no need for further revision.</p>
<p>To determine the <italic>internal consistency</italic>, the data were entered in the Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) program. We found Cronbach’s αs of .59 for the NP level and .50 for the PC level (n = 50).</p>
<p>To determine the <italic>test–retest reliability</italic>, the test was administered at a 3-week interval to 25 nurses working at a university hospital. Previous studies using tools to measure moral judgement or ethical decision-making of nurses did not provide information on test–retest reliability of the instrument,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0969733012455562">32</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0969733012455562"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0969733012455562"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0969733012455562">35</xref></sup> while Corley et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0969733012455562">36</xref></sup> reported an interval of 3 weeks for test–retest reliability. Our rationale for the 3-week interval for the retest was to reduce the carry-over effect, which refers to remembering the answers from last time, and to reduce the likelihood of work-related factors such as changes in clinical setting and organizational policies that may occur over time and influence nurses’ ethical decision-making. According to the literature, if the Pearson correlation coefficient is within the range .70–.89, then the relationship between the variables is defined as strong.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0969733012455562">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0969733012455562">38</xref></sup> Our test–retest results showed a positive relationship (p &lt; .01; NP: r = .77; PC: r = .73).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-0969733012455562">
<title>Study phase II</title>
<p>The second phase of this study was carried out to investigate the correlation between nurses’ professional behaviours and their ethical decision-making.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-0969733012455562">
<title>Sample</title>
<p>In phase I of this study, a purposeful sample of 50 volunteer nurses was recruited from a public hospital to assess the content validity, and 25 nurses were sampled from a university hospital to assess the reliability of the Turkish version of the NDT. The participants (n = 75) and settings in phase I were different from phase II of the study.</p>
<p>The population in the second phase of this study consisted of 630 nurses with bachelor’s degrees who were employed at three university hospitals in Ankara. The sample size was calculated using the formula n = N t<sup>2</sup> pq/d<italic><sup>2</sup></italic> (N − 1) + t<italic><sup>2</sup></italic> pq, as suggested by Sekaran.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0969733012455562">37</xref></sup> Based on this formula, we calculated the sample size as 242 nurses. Sampling was determined by proportionate stratification. Accordingly, we first identified the number of nurses working at each hospital and then calculated their proportion to the size of the total sample. The participating nurses from each hospital were recruited randomly using a random number table. As 17 nurses refused to participate, the study was conducted with 225 nurses.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-0969733012455562">
<title>Instruments</title>
<p>In the second phase, data were collected with two instruments: the Turkish version of the NDT to measure the ethical decision-making levels of nurses and the Behavioural Inventory for Professionalism in Nursing (BIPN) to measure the professionalism behaviour of the nurses.</p>
<p>The BIPN was developed in 1993 by Barbara Kemp Miller, Dona Adams and Lasca Beck.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0969733012455562">39</xref></sup> The BIPN includes 48 questions. Questions 1–7 involve demographic characteristics of the nurses, and questions 8–48 cover professional behaviour. The BIPN has nine subgroups: (a) educational preparation, referring to the highest nursing degree attained; (b) publication, referring to published nursing articles; (c) research, referring to involvement as investigators or participants; (d) participation in a professional organization; (e) community service participation; (f) competence and continuing education, including reading and subscribing to nursing journals; (g) following a nursing code of ethics; (h) familiarity with nursing theory and (i) autonomy, referring to participation in peer review, nursing audits, quality assurance, self-evaluation and ethics committees, as well as budgeting for their areas, hiring and firing or consulting with other agencies.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0969733012455562">39</xref></sup></p>
<p>Behaviours are weighted within each of the nine categories to equal 3, such that a total scale score of 27 (9 × 3) is possible. Weightings for specific behaviours within each category range from 0.5 to 3. The BIPN was adapted in 2004 into Turkish by Karadağ, Hisar and Elbas,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0969733012455562">40</xref></sup> and its validation and reliability were confirmed (Cronbach’s α = .78–.87).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-0969733012455562">
<title>Data collection</title>
<p>During the period from 16 March 2009 to 30 June 2009, the two instruments were administered to 225 volunteer nurses through face-to-face interviews (response level = 92.97%).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-0969733012455562">
<title>Ethical considerations</title>
<p>The study protocol was officially approved, and ethical clearance was obtained by the Ethical Commission of Hacettepe University. The medical and nursing directories of three university hospitals provided written permission for this study. Nurses were informed about the aims and methods of the study. They were told that their participation must be voluntary and that they could withdraw from the study at any time. Those who agreed to participate signed the informed consent form. Written permission was granted by Patricia Crisham in 2008 for the translation and adaptation of the NDT into Turkish. Similarly, written permission was obtained from Ayişe Karadağ et al. on 15 February 2008 for the use of BIPN.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-0969733012455562">
<title>Data analysis</title>
<p>The SPSS, version 15.00 for Windows, was used for data entry with appropriate coding and statistical analysis. We used descriptive statistics to analyse the demographic data. Mean and standard deviation (SD) were used to identify the NP and PC scores for ethical decision-making and for scores of professionalism behaviours. Cronbach’s αs were calculated for NP and PC scores as a measure of internal consistency, and test–retest reliability was tested with a Pearson correlation coefficient. The degree of association between nurses’ ethical decision-making and professionalism behaviours was also analysed with a Pearson correlation coefficient. Statistical significance was set at p &lt; .05.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section13-0969733012455562">
<title>Results</title>
<p>The age of most participants (86%) ranged from 18 to 30 years. More than half of the participating nurses were working at clinics, and 73% had 5 years of clinical experience. We identified Cronbach’s αs of .68 for the NP level score and .56 (n = 225) for the PC level.</p>
<p>Based on the data from section A of each scenario of NDT, approximately 69% of the nurses were in favour of resuscitation of a newborn with abnormalities, more than half would administer medication against the will of the patient and for the third scenario, 88% would provide respiratory support despite a competent adult patient’s request to die. Almost half of the nurses stated that there is no time allocated for the orientation of new nurses into the paediatric and surgical nursing clinic, as it would compromise patient quality of care. The last scenario included a dilemma about a terminally ill adult who wanted to know his diagnosis in spite of his doctors’ and family members’ wishes. Nurses’ responses to this scenario were quite different, with 40.5% agreeing with the doctor and family and 33.8% remaining undecided (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0969733012455562">Table 1</xref>).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The first limitation of our study is the unacceptably low internal consistency estimates and no reported test–retest reliability for NDT, despite its use in several studies without additional testing.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0969733012455562">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0969733012455562">41</xref></sup> Compared to the original NDT, we obtained higher Cronbach’s αs for NP (.68) and PC (.56) scores, and used test–retest reliability, indicating positive correlation coefficients; however, our results also showed low reliability for this test. In addition, although NDT content validity was approved by experts, we did not assess construct and concurrent validity.</p>
<p>The second limitation is NDT scenarios representing ethical dilemmas. Although several instruments were translated into Turkish to measure the moral reasoning of individuals, no instrument in Turkey measured specifically the ethical decision-making level of the nurses. In this study, we also used the NDT because the scenarios were formulated by Crisham<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0969733012455562">32</xref></sup> after interviews with 130 registered nurses who provided actual experiences with ethical dilemmas. The current study also provides evidence that most of the nurses in our sample were familiar with similar ethical dilemmas in clinical practice. Thus, the six ethical scenarios included in the NDT address a variety of client care challenges in nursing practice. In addition, the NDT measures not only nurses’ responses to ethical dilemmas, and their level of moral reasoning, but also the importance given to PCs that may affect moral reasoning. Therefore, we considered the NDT more applicable to nursing practice. However, some of the ethical dilemmas presented in the NDT might be regarded as scenarios involving moral distress, rather than really ethical dilemmas. Corley<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0969733012455562">42</xref></sup> suggests that when nurses cannot do what they think is right, they experience moral distress. According to Jameton,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0969733012455562">43</xref></sup> moral distress refers to a negative state of painful psychological imbalance experienced when nurses make a moral decision but cannot act accordingly because of real or perceived institutional constraints. Indeed, nurses are required to make decisions that take into account many factors, including the institutional policies, organizational ethical climate and the expectations of the organizational authorities as well as their professional, ethical and legal responsibilities. In the study of Pauly et al.,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0969733012455562">44</xref></sup> moral distress intensity and frequency were found to be inversely correlated with perceptions of ethical climate, which is described by Olson<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0969733012455562">45</xref></sup> as the presence of organizational conditions that allow employees to engage in ethical reflection, and that provides the context for ethical decision-making in the clinical setting. Although the sixth item of section B in the NDT measures the importance of PCs for each scenario, most of the ethical dilemmas require nurses to make decisions by considering the orders of physicians for patient care. For example, whether to resuscitate a newborn with abnormalities or not depends upon the physicians’ resuscitation order. Similarly, answering a terminally ill patient’s questions about his medical diagnosis or condition is beyond the nurses’ legal authority in Turkey. Except any condition that poses risk for a patient, nurses have a legal obligation to carry out physicians’ written order, but they are also legally obliged to respect patient rights, which require nurses to inform patients about their medical condition. Thus, due to the medical context of the ethical dilemmas of NDT, it is possible for nurses in our sample to perceive their professional autonomy as under siege and feel unable to make their own ethical decisions due to external restraints or their professional and legal obligations.</p>
<p>The third limitation relates to representativeness of 225 nurses working at three university hospitals in Ankara. Although university hospitals differ from public hospitals by combining the health-care services with education and research activities, regardless of hospital or work setting, nurses are legally authorized to provide care for the individual, family and community, and to administer treatment and medications ordered by a physician. However, according to Turkish Ministry of Health 2010 data, Ankara has 72 hospitals, 9 (12%) of which are university hospitals.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0969733012455562">46</xref></sup> This limits the generalizability of our sample. Further research with a larger sample is required to assess the psychometric properties of NDT and to investigate the correlation between nurses’ professional behaviours and ethical decision-making.</p>
<p>Fourth, our data are based on nurses’ responses to hypothetical scenarios in NDT and the closed questionnaire format of the BIPN. Finally, factors influencing ethical decision-making and professional behaviour were not focused on separately. Despite these limitations, we believe this study contributes to nursing ethics in Turkey and offers insights into the relationship between ethical decision-making and professional conduct of nurses from a different culture.</p>
<sec id="section15-0969733012455562">
<title>Nurses’ ethical decision-making</title>
<p>In this study, most nurses were familiar with ethical dilemmas of NDT. Our findings support studies suggesting that nurses frequently face ethical dilemmas.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0969733012455562">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0969733012455562">47</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0969733012455562">48</xref></sup> Familiarity with such dilemmas may contribute to nurses’ awareness of ethical problems in health care and can increase their capability to reason and find possible solutions for problems that require ethical decision-making. Nurses’ responses to dilemma 1 (resuscitation of an anomalous newborn) and dilemma 3 (an adult’s request to die) suggested that most of them favour pro-life rather than life quality. Their responses to dilemma 3 and the last dilemma (a terminal adult’s right to know) revealed their concern for the patient’s life rather than respecting autonomy. Responses to scenarios on forceful administration of medication and reporting a medication error indicated that they considered patients’ welfare from a paternalistic perspective. These findings can be ascribed to nurses’ religious orientations and cultural backgrounds. Studies report that culture and religion can affect ethical decision-making.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0969733012455562">49</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0969733012455562"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0969733012455562">51</xref></sup> Islam, the main religion in Turkey, stresses sanctity of life, and Turkish culture is highly patriarchal and collectivistic. In this study, nurses’ pro-life and paternalistic choices against patients’ autonomy imply that religious and cultural orientations influence ethical decisions.</p>
<p>The mean NP score (47.89) was lower than other scores reported<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0969733012455562">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0969733012455562">41</xref></sup> (54.5 (SD = 6.75) in Crisham’s study).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0969733012455562">47</xref></sup> PC scores were similar to those in previous studies.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0969733012455562">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0969733012455562">47</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0969733012455562">48</xref></sup> Results of this study indicate that nurses consider principled thinking when making ethical decisions; however, their decisions are influenced by cultural/work-related factors.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section16-0969733012455562">
<title>Nurses’ professional behaviours</title>
<p>In this study, nurses’ professional behaviour levels were very low (5.97 (SD = 3.80)). Karadağ et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0969733012455562">52</xref></sup> also found low professionalism scores (5.45 (SD = 5.10)), whereas Adams and Miller’s<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0969733012455562">53</xref></sup> average score was 16.70 (SD = 3.60). Nurses’ professional behaviours may influence public perception of nursing and care quality. Our findings have implications for practicing manager and educator nurses and should also be interpreted within the historical development of nursing in Turkey. Formal nursing education started in 1925, and higher education was accelerated after the 1990s. The patriarchal Turkish culture affects nursing care quality and nurses’ professional behaviours while shaping the hierarchical structure in hospitals where physicians are dominant in decision-making. Nurses also reported that differences in education levels; increasing workload in our country, as well as throughout the world; lack of job security and inadequate staff and resources contributed negatively to their professional behaviours.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section17-0969733012455562">
<title>The correlation of nurses’ professional behaviours and ethical decision-making levels</title>
<p>Our results showed a weak positive correlation between NP scores and nurses’ professional behaviours, particularly for participation in research activities and professional organizations, maintaining competence, and continuing education and autonomy (r = .172–.287).</p>
<p>Competence, continued education and professional autonomy are among basic criteria of professionalism. Professional autonomy entails exercising judgement of one’s own work using professional values and standards. Professional autonomy and competency are important as ethical decision-making requires independent reasoning and accountability. In this study, nurses lacking professional autonomy did not consider themselves active decision makers, a finding consistent with literature.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0969733012455562">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0969733012455562">53</xref></sup> NP was also correlated with participation in research (r = .287). Independent research or participation in research is important for ethical decision-making, which involves collecting data, defining the problem, considering alternative solutions, finalizing an action and evaluating the results. However, research without ethics can lead to scientific misconduct. Making ethical decisions requires integrity of researchers, and ability to distinguish right from wrong while planning, conducting and reporting research. Although participation in research is important, being ethical is the first and foremost requirement for professionalism. Nurses’ scores were low, despite the correlation between nurses’ principled thinking and research dimension of professional behaviour. Since our sample largely comprised clinical nurses not qualified to conduct research, their analytical and problem-solving skills were lower than expected. The results indicate that nurses’ ethical decision-making levels are related to their low professional behaviour levels.</p>
</sec>

<sec id="section18-0969733012455562">
<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>This study demonstrated that the NDT can be used for measuring the ethical decision-making levels of nurses; however, additional testing of the validity and reliability is needed. Our results indicated that nurses face ethical problems in practice; they considered principled thinking while making ethical decisions but not at the expected level. Further studies from both empirical and philosophical perspectives may broaden our understanding of the relationship between nurses’ professional behaviours and ethical decision-making.</p>
