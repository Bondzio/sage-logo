<abstract>
<p>South Africa and India are viewed as incipient economic powerhouses of the developing world – South Africa is the biggest economy on the African continent and India a rising star in the global economy. Both countries have adopted neoliberal policies. The forms in which neoliberalism has unfolded, however, have been contingent upon the countries’ and utility sector’s historical-geographical context. In this paper we attempt to provide a comparative perspective demonstrating similar processes of neoliberalism in South Africa and India. We examine the contradictory nature of neoliberalism with respect to particular sections of the population – the poor in particular. A broadly political-economy approach is adopted. The paper reveals that there is particular state-market logic driving the delivery of basic services such as water and energy. It is this logic which has undermined the states’ attempts at providing basic services to the poor in particular.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The global neoliberal phenomenon, very much the hegemonic economic discourse for a generation now, has influenced the developing world in fundamental ways. The discursive power of neoliberalism, manifested in creative destruction and spatial transformation, are clearly discernible at different scales. The variegated nature of the discourse has been examined by geographers who suggest that it may be too simplistic to view neoliberalism as a homogenous global phenomenon (c.f., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0021909611429922">Larner and Laurie, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0021909611429922">Peck, 2010</xref>). While this view is not without merit, it is equally important to concede that there is a global dynamic that drives the discourse. This dynamic, in developing economies, is unleashed with the rhetoric of free markets, focussed on transforming public utilities/assets into corporate-controlled private property. But, these forces do not present themselves in the same way everywhere. It reveals itself globally historically and geographically. It is essential, therefore, to consider the historical geographical materialism of the phenomenon.</p>
<p>South Africa and India have both been impacted by this phenomenon and adopted neoliberal policies at roughly the same time during the 1990s. Additionally, both countries are part of a new geopolitical re-alignment as rising economic power blocs on the African and Asian continents respectively. Yet both countries find themselves facing huge developmental challenges in terms of delivery to the masses. In South Africa unemployment rates vary between 25–37% and its Gini<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0021909611429922">1</xref></sup> coefficient is among the highest in the world. As compared to other countries in the world, India ranks 118th in terms of unemployment rate – in fact, unemployment in India increased from 8.8% in 2003 to 10.7% in 2010. In terms of Gini coefficient India is ranked 79th, with more than 250 million people living below the poverty line. Generally, both South Africa and India have failed to meet their responsibilities to their citizens. In this paper we demonstrate how this has occurred through a consideration of the water sector in South Africa and the energy sector in India. We contend that a market logic which has informed the states’ practice has undermined developmental goals. This paper provides a comparative perspective on neoliberalism as it has unfolded in the water and energy sectors in South Africa and India, respectively.</p>
<p>This paper is divided into three main parts. In what follows, a very brief historical geographical exposition of neoliberalism will be undertaken. This is done on purpose given that the history of neoliberalism has been well enunciated (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0021909611429922">George, 1997</xref>; and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0021909611429922">Harvey, 2006</xref>, for useful accounts which approach our own position). Thereafter, neoliberalism and its impact on the water sector in South Africa will be examined, followed by an exposition of the neoliberalization of the energy sector in India.</p>

<title>The Rise of Neoliberalism</title>
<p>Keynesianism was the dominant developmental discourse at the global scale during the period following World War II. Keynes, in his <italic>General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0021909611429922">1936</xref>) had argued that real investment (in new factories, tools, machines, and greater inventories of goods) was the crucial variable: changes in real investment fed into other areas of an economy. The decision to invest, Keynes said, depended on comparisons between expected profits and the prevailing interest rate. Keynes explained interest rate in terms of speculation about future stock prices which, in turn, determined interest rates as savings moved from one fund to another, which again depended on expectations about the future. For example, investors bought machines, thereby providing income to machine builders. In turn they spent money, further increasing national income, through the <italic>multiplier effect</italic><sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0021909611429922">2</xref></sup> varying with the proportion of additional income that was spent rather than saved, and so on; a decrease in real investment had the reverse effect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0021909611429922">Peet and Hartwick, 2009</xref>). The government could influence this process through monetary policies, shifting the economy from one equilibrium level to another, and generally to higher employment levels. Keynesian economic theory, in a sense, established the legitimacy of state intervention into market economies with the aim of achieving growth rates decided on the basis of social policy. Aspects of the Keynesian economic theory, coupled with socialist objectives of striving for social, economic and political justice and equality of status and opportunity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0021909611429922">Austin, 1999</xref>), became the guiding principal for development policy formulation of the post World War II era.</p>
<p>Keynesianism as the dominant developmental discourse at the global scale, however, started facing opposition, from what has come to be known as neoliberalism, in the late 1960s. The main arguments put forth under the rubric of neoliberal policy regime are: (1) that macroeconomic problems like inflation and indebtedness derived from excessive government spending drive up the quantity of money circulating in a society; (2) that a dalliance with a ‘socialist idea’ (like Keynesian planning) would lead to disaster and that classical Smithian and Ricardian economic principles should be relied on instead; and (3) that laissez-faire and rugged individualism was in general good for all economies and societies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0021909611429922">Chang and Garbel, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0021909611429922">Peet and Hartwick, 2009</xref>). Neoliberal discourse gained precedence over Keynesianism in the 1970s against the backdrop of a macroeconomic crisis which included stagflation<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0021909611429922">3</xref></sup> and instability in global commodity markets and business cycles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0021909611429922">Peck and Tickell, 2002</xref>). Neoliberal economic policies came into effect under the governments of Prime Minister Thatcher in Britain and President Reagan in the United States in the early 1980s, accompanied by the rhetoric that there was no alternative, popularly referred to as the TINA factor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0021909611429922">Chang and Garbel, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0021909611429922">Krieger, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0021909611429922">Toye, 1987</xref>). The initiation of neoliberal policy in the United States and Britain was accompanied by the transformation of the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund (IMF).</p>
<p>Neoliberalism became the dominant global economic discourse during the 1980s. Through instruments such the structural and stabilization policies of the World Bank and the IMF the neoliberal approach gained traction in the developing world.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0021909611429922">4</xref></sup> In so doing, markets were opened up and created for private capital. Policies such as: privatization; inflation targeting; regressive taxation; export oriented trade, and so on, became fairly ubiquitous in the developing world. Having said this, there were various discourses informing this dynamic such as the New Public Management approaches developed during the 1980s (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0021909611429922">Hood, 1995</xref>). The public sector had in effect been ‘rolled back’ (c.f. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0021909611429922">Peck and Tickell, 1994</xref>) and what was also apparent was that this sphere was increasingly being invaded and colonized by the private sector (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0021909611429922">Clarke, 2004</xref>). According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0021909611429922">Harvey (2010)</xref>, colonization of the public sector occurred against the backdrop of a successful assault upon organized labour, the ostensible demise of nation state-based monopoly capitalism and the opening up of capitalism to fiercer international competition, and deindustrialization of the traditional core regions and new forms of industrialization and natural resource extraction in emergent markets along with the financialization (creation of fictitious capital markets) of the global economy. The public sector in countries like South Africa and India, apparently, were willingly mimicking private-sector approaches, also because of contradictions within their respective national economies. Prior to neoliberalization, such states had become populist – in India, for example, several state governments promised free electricity to poor, as well as rich farmers, simply to win elections. Such populist strategies impacted the financial health of public utility companies. So, private sector approaches such as marketization and commercialization were being mimicked by the public sector. Previously-untapped markets such as water and electricity were now being targeted as new frontiers for unlocking value for private capital.</p>

<title>The Rise of Neoliberalism in South Africa<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0021909611429922">5</xref></sup></title>
<p>When the African National Congress (ANC) came to power in 1994, the Reconstruction and Development Programme (RDP), which was its election manifesto, became government policy. However, in order for this to happen there was a need for the RDP ‘base document’ to be translated into government policy. The RDP was a broadly basic needs-oriented development treatise. The RDP, in its formulation, and as functional policy, was the site of hegemonic struggle between contending social and economic forces. It was an instrument which could have been used in different ways. For example, the chapter on the provision of basic needs could have served as a template for a socialist order, the public works programmes and its spin-offs had a Keynesian tenor, while the chapter on the restructuring of the economy had a conservative and even perhaps neoliberal orientation.</p>
<p>The translation of the ANC election manifesto into the government RDP ‘Green Paper’ showed a distinct shift in emphasis from basic needs to a supply-side bias. With the publication of the RDP White Paper in September 1994, it was apparent that the people-centred development drive of the RDP base document had been effectively abandoned. In this regard, the Preamble, written by President Nelson Mandela, was of importance. The emphasis had shifted to macroeconomic policy which would: reduce the fiscal deficit; ensure that government expenditure did not increase in real terms; reduce government dissaving; alter the ratio of government spending in favour of capital expenditure; and initiate intensive labour market reform (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0021909611429922">Republic of South Africa [RSA], 1994</xref>).</p>
<p>Chapter four of the RDP base document, which set out a relatively conservative macroeconomic position, formed the basis of the White Paper. Here a more market oriented approach was adopted, with the new government embracing privatization through the sale of state assets and the abolition of exchange controls. Not surprisingly, the response from business to the RDP White Paper was favourable.</p>
<p>By February 1996 the National Strategy for Growth and Development (NSGD) had been unveiled. With the NSGD – punted as a strategy to boost the RDP – the direction of the RDP was ineluctably re-oriented towards issues focussed on growth. Emphasis was placed on export competitiveness, fiscal discipline, restructuring the civil service, and tariff reform. The main themes of the strategy were to increase GDP growth to 6% per annum, creating between 300,000 and 500,000 jobs by the year 2000. Job creation was to be underpinned by a 10% annual increase in private and public investment and non-gold exports. Other elements of the new strategy were: increased investment in education and training; a national crime prevention strategy; transformation of the public sector; and a social security system targeting the poorest sector of the population. It was apparent that the ‘right’ signals had to be sent to the markets – South Africa was experiencing a currency crisis in early 1996 as the rand lost almost a quarter of its value against major currencies. Growth superceded social equity, culminating in the closure of the RDP office at the end of March 1996.</p>
<p>In June of that year a new macroeconomic policy was presented to South Africa’s parliament – the ‘Growth, Employment and Redistribution’ (GEAR) policy. The GEAR policy was in many ways merely an elaboration of the NSGD. Minister Trevor Manuel and head of the ANC economic policy pronounced the policy ‘non-negotiable’. This was in stark contrast to the process which had informed the RDP. GEAR was drafted by a small group of 14 ‘experts’ on economic policy, government officials, academics and those from institutions such as the World Bank. Some of the salient features of the GEAR policy were: budget reform; a deficit reduction programme; and restructuring of state assets, among others. The political battles had been won to ensure that GEAR would be implemented somewhat ruthlessly. In effect, South Africa was to be governed from the Reserve Bank and the Department of Finance. Therefore, other departments had to ensure that their policies were aligned to the GEAR document. The process of neoliberalization had thus been effected. In what follows we will discuss how the water sector assumed the tenor if not the substantive concerns of the GEAR policy.</p>

<title>The Neoliberalization of the Water Sector in South Africa</title>
<p>The articulation of neoliberalism geographically and in the water sector specifically has been the focus of a not-insubstantial literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0021909611429922">Bakker, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0021909611429922">Laurie, 2007a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0021909611429922">2007b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0021909611429922">Marvin and Laurie, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0021909611429922">Swyngedouw, 1997</xref>). This literature has been informed by a number of theoretical positions – in geography the dominant discourse has been the neoliberalization of nature and, to a lesser extent, the impact of market-driven influences on water services delivery (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0021909611429922">Castree, 2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0021909611429922">2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0021909611429922">Larner, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0021909611429922">Peck and Tickell, 2002</xref>). This literature has covered the various geographical scales: global; national; and local. It has also engaged with the water sector in both the developed and developing world (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0021909611429922">Laurie, 2007a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0021909611429922">2007b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0021909611429922">Laurie and Crespo, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>In South Africa there has been some work which focusses on the water sector. However, this work is uneven in its geographical focus. Much of the geographical literature on water services in South Africa has an urban focus, specifically metropolitan – research on Cape Town and Johannesburg being most often reported and, to a lesser extent, Durban (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0021909611429922">Loftus, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0021909611429922">McDonald and Pape, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0021909611429922">Naidoo, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0021909611429922">Narsiah, 2010</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0021909611429922">2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0021909611429922">Ruiters, 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>The Water Services Act was proclaimed in 1997 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0021909611429922">RSA, 1997</xref>). The National Water Act was proclaimed in 1998 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0021909611429922">RSA, 1998</xref>). The National Water Act is a comprehensive, weighty document covering the whole gamut of the water sector in South Africa. While at first sight these acts appear to adhere to the principles of equity and social redress, there are certain provisions which allow for the neoliberalization of water services provision, particularly at the local level. For example, the Water Services Act creates the space for the private sector to provide water services:
<disp-quote>
<p>A water services authority may only enter into a contract with a private sector water services provider after it has considered all known public sector water services providers which are willing and able to perform relevant functions. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0021909611429922">RSA, 1997</xref>: 24)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>There have been several municipalities which have used this provision in the law to allow the entry of the private sector into water services provision. For example, shortly after the Water Services Act (1997) was passed, in 1998 the Dolphin Coast municipality, which is situated on the north coast of the province of KwaZulu-Natal, entered into a management contract with the French SAUR company and the Nelspruit municipality in Mpumalanga province entered into a contract with the British Biwater-Nuon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0021909611429922">Hall et al., 2002</xref>). During the 1990s water privatization occurred in the Eastern Cape towns of Stutterheim, Fort Beaufort, and Queenstown. Suffice to say they were all beset with major difficulties resulting in their subsequent collapse and the abandonment of the concessions by Suez-Lyonnaise, also a French company (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0021909611429922">Ruiters, 2002</xref>). The use of market mechanisms in the provision of basic necessities such as water, apartheid geography, and the developmental challenges of the infant democracy throws the policy decisions of the post-apartheid state into stark relief. Clearly, the policy decisions were flawed. And, what was also apparent was that local municipalities were being courted by the private sector on the one hand and were also under pressure from the finance ministry to be financially viable. This would account for the uncommon haste with which the Dolphin Coast and Nelspruit entered into agreements with the private sector. The ‘invisible hand’ of the market was indeed at work – in a phrase, neoliberalism was realized at the local scale. To ensure profits, residents were faced with almost instantaneous increases in tariffs and a full cost recovery policy was implemented. Furthermore, technologies, such as prepaid water meters, were introduced ensuring that consumers paid for water before use. The use of the prepaid meter meant that consumers had to discipline their water use – economic principles governed how much water one consumed. Access to clean potable water was governed by the ability to pay for it.</p>
<p>A case-in-point is Johannesburg, one of South Africa’s largest cities. In 2001, the city corporatized its water services. The corporatization of public services is indicative of the use of business principles to govern public utilities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0021909611429922">Naidoo, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0021909611429922">Narsiah, 2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0021909611429922">2011</xref>). Johannesburg Water came into operation – a management contract was awarded to a consortium led by the Suez-Lyonnaise company. An analysis of water use patterns in the metro revealed a substantial amount of non-revenue water.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0021909611429922">6</xref></sup> The analysis also revealed a geographical pattern in that a large amount of non-revenue water was being lost in the former ‘black’ township residential areas of Soweto.</p>
<p>Briefly, Soweto residents had paid a flat fee for water under apartheid. Their connections were unmetered. Johannesburg Water then started to implement a programme of metering so that residents could be billed for their water consumption. In the poorer areas of Soweto, such as Phiri, a system of prepaid meters was rolled out amid staunch opposition from the community. The implementation of prepaid meters meant that residents had to pay more for their water – and this in an area where poverty, unemployment and disease was endemic. The resistance of the community was such that Johannesburg Water was taken to court. In various progressive judgements, the community won concessions declaring prepaid water meters unconstitutional and poor people were to be provided with an increased amount of free basic water.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0021909611429922">7</xref></sup> Unfortunately, when the case reached the Constitutional Court of South Africa<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-0021909611429922">8</xref></sup> the court decided that market principles were an over-determining factor and that the market could be used as a desirable mechanism to address human rights (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0021909611429922">Narsiah, 2011</xref>). The court had confirmed that water as an economic good – a commodity – superceded water as a human right.</p>
<p>The neoliberalization of the water sector in South Africa, explored above, reveals that the discourse is not homogenous, rather spatially uneven in effect. It ought to be borne in mind that the spaces for the neoliberalization of the water services sector in South Africa were created in the water services legislation passed in the aftermath of the neoliberal GEAR policy. The Water Act of 1998 states that a pricing strategy may be established which differentiates among geographical areas and which is based on the user pays principle. Additionally, the act makes provision for the restriction or suspension of water supply (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0021909611429922">RSA, 1998</xref>). A progressive reading of the legislation would suggest that people who had been discriminated against under the apartheid regime would be the target of positive redress in the democratic era. Specifically, the spatial nature of apartheid meant that race was spatially inscribed creating the template for the developmental needs of poor people to be addressed. Thus, instead of people living in these areas paying economic rates for water, they could be afforded subsidized rates. One strategy is a flat-rate with rebate.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-0021909611429922">9</xref></sup></p>
<p>What is clear is that, during the democratic era, there has been an almost uniform application of the increasing block tariff approach. Here, tariffs are levied according to specific quantities of consumption. In addition a fixed charge is also attached to each block. The economic rationale here is to recover costs. So, even though residents may be under the impression that they are receiving a certain quantity of water free of charge under the free basic water policy, this neat accounting strategy ensures that they are actually paying for it. And this is the basis of the neoliberal approach to water services – the use of costing strategies which ensure full cost recovery. It also ensures that subsidies are virtually eradicated. Furthermore, stringent credit control mechanisms are enforced.</p>
<p>In Durban, which lies on the east coast of South Africa in the province of KwaZulu-Natal, the neoliberalization of water services has taken on a different form. Here, water services are not privatized as in Nelspruit or the Dolphin Coast; rather, private sector principles are used in the governance of the sector. Here, the water services sector operates as a business unit. Water is costed according to the rising block tariff approach. A stringent cost recovery and credit control approach is adhered to.</p>
<p>Durban has also adopted an overtly spatial approach to the provision of water services in the region. Durban was declared a metropolitan area shortly before the first local government election in 2001. The creation of a metropolitan area dramatically altered the spatial extent of the former City of Durban’s administration by some 66%, most of it rural. What the Durban Metro Water Services (DMWS) inherited, therefore, were: areas with little or no infrastructure; no roads; and importantly, no information (maps, engineering data etc.). In consequence, a strategy had to be designed to ensure that water and sanitation services be extended to those living in the rural areas of the metro. But, financial viability became the over-determining factor. The key question was how to provide a financially-sustainable service to those living in rural areas. In this regard geography played a central role. The central urban core had received a relatively high quality full pressure service when the City of Durban was in existence. For the technocrats at DMWS such a service could not be rolled out to the rural areas – it would have bankrupted the unit.</p>
<p>A geographical strategy whereby different levels of service were identified enabled the DMWS to run a financially-sustainable operation. In effect, this constituted a neoliberalization of space. Market principles – financial concerns – informed space. Those who could not afford to pay for a full pressure service had the option of ground/rooftanks, electronic water bailiffs, and semi-pressure systems. In socio-economic terms, it was almost exclusively the poor who had in effect no choice but to opt for that service.</p>
<p>A technological solution was found to the financial conundrum: people living in rural areas would be provided with a free basic water allocation as prescribed in the Water Acts; that is, they would receive 200 litres of water per household per day. The water was supplied during the off-peak demand period – from 12 midnight to 2.00am. In consequence, the cost of infrastructure to these areas dropped significantly. The metro has highlighted this as one of its success stories. One should bear in mind that the cost of the infrastructure was borne at national level through the Municipal Infrastructure Grant (MIG) and the cost for the provision of water is borne through the Equity Share allocation.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-0021909611429922">10</xref></sup> Thus the financial obligations of the municipality are drastically reduced.</p>
<p>Neoliberalism is an economic discourse that dispenses discipline – it creates objects and subjects in its own image. The power of the discourse is such that people view themselves in its own terms. When one considers the provision of water to people living in Durban it is apparent that this discourse acts to discipline consumption. People living in these areas have to discipline their water consumption so as not to run out of the resource within the first few hours of the day. In effect, they have to ensure that the 200 litres of water lasts the whole day until it is refilled at night. People living in the urban core, however, have an unlimited, full pressure supply. This raises questions of equality and equity.</p>
<p>The constitution of the Republic of South Africa has various clauses relating to equality. And, given that the historical legacy of apartheid is steeped in inequalities relating to socio-economic rights in particular, it would therefore be incumbent on the state to address these issues in an equitable manner. Clearly, in the Durban this is not the case. In effect constitutional principles have given way to market rules – in a word neoliberalism. The neoliberal approach, driven by an almost fanatical focus on monetarist concerns, ensured that governance would be over-determined by financial viability. Thus cutbacks to municipalities forced these entities, almost by default, to adopt and implement neoliberal approaches at the local scale. From an examination of the water sector in South Africa it is apparent that neoliberal approaches, while uneven in their application and in their spatial effect, are very much the dominant tools of government.</p>

<title>The Rise of Neoliberalism in India</title>
<p>India emerged as an independent nation-state in 1947. During the period up to the late 1980s India had followed a broadly Keynesian approach. By 1991, however, India was being coerced into adopting neoliberal policies by the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank. These institutions were responsible for bailing India out of a balance of payments crisis that had been accentuated by the first Gulf War leading to the rise in price of petroleum, sudden decline in remittances from the large number of Indians working in the Middle East, and collapse of the Soviet Union, leading to sharp decline in India’s foreign trade (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0021909611429922">Bhalla, 2001</xref>). In the following section, we examine the transition of India’s electricity sector from Keynesian principles and socialist goals to neoliberalism. The neoliberalization of the electricity sector in India, however, has met with failure.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0021909611429922">
<title>The Neoliberalization of the Energy Sector in India</title>
<p>Before India’s independence, electricity was generated and supplied locally by private entrepreneurs, enterprising municipalities and provincial governments. The emphasis was on supply to large urban concentrations, and there was little coordination or cooperation between different suppliers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0021909611429922">Rao, 2002</xref>). In the colonial economy, the generation and supply of power had clear-cut extractive and profit motives; that is, making immediate profit was the sole motive of electricity generators and suppliers. The colonial government had no plans for promoting electricity generation and supply to produce the long-term social and infrastructural development of India. The function of policy and legislation<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-0021909611429922">11</xref></sup> was to ‘regulate the generation, supply and use of electricity . . . and for the protection of person and property, from injury and risks’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0021909611429922">Government of India, 1910</xref>). The post-colonial Indian state, in sharp contrast, envisaged electricity as a vital input in facilitating India’s long-term economic growth and development. Drawing broadly from the United Kingdom (UK)’s Electricity (Supply) Act (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0021909611429922">British Government, 1926</xref>), which had elements of state intervention in the process of national development, the Government of India passed the Electricity (Supply) Act of 1948. The Electricity (Supply) Act of 1948 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0021909611429922">Government of India, 1948</xref>) reflected the government’s vision of development by stating that ‘the coordinated development of electricity in India on a regional basis was a matter of increasingly urgent importance for the post-war reconstruction and development’. State-supported development was envisaged as a strategy to consolidate national identity. So the goal, stated in the Electricity (Supply) Act, was ‘to facilitate the establishment of regional coordination in the development of electricity transcending the geographical limits of local bodies’. The act provided ‘for the rationalization of the production and supply of electricity and generally for taking measures conducive to the electrical development of the Provinces of India’. This enabled the creation of state electricity boards for promoting the coordinated development for the generation, supply and distribution of electricity in the provinces and in other areas of India. The Industrial Policy Resolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0021909611429922">Government of India, 1956</xref>) reserved generation and distribution of electricity almost exclusively for the states, allowing existing private licensees, however, to continue. Amendments in 1976 to the existing acts on electricity enabled power generation companies to be set up, with close coordination between the federal/central and state governments.</p>
<p>In the late 1980s, a ‘new breed of entrepreneurs’, along with a newly-sympathetic government, began to follow global trends vis-à-vis the electric-power sector. Massive restructuring and privatization of the power sector was taking place in Chile and the UK. This privatization policy had ramifications for the working-class movement in the UK, where the Scargill-led Coal Miners Union was the backbone of working-class opposition to the conservative agenda of the Conservative government. By privatizing electricity generation, the Conservative government opened the door for the use of any fuel – imported or domestic. This removed British coal from its pre-eminent position in electricity generation. Oil and imported Australian coal soon replaced expensive British coal, and led the entire British coal mining sector into bankruptcy. British coal mines closed one by one, and the power of the Coal Miners’ Union was effectively broken (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0021909611429922">Purkayastha and Prashad, 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>The ‘employee problem’ was a major issue in the Indian power sectors as well (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0021909611429922">Upadhyay, 2000</xref>). The state electricity boards in India were considered notorious for worker strikes – so privatization of this sector was considered as an effective ‘remedy’. In addition, Britain’s case demonstrated that private companies could use discriminatory strategies in the supply of electricity, something that public sector units could not (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0021909611429922">Thomas, 2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0021909611429922">2004</xref>). The new breed of Indian entrepreneurs found this possibility attractive. They had the money to pay for uninterrupted power supplies and they felt that their electricity needs would automatically be prioritized, as was being done in Britain, since private investors would not be burdened with the social responsibility of observing equity and equality in electricity supply. Further, the discourse of privatized efficiency became entrenched in the imagination of the entrepreneurial class, first, because of the collapse of the Soviet Union and its economy and, second, because Indians began to look to the United States (US) and the UK as models to emulate to ensure rapid economic growth. The entrepreneurial class, along with policy makers, were now of the opinion that the best way to meet the shortfall in power generation in the country was to promote the free market in this sector.</p>
<p>The demands of and lobbying by the elite and the opinion of few policy makers was simply not enough to force privatization of this vital industry. But, when India accepted conditional loans from the World Bank and the IMF, these global governance institutions, in no uncertain terms, pointed out that the electricity sector had to be restructured. Future loans from the World Bank to this vital sector were linked or conditional on structural adjustments and marketization of generation, transmission and distribution of electricity. As elements of neoliberal policy were adopted during 1991, amendments to the existing power policies were made. In that year, electricity generation was opened to private investment, including foreign investment. Further amendments in 1998 opened transmission to private investment, subject to approval by the Central Transmission Utility (a public sector undertaking), with a license issued by the Central Electricity Regulatory Commission.</p>
<p>The neoliberalization of India’s electricity policy has also been facilitated by a change in the mindset of the urban elite and middle-class population and, in turn, the general discourse about the poor, and nature of development and its relationship with the electricity sector. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0021909611429922">Rao (2002)</xref> has argued that there seem to be certain attitudes that are almost axiomatic in the electricity sector. Prior to the adoption of neoliberal policies in India, electricity was considered as a fundamental right that had to be supplied irrespective of the inability of certain sections of the population to pay. The generally-accepted discourse was that the lives of a large number of very poor people, and opportunities for their economic advancement, would greatly improve if electricity was available to them, and that making electricity available should be the responsibility of the state. Increases in the accessibility to electricity in economically-backward regions, and among the poorer sections of the population, were understood as desirable social goals. Thus state ownership, that gave precedence to social objectives over profit motives, was understood as good for society. Generation and supply of electricity were seen as opportunities to expand and create employment by the Indian state adhering to Keynesian economic policy and socialist goals.</p>
<p>Neoliberal policies, however, are embedded in an elite discourse. Proponents of neoliberal policies argue that power generation and distribution should be run on the principles of efficiency and profit, rather than on the basis of social objectives, and that this will ensure the sector’s growth. State ownership of this sector is seen, by comparison, as subsidizing and supporting inefficiency. ‘Professional management’, as opposed to bureaucratic control, is epitomized as rational, qualitatively different and better. The power sector’s social objective of creating employment opportunities is criticized for giving rise to inefficiency. Markets, as opposed to the state, are understood as being fair, and the state’s effort to ensure accessibility to electricity by backward regions and the poor are criticized as being populist measures to attract votes. The current mindset of the elite, and the neoliberal policies streaming out of such a mindset, alludes to the fact that neoliberalism is the reassertion of class and caste power in India.</p>
<p>We had earlier pointed out that the mobilization of the urban elite and middle class was fundamental to India’s neoliberalization. In the electricity power sector, too, demands and mindset of the urban elite is fundamental to its policy changes. Urban centres with high foreign direct investments are spaces with relatively-high levels of affluence, juxtaposed with squalor and slums. During the last few years, the urban elites have increasingly tried to sanitize their localities of poverty and the poor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0021909611429922">Baviskar, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0021909611429922">Kundu, 2004</xref>). The desire of the rich to inhabit urban spaces free of poverty, however, is enmeshed in socio-spatial contradictions. The poorer sections of the population, made up largely of the scheduled caste and the other backward classes, provide essential services, including cleaning the city, as labourers in factories and construction sites, or working as domestic help in the homes of the rich and the middle class. Despite this, the rich often perceive these poor as having characteristics, like vagrancy, ignorance and the refusal to accept social duties – as if such characteristics were innate. Such a characterization, in the minds of the city elites, makes the poor undesirable in areas inhabited by the rich. In the city of Delhi, for example, nearly 52% of the population lives in what is classified as squatter clusters, designated slum areas, unauthorized settlements and/or regularized unauthorized settlements. The situation is no different in other Indian cities. The rich in the cities believe that those living in the slums make unauthorized use of electricity – and it is because of such unauthorized, illegal and free use of electricity, that paying consumers have to suffer long hours of load-shedding or power cuts. They believe that the government’s inability to take tough measures against the slum dwellers by cutting off their electricity supply is a reflection of the populist nature of the democratic state. Thus the city elite has favoured privatization of electricity generation and supply – privatization has been accepted as a system that has greater accountability: a system that will be vigilant about unauthorized leakage of electricity and take the offenders to task. The discourse of electricity theft that is entrenched in the imagination of the elite is now reflected in the law as well. According to one of our interviewees, Mr Ramakrishnan, member<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-0021909611429922">12</xref></sup> of the Central Electricity Authority, Government of India, who was speaking about the Electricity Act (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0021909611429922">Government of India, 2003</xref>) ‘theft of electricity is now a cognizable offence and the government is trying to come up with special courts and special bills to prosecute and dissuade people from doing that – earlier it was not so’ (personal correspondence, June 2006). On examining the Electricity Act, 2003, we found that sections 135 through 152 lay out, in detail, laws related to electricity theft and corresponding punishments. Mr Ramakrishna, however, also informed us that ‘there is some theft of electricity in the slums, but if we look at the quantum and proportion of such theft, it is industry, commercial establishments and the affluent section of the population that are the major culprits’. He pointed out that, while most homes in the slums might use a single bulb and/or a fan, the industry, commercial establishments and affluent homes use air-conditioners and high electricity consuming appliances. Mr Ramakrishna concluded by pointing out that ‘it is theft committed by the elite which essentially hurts the system – though people in general, do not recognize that’. Despite the disconnect between the discourse and the reality, privatization of one of the most basic socio-economic utilities – that is, power – was started with India’s integration with the neoliberal global economy.</p>
<p>In fact, efforts to privatize the electricity sector and make it dependent for foreign direct investment has proved detrimental. The power sector has linkages with all other industries, since they all require electricity, and with the agricultural sector, through farm mechanization. Hence rapid growth in the electricity generation capacity of the country is vital for sustaining and increasing the rate of India’s economic growth. An overview of the increase in power generating capacity in India through the five year plan periods (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0021909611429922">Table 1</xref>) shows that the rate of increase in capacity has been relatively high. Even more noticeable is the fact that, prior to the initiation of neoliberal policies (until the end of the seventh plan), the rate of increase in capacity was far higher. Percentage increase in capacity declined from 60.11, 49.69, and 49.43 in the fifth, sixth and seventh plan periods respectively to 24.22, 22.28 and 25.70 in the eighth, ninth and tenth plan periods (after the onset of neoliberalism) when actual capacity added fell far short of the targeted capacity addition. The decline in the rate of increase of power-generating capacity occurred despite the fact that, from 1997–8 through 2003–4, energy shortages in India has ranged anywhere between 5.9% to 8.8%, and peak energy shortage has ranged from 11.20 to 13.90% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0021909611429922">Government of India, 2005</xref>). Additionally, only 55.80% of houses in India had electricity connections in the year 2001 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0021909611429922">United Nations [UN] Habitat, 2008</xref>). Existing shortages are clear pointers to the fact that the power sector is nowhere close to its saturation point, so a slowdown in its rate of growth is neither ‘natural’ nor acceptable from any rational economic perspective. Thus the neoliberal tendency of the Indian state seems to be adversely affecting the power sector’s growth.</p>

<p>Additionally, foreign investors in India’s electricity sector have had to encounter tremendous failures. With the unleashing of privatization policies in the electricity sector, nine fast track power projects,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-0021909611429922">13</xref></sup> involving significant foreign investments, received immediate clearance from the state and the central governments. The Indian public sector unit, Bharat Heavy Electricals Limited (BHEL), was technologically capable of developing power generating units with installed capacities similar to those offered by the fast-track projects, but they were denied the opportunity even to bid for these projects. One of our interviewees, a senior manager at BHEL, the Indian public sector unit, said, ‘had there been open bidding, we would have bid for much lower costs. In fact, the costs per megawatts (MW) quoted by the foreign companies (and accepted by the state and central governments) were 75 to 175% higher than what we were quoting at that time’ (Interview, BHEL Senior Manager, 20 July 2006).

<p>Each of the projects listed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0021909611429922">Table 2</xref> got off to highly-publicized starts, with tremendous government support. During the early part of the century, however, each of these projects closed down and the companies left the country – they all turned out to be miserable failures. A point to be noted is that the publicly-owned Indian electricity sector had strongly established roots in the Indian economy. These public sector units could supply power cheaply. The foreign companies, however, wanted to charge much higher rates. This created tremendous public dissent, and culminated with a complete inability of the foreign corporations to function in India (for a detailed analysis, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0021909611429922">Ahmed, 2010</xref>). In a recorded interview, the cabinet Minister for Power, government of India, informed us that, ever since the above-mentioned foreign corporations have left, ‘foreign investments in India’s power sector has dried up’ (Interview, 20 July 2006).</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Despite variations and differences, neoliberalism unfolded with certain fundamental similarities in terms of ideology and geography of power in both South Africa and India. The nature of the neoliberalization process in the water sector in South Africa and the energy sector in India also show similarities. During the 1980s neoliberalism had taken firm root in the US and the UK where political support ensured the hegemony of the economic policy. Furthermore, through proxies such as the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund, neoliberalism became a global economic discourse gaining traction in particularly the developing world. India and South Africa were not immune to these influences with both countries being influenced by policy in the UK. For example, during the 1980s the apartheid state began to implement policies such as privatization. In 1991, following a balance of payment crisis, India accepted loans from the International Monetary Fund.</p>
<p>It was during the 1990s that the dominant discourse to promote economic development was one that was free market-oriented. In effect the free market was being promoted as the preferred instrument to address historically-entrenched development challenges in, for example, the energy sector in India where foreign corporations were entrusted with the responsibility to provide the country’s energy needs. Similarly, in South Africa’s water sector policies using private sector business principles became entrenched.</p>
<p>What was also apparent was that, prior to the neoliberal era in India and South Africa, the state had controlled the energy and water sectors, respectively. Water in South Africa and energy in India were viewed as fundamental rights which had to be supplied by the state irrespective of the ability of certain sectors of the population to pay for it. The rationale for the adoption of free market principles in these countries followed the global trend, promoted by the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund, that these were economic goods which had to be privatized and marketized. This approach is of fairly recent provenance having roots in the New Public Management approach incipient during the mid-1980s. One of the key elements of this approach is the ‘user pays’ and ‘full cost recovery’ principles. Subsidies were to be cut back or removed altogether.</p>
<p>For proponents of this approach, the adoption of free market principles would rid the respective sectors of inefficiencies. Professionalization of these sectors in terms of rationalized management and employment structures meant that the inefficiencies of the state would be replaced by the efficiencies of the private sector. Yet what the neoliberalization of the water and energy sectors in South Africa and India, respectively, reveal, is the increasing use of a market logic.</p>
<p>The market-oriented approach promotes the reassertion of class spatially. In India there is the added influence of caste. Poor people are spatially stigmatized under a neoliberal order (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0021909611429922">Ahmed et al., 2010</xref>). In the water sector in South Africa, poor people in rural areas are afforded a certain level of service unlike counterparts in urban areas. However, even poor people living in urban areas are subjected to various forms of discipline such as prepaid water meters. Access to water is determined by economic factors. In India a similar stigmatization of the poor is also apparent. What is apparent is that the poor in both South Africa and India are reacting in similar ways to the neoliberal measures which have been implemented by their respective governments. In South Africa, during the post-apartheid era, there have been numerous protests over services delivery – many over water. In India the privatization of energy and the subsequent increase in tariffs by foreign-owned companies mandated to operate these utilities have led to huge outpourings of dissent. The discussion in this paper has shown that neoliberal approaches – in a phrase, a market logic – to services provision in the water sector in South Africa and the energy sector in India have not been able to meet the states’ responsibilities to their citizens.</p>

<p>This paper employs mixed methods – qualitative and quantitative. Data sources for this paper are both primary and secondary. Qualitative primary data has been generated by conducting semi-structured interviews. In India seven ministers in the national government, additionally eight members of parliament (from the opposition as well as the ruling coalition) were interviewed. Also, 20 civil society representatives from non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and trade unions together with 10 bureaucrats were interviewed. In South Africa, seven municipal officials were interviewed of which three were in senior managerial positions. A number of NGO representatives and academics were also interviewed in South Africa. Secondary data both qualitative and quantitative has been obtained from archival material, including necessary legislation in the two countries, among other documentation. We also used newspaper reports as (secondary) archival data. Subsequently we have created a narrative which weaves the primary and secondary data together.</p>

<p>The free basic water supply is 25 litres per person per day for a household of eight; that is, 6,000 litres of water free per month. Obviously for bigger households this was not sufficient. The Phiri community won a concession in the High Court of Johannesburg for that quantity to be increased to 50 litres per person per day.</p>
