<abstract>
<p>Chile altered its electoral rules for municipal elections in 2002. The new rules separated mayoral and council member elections, and while the latter continue to use proportional representation, mayors are now chosen based on plurality. These changes serve as a natural test of the effects of electoral rules on women’s political representation. The Chilean case demonstrates (1) that electoral reform is gendered, (2) that women’s representation is shaped by both formal and informal rules, and (3) that electoral rules have different effects on mayoral and council member positions, demonstrating that the “glass ceiling” for executive positions is harder to crack.</p>

<p>Empirical studies of women’s representation have primarily sought to explain variation in women’s access to political office. To this end, researchers have explored three types of factors believed to influence the overall number of women elected: institutional or “demand-side” factors, such as electoral rules and candidate selection procedures; structural factors that affect the “supply” of female candidates, such as the proportion of women in the workforce and women’s educational achievements; and cultural or ideational factors that influence the likelihood that voters will support female candidates. Of these three sets of factors, scholars have consistently found the most evidence for the role of institutional variables. Specifically, women’s representation is generally higher in countries with proportional electoral rules, closed party lists, and relatively high district magnitude (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1065912911427449">Rule 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1065912911427449">Welch and Studlar 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1065912911427449">Caul 1999</xref>). While this finding has been confirmed in numerous large-<italic>N</italic> cross-national studies, case study research of single national contexts reveals the limits of generalizations drawn from large-<italic>N</italic> studies. In some cases women’s representation changes without a corresponding change in the electoral system or institutional environment, and in other cases women’s representation remains constant despite electoral reform (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1065912911427449">Krook 2010</xref>). This signals the need for more in-depth investigation of the factors that shape women’s access to elected office. A close examination of a single country over time can reveal how electoral rules interact in a dynamic way with other features of the institutional and political environment to produce changes in women’s representation and aid our understanding of how informal institutions affect women’s access to power.</p>
<p>An examination of patterns of women’s representation in municipal elections in Chile is a perfect example of the insights that can be gained from such a research strategy. The Chilean case serves as a natural test of the effects of electoral reform.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1065912911427449">1</xref></sup> Women’s representation increased in the 2004 elections, after three previous elections (1992, 1996, and 2000) where patterns of women’s representation remained constant. Although changes in electoral rules did occur prior to the 2004 elections, the overall electoral system remained the same (open-list proportional representation). The new electoral rules have separated mayoral and council member elections; while the latter continue to use proportional representation, mayors are now chosen based on plurality. Because plurality elections are generally considered less “women friendly” than proportional representation, we might have expected to see a decline in female mayors following this reform. However, while the formal rule officially separated mayoral and council member elections, the previous existence of an informal rule of a privileged candidate (the coalition privileged a candidate; other coalition candidates were charged with increasing the vote share for this individual so that the privileged candidate would earn a plurality of votes and become mayor) had effectively separated these elections, explaining the lack of change that we see after this separation.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1065912911427449">2</xref></sup> Ultimately, the electoral rule changes reshaped party strategies for selecting candidates. Our analysis of municipal elections in Chile before and after the reform reveals three things:</p>
<list id="list1-1065912911427449" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>Electoral reform is <italic>gendered</italic>, that is, electoral reform affects women and men differently.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Women’s representation is shaped by both formal rules and <italic>informal</italic> norms. While informal norms often derive from formal electoral rules, both formal and informal rules must be analyzed to understand women’s access to elected office.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Women may experience improved access to candidacies for legislative representation (council seats) without expanding their access to candidacies for executive posts (mayoral seats). The “glass ceiling” for executive office remains harder for women to crack.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>In the remainder of this article, we show how these three claims follow from an examination of patterns of women’s representation in Chile’s municipal elections between 1992 and 2008.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-1065912911427449">3</xref></sup> The article begins with an overview of the comparative literature on women’s electoral representation, noting that a preoccupation with formal electoral rules overlooks the key role played by the informal aspects of party strategy and candidate recruitment. The second section briefly outlines patterns of women’s representation in Chile, particularly at the national level, where most research to date has been conducted. While a number of similar political and electoral dynamics operate at the national and municipal levels, electoral rules differ in ways that are significant for women’s access to elected office. The third section turns to the municipal level, outlining the changes in electoral rules as well as the emergence and disappearance of informal rules that have influenced women’s access to candidacies. These changes have led to a rise in women’s candidacies for both mayoral and councillor posts and have highlighted the more substantial obstacles that women face when pursuing executive office.</p>
<sec id="section1-1065912911427449">
<title>Women and Electoral Systems</title>
<p>The literature on women and electoral politics is fairly diverse, and scholars have discovered a vast array of factors that help to explain women’s access to elected office. Some researchers emphasize structural or socioeconomic factors such as level of economic and social modernization. These processes draw women into the labor force and close the education gap between men and women. This means that women achieve greater presence in the “eligibility pools” from which parties draw their candidates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1065912911427449">Norris and Lovenduski 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1065912911427449">Darcy, Welch, and Clark 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1065912911427449">Reynolds 1999</xref>). Other researchers have found cultural factors to be key. Studies have found that societal attitudes toward gender roles and perceptions of equality between men and women are highly correlated with women’s presence in representative bodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1065912911427449">Inglehart and Norris 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1065912911427449">Paxton and Kunovich 2003</xref>). Where cultural beliefs that restrict women’s roles to the private sphere dominate, women are less likely to seek a political career and voters may be less likely to support female candidates. Yet other researchers have argued that, of all the factors that affect women’s representation, electoral rules are the most powerful determinant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1065912911427449">Rule 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1065912911427449">Studlar and McAllister 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>Scholars have offered a number of reasons why proportional representation (PR) systems are more “women-friendly” than single-member plurality (or majority) systems. Because PR systems involve multimember rather than single-member electoral districts, there is more space to include women on party lists. This means that candidate selection is less of a zero-sum game than in single-member systems where women must compete directly with men for a single nomination.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-1065912911427449">4</xref></sup> Moreover, when district magnitude is relatively high, parties may perceive electoral advantages to presenting voters with party lists that mirror the diversity of the population more generally, a dynamic that is clearly advantageous to women. In addition, where party lists are closed rather than open to reordering by voters, party leaders may be better able to respond to organized pressure from women in the parties to place female candidates in “electable” spots. Although leftist and social democratic parties tend to be more responsive to women’s lobbying, scholars have detected “contagion” effects whereby conservative parties feel compelled to increase the number of women they nominate (and place in electable spots) to compete effectively for women’s votes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1065912911427449">Caul 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1065912911427449">Matland and Studlar 1996</xref>).</p>
<p>This latter factor suggests a link between electoral rules and candidate nomination procedures. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1065912911427449">Norris and Lovenduski’s (1995)</xref> study on political recruitment and candidate selection for the British parliament focused attention on the gendered effects of these institutions. Comparative research shows that centralized recruitment processes offer some advantages to women: they allow women to overcome the difficulty of self-nominating and undercut the impact of local power monopolies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1065912911427449">Hinojosa 2009</xref>; Hinojosa Forthcoming; also see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1065912911427449">Norris 1993</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-1065912911427449">5</xref></sup> Researchers have noted that candidate selection tends to be more centralized in PR systems compared to the decentralized and local mechanisms employed in countries with single-member district (SMD) systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1065912911427449">Matland and Studlar 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1065912911427449">Lovenduski and Norris 1993</xref>). The advantages posed by centralized recruitment mechanisms can be even further strengthened when party leaders actively want to increase the number of female candidates, because of either perceptions of electoral advantages or sustained and organized pressure from women in the parties or women in society. Thus, the extent to which women mobilize around the goal of increasing women’s representation may be an important factor in pushing party leaders to recruit more women (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1065912911427449">Caul 1999</xref>; King and Matland 2003).</p>
<p>Finally, some scholars draw a link between electoral rules and incumbency, finding that PR systems have higher rates of turnover than do SMD systems. This may occur because voters in PR systems are casting their votes for a party more than for individual candidates. This expands opportunities for parties to bring in new candidates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1065912911427449">Kaminsky and White 2007</xref>). Research has also shown that high levels of incumbency are a powerful obstacle to women (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1065912911427449">Schwindt-Bayer 2005</xref>). Hence, electoral rules that encourage incumbency may also discourage the recruitment of female candidates.</p>
<p>While there is a clear consensus in the literature that electoral rules matter, scholars have more recently begun to question the view that electoral rules are the most important or indeed the only relevant factor determining women’s representation. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1065912911427449">Manon Tremblay (2008</xref>, 14) notes, for instance, that “electoral systems do not act in isolation; instead, they interact with a host of cultural, socioeconomic, and political variables to create a global dynamic that in turn influences the proportion of women in legislative assemblies.” Indeed, we argue that a narrow focus on the formal rules contained in different electoral systems diverts attention away from the equally important informal institutions that govern candidate recruitment and selection. Recent research on Latin American politics has demonstrated the importance of informal institutions, defined as norms and rules that influence the behavior of political actors yet are not publicly communicated and are enforced outside of official channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1065912911427449">Helmke and Levitsky 2006</xref>). In the Chilean case, the “rules of the game” that shape candidate nomination are largely informal, although they are clearly shaped in important ways by the formal rules embedded in the country’s electoral system. In the next section, we briefly describe patterns of women’s representation in national politics and then discuss how these patterns have been shaped by Chile’s electoral system. In particular, we argue that the rules in place for national elections have created informal institutions of candidate selection that disadvantage women.</p>

<title>Women’s Representation in National Politics: Gendered Patterns of Political Recruitment</title>
<p>Chile is an outlier in a region where women’s electoral representation has expanded significantly in recent years. While two Latin American countries (Argentina and Costa Rica) rank in the global top fifteen in terms of female legislative representation, women’s presence in Chile’s national congress has not grown significantly since the 1990 transition to democracy (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1065912911427449">Table 1</xref>). In the 2010 elections, women won just 14 percent of seats in the lower house (Cámara de Diputados) and 13 percent of seats in the senate. Of course, the gains in women’s representation that have occurred elsewhere in the region are largely the result of the adoption of candidate gender quotas, currently in place in eleven countries.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-1065912911427449">6</xref></sup> In Chile, however, a quota law has not been adopted, despite repeated efforts by female legislators and previous President Michelle Bachelet (2006–10).</p>

<p>The absence of a quota law does not fully explain women’s underrepresentation, however. Women’s absence from politics is partly a result of electoral rules that shape the process of candidate selection in ways that disadvantage women. The current system, established during the Pinochet dictatorship (1973–90), was designed with the twin goals of decreasing the number of political parties and overrepresenting the right (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1065912911427449">Siavelis 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1065912911427449">Rabkin 1996</xref>). The traditional PR system was replaced with a binomial majoritarian one. Chile’s electoral system establishes two-member open-list voting districts (sixty districts for the Chamber of Deputies and nineteen for the Senate). For a party list to win both seats, it must double the amount of votes received by the second-largest vote getter. Where it does not, the second seat goes to the list receiving the second highest number of votes. These rules produce important consequences for the way politics is practiced in Chile. Traditionally, Chile has had a multiparty system, with relatively coherent and ideological parties on the left, center, and right of the political spectrum. While the binomial system has been unable to decrease the number of effective parties, it has, however, compelled parties to join together to compete in electoral coalitions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1065912911427449">Siavelis 2006</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-1065912911427449">7</xref></sup> Since the return of democracy, the center and left parties have joined to form the Concertación de los Partidos por la Democracia and the parties of the right have formed the Alianza por Chile. The Concertación coalition includes the leftist Socialist Party (PS), the center-left Party for Democracy (PPD), the smaller centrist Radical Social Democratic Party (PRSD), and the large centrist Christian Democratic Party (PDC). The Alianza is composed of the moderate-right National Renovation (RN) and the more ideologically conservative Independent Democratic Union (UDI). This coalition has undergone a number of name changes since the transition but is today most commonly called the Alianza. The minor parties that exist, such as the Communist Party and Humanist Party, have little chance of electing candidates to office, though they continue to field candidates.</p>
<p>A second consequence of the electoral system has been the emergence of informal rules and mechanisms for candidate selection. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1065912911427449">John Carey and Peter Siavelis (2006</xref>, 164), “Though the electoral rule is strategically straightforward, its combination with the contemporary party system generates substantial complexity for candidates, parties, and coalition leaders.” This complexity has been resolved by the <italic>cuoteo</italic>, which refers to the allotment of nominations for the individual parties within the Concertación (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1065912911427449">Siavelis 2006</xref>, 41).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-1065912911427449">8</xref></sup> Each coalition can nominate only two candidates per district, and in most cases only one of these candidates will win a seat. Clearly, the process of coalition bargaining is more difficult in the Concertación, which is composed of three main parties and a number of smaller ones, compared to the Alianza, with just two main parties. While each party retains its own rules for candidate selection, rules that range from highly centralized to relatively open and decentralized, the question of which candidate will run in which district is ultimately determined through a complicated process of intracoalition bargaining.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-1065912911427449">9</xref></sup> According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1065912911427449">Siavelis (2006</xref>, 41), “The players involved in this informal institution are high-level party leaders in the inner core of the Concertación.”</p>
<p>Some researchers point to the benefits of these informal institutions, principally the political stability that they provide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1065912911427449">Siavelis 2006</xref>, 34; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1065912911427449">Carey and Siavelis 2006</xref>, 176). But this conclusion ignores the gendered implications of these informal rules. There are three aspects of the coalitional bargaining for nominations, particularly in the Concertación, that disadvantage women. First, decisions about nominations taken at the party level may be overturned during the elite-level negotiations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1065912911427449">Siavelis 2005</xref>). This means efforts at the party level to promote female candidacies are less effective. Even though the three largest parties in the Concertación, the Christian Democrats, Socialists, and the PPD, all have internal party quotas for women, their impact is diluted by the bargaining that takes place at the coalition level. Thus, while there may be advantages to centralized methods of candidate selection at the <italic>party</italic> level, enabling women to pressure party leaders to promote female candidacies, centralization at the intracoalition level provides no such advantages. The intracoalition bargaining is carried out among high-level leaders from across the coalition, a group that <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1065912911427449">Siavelis (2006</xref>, 45-51) refers to as the <italic>partido transversal</italic> (transversal party), “a shifting but consistent informal group of leaders” whose primary role is to negotiate among the various parties composing the coalition on a range of political and policy matters. The fact that this group is not formalized means that women cannot express their concerns in the same way they could to a formally constituted party executive, nor can they demand that this group adopt gender quotas like those used by their parties. The <italic>partido transversal</italic> is not accountable in the same way as a party executive is accountable to its membership and cannot therefore be lobbied as effectively by women seeking equality.</p>
<p>A second factor that disadvantages women seeking nominations is that women tend to be absent from the high-level party elite who participate in bargaining. The party leaders who compose the <italic>partido transversal</italic> are almost all men.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-1065912911427449">10</xref></sup> Elites may inadvertently seek qualities more likely to belong to men than women (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1065912911427449">Norris and Lovenduski 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1065912911427449">Peterson and Runyan 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1065912911427449">Tremblay and Pelletier 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1065912911427449">Niven 1998</xref>). More important for our understanding of the <italic>partido transervsal</italic>, political scientists have unearthed evidence that elites channel women away from candidacies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1065912911427449">Niven 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1065912911427449">Fox and Lawless 2004</xref>). Niven has found evidence of in-group preferences; because elites are predominantly men—in Niven’s study but also in the <italic>partido transversal</italic>—they are likely to prefer candidates who are also men. The literature on representation has also found a relationship between descriptive and substantive representation: women are more likely than men to address women’s issues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1065912911427449">Phillips 1995</xref>). Female legislators are more likely than their male colleagues to work on legislation related to women’s issues (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1065912911427449">Schwindt-Bayer 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1065912911427449">Taylor-Robinson and Heath 2003</xref>). We would therefore expect that women’s absence in the <italic>partido transversal</italic> means that this intraparty organization is less likely to be cognizant about women’s underrepresentation.</p>
<p>Third, the search for strong candidates that can help a list to double the votes received by their opponents produces high rates of incumbency, which are disadvantageous to women (as well as any other “newcomer”). Researchers have noted that incumbents “are understood to have a right to re-nomination,” and in the 1990s over 70 percent of parliamentarians sought reelection and over 80 percent went on to win their seats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1065912911427449">Siavelis 2002</xref>, 426). According to Teresa Valdés, the high rates of reelection in Chile leads to a vicious cycle for women “who don’t have the political capital to be nominated as candidates, but this keeps them from obtaining the political capital as well. Therefore, they never break into the system.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-1065912911427449">11</xref></sup></p>
<p>Given these dynamics, women’s parliamentary representation has remained fairly low. The data in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1065912911427449">Table 2</xref> show that women have fared relatively poorly in terms of nominations,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-1065912911427449">12</xref></sup> although this appears to be changing, at least in the more leftist parties of the Concertación, the PS and PPD. The parties of the right nominate fewer women than the leftist parties,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-1065912911427449">13</xref></sup> and neither has explicit strategies to increase the number of female candidates. Three of the parties in the Concertación, however, the PS, PDC, and the PPD, all adopted internal quotas ranging from 20 to 40 percent for female candidacies because of women’s lobbying during and after the transition to democracy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1065912911427449">Franceschet 2005</xref>). These mechanisms have not been consistently applied, however, and even the most “women-friendly” party, the PPD, has consistently failed to meet its 30 percent target. Interviews with female politicians in the parties of the Concertación reveal the difficulty of applying affirmative action mechanisms at the party level given the ultimate need for bargaining at the coalition level. Indeed, it is notable that the center-right party RN has consistently nominated more women than the Christian Democrats, a party with an explicit commitment to promote women through a voluntary quota.</p>

<p>While women are making very slow progress in electoral politics, they have fared somewhat better in appointed positions, particularly in the administrations of Ricardo Lagos (2000–2006) and Michelle Bachelet (2006–10). The data in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1065912911427449">Table 3</xref> outline women’s representation in various executive-level offices that are appointed by the president. Women’s representation in these positions increased substantially in 2000, largely because of the lobbying efforts of women in the parties of the Concertación. Women urged Lagos to name more women to the cabinet and other executive-level posts. In her presidential campaign, Michelle Bachelet made an explicit commitment to parity in all government positions, and her first cabinet contained 50 percent female ministers. However, she later made a number of changes, and women’s representation dropped below parity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1065912911427449">Franceschet 2010</xref>). Women’s share of portfolios decreased with the new center-right administration of Sebastián Piñera that took office in 2010. Currently, there are six female ministers (27 percent).</p>

<p>The data on female officeholders since Chile’s transition to democracy reveal the influence of formal electoral rules but also the importance of informal institutions. The informal rules surrounding candidate selection undermine the goal of increasing the number of female candidates. Because negotiations for candidacies are conducted by an “informal” elite at the supraparty level and according to rules that are not publicly communicated or enforced, it is more difficult for women to lobby party or coalition leaders to devise a coherent and effective strategy. In contrast, women have fared better in convincing sympathetic leftist presidents (Ricardo Lagos and Michelle Bachelet, both from the PS) to appoint a substantial number of women to high-level executive positions. Indeed, many observers credit Lagos’s decision to appoint women to traditionally “masculine” portfolios, such as defense and foreign affairs, with the breakdown of cultural stereotypes about women’s leadership capacities. The erosion of these stereotypes, in turn, made it possible for two women, Soledad Alvear (as foreign minister) and Michelle Bachelet (as defense minister), to become the most popular political figures in Chile and the two leading candidates for the 2005 presidential election.</p>
<p>As we see in the next section, informal rules have also been influential in shaping women’s access to nominations for municipal elections.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-1065912911427449">
<title>Women and Municipal Elections</title>
<p>The modification to electoral law in 2004 was only the latest in a series of changes to municipal elections for mayors and council members. The electoral changes that have taken place at the municipal level indicate the importance of these positions in Chilean politics. The contestation of political power is limited in a unitary state with few elected positions—mayors and council members are elected, along with 120 deputies, thirty-eight senators, and a single president; all other positions are appointed ones. The scarcity of elected positions combined with the small number of municipalities in the country and the local level’s position as a stepping stone to higher office have increased the importance of municipal office. Local-level politics are also important because they provide smaller parties within the two major coalitions a chance to compete in a different political arena and to “increase the leverage of smaller parties in the national negotiation process” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1065912911427449">Siavelis 1997</xref>, 663).</p>
<p>The question of how to select local representatives has dogged Chilean politics since the return to democracy. Before 1973, council members were elected via PR, while mayors were chosen either by council members or, in the largest cities, appointed directly by the president. On September 21, 1973, merely days after taking power through a coup, General Pinochet ended democratic elections for the local level. Pinochet shut down municipal councils and designated mayors for each municipality. These mayors served as representatives of the president and “concentrated all power at the local level” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1065912911427449">Rehren 1991</xref>, 240). After the return to democracy but before the first postdictatorship municipal elections occurred in 1992, mayors were chosen by the local Consejos de Desarrollo Comunal in all but the largest municipalities. In these, then-President Patricio Aylwin designated mayors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1065912911427449">Bunker 2008</xref>, 3).</p>
<p>In the initial elections after the return to democracy, the Organic Constitutional Law on Municipalities decreed that council members were to be elected using a modified D’Hondt method of PR in the upcoming June 1992 elections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1065912911427449">Posner 2004</xref>, 77). The D’Hondt system’s open-list representation allows Chileans to vote for an individual on the ballot rather than for a party or list. Each candidate’s votes are pooled with those of others on the same list to determine the electoral quotient, which then determines the number of seats that each list will receive.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn14-1065912911427449">14</xref></sup> The candidate with the greatest share of the vote (minimum of 35 percent) from the winning list would automatically become mayor. The “odds of a single candidate receiving such a high percentage of the vote are poor” because of the large number of effective parties fielding candidates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1065912911427449">Posner 1999</xref>, 78).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn15-1065912911427449">15</xref></sup> If these difficult criteria were not met, the mayor would be selected by the members of the council. This high bar to elect a mayor meant that often mayors were chosen by the council. The “possibility of lack of discipline . . . by those who had been elected council members but aspired to be mayors” led to situations where the typical four-year mayoral term was split into two, allowing for two periods of two years each and giving two council members (presumably from the two major pacts) a chance to serve as mayor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1065912911427449">Bunker 2008</xref>, 4).</p>
<p>The problems inherent to the 1992 electoral rules led to a push for reforms. For the 1996 elections, the mayor would be the candidate who received the most votes and who was a member of a list that received a minimum of 30 percent of the vote. The threshold was lowered by five percentage points, and it was no longer necessary to be a candidate of the winning list. If no mayor could be chosen using these criteria, the candidate with the most votes from the list receiving the most votes would become mayor. If still no candidate could be chosen then the highest vote getter from the winning list would become mayor. These same byzantine rules applied to the 2000 municipal elections.</p>
<p>These electoral rules were discarded in 2002, and new rules were adopted and applied to the 2004 and 2008 elections municipal elections. The elections of mayors and council members have now been split, and while PR rules continue to be used to choose council members, mayors are now elected via plurality.</p>
<p>The formal electoral rules as well as the informal norms adopted in response to them have shaped patterns of women’s representation at the municipal level, just as they have for national-level office. Female representation was low in the three municipal elections following the return to democracy. The reform that separated mayoral elections from those for council member seats, a formula that has now been applied for two electoral cycles, however, led to important change. Between 7.4 percent and 8.5 percent of mayors elected in the 1992, 1996, and 2000 elections were women. The percentage of women council members grew slowly during that same time period, climbing from 13.1 percent in 1992 to 17.0 percent after the 2000 elections. A noticeable jump occurred with the 2004 elections, when women’s representation in both offices increased by about five percentage points: 44 women became mayors in 2004 (12.7 percent of all mayors) and 464 women were elected to council member posts (21.7 percent). For the 2008 elections, 1 fewer women were elected mayor (12.5 percent), but women’s share of council member seats increased to 23.2 percent. It appears that the reforms have induced changes to the informal rules of candidate selection in ways that have opened more space for women.</p>
<p>The electoral reforms first implemented in 2004 altered norms of candidate selection within the two major coalitions; these changes require that we analyze not simply the number or percentage of women elected to municipal office but also the number and percentage of women candidates for these local-level positions. The percentage of female candidates between 1992 and 2000 includes candidates for both mayoral positions and council member spots since these elections had not yet been separated. Women composed 16.5 percent of candidates in 1992, 17.7 percent in 1996, and 18.8 percent of all candidates in 2000.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn16-1065912911427449">16</xref></sup> For the 2004 and 2008 elections, 16.6 percent and 17.5 percent, respectively, of mayoral candidates were women. In contrast, women received a larger number of nominations for the council member seats for the 2004 elections (21.8 percent) and the 2008 elections (25.6 percent).</p>
<p>Chile’s municipal electoral rules led to the creation of certain informal institutions aimed at resolving the problems created by the formal rules, as was the case when analyzing the binomial system for national elections. The problems inherent to combining the election for mayors and council members ultimately induced political parties to rally around a single candidate and to increase the odds that this candidate would be able to reach the threshold for election, outlined above. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1065912911427449">Bunker (2008</xref>, 2) notes, the electoral rules in place for the 1996 and 2000 elections convinced parties that they should “strategically construct lists that would produce a high vote share and would simultaneously concentrate the vote share in a privileged candidate”. The decision to privilege a single candidate from the coalition required intense negotiations, which were undertaken at the national level, and which resembled those of the <italic>cuoteo</italic> (interview with author, September 16, 2002). The informal rules of “the privileged candidate” and avoiding “diluting the vote” were well known within Chile. While a high-ranking UDI official acknowledged that the reduction in the number of candidates running for local-level office was part of an electoral strategy meant to avoid the diffusion of the vote (interview with author, October 2, 2002), local-level representatives provided more specific information. For example, in one large city, a party official from the coalition of the right explained that they had nominated only four candidates from his coalition even though they had the legal right to run eight candidates. Their strategy panned out when their privileged candidate was elected mayor (interview with author, November 21, 2002). Even failed local candidates knew of the policy and talked openly about it. For example, a candidate for council member in the 2000 elections from a large tourist city was initially “very excited” when her party asked her to run for the council. Her enthusiasm waned, however, when she learned a week later that she would not be allowed to campaign; she was asked to sign a document stating that she would instead work for the privileged candidate’s campaign (interview with author, December 4, 2002).</p>
<p>How were coalitions able to maintain these informal institutions? To avoid diluting the vote, coalitions had to limit the number of candidacies. Privileging one candidate has the potential to antagonize other coalition members. Interviews revealed that these municipal elections were highly contested: council members routinely mentioned their vote share in elections (i.e., whether their vote share had increased from one election to the next, but also how their vote share compared to those of their follow council members). One mayor from a small city detailed how she had not been her party’s privileged candidate. Her accidental election—she did not campaign or challenge the privileged candidate—led to fighting with other candidates (interview with author, December 16, 2002). When asked why people from his party and coalition did not campaign against the privileged candidate, a high-ranking UDI official explained, “We’re very disciplined” (interview with author, October 2, 2002). While this may be part of the explanation, parties and coalitions maintained an arsenal of incentives at their disposal to keep party and coalition members in line. First of all, only candidates running under the banner of the Alianza or the Concertación have a “reasonable chance” of being elected to local office (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1065912911427449">Posner 2004</xref>, 68). Candidates had little option for defection if they were dissatisfied with these informal rules. Second, candidates received campaign financing—typically in the form of campaign posters and other materials—and support in the form of deputies and senators campaigning on their behalf during election season. Third, mayors were always allowed to pursue reelection; that is, other coalition partners would not challenge an incumbent from their own coalition. This rule almost certainly decreased infighting. Fourth, the few elected positions in the country are dominated by the two major coalitions. Candidates who break these informal rules have no options for advancement.</p>
<p>An important effect of these informal rules was a substantial drop in the number of candidacies. While in 1992 there were 6,530 candidates, the number of candidates decreased to 5,471 in the following elections and to 4,507 by the 2000 elections. The Alianza, in particular, enjoyed success with the strategy of selecting a privileged candidate and preventing vote dilution; by 2000, the coalition received over 40 percent of municipal votes “thanks to a pact that concentrated vote share in ‘privileged’ candidates” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1065912911427449">Rojas 2008</xref>, 4).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn17-1065912911427449">17</xref></sup></p>
<p>These informal rules, while widely known, were not without their critics. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1065912911427449">Posner (1999</xref>, 76) has noted that the rules governing local elections prior to 2004 and still in effect for council seats lead to indirect elections since lists or pacts distribute seats “according to the agreement made among the member parties, an arrangement that in many instances means that the candidates receiving the highest number of votes are not the same candidates who actually assume office.” Municipal councils are instead chosen based on elite negotiations. Pact making further decreases the proportionality of municipal elections because only parties and candidates who have aligned themselves with either the Concertación or the Alianza have a realistic chance of obtaining representation; according to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1065912911427449">Posner (2004</xref>, 68), in the 2000 elections, 96.7 percent of all seats were won by representatives of these two pacts.</p>
<p>The informal rules that were used at the municipal level did not simply resemble some of the negotiations that took place at the national level as part of the <italic>cuoteo</italic>. Municipal negotiations could also inform national-level negotiations. Municipal election results have been used “as a bargaining chip” during coalition-level decision making (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1065912911427449">Altman 2008</xref>, 247). The results of elections at the local level indicate the level of support for a particular political party and are still used by political parties to negotiate candidacies.</p>
<p>According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1065912911427449">Helmke and Levitsky (2006</xref>, 23), “[F]ormal rule changes may alter the nature of problems that the informal institution had addressed, thereby creating incentives for actors to modify or abandon the informal rule.” The electoral reform that separated mayoral elections from those for council members necessarily meant the end of an informal institution of a “privileged” candidate, but it is also not surprising that the changed electoral rules for Chilean municipal elections led to the disappearance of the informal rule that reduced the number of candidates to avoid diluting the vote (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1065912911427449">Helmke and Levitsky 2006</xref>, 23). These two informal rules were no longer necessary to maximize electoral success.</p>
<p>The end of the informal rule of avoiding vote dilution is evidenced in part by a dramatic rise in candidacies both in 2004 and again in 2008. More than 7,400 candidates combined ran for mayor or council member in 2004, nearly 3,000 more than had run in the previous elections. By 2008, the number of candidates had increased even more substantially.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn18-1065912911427449">18</xref></sup> While in 2004, 6,165 candidates entered the council member elections, by 2008 this number had grown to 9,486—an increase of more than 50 percent from the previous election.</p>
<p>The data that show that women’s representation increased after the reform to the electoral rules also indicate that informal rules can have as much of an impact as formal ones. The electoral system in place prior to the 2004 elections inspired the creation of an informal rule meant to differentiate between candidates for council member positions and a “privileged” candidate, who effectively vied for the executive position. To maximize the effectiveness of this policy, pacts hammered out a system that would minimize vote dilution by reducing the number of candidates. The informal rules affected the mayoral and council member positions differently; the change in formal rules caused the discontinuation of two informal institutions leading to changes for council member candidacies, but no such changes for mayoral positions. The informal rule of a “privileged” candidate explains the lack of change in mayoral positions since privileging certain candidates had already effectively separated the election of municipal candidates even though a single ballot was used to elect both mayors and council members.</p>
<p>Women and politics scholars have long elaborated on the advantages of multimember rather than single-member electoral districts for electing more women. Hence, we might expect that the new electoral rules that turned mayoral contests into first-past-the-post elections would have deleterious effects on women’s representation. Women and politics scholars might have expected to see a substantial drop in the percentage of female mayors. Instead, women’s representation as mayors and as council members increased after the implementation of these new electoral rules, indicating that the changes we see cannot be wholly attributed to the use of first-past-the-post rules for mayoral elections and PR for council member positions. Despite expectations, women are more likely to be mayors today than they were prior to the electoral reform. However, the gender gap remains greater for the post of mayor than for the position of council member. Women are more likely to be elected to legislative than executive positions.</p>
<p>The data from Chilean municipal elections also indicate that differences continue to exist in women’s election to executive and legislative positions. While 12.5 percent of the country’s mayors are women, the percentage of female council members is much higher: 23.2 percent. Executive office comes with greater prestige than legislative office. The greater prestige of this office comes with a corresponding increase in public attention for this office: in 2008, 10 percent more Chileans cast a vote for mayor than voted in council member elections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1065912911427449"><italic>The Economist</italic> 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>As scholars have found, masculine traits are more strongly associated with executive office (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1065912911427449">Dolan 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1065912911427449">Kahn 1996</xref>), and this could ultimately discourage both coalitions from nominating women for mayoral office and voters from casting their ballots for women running for these positions. The 2004 council member election data clearly demonstrate that a higher proportion of women are fielded as municipal council candidates than as mayoral candidates. While 16.6 percent of all mayoral candidates were female, 21.8 percent of all council member candidates were female. The 2008 data confirm that this gender gap exists and demonstrate an even more sizable breach (as <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-1065912911427449">Table 4</xref> shows). Unfortunately, there is no way to ascertain what proportion of privileged candidates were female in the 1996 or 2000 elections; women were 19 percent of all municipal candidates in 2000.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn19-1065912911427449">19</xref></sup></p>

<p>Electoral data from 2008 and 2004 demonstrate that voters are more likely to cast their ballots for men than for women in these executive positions. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-1065912911427449">Table 5</xref> provides data on the percentage of female and male candidates who won their elections for both executive and legislative positions in the past two municipal elections. The 2008 mayoral election data indicate that male candidates were more likely to be elected than female candidates since only 19.9 percent of female candidates won election, while 29.7 percent of male candidates were able to gain office. When analyzing candidates from only the six major parties, we still see a gender gap. While 32.3 percent of women from these parties won their election, 40.7 percent of men from these parties won theirs. Tremendous differences exist within and across parties, however. In these same elections, while 19 percent of 21 female PDC candidates won election, 47 percent of male members of their party (54 of 115) were able to win election. The range across parties is quite dramatic. Nearly 54 percent of the 28 female candidates of the UDI—a party of the right that has no gender goals in place—gained office (considerably higher than the 42 percent of the 101 male candidates from the party), but less than 18 percent (3 of 17) of the female candidates of the PS—one of the parties of the Concertación that is committed to greater gender equality—won election and 0 percent—since the lone female candidate lost—of the PRSD’s female candidates were able to win office. In the 2004 mayoral elections, 21.3 percent of female candidates won their elections compared to 29.0 percent of men. Analyzing only candidates from the major parties reveals that 42.0 percent of women candidates won mayoral elections compared to 48.3 percent of male candidates.</p>

<p>While the results of elections for executive positions demonstrate a gender gap, the 2004 council member elections tell a different story. While 34.6 percent of all male candidates won their elections, so did 34.5 percent of all female candidates. Women were as likely as men to win these elections. The 2008 data demonstrate that women had slightly more difficulty winning election than men: 20.5 percent of women won their elections compared to 23.3 percent of men (a difference of 2.8 percentage points). When we examine only candidates from the major parties, we find that 32.7 percent of women won their elections compared to 34.6 percent of men. Although the 2008 electoral data demonstrate a difference in election rates for men and women, this difference is considerably smaller for these legislative posts than for the executive positions.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn20-1065912911427449">20</xref></sup> The newly separated elections allow us to see that there is a gender gap for executive positions but a much smaller difference in election rates for legislative positions.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn21-1065912911427449">21</xref></sup></p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Our main goal in this article was to evaluate the impact of municipal electoral reform on patterns of women’s representation. We argue that the existing literature’s preoccupation with formal electoral rules can lead to unrealistic expectations about the impact of electoral reform on women’s representation. An emphasis on formal rules overlooks the role of the informal norms that shape candidate recruitment and selection. While informal norms are regularly shaped by formal electoral rules, they emerge out of the interaction between formal rules and other features of the political context. Although students of Latin American politics have recently begun to pay more attention to informal norms and institutions, few accounts to date have acknowledged their gendered aspects.</p>
<p>In the case of electoral rules in Chile, we have shown here that the informal rules governing candidate selection at both the national and municipal level work against the goal of increasing the number of women that are nominated and elected to office. In both cases, it was not simply the formal electoral rules that disadvantaged women but rather the informal norms of coalition bargaining that emerged from the formal rules. Thus, scholars need to examine both the formal and informal aspects of elections and recruitment. At the municipal level, the electoral rules prior to the separation of council member and mayoral posts led to the creation of informal institutions that proved detrimental for women. The norm of the “privileged candidate” and the strategy of reducing candidacies so as to not “dilute the vote” made it harder for women, especially newcomers, to access nominations. As we predicted, the reform that separated these elections led to an increase in the number of women elected as council members, but women still face greater hurdles in accessing executive posts. For mayoral office men have higher success rates than female candidates.</p>
<p>These findings have relevance beyond local politics in Chile. The issue of electoral reform at the national level has been on the Chilean public agenda for a number of years because of vigorous criticisms of the distorting effects of the binomial system. Scholars of women and politics, too, have often blamed Chile’s electoral system for the low number of women elected to congress. But our analysis here illustrates that we should be cautious of placing all our faith in electoral reform as a mechanism to increase female political representation. Informal norms matter, and although they are intricately linked to the conditions created by formal rules, they also respond to societal attitudes or preferences for certain kinds of candidates. In this case, electoral reform may mitigate but not entirely eliminate the disadvantages that female candidates normally confront. Electoral reform has been a perennial feature of Latin American politics since the return to democracy of the third wave: Brazil held a referendum to decide whether to return to monarchy or adopt a parliamentary system, Peru and Venezuela both have fiddled with presidential reelection, Colombia’s constitution was altered to allow political parties to decide whether to use open or closed lists. The reforms that have been proposed and passed are not without gendered consequences. We argue too that to fully understand the gendered consequences of any electoral changes it is imperative that we examine both formal and informal rules. Furthermore, the continued salience of gendered informal norms means that we should not view gender quotas, whether at the party or national level, as a panacea. The limited effect of legislated quotas in some countries in Latin American and beyond indicates the extent to which informal norms and institutions can undermine the effective implementation of gender quotas. This study highlights the need for further examination of the gendered consequences of the interaction of formal rules with informal institutions.</p>

<p>This type of electoral reform is not unique in the region. Electoral laws have similarly been revised to allow for the direct election of mayors in Costa Rica, Nicaragua, and Venezuela. The desire for political decentralization has led to significant changes in local and regional politics across Latin America since the 1990s.</p>

<p>We obtained data from <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.elecciones.gov.cl">www.elecciones.gov.cl</ext-link> for the 1992, 1996, 2000, 2004, and 2008 municipal elections. We then coded all candidate names for gender. The coding for 1992, 1996, 2000, 2004, and 2008 was done by Author 1, a native Spanish speaker. Any names that were ambiguous were forwarded on to Author 1’s research assistant who lived in El Salvador for a decade and has an advanced degree from a Central American university. The research assistant performed general Internet searches to try to determine whether the individuals in question were male or female. When Internet searches were unsuccessful, the research assistant contacted individual municipalities via email and followed up with a telephone call as necessary. These quantitative data were supplemented with qualitative data gathered over research trips to Chile in 2002, 2004, and 2006. Hinojosa interviewed more than thirty mayors and council members. Both authors also conducted interviews with other elected representatives, party elites, and members of civil society organizations.</p>

<p>The following countries have adopted gender quotas (the percentage of women in their lower—or single—chamber of congress in 2000 is listed in parentheses): Argentina (35.2 percent), Bolivia (47.2 percent), Brazil (12.3 percent), Costa Rica (38.6 percent), Dominican Republic (20.8 percent), Ecuador (32.3 percent), Honduras (18.0 percent), Mexico (19.5 percent), Panama (8.5 percent), Paraguay (15.6 percent), Peru (27.5 percent). A quota law was also adopted in 2009 by Uruguay’s congress (12.9 percent), but has not been implemented; Colombia (12.6 percent) passed a quota law in 2011 and will first be implemented in October 2011.

<p>The number of council members elected in each municipality varies by population: those with over 150,000 residents elect ten council members, while municipalities with fewer than 70,000 residents elect only six. All other municipalities elect eight council members.</p>

<p>Interestingly, despite the fact that three parties of the Concertación have clearly stated gender goals and use gender quotas, it is the parties of the right, and in the particular the UDI, that have nominated a larger share of female candidates and have placed more women into local-level political positions. For example, in the 2000 elections 23.9 percent of candidates from the UDI were women; the percentages for the other parties are as follows: RN (18.6 percent), PS (17.0 percent), PPD (18.6 percent), PRSD (14.7 percent), and PDC (16.6 percent). The difference between the percentage of women fielded by the UDI and by other political parties is statistically significant. One argument that has been proposed to explain this apparent paradox is that the parties of the Concertación have used candidate selection procedures that prove problematic for women; specifically, these parties have used selection processes that are inclusive (i.e., they involve a large number of individuals in decision making) and decentralized (i.e., decision making takes place at the local level). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1065912911427449">Hinojosa (2009</xref> and Forcoming) argues that this type of candidate selection is problematic for women because it requires that potential candidates self-nominate and gives power to local power monopolies.</p>
</fn>
<fn fn-type="other" id="fn17-1065912911427449">
<label>17.</label>
<p>We hypothesize that these informal rules would prove more successful for the Alianza than for the Concertación. While the former is composed of only two parties, negotiations within the Concertación involve numerous political parties.</p>
</fn>
<fn fn-type="other" id="fn18-1065912911427449">
<label>18.</label>
<p>The increase in candidacies in 2008 is also likely a result of the Concertación’s decision to run candidates on two lists rather than a single list, as had been previously done. Candidates of the PDC and the PS ran under the banner of the Concertación Democrática, while PPD and PRSD candidates joined together as the Concertación Progresista.</p>
</fn>
<fn fn-type="other" id="fn19-1065912911427449">
<label>19.</label>
<p>The informal nature of the institution of a privileged candidate means that there are no available records of privileged candidates for municipal elections. While it is likely that the privileged candidate is the individual who received the greatest vote share within his or her coalition (especially since nonprivileged candidates were sometimes barred from campaigning), this was not always the case. We are therefore unable to compare the percentage of female privileged candidates in the 1992, 1996, and 2000 contests to the percentage of female mayoral candidates in 2004 and 2008.</p>
</fn>
<fn fn-type="other" id="fn20-1065912911427449">
<label>20.</label>
<p>This contradicts the findings of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1065912911427449">Hinojosa (2002)</xref>, who found minimal evidence that such a gender gap existed for local elections in Chile. However, her study analyzed a pooled election rather than separate elections for mayors and council members. The much larger number of municipal council candidates versus “privileged” candidates who were effectively competing as mayoral candidates may have masked the differences in election rates that we find in this study.</p>
</fn>
<fn fn-type="other" id="fn21-1065912911427449">
<label>21.</label>
<p>One possible explanation for this gender gap is voter bias. To fully test for voter bias, however, we would need to examine qualifications for male and female candidates, district-level voting history and demographics, and the effects of incumbency and party. We do not have the data necessary to undertake such an analysis.</p>
