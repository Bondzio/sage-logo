<p>In the last two decades we have witnessed a rise in the number of Asian women entering higher education institutions in the UK. For this reason alone this text is relevant for providing an insightful exposure of South Asian women’s experiences of university life. Through the student interviews and discussions, Kalwant Bhopal speaks to the complex issues of family commitment, domestic/childcare issues, dowries and arranged marriages, friendship networks, class and community struggles. The 45 Asian female students in this text are from diverse backgrounds; they address the challenges of higher institutions, but also the complex crossover between higher education and family commitment and obligations. The text focuses on how these students manage their different worlds, as they navigate between community and university.</p>

<p>[M]y study examines how Asian women are using strategies for success in higher education. It explores the choices women make in choosing where to study, which courses they select and the impact this has on their participation in their community of practice in higher education. (p. 38)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In this sense, the text offers more than an insight into Asian women’s experiences of higher education. It is a discussion of both academic and community struggles and barriers. By uncovering the lives of these 45 women, Bhopal unravels the women’s strategies for surviving the academy. Making friends with women like themselves, argues Bhopal, is what makes for an environment in which these students felt accepted and indeed empowered. They felt understood by friends who had similar experiences, of say racism or family matters. According to Bhopal, such shared cultural and ethnic experiences compensate for the marginalization that university spaces can bring.</p>
<p>The first chapter is a survey of the literature that maps out Asian women in British society. This is a critical review of the literature in which Bhopal outlines the limitations of texts published between the 1970s and the 1980s. Here she speaks of the patronizing references to ‘cultural clash’, to ‘women being weak and passive and [who have] suffered arranged marriages’ (p. 2). Bhopal rightly says here that Asian women’s experiences were often presented as homogeneous and essentialist. Chapters 2 and 3 speak at length to issues of shared communities and identities. However, there is an overuse of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1350506812463662">Wenger (1998)</xref> here, I would have welcomed other writers such as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1350506812463662">Brah (1996)</xref> in this discussion of Asian women and identity issues. Nonetheless, the discussion by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1350506812463662">Wenger (1998)</xref> is useful in its observation of the complexities and heterogeneity of Asian communities and identities. Framed within the discussion of identities as fluid and in flux, Bhopal makes an important link between personal and community commitments and commonalities between the Asian female students. Here Bhopal refers to shared identity as significant in the surmounting of barriers between researchers and researched. Researchers should share their own personal experiences, she argues, as this will encourage respondents to disclose their personal and subjective experiences.</p>
<p>In Chapters 4 and 5 Bhopal explores the connections between social class and Asian identity in the negotiation of university life. The chapters attend to the students’ informal networks. Ethnic and class experience is central to the choices these students make. Social and ethnic background impacted on the universities these women students attended, and the courses for which they enrolled. Asian women, Bhopal argues, feel ‘othered’ in university spaces, and because of this, they choose universities that welcome minority cultural communities. For some students, parents and partners were reported to be encouraging, and supportive, of university education whilst, for others, family life was experienced as very discouraging and judgemental of higher education. Despite these varied experiences, all the women felt empowered by the opportunity to take up higher education. University education gave them the confidence to take control of their lives and to make independent choices about their future. These chapters dispel the often-patronizing views of Asian women as passive bystanders in relation to cultural norms and expectations.</p>
<p>Chapter 6 continues the focus on strategies of support that exist both within and outside university, these include: friendship networks and wider community support. It is shared identity and solidarity between these women, argues Bhopal, that gives these students <italic>agency.</italic> Friendship networks provide social capital that reduces isolation, that empowers these students and equips them to deal with the alienation and marginalization they may face in university spaces.</p>
<p>The financial struggles and support experienced by these students are discussed in Chapter 7. Here the students talked about the cultural expectations to stay home and be ‘looked after’ by the family. One student suggests that Asian families are more supportive when it comes to financial help.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>I could not afford to go to university … I live at home and my parents have helped me with my fees and I don’t have to worry about paying my bills. If you have these additional worries, as well as trying to pass the course, then this must be a lot of pressure. (p. 83)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Some of the female students said they felt guilty when not contributing to the family income. Others worked part-time as well as studying and raising a family.</p>
<p>Chapter 8 is concerned with how higher education has helped these women to free themselves from patriarchy. One of the most poignant explanations here concerns the value of higher education the women identified as allowing them more choice in finding suitable marriage partners. It is viewed as having great exchange value for prospective husbands because an educated wife represents financial independence. In this sense, achieving a university degree adds cultural capital which allows these women to challenge certain traditional family obligations.</p>
<p>This text discusses 45 Asian women’s community struggles and barriers, and educational challenges. Its major contribution lies in its exploration of strategies for surviving the academy. University is empowering for these Asian women, not only as an educational and career pathway, but also personally because higher education offers an opportunity for these women to take control of their lives and their futures. For this reason this text offers more that a read into Asian women’s experiences in higher education. It not only illuminates the experiences of outsiders within, but is also an exposure of the connections between shared communities outside university spaces. As readers journey through these stories, this text will help them to make sense of the complex negotiations between community and university life that Asian women in higher education have to make.</p>
