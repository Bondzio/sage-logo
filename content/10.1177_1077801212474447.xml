<abstract>
<p>This study aimed to further understanding of intimate partner stalking victimization in post-abuse women, with particular attention to the definition of stalking (with or without fear and threat) most predictive of posttraumatic stress (PTS) symptoms. In community midlife women with histories of divorce (<italic>N</italic> = 192), a history of stalking victimization accompanied by fear and threat was positively correlated with PTS symptom severity, after accounting for other partner abuse. The presence, compared with absence, of fear-and-threat stalking history doubled the odds of symptomatic levels of hyperarousal. Greater physical assault and injury chronicity differentiated fear-and-threat stalked women from other stalked women. Stalking contributed to a fuller understanding of PTS symptoms in women, showing particular relevance for hyperarousal.</p>

<body>
<p>A history of intimate partner stalking victimization (hereafter, stalking) has been linked with poorer mental health among women, including posttraumatic stress (PTS) symptoms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1077801212474447">Davis, Coker, &amp; Sanderson, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1077801212474447">Pathe &amp; Mullen, 1997</xref>). Women stalked by an intimate partner, however, also report other types of intimate partner violence (IPV; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1077801212474447">Tjaden &amp; Thoennes, 1998</xref>). These other IPV types, in turn, have also been linked with poorer mental health, including PTS reactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1077801212474447">Golding, 1999</xref>). Thus, to understand the role of stalking per se in women’s mental health, the broader context of relational violence and abuse must be considered. A few pioneering studies have adopted this approach, focusing on women reporting exclusively recent partner abuse (i.e., within 6 months of the most recent episode), or women residing with their partner, or both (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1077801212474447">Basile, Arias, Desai, &amp; Thompson, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1077801212474447">Coker, Weston, Creson, Justice, &amp; Blakeney, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1077801212474447">Logan, Shannon, Cole, &amp; Walker, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1077801212474447">Mechanic, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1077801212474447">Mechanic, Weaver, &amp; Resick, 2008</xref>). The present study extended this line of research to post-abuse women—11 years post-divorce on average—selected to be free of current IPV and stalking.</p>
<p>The mental health of post-abuse women sometimes, but not always, improves over time. Emerging research suggests that key factors affecting recovery from anxiety and depression may be abuse type or severity, and time post-abuse; for severe IPV, more time may be necessary for symptoms to subside. For example, during 12- to 36-month follow-up periods, some studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1077801212474447">Blasco-Ros, Sanchez-Lorente, &amp; Martinez, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1077801212474447">Mertin &amp; Mohr, 2001</xref>), but not all (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1077801212474447">Bell, Goodman, &amp; Dutton, 2007</xref>), observed statistically significant decreases in syndromal PTSD and PTS symptoms when physical abuse ended. In one study that used a longer follow-up period, battering—compared with lower exposure physical abuse—was associated with elevations in anxiety and depression up to 8 years into the follow-up, even though group differences in ongoing physical abuse were no longer apparent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1077801212474447">Lindhorst &amp; Beadnell, 2011</xref>). Four to five years later (i.e., 12 to 13 years into the follow-up period), group differences in anxiety and depression symptoms had fully abated.</p>
<p>To our knowledge, and most relevant to the present study, no studies of remitted IPV have considered the role of stalking victimization per se in women’s post-abuse mental health. Because separation/divorce is a risk factor for stalking victimization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1077801212474447">Basile, Swahn, Chen, &amp; Saltzman, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1077801212474447">Baum, Catalano, Rand, &amp; Rose, 2009</xref>), consideration of stalking may be important for a complete understanding of the mental health of post-abuse women. Within this context, the present cross-sectional study of remitted partner abuse addressed four specific points: (a) different definitions of stalking and their associations with PTS symptoms, (b) stalking and its association with PTS symptoms after controlling for women’s other partner abuse experiences, (c) correlations between stalking and PTS symptom clusters, and (d) connections between women’s broader histories of partner abuse and stalking-related fear and threat.</p>
<sec id="section1-1077801212474447">
<title>Definitions of Stalking</title>
<p>Although the specific behaviors that qualify as stalking victimization vary, a common set of qualifying behaviors is nonetheless apparent (e.g., loitering nearby a victim, unsolicited telephone or mail contact, vandalizing a victim’s personal property). These behaviors reflect general agreement that stalking behaviors are intrusive and unwanted, and are perpetrated on multiple occasions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1077801212474447">Blaauw, Winkel, Arensman, Sheridan, &amp; Freeve, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1077801212474447">Tjaden &amp; Thoennes, 1998</xref>). There is less agreement, however, about whether these behaviors must result in feelings of fear or threat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1077801212474447">Fox, Nobles, &amp; Fisher, 2011</xref>). In the nationally representative National Violence Against Women Survey (NVAWS), intrusive and unwanted behaviors were defined as stalking only when they resulted in a high level of fear; this definition of stalking was based on the U.S. federal government’s model anti-stalking code (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1077801212474447">National Criminal Justice Association, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1077801212474447">Tjaden &amp; Thoennes, 1998</xref>). In another analysis of the NVAWS data, however, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1077801212474447">Dietz and Martin (2007)</xref> noted that 27% of women who reported intrusive and unwanted behaviors did not feel fear as a result. This highlights the need to consider various definitions of stalking (with or without experiences of fear and/or threat; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1077801212474447">Davis et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1077801212474447">Dietz &amp; Martin, 2007</xref>). This definitional issue takes on added significance in the context of predicting PTS symptoms.</p>
<p>Previous studies of intimate partner stalking victimization and PTS symptoms have used different definitions of stalking. Some defined stalking as a set of intrusive and unwanted behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1077801212474447">Mechanic et al., 2008</xref>), others as behaviors that resulted in feeling frightened (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1077801212474447">Logan et al., 2006</xref>), and still others as behaviors that resulted in feeling very frightened or perceiving physical or life threat to oneself or close others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1077801212474447">Basile et al., 2004</xref>). Each study revealed statistically significant correlations between stalking victimization and increased PTS symptoms. Nevertheless, given the centrality of fear and threat to posttraumatic stress reactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1077801212474447">Weathers &amp; Keane, 2007</xref>), incorporating fear and threat into definitions of stalking may yield stronger prediction of PTS symptoms. Accordingly, the present study evaluated whether defining stalking based on intrusive and unwanted behaviors, behaviors plus fear only, behaviors plus threat only, or behaviors plus fear and threat yields differential associations with PTS symptoms.</p>

<sec id="section2-1077801212474447">
<title>Stalking, Other IPV Types, and Posttraumatic Stress Symptoms</title>
<p>Regardless of definition, a relationship between intimate partner stalking and PTS symptoms has been consistently demonstrated, even after accounting for exposure to other IPV types. This is highlighted by studies of women selected from the community, from agencies serving battered women, and from the courts. Among community women reporting a history of abuse or violence in their current intimate relationships (a subsample of women from the NVAWS), stalking history uniquely explained variance in PTS symptoms after accounting for physical assault and psychological aggression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1077801212474447">Basile et al., 2004</xref>; but see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1077801212474447">Coker et al., 2005</xref>). Next, in women seeking services for battering, stalking history was a statistically significant, unique predictor of PTS symptom severity, after controlling for physical assault, sexual coercion, and psychological aggression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1077801212474447">Mechanic et al., 2008</xref>). Finally, in women seeking civil protection orders, those stalked by intimate partners, compared with nonstalked women, endorsed a significantly greater number of past-month PTS symptoms after adjusting for other types of partner abuse including threats, severe physical violence, and sexual violence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1077801212474447">Logan, Shannon, &amp; Cole, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>Overall, then, in the immediate aftermath of partner violence (or while residing with one’s partner), PTS symptoms can be more fully accounted for by considering experiences of stalking, even when these other IPV types also account for variance in PTS symptoms (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1077801212474447">Basile et al., 2004</xref>). The present study extended this analysis to post-abuse women, predicting that stalking history would make a unique contribution to PTS symptom severity, above and beyond a history of other IPV types (physical and sexual assault, and psychological aggression).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-1077801212474447">
<title>Stalking and Posttraumatic Stress Symptom Clusters</title>
<p>Although there is debate about the exact number of, and precise composition of, PTS symptom clusters, it is generally accepted that PTS symptoms comprise anywhere from three to four autonomous clusters, including intrusive reexperiencing, avoidance, hyperarousal, and dysphoria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1077801212474447">American Psychiatric Association, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1077801212474447">Simms, Watson, &amp; Doebbeling, 2002</xref>). Based on the notion that “unpredictable but omnipresent threat” characterizes stalking, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1077801212474447">Mechanic, Weaver, and Resick (2008</xref>, p. 649) speculated that it may be of particular relevance for hyperarousal symptoms, which include sustained hypervigilance for threat. To our knowledge, one study has examined relationships between PTS symptom clusters and stalking (albeit regardless of victim–perpetrator relationship), but hyperarousal symptoms were not assessed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1077801212474447">Kraaij, Arensman, Garnefski, &amp; Kremers, 2007</xref>). Thus, the present study tested associations between stalking and hyperarousal symptoms, employing two different definitions of hyperarousal—the traditional <italic>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</italic> (4th ed., text revision [<italic>DSM-IV-TR</italic>]) symptom cluster (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1077801212474447">American Psychiatric Association, 2000</xref>), and the hypervigilance/startle cluster identified by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1077801212474447">Simms, Watson, and Doebbeling (2002)</xref> and later replicated among women with IPV histories (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1077801212474447">Krause, Kaltman, Goodman, &amp; Dutton, 2007</xref>). Associations between stalking and the other PTS symptom clusters (intrusive reexperiencing, avoidance, and dysphoria) were also tested.</p>

<sec id="section4-1077801212474447">
<title>Other IPV Types and Stalking-Related Fear and Threat</title>
<p>As highlighted above, some, but not all, women who report stalking also report co-occurring fear or perceived threat. IPV history may be one of the factors that differentiates women who report stalking with, versus without, co-occurring fear and/or perceived threat. Women with more extensive exposure to physical violence, sexual coercion, psychological aggression, or injury—with the stalker and/or with other partners—may be particularly aware of their stalker’s potential for violence; under these circumstances, stalking may be more likely to instill fear or perceptions of threat. To test this idea, differences in IPV chronicity were compared among four mutually exclusive groups of women identified based on their stalking histories: no stalking history, stalking behaviors only, behaviors plus fear or threat, and behaviors plus fear and threat.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1077801212474447">
<title>Summary of Hypotheses</title>
<p>The central aim of the present study was to examine the contribution of stalking to PTS symptoms in the context of other IPV types. Accordingly, four hypotheses were addressed. First, stalking defined as behaviors plus fear and threat (hereafter, fear-and-threat stalking), compared with stalking defined by behaviors, behaviors plus fear, or behaviors plus threat, was hypothesized to have the strongest association with PTS symptoms. Second, in this sample of post-abuse women, stalking history was hypothesized to make a unique contribution to PTS symptom severity, above and beyond a history of other IPV types (physical and sexual assault, and psychological aggression). Third, the hypothesis of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1077801212474447">Mechanic et al. (2008)</xref>—that stalking victimization may specifically predict the presence of hyperarousal symptoms, as opposed to the presence of other symptom clusters—was tested. Fourth, it was hypothesized that women who reported stalking with, versus without, fear and/or perceived threat would be characterized by more extensive histories of other IPV types.</p>

<title>Method</title>
<sec id="section7-1077801212474447">
<title>Participant Selection and Sample</title>
<p>Women were recruited with community advertisements and mailings as part of a larger investigation of stress and aging in midlife women (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1077801212474447">Newton et al., 2011</xref>). Recruitment materials were directed toward physically healthy women who had been divorced or separated from a stressful relationship, rather than toward women with an IPV history per se. A telephone interview assessed initial eligibility criteria (i.e., English language ability, no ongoing divorce-related legal issues, no recent psychiatric hospitalization, and no current IPV—no IPV in the past year, and no IPV ever from a current intimate partner). For women meeting these criteria, the telephone interview assessed biomedical eligibility criteria for the laboratory phase of the larger investigation (i.e., postmenopausal, no chronic medical conditions, no probable substance use disorder, and no current use of prescription or over-the-counter medications with inflammatory effects). Callers ineligible for the laboratory phase were invited to participate in a questionnaire-only phase. The present study combines questionnaire data from each of these phases, for which women were compensated US$140.00 and US$60.00, respectively.</p>
<p>Of the 577 women who called for information about the study, 118 were disqualified for not meeting initial eligibility criteria, and 246 were uninterested or unable to participate, were lost to contact, or did not attend a scheduled session. The remaining 213 women were enrolled in the study protocol. Of these women, the 192 with complete data for the primary variables in the present study comprise the sample for this report (<italic>n</italic> = 68 from the laboratory phase, and <italic>n</italic> = 124 from the questionnaire-only phase).</p>

<title>Demographics and Intimate Relationship Measures</title>
<sec id="section9-1077801212474447">
<title>Demographics</title>
<p>Women reported their age, highest level of education attained, occupational status, average annual household income, and current marital status.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-1077801212474447">
<title>Relationship characteristics</title>
<p>For up to four stressful intimate relationships, women reported whether to stay safe they had ever contacted police or filed an emergency protective order (EPO), or sought shelter in the community or with friends or family. They also reported the duration of the relationship, and the age at which they divorced or separated.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-1077801212474447">
<title>Stalking</title>
<p>To assess histories of stalking by prior partners, either during the relationship or after its dissolution, women completed items from the NVAWS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1077801212474447">Tjaden &amp; Thoennes, 2000</xref>). Women who were divorced or separated from more than one partner completed the items with respect to all former relationships, collectively. The NVAWS items, based on the U.S. federal government’s model anti-stalking code (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1077801212474447">National Criminal Justice Association, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1077801212474447">Tjaden, Thoennes, &amp; Allison, 2002</xref>), identify events that constitute legally defined forms of stalking. A single yes/no item inquired if any partner had perpetrated any of eight intrusive, unwanted stalking behaviors (e.g., unsolicited correspondence, following or spying, vandalism). Women who responded affirmatively to this item then reported whether these behaviors caused (a) fear, (b) fear of bodily harm to oneself, (c) perceived threat to one’s own life, (d) perceived threat to another’s life, and (e) threat of harm to oneself. Using these items, stalking history presence (coded “1”) or absence (coded “0”) was defined based on (i) intrusive and unwanted behaviors, (ii) behaviors plus fear, and (iii) behaviors plus fear and at least one physical or life threat item (b-e). The research literature on stalking, and traumatic stress more broadly, motivated these three definitions. In addition, because some women in the present sample reported behaviors plus perceived threat, but without fear, this was included and tested as a fourth definition.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-1077801212474447">
<title>Intimate partner violence</title>
<p>With respect to their adult intimate relationships collectively, women completed the revised Conflict Tactics Scale (CTS2) to assess exposure to physical assault (12 items; α = .92), sexual coercion (7 items; α = .80), psychological aggression (8 items; α = .84), and IPV-related injury (6 items; α = .76) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1077801212474447">Straus, Hamby, &amp; Warren, 2003</xref>). This scale classifies each item as either minor (e.g., pushed or shoved by partner) or severe (e.g., choked by my partner; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1077801212474447">Calvete, Corral, &amp; Estevez, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1077801212474447">Straus &amp; Gelles, 1999</xref>; but see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1077801212474447">Regan, Bartholomew, Kwong, Trinke, &amp; Henderson, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>Two types of scores—prevalence and chronicity—were calculated. Women rated each item with respect to frequency (<italic>never, once, twice, 3 to 5 times, 6 to 10 times, 11 to 20 times, more than 20 times</italic>). Prevalence scores for severe forms of each IPV type and injury (0 = <italic>absent</italic>, 1 = <italic>present</italic>) were calculated as the percentage of women responding other than “<italic>never</italic>” to any CTS2 subscale item classified as severe. Per standard procedure, the frequency ratings were assigned values of 0, 1, 2, 4, 8, 15, and 25, respectively. Chronicity scores were calculated by summing these values for each IPV type and for injury, aggregated across minor and severe items.</p>

<title>Posttraumatic Stress Symptoms and Symptom Clusters</title>
<p>The 17-item self-report PTSD Checklist—Civilian (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1077801212474447">Weathers, Litz, Herman, Huska, &amp; Keane, 1993</xref>) assessed severity of <italic>DSM-IV-TR</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1077801212474447">American Psychiatric Association, 2000</xref>) posttraumatic stress symptoms. Women rated items on a scale of 1 (<italic>not at all</italic>) to 5 (<italic>extremely</italic>) to indicate how much they had been bothered by each symptom in the past month. Mean imputation at the symptom cluster level was used to replace missing data. A symptom severity score was calculated by summing ratings for all 17 items (α = .92).</p>
<p>Symptom cluster severity scores were calculated for both the <italic>DSM-IV-TR</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1077801212474447">American Psychiatric Association, 2000</xref>) and the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1077801212474447">Simms, Watson, and Doebbeling (2002)</xref> PTSD models. The latter model has been replicated among women with IPV histories (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1077801212474447">Krause et al., 2007</xref>). The <italic>DSM-IV-TR</italic> model comprises three clusters: reexperiencing (5 items; α = .84), avoidance (7 items; α = .88), and hyperarousal (5 items; α = .79).

<p>To provide a clearer picture of connections between PTS symptoms and partner violence per se, two other life stressors were assessed and included as covariates in the statistical models. First, childhood adversity, a potentially confounding variable, was measured by assessing the presence or absence of six events from the National Women’s Study Event History Module (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1077801212474447">Resnick, 1996</xref>): traumatic loss of a family member, attempted or completed sexual molestation, physical or sexual attack, or other extraordinarily stressful life event. Events that occurred before age 18 were counted as childhood adversity. Because less than half of the sample (47.40%) reported such a history, this variable was coded as present (1) or absent (0).</p>
<p>Second, because some PTS symptoms are nonspecific and may arise in the context of life stress more generally, past year stressful life events were measured using a 48-item checklist (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1077801212474447">Spurgeon, Jackson, &amp; Beach, 2001</xref>). Only stressors judged to be independent of partner abuse and PTS symptoms (i.e., unlikely to be caused by them) were scored. Stressors judged to be potentially related to partner abuse or PTS symptoms (i.e., likely to be caused by them) were excluded (e.g., involvement in physical fight, period of homelessness, problems related to drugs or alcohol). This approach has two advantages: It minimizes over-adjusting, or removing variance that could arguably be attributed to partner abuse, and it protects conceptual clarity by reducing the likelihood of adjusting the model for potential effects of the dependent variable.</p>
<p>To identify which stressors should be excluded, two raters independently rated the IPV-dependence (yes/no) and PTS symptom-dependence (yes/no) of the 48 stressors; Kappa coefficients reflected moderate (.59) and substantial (.63) agreement beyond chance, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1077801212474447">Landis &amp; Koch, 1977</xref>). After resolving disagreements by discussion, 14 stressful life events were retained (e.g., death of spouse, partner starts or stops working, child left home). This measure was scored by counting the number of events reported.</p>

<title>Data Analysis Plan</title>
<p>Posttraumatic stress symptom severity scores were log-transformed to reduce positive skewness and meet assumptions of statistical tests. Symptom cluster severity scores were positively skewed, and frequency distributions suggested that they could be best captured by a dichotomous indicator of symptom presence or absence. Therefore, for each symptom cluster, dichotomous scores were calculated (0 = <italic>no symptom present</italic>, 1 = <italic>at least one symptom present</italic>), where symptom presence was defined as at least one item rated 3 (<italic>moderately</italic>) or above (<italic>quite a bit</italic>, or <italic>extremely</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1077801212474447">U.S. Department of Veteran Affairs, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>Point-biserial correlation coefficients compared associations between the four different stalking definitions and PTS symptom severity. Zero-order and partial correlation coefficients were calculated. The latter controlled for physical assault, sexual coercion, and psychological aggression chronicity scores (assumed to best capture the full extent of women’s IPV histories) to enable clearer comparisons between stalking per se and PTS symptoms.</p>
<p>To evaluate whether stalking accounts for unique variance in PTS symptoms not accounted for by other IPV types, hierarchical multiple regression analysis tested the relative contributions of stalking, other IPV types, and other life stressors (childhood adversity, and past year stressful life events) to PTS symptom severity. A measure of years since divorce was also included as a covariate, a priori. This analysis directly compared stalking (measured dichotomously) to other IPV types. Therefore, dichotomous IPV prevalence scores, rather than chronicity scores, were used so that stalking and IPV were measured on similar scales.</p>
<p>To evaluate the hypothesis concerning hyperarousal, logistic regression models tested whether stalking predicted the presence of symptoms after controlling for other IPV types. Identical models were tested for the other symptom clusters.</p>
<p>To evaluate whether women stalked with fear and/or threat reported more extensive IPV histories than other stalked women, four mutually exclusive groups were formed: no stalking history (<italic>n</italic> = 60), intrusive, unwanted behaviors only (<italic>n</italic> = 16), behaviors plus fear or threat (<italic>n</italic> = 18), and behaviors plus fear and threat (<italic>n</italic> = 98). Kruskal-Wallis tests, the nonparametric equivalent to analysis of variance, tested group differences in chronicity of IPV and injury.</p>

<title>Demographics</title>
<p>On average, women were 55.04 years of age (<italic>SD</italic> = 3.92). Most women (79.69%) self-identified as European American or White; the remaining self-identified as African American or Black (18.23%), American Indian or Alaskan Native (&lt; 1%), or Other (&lt; 2%). Highest levels of educational attainment (<italic>n</italic> = 190) were college or graduate training (51.05%), some college or specialized training (35.26%), and all or part of high school (13.69%). Most women (75%) were currently employed either full-time or part-time. Regarding income (<italic>n</italic> = 189), most (79.89%) reported an average annual household income of less than US$60,000. At the time of study participation, most women (79.17%) were currently divorced or separated, with 13.02% currently married or partnered, 4.17% widowed, and 3.65% single or never married.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section19-1077801212474447">
<title>Relationship characteristics</title>
<p>With regard to all intimate relationships collectively, women spent an average of 18.42 years (<italic>SD</italic> = 8.73) in stressful relationships (i.e., total number of years spent in any intimate relationship from which they ultimately divorced or separated), with a range from 0.17 to 41.00 years; 83.85% spent 10 or more years in such relationships. Seventy-five women (39.06%) had been in one stressful relationship; 117 women (60.94%) had been in two or more stressful relationships. Women reported that it had been an average of 10.98 years (<italic>SD</italic> = 8.55) since their most recent separation or divorce, with more than two-thirds (69.79%) reporting it had been five or more years. Eleven women had been divorced or separated for less than one year, and four of these women for less than six months. Slightly above half of the women (54.17%) had previously sought shelter with friends, family, or in the community to stay safe, and nearly half (47.12%) had filed for an emergency protective order.</p>

<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1077801212474447">Table 1</xref> shows descriptive statistics and intercorrelations for stalking and IPV. When defined based on the presence of intrusive and unwanted behaviors regardless of fear or threat, slightly more than two-thirds of women had experienced stalking. When defined based on behaviors plus fear, behaviors plus threat, or behaviors plus fear and threat, stalking was somewhat less prevalent, reported by roughly half of the sample. By comparing prevalence rates across the four stalking definitions, it is evident that most women who reported intrusive and unwanted behaviors also reported fear or life threat (107 of 132), and that most who reported one of these experiences also reported the other (98 of 107).</p>

<p>Point-biserial correlation coefficients revealed statistically significant associations between log PTS symptom severity and stalking history, whether the latter was defined based on the presence of intrusive and unwanted behaviors (<italic>r</italic>(192) = .20), behaviors plus fear (<italic>r</italic>(192) = .21) or plus threat (<italic>r</italic>(192) = .23), or behaviors plus fear and threat (<italic>r</italic>(192) = .27), <italic>p</italic>s &lt; .005.

Thus, fear-and-threat stalking, compared with the other stalking definitions, accounted for more unique variance in log PTS symptom severity—2.25% versus 0.81% for stalking defined by behaviors, or by behaviors plus fear, for example—yet the amount accounted for was relatively small.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Women in the present study, carefully selected to be free of ongoing IPV, were 11 years post-divorce or separation, on average. Results, therefore, provide a unique perspective on the distal emotional aftermath of exposure to intimate partner stalking victimization, and to other IPV types. As predicted, when stalking definitions were compared, fear-and-threat stalking was the only statistically significant, unique predictor of PTS symptoms. Further, in this sample of post-abuse women, fear-and-threat stalking predicted PTS symptom severity after accounting for other types of severe IPV, and other life stressors. Support was also found for the hypothesis of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1077801212474447">Mechanic et al. (2008)</xref>: The presence versus absence of fear-and-threat stalking doubled the odds of symptomatic levels of hyperarousal; it did not predict symptomatic levels of the other symptom clusters. Finally, chronicity of other IPV types did differentiate the mutually exclusive groups of women identified based on stalking history; somewhat contrary to predictions, however, the group defined by both fear and threat, but not those defined by fear or threat alone, was most consistently differentiated by chronicity of other IPV.</p>
<sec id="section27-1077801212474447">
<title>Stalking Definitions</title>
<p>Slightly more than two-thirds of the sample reported that a partner or former partner had engaged in intrusive and unwanted behaviors commonly used to define stalking. The bulk of these women (74%) reported fear or perceived threat in response to these behaviors, and most reported both fear and threat. Overall, the prevalence rate of fear-and-threat stalking was 51%, making it less prevalent than severe physical assault, but more prevalent than severe sexual coercion.</p>
<p>The rates of fear (81%) and perceived threat (81%) that accompanied stalking behaviors are higher than those observed in a study that conducted a somewhat comparable analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1077801212474447">Bjerregaard, 2000</xref>). Specifically, in a sample of college undergraduates, 57% of stalked women reported fear for physical safety and 23% reported fear for life. However, intimate and nonintimate partner stalking were combined in the study of undergraduates. This may help explain the disparity: Stalking victimization by intimates, compared with nonintimates, doubles the odds of reporting fear, even when differences in specific stalking events are controlled (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1077801212474447">Dietz &amp; Martin, 2007</xref>). Another possible explanation for the disparity is that midlife women, by virtue of their greater life experience, may be more aware of the dangers of stalking and, therefore, more likely than college-age women to report fear. Although <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1077801212474447">Dietz and Martin (2007)</xref> tested this hypothesized connection between age and stalking-related fear and did not find support for it, they attributed this to possible cohort effects in their sample, given that awareness of stalking victimization has emerged relatively recently.</p>
<p>In addition to its high prevalence, fear-and-threat stalking compared with the three other stalking definitions, was the only statistically significant, unique predictor of PTS symptoms. In terms of actual magnitude of association, differences among the stalking definitions were quite small. Nevertheless, as the present results illustrate, differing conclusions about the role of stalking in PTS symptomatology could be reached depending on the specific stalking definition employed, especially in the context of other IPV types.</p>
<p>To our knowledge, the present study is the second to consider multiple definitions of stalking and their implications for mental health. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1077801212474447">Davis et al. (2002)</xref>, using the NVAWS sample, compared two fear-based definitions of stalking: “very afraid” and “somewhat afraid.” Compared with women without stalking histories, and after adjusting for other measures of partner abuse and for childhood maltreatment, women who reported being “very afraid,” but not “somewhat afraid,” in the context of stalking behaviors were significantly more likely to report the presence of a chronic mental illness. Importantly, only illnesses that emerged after the stalking victimization were assessed. Although not limited to intimate partner stalking, these results further underscore the importance of assessing experiences such as fear and threat to fully understand the implications of stalking victimization for women’s mental health.</p>
<p>One caveat to this line of reasoning concerns whether the statistical significance of fear-and-threat stalking reflects a form of criterion contamination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1077801212474447">Anastasi, 1988</xref>). When both stressor and symptom measures incorporate aspects of negative affectivity, and especially when both are self-report, correlations may be artificially inflated. Arguing against this, if criterion contamination were the driving force in the present study, then stalking defined by fear would also have shown statistically significant partial correlations with PTS symptoms. To the contrary, the partial correlations for fear-defined stalking were identical to those observed when stalking was defined by behaviors alone. Although this methodological question deserves further attention, the present results underscore the importance of stalking experiences that rise to the threshold of traumatic, as in the <italic>DSM-IV-TR</italic> criteria for a traumatic event—life threat plus feelings of fear, helplessness, or horror (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1077801212474447">American Psychiatric Association, 2000</xref>).</p>

<sec id="section28-1077801212474447">
<title>Stalking, Other IPV Types, and Posttraumatic Stress Symptoms and Symptom Clusters</title>
<p>The present study also compared fear-and-threat stalking to women’s broader life histories of stress—distal experiences of childhood adversity, proximal stressful life events, and three types of severe IPV—in terms of predicting PTS symptom severity. Without considering stalking, the set of severe IPV variables—psychological aggression, physical assault, and sexual coercion—emerged as statistically significant. Distal IPV history, particularly severe physical assault, predicted more bothersome past-month PTS symptoms. Neither childhood adversity nor proximal stressful life events predicted PTS symptoms. As hypothesized, when stalking was added to the model, it made a statistically significant contribution. Moreover, it emerged as the only statistically significant predictor, although the magnitude of the effect was small.</p>
<p>The fact that stalking, a nonphysical type of abuse, was the sole significant predictor of PTS symptoms may seem surprising, particularly because physical assault is often viewed as the canonical IPV experience. In interpreting this pattern, statistical issues deserve consideration. When predictors are highly correlated, the unique variance accounted for by each is reduced because all predictors cannot “claim” the same variance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1077801212474447">Cohen, Cohen, West, &amp; Aiken, 2003</xref>, p. 98). In such instances, not all individual predictors may reach statistical significance. This perspective cautions against entirely discounting the importance of more traditional IPV measures. Yet, at the same time, only fear-and-threat stalking predicted a statistically significant portion of unique variance in PTS symptoms. Substantively, what might explain this pattern?</p>
<p>One possibility is that this pattern stems from defining stalking, but not the other IPV types, based on fear and threat. For predicting PTS symptoms, which are proposed to be directly and causally related to experiences of fear and threat, this measurement approach may have advantaged stalking over the other IPV types, similar to the manner in which fear-and-threat stalking was advantaged over the other stalking definitions. To help compensate for this measurement difference, the regression model compared stalking to severe IPV only, assuming that it would be more likely than minor IPV to be accompanied by fear and threat. Although this interpretation cannot be ruled out, the results of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1077801212474447">Basile et al. (2004)</xref> argue against it. In their analysis of NVAWS data, stalking, but not physical assault, was identified based on reports of fear and threat. Yet, both physical assault and stalking accounted for unique, statistically significant portions of variance in PTS symptoms. Physical assault was not disadvantaged by the absence of fear and threat assessments.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1077801212474447">Basile et al. (2004)</xref>, however, did not study exclusively post-abuse women. Perhaps experiences of fear and threat are more critical for predicting PTS symptoms in the longer-term aftermath of IPV. If so, in the present study, stalking may indeed have been advantaged over other IPV types. Importantly, our measurement approach—the use of fear and threat appraisals for stalking, but not other IPV types—is very common in the broader literature. This highlights the importance of incorporating stress appraisals into assessments of all IPV types, not just stalking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1077801212474447">Martinez-Torteya, Bogat, von Eye, Levendosky, &amp; Davidson, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>A second possibility is that the stress of stalking is qualitatively different from that of other IPV types, and is especially predictive of PTS symptoms that are persistent, or likely to be observed years after the stressor itself has ended. Relatively few studies have addressed the mental health of post-abuse women, particularly with follow-up periods that extend beyond a few years, and to our knowledge none has explicitly tested connections between stalking and post-abuse posttraumatic stress symptoms. Yet, one study that used a longer follow-up showed that some abuse types (i.e., battering) predict more persistent symptoms of anxiety and depression than do others (i.e., lower exposure physical abuse; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1077801212474447">Lindhorst &amp; Beadnell, 2011</xref>). The nature of stalking victimization—intrusive, unwanted behaviors that extend unpredictably into multiple arenas of a woman’s life, and for which onset and offset may be difficult to gauge—seems conducive to persistent anxiety (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1077801212474447">Mechanic et al., 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>This latter point is underscored by considering PTS symptom clusters. In support of the hypothesis put forth by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1077801212474447">Mechanic, Weaver, and Resick (2008)</xref>, fear-and-threat stalking, but not severe forms of physical assault or sexual coercion, doubled the odds of symptomatic levels of past-month hyperarousal. This effect approached statistical significance for the circumscribed view of hyperarousal (i.e., hypervigilance and exaggerated startle), and it reached statistical significance when measurement of hyperarousal was broadened to include disrupted concentration, sleep dysregulation, and irritability. Fear-and-threat stalking did not predict the presence of symptomatic levels of the other clusters. The hypothesis of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1077801212474447">Mechanic et al. (2008)</xref> hinged on the notion that the stress of stalking is qualitatively different from that of other IPV types by virtue of being very likely to involve perceptions of unpredictability and omnipresence. Notably, the National Crime Victimization Survey identified “not knowing what would happen next” as the most common worst fear of stalking victims (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1077801212474447">Baum et al., 2009</xref>, p. 7). Future research on stalking and women’s mental health should assess these putative mediators: perceptions of uncertainty, unpredictability, and omnipresence.</p>
<p>A third and final possible explanation for the pattern of results observed here is that fear-and-threat stalking may be a de facto indicator of risk for having experienced multiple types of IPV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1077801212474447">Krebs, Breiding, Browne, &amp; Warner, 2011</xref>). Because exposure to multiple IPV types increases PTS symptoms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1077801212474447">Basile et al., 2004</xref>), associations between stalking and PTS symptoms might reflect this underlying dose-response relationship. The present study’s analysis of IPV chronicity and stalking groups discussed below is consistent with this line of thinking. However, the results of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1077801212474447">Logan et al. (2006)</xref> are not: When comparing two groups of women, both characterized by histories of severe physical assault, psychological abuse, and injury, the group that also reported stalking was significantly more likely to meet criteria for syndromal PTSD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1077801212474447">Logan et al., 2006</xref>). The fact that both groups were quite similar in terms of other IPV types argues that stalking is more than a simple risk indicator for multiple IPV types. Thus, the possibility remains that nonphysical abuse such as stalking may play a key, and perhaps previously underappreciated, role in PTS symptomatology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1077801212474447">Mechanic et al., 2008</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section29-1077801212474447">
<title>Chronicity of Other IPV Types and Stalking-Related Fear and Threat</title>
<p>Because not all women who reported stalking behaviors also reported fear and threat, it is important to identify why only some stalking experiences rise to the threshold of traumatic. The present results implicate chronic physical assault and injury. Chronicity of these two experiences, but not of psychological aggression or sexual coercion, differentiated the fear-and-threat stalking group from the group defined by stalking behaviors alone. This is consistent with our hypotheses and supports the idea that IPV events may influence whether women appraise stalking as frightening and threatening. However, the cross-sectional study design constrains causal inferences. Furthermore, the present study did not ascertain whether physical assault and injury occurred before or after stalking victimization. If the latter, then these IPV experiences could not have influenced perceptions of stalking victimization at the time of its occurrence, but they might have affected retrospective perceptions of stalking. Alternatively, stalking experienced by women with more chronic histories of physical assault and injury may be qualitatively different from stalking experienced by other women, and may perhaps be more frightening or threatening. Contrary to our hypotheses, stalked women who reported fear or threat alone did not report more chronic injury, or chronic IPV of any type, when compared with women who reported stalking behaviors alone or those who were not stalked. The fact that few women reported stalking behaviors plus fear or threat (<italic>n</italic> = 18), or stalking behaviors alone (<italic>n</italic> = 16) may have limited the ability to detect differences.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section30-1077801212474447">
<title>Limitations and Implications</title>
<p>A number of limitations of the present study should be acknowledged. Most broadly, participants were part of a larger study that selected midlife women who were physically healthy, who were free from medications, and who had not been recently hospitalized; women who meet these criteria may report intimate partner stalking and violence histories and mental health symptoms that differ from those of midlife women who do not. Regarding IPV assessment, it cannot be definitively stated that stalking and IPV were experienced within the same relationship because women referred to all adult cohabiting relationships, collectively, when responding to questions about these events. Also, despite precedent for using these measures to assess cumulative lifetime IPV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1077801212474447">Tjaden &amp; Thoennes, 2000</xref>), the passage of time and the malleability of memory limit the reliability and validity of these retrospective reports. Regarding assessment of stalking victimization, the present study did not ascertain its chronicity, nor whether it occurred prior to or after separation, or both. These event characteristics may contribute to a more refined understanding of connections between stalking and mental health, and should therefore be addressed in future research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1077801212474447">Dietz &amp; Martin, 2007</xref>). Regarding PTS symptoms, although we controlled for a variety of potentially correlated factors, the PTS symptoms experienced by women in this sample may not necessarily be linked to stalking or partner violence. For example, it is possible that exposure to unmeasured traumatic events may have contributed to women’s PTS symptoms. Regarding study design, although our implicit conceptual model is that IPV experiences lead to PTS symptoms, the cross-sectional design cannot establish causality. More severe current PTS symptoms may negatively bias memory such that more severe or more threatening IPV experiences are recalled. Finally, although the overall pattern of results suggests that criterion contamination is not the sole driving force in the present findings, it may be a contributing factor, as may the exclusive reliance on self-reports obtained from a single respondent. Future research on this topic will benefit from incorporating multiple measurement methods and/or respondents.</p>
<p>In sum, in the context of histories of partner abuse and violence, assessment of intimate partner stalking victimization and associated experiences of fear and threat provide a more complete understanding of post-abuse women’s mental health. Even years after its cessation, it may be of particular relevance for hyperarousal. Assessment of stalking should be emphasized in IPV research, particularly among post-abuse women, as should careful attention to its measurement and to specific symptom profiles.</p>
