<p>The educational challenge of the 21st century is to achieve high levels of learning for each and every student. As increased accountability becomes the norm, leadership becomes more challenging and demanding. In today’s complex world, in schools beset with new kinds of issues and problems, the ability of the principal to improve the effectiveness of the school becomes the critical element in determining the kind of impact that the school will have on its students. This issue offers several important articles on how educational learning systems can be improved and how the exercise of leadership influences this improvement.</p>
<p>In the lead article, researchers Ali and Heck present a new approach for determining the effectiveness of middle schools using a <italic>regression discontinuity</italic> (RD) research design to estimate schools’ academic outcomes. Their findings imply the RD design is a promising approach in differentiating school effectiveness and the leadership and educational processes that influence added-year outcomes. It produced results consistent with previous research suggesting that background factors matter less when explaining student “absolute gains” in learning. In contrast, school type, student attendance, and instructional processes matter relatively more. With respect to school leadership, their research focused attention on a set of key instructional practices that may be linked to successful school improvement. In their preliminary analyses, they noted that collaborative leadership appeared to contribute to the development of school academic capacity.</p>
<p>In recent months, there has been renewed focus to reduce the dropout rate in U.S. high schools and provide dropout prevention strategies in our schools. Fries, Carney, Blackman-Urteaga, and Savas compared two different school/community models for delivering wraparound service to support high-risk teen parents. The results of their study suggest that the process is most successful if the support system engages the students long enough (more than 8 months) to stabilize their lives and successfully meet at least two of their learning goals. The authors provide key recommendations to schools that could dramatically impact the dropout rate patterns that currently exist.</p>
<p>Providing a safe learning environment is a top priority for school leaders. In today’s world, with the increased availability of technology, addressing the issue of cyberbullyng is on every principal’s list. Strom, Strom, Wingate, Kraska, and Beckert look at the benefits of polling students about how cyberbullying affects their personal lives. The authors find that polling students provides more accurate data on the level of cyberbullying that exists in schools and note that the use of this data implies important strategies that principals could consider in their school improvement planning.</p>
<p>A firm grounding in change theory can provide educational leaders with an opportunity to orchestrate meaningful organizational improvements. Evans, Thornton, and Usinger discuss four organizational change theories and present a summary of the theories as a framework for principals to consider as different approaches to leading change. Their review of the literature suggests that shifts in thinking and behavior are needed if sustainable change is going to be achieved. Principals will find multiple ideas to apply to their own school context.</p>
<p>As you read this issue, I hope you will gather ideas that will help you move your school forward. Each article is a “must read”!</p>
