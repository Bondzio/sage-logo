<abstract>
<p>Although gambling was a prominent, not to say infamous, feature of nineteenth-century literary depictions of elite social life, the study of how the social and cultural relevance of certain games developed in the earlier period has been relatively neglected. This article examines the emergence of card-playing as a form of entertainment at the court and amongst the urban elite during the watershed period of the early to mid-eighteenth century as part of a broader engagement with European forms and fashions, catalysed by the reign of Peter I (1689–1725). The emphasis was essentially on the sociable nature of cards, but it was an activity fraught with potential risks for more ‘committed’ players. The Russian state’s role in restricting the potential excesses of any gambling, particularly (but not exclusively) amongst non-elite social groups, reflects the wider European concern about the financial and moral dangers of challenging Fate.</p>

<sec id="sec1-0265691412448045" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title>
<p>Gaming and gambling have long been recognized as an important part of the social life of early modern Europe. The late seventeenth and eighteenth centuries are commonly held by contemporaries and historians to be a period of considerable expansion for gambling as a social pursuit for both the punters and their critics.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0265691412448045">1</xref></sup> The establishment of gaming and gambling as popular recreations was in part due to their prominence at leading courts across early modern Europe, most notably that of France. The influence of Versailles as ‘a prestigious cultural context’ led to the spread of its principal card-games, such as Quadrille, Comète and Basset.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0265691412448045">2</xref></sup> A related but distinct strand of gambling culture throughout the early modern period was amongst middling and lower social groups in most European countries, which led to the prevalence of such games in taverns, coffee-houses and private houses.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0265691412448045">3</xref></sup> In Russia, certain games, such as chess and dice-playing, had a long tradition, stretching back to the pre-Christian period, but the origins of such games were to be found in contact with the Persian and Mongol worlds, rather than with Europe.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0265691412448045">4</xref></sup> From the sixteenth century onwards, however, increased contact between Muscovy and its neighbours to both the east and west meant that other games were soon introduced to Russia. These games included card-playing, draughts (<italic>shashki</italic>), dice (<italic>zern’</italic>) and other table games.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0265691412448045">5</xref></sup></p>
<p>Enthusiasm for gambling had reached a widespread and, for some contemporaries, dangerous level by the early eighteenth century, with traditional card and dice games supplemented, in terms of occasions, by various sporting events, and by means which ranged across stock exchanges, assurance companies and insurance stakes. The latter excited moral commentators in particular, given the apparent frequency of betting on births and deaths.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0265691412448045">6</xref></sup> In the eyes of these commentators, lotteries (particularly those organized by the state) were potentially the least morally suspect of all such activities, since a proportion of the profits derived could be apportioned to a charitable cause, with hospitals often chosen as worthy recipients.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0265691412448045">7</xref></sup> Russia’s distinctive economic and socio-cultural context by the late seventeenth century meant that it did not produce this type of gambling culture, although it experimented with a number of these forms throughout the eighteenth century.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-0265691412448045">8</xref></sup> However, in common with its European contemporaries, the available evidence suggests that the eighteenth century was a watershed period for gambling in Russia, in terms of the extent of such practices and the reaction of the state.</p>
<p>Scholarship on gambling during this period has generally focused on the symbolic and cultural importance of gambling in certain contexts.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-0265691412448045">9</xref></sup> For example, Kavanagh has examined the function of gambling in eighteenth-century France, in particular its role as a means for the aristocracy to project an appropriate self-image through a conscious disregard for wealth and its relationship with the theme of chance in Enlightenment discourse.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-0265691412448045">10</xref></sup> The relationship between gambling and literature in Russia has generally been the focus of most scholarly attention, concentrating on the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-0265691412448045">11</xref></sup> For example, the dangers of excessive gambling were a common theme in Russian literature in this period, from Vasilii I. Maikov’s <italic>Igrok lombera</italic> (The Ombré Player) (1763) through to the well-known examples in Aleksandr S. Pushkin’s <italic>Vystrel</italic> (The Shot) (1830) and <italic>Pikovaia dama</italic> (The Queen of Spades) (1833).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-0265691412448045">12</xref></sup> However, apart from passing mentions in the introductions ro these studies of a later period, the early to mid eighteenth-century background to this gambling context is for the most part relegated to mentions of ‘antiquarian’ collections of Russian and foreign anecdotes, with an emphasis on the extravagant nature of gambling at the Imperial court.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-0265691412448045">13</xref></sup> The history of card-playing in Russia has been rather better served by several studies from the same late imperial period, which refer to both the archival and printed records on the subject, which has recently resurfaced as a topic for scholarly analysis in Russia.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn14-0265691412448045">14</xref></sup></p>
<p>Whilst all of the above works include many interesting details and incidents, particularly on the increasing frequency of card-playing in Russian society during the eighteenth century, my discussion here will instead focus on the changing nature of gaming, specifically the establishment of card-playing as an acceptable social pastime in Russia in this period. Such games are generally perceived as merely part of the backdrop to more significant cultural changes. However, the increasingly important role of cards as an accepted commonplace in elite and urban social life by the second half of the eighteenth century, specifically during the reign of Catherine II, and the prevalence of gambling in nineteenth-century literature merit further investigation of their origins in the Russian context. The focus will be primarily on the half-century preceding Catherine II’s accession in 1763, a period which saw the adoption and adaptation of certain European fashions by the Russian elite and which therefore effectively set the stage for the better-known developments during Catherine’s reign.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn15-0265691412448045">15</xref></sup></p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec2-0265691412448045"><title>I. Background</title>
<p>There is some question as to the extent of such gaming activities, beyond certain social groups or regions. For example, somewhat surprisingly in view of his frank opinions on the other apparent deficiencies of the Russian character, Adam Olearius’s travel account of Muscovy in the 1630s barely mentions games or gambling at all.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn16-0265691412448045">16</xref></sup> On the other hand, Unbegaun highlights the Russian-English vocabulary of Richard James, an English embassy chaplain from 1618 to 1619, which included no fewer than 15 words relating to cards and card-playing (including a slang term for cheating at cards), nine terms associated with chess, and a single popular dice game, referred to as <italic>sem’ odinnadtsat’</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn17-0265691412448045">17</xref></sup> In a related article, with specific reference to cards, Unbegaun notes that the use of such terminology not only enables the historian to date their first appearance in Muscovite Russia as earlier than previously thought, but also to explore the route through which they arrived, since the words are derived from Polish and Czech roots.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn18-0265691412448045">18</xref></sup> The subsequent extent of awareness and adoption of such card games is suggested by the records of playing-card imports during the seventeenth century, with Moscow alone receiving 200 dozen packs in 1636.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn19-0265691412448045">19</xref></sup></p>
<p>Regardless of the actual extent of such games, however, the official attitude was largely hostile, as was generally the case elsewhere in contemporary Europe. The Orthodox Church distrusted objects and pastimes of foreign origin and the wager of money was considered sinful. The subject of games – including chess, draughts, dice and cards – was raised and condemned by tsar Ivan IV’s 1551 Church Council in Moscow, the written proceedings of which became known as the ‘One Hundred Chapters’ (<italic>Stoglav</italic>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn20-0265691412448045">20</xref></sup> This view was echoed in the famous guide to household management, the <italic>Domostroi</italic> (lit. ‘house order’) compiled in roughly the same period, wherein such games were decried as part of an ungodly lifestyle.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn21-0265691412448045">21</xref></sup> An eighteenth-century manuscript manual for confessors notes the continuation of this Orthodox attitude, with the imposition of a penance for playing such games.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn22-0265691412448045">22</xref></sup> On the secular front, Muscovite legislation, subsequently codified in the ‘Law Code’ (<italic>Ulozhenie</italic>) in 1649, made clear that gambling with cards or dice was a practice associated with thieves (<italic>vory</italic>). As a result, it was to be punished in the same terms as theft – that is, beating with the knout, removal of the left ear and two years in prison, followed by hard labour.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn23-0265691412448045">23</xref></sup></p>
<p>Whilst such religiously inspired disapproval was hardly unusual in contemporary Europe,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn24-0265691412448045">24</xref></sup> state interest in gambling varied in its motivation. For example, the frequent prohibitions on gambling in early modern Spain were not wholly concerned with the moral well-being of society, but were influenced by the local nobility having a stake in the gaming ‘boards’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn25-0265691412448045">25</xref></sup> In Renaissance and early modern Italy, there was a flourishing gambling culture, both at court and in the various <italic>ridotti</italic> (and later <italic>casini</italic>), which sprang up in a variety of settings, from noble houses to less salubrious establishments.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn26-0265691412448045">26</xref></sup> Interestingly, these <italic>ridotti</italic> are noted by Petr Tolstoi during his travels – he visits what he calls a <italic>reduta</italic> in Venice in 1698, where he observes <italic>basset</italic> being played and is struck by the sheer amount of money being gambled (tens of thousands of golden <italic>chervontsy</italic>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn27-0265691412448045">27</xref></sup> Like their French equivalents, the <italic>académies des jeux</italic>, which sprang up across Paris and other cities from the mid-sixteenth century onward, these ‘gambling houses’ were generally tolerated, but periodic legislation sought to limit excessive gambling. This was not merely to prevent ruinous debt, but also to tackle the assorted vices frequently associated with it – violence, swearing and lewd behaviour were often cited.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn28-0265691412448045">28</xref></sup> In England, Henry VIII tried to prohibit gambling beyond the royal court in 1541, with specific reference to cards, dice, bowls and other table games, although this proved unpopular and thus unenforceable in the long term. Similarly, the moral opposition of the Puritans to such activities did not prevent their persistence at local level during the 1650s.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn29-0265691412448045">29</xref></sup></p>
<p>Therefore, despite official disapproval, in common with the aforementioned contemporary European examples, it is clear that such games were at least familiar to members of the Muscovite elite by the mid-seventeenth century. However, with the exception of chess (provided that no money was staked), it was only in the eighteenth century that these games became a common and acceptable social activity for this elite. A number of factors might be considered as part of this process, not least that this was a period of growing awareness of European social practices amongst the Muscovite elite. For example, the household of Artemon S. Matveev (whose wife was of Scottish descent) hosted musical and theatrical performances, featuring foreign personnel, in the early 1670s and this has been linked to the emergence of a court theatre at the end of tsar Aleksei Mikhailovich’s reign.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn30-0265691412448045">30</xref></sup> Individuals such as Prince Vasilii V. Golitsyn and, more significantly, Peter I himself, actively sought to interact socially with foreigners, either in private or in the Foreign Quarter in Moscow, which may have led to their exposure to this important aspect of European social life.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn31-0265691412448045">31</xref></sup></p>
<p>However, there is no direct evidence to suggest that these members of the Russian elite adopted this sociable aspect of card-playing during this period. For example, Golitsyn did not own cards, although an inventory of his possessions lists draughts and a chess set.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn32-0265691412448045">32</xref></sup> Similarly, the accounts of Peter’s carousing during his formative years do not make any specific mention of gambling, while later accounts make it clear that he was a committed chess player of some ability.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn33-0265691412448045">33</xref></sup> Instead, when mentioned in the accounts of this period, cards and gambling are usually linked to their prohibited status and the problems that these activities caused those who became involved with them. For example, Patrick Gordon notes in his <italic>Diary</italic> that several soldiers billeted with him in <italic>Ogorodnaia sloboda</italic> in Moscow were caught playing cards by a Russian ‘captain’, Afanasii K. Spiridonov, who confiscated the gambled money and extorted from them a further 60 rubles (until dealt with by Gordon).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn34-0265691412448045">34</xref></sup> Therefore, despite a growing awareness of cards and card-playing in late Muscovite Russia, there is little evidence to suggest that such games were becoming any more acceptable as a social pursuit by the eve of the eighteenth century.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec3-0265691412448045"><title>II. The Petrine Era and Assemblies</title>
<p>Initially, there is little to suggest that the early Petrine era represented a major shift in attitude with regard to cards and gambling. Instead there is a considerable degree of continuity with the trends of the seventeenth century – growing familiarity with this important strand of European sociability, coupled with official disapproval – albeit on a larger scale than previously. Thus, the education of young noblemen abroad or by foreign tutors, and the increased employment of foreign specialists in Russia, particularly in the military and the navy, contributed to increased contact with such games from the 1690s onwards. For example, Ivan I. Nepliuev mentions that his fellow Russian naval students visited a <italic>reduta</italic> (using the same term as Tolstoi, above) when based on Corfu in April 1718, presumably not an isolated incident.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn35-0265691412448045">35</xref></sup> However, the official attitude to such practices remained very negative, and it is hardly surprising, in light of this increased contact, that the initial prohibitions on gambling issued in the eighteenth century were directed at military and naval personnel. The ‘Military Statute’ (<italic>Voinskii ustav</italic>) in 1715 prohibited soldiers from gambling, with specific reference to using their uniform or their weapon as a stake, under threat of corporal punishment, loss of wages, and (for persistent offenders) death.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn36-0265691412448045">36</xref></sup> The naval equivalent, the <italic>Morskoi ustav</italic> (1720), contained similar punishments for any personnel found playing cards, dice or similar games for money whilst on-board ship.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn37-0265691412448045">37</xref></sup></p>
<p>Instead, the major turning point for card-playing as a social activity at the Russian court was the Petrine ‘assemblies’ (<italic>assamblei</italic>) that were formally introduced by an oft-cited law in late November 1718.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn38-0265691412448045">38</xref></sup> Although this probably consolidated an existing social practice, dating back to the late 1690s and the aftermath of the Grand Embassy,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn39-0265691412448045">39</xref></sup> the fact that the law included game-playing amongst the types of activity that were permitted (not to say expected) at these gatherings suggests that it was recognized as a component part of elite, urban, European social life. Several contemporary accounts mention card-playing in this context during the late Petrine period. Friedrich-Christian Weber’s description of the ‘assemblies’ in 1719 indicates that they often had separate rooms for dancing, and for playing cards, chess and draughts, for smoking and conversation, and for ‘Questions and Commands, Forfeits, Cross-purposes’ and other parlour games.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn40-0265691412448045">40</xref></sup> This division was also noted by another contemporary observer, Peter Henry Bruce, although he highlights that it was not always possible – albeit largely for practical reasons – and thus smoking, gaming and dancing in close proximity to each other hampered sociable conversation.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn41-0265691412448045">41</xref></sup></p>
<p>Such foreign accounts of the late Petrine period provide evidence of this trend. Friedrich-Wilhelm von Bergholz’s diary is a very valuable source for the developments occurring in Russian social life in the early to mid 1720s. Along with comments on oft-neglected topics – like clothing fashions, manners and dancing – he similarly noted instances of card-playing in Russia. The transnational nature of such forms of interaction is highlighted when Bergholz meets an old Russian nobleman, whilst staying in Narva in June 1721. Despite a lack of common language, they are able to play cards together through a common game – <italic>mar’iazh</italic> in Russian, <italic>mariagen-spiel</italic> in German.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn42-0265691412448045">42</xref></sup> It was also naturally an abiding interest for the foreign personnel residing at the Russian court, although it was not always available due to its relative novelty at formal Russian elite social gatherings. The Imperial envoy Count Stefan Kinskii and the Holstein envoy Henning-Friedrich Bassewich bemoaned the lack of cards as a means to pass the time at the court celebrations for the conclusion of the Peace of Nystadt on 22 October 1721.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn43-0265691412448045">43</xref></sup> This attitude was not shared by all foreigners, however – Bergholz’s employer, Karl Friedrich, the Duke of Holstein, showed a marked lack of enthusiasm for such games.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn44-0265691412448045">44</xref></sup></p>
<p>Likewise, there was the question of Peter I’s aforementioned lack of interest in cards. Bergholz notes in his diary that card-playing was not tolerated at the ‘assemblies’ in February 1722, in contrast to the permissible games, chess and dice.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn45-0265691412448045">45</xref></sup> He claims that gambling of any kind was not permitted at these gatherings because of Peter’s personal disapproval – rather, the tsar preferred to play chess or draughts on such occasions.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn46-0265691412448045">46</xref></sup> Whilst Peter I’s disapproval led to the enforced absence of such activities from the gatherings where he was in attendance, the tsar was neither omnipresent nor omniscient, and gambling appears to have persisted amongst the Russian elite. Members of Peter’s close circle and Catherine’s emerging European-style court were enthusiastic card-players, and considerable sums of money were gambled on occasion.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn47-0265691412448045">47</xref></sup> For example, Prince Aleksandr D. Menshikov, an apparently enthusiastic gambler (according to several historical opinions), played cards (<italic>karty</italic>) or chess (<italic>shakhmaty</italic>) on an almost daily basis, usually for an hour or more in the afternoons or evenings with his guests or members of his entourage. Menshikov’s diary for the years 1716–20 notes broadly that the prince ‘amused himself’ or engaged in ‘amusements’ (<italic>zabavy</italic>), whereas, for 1726–27, specific reference is made to playing both chess and cards on such occasions (albeit with no details of the individual games or stakes).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn48-0265691412448045">48</xref></sup></p>
<p>Thus, the available evidence by the end of the Petrine era suggests that card-playing and gambling had become a fixture in the Russian social calendar. This had occurred despite the tsar’s lack of interest in card-playing, although his encouragement (not to say enforcement) of mixed company socializing amongst the elite (typified by the ‘assemblies’) gave it an environment in which to flourish. Although there was naturally an ongoing foreign influence on (and interest in) such games in early eighteenth-century Russia, their adoption by influential persons at court, alongside a continuing enthusiasm for gambling in other sectors of Russian society, better explain this trend.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec4-0265691412448045"><title>III. Refinement and Diversification</title>
<p>The two aforementioned factors form the context for the examination of the relationship between the Russian state and gambling at cards in the period after Peter I’s death. Although the available information about court activities, particularly in the 1730s, is less detailed than for the second half of the eighteenth century, three trends become clear about card-playing and gambling at court from the existing court journals (particularly from the early 1740s onward), and from various foreign accounts.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn49-0265691412448045">49</xref></sup> Firstly, with the gradual evolution of the court’s social life during the 1730s and 1740s, such games, in particular cards, became an established and regular feature of both the court’s everyday social life and of specific events, such as ‘court days’ (referred to as <italic>kurtagy</italic>, from the German equivalent) or masked balls. Alongside other similar socio-cultural developments, such as the evolution of court theatre, music and ballet, this brought the Russian court firmly into line with its European contemporaries. In most European courts, the fact that the ruler played such games meant that their courtiers were usually obliged to participate.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn50-0265691412448045">50</xref></sup> There were inevitable consequences, particularly in view of the financial implications of certain games (discussed further below), or the boredom of enforced participation. For example, Louis XV’s court evenings were dominated by the royal couple’s enthusiasm for card-playing (particularly <italic>lansquenet</italic> and <italic>cavagnole</italic>), but contemporaries noted that this passion was not shared by all present, and games usually ceased shortly after they retired for the evening.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn51-0265691412448045">51</xref></sup></p>
<p>The situation in Russia was similar, and, as in most other court activities, the ruler naturally dominated proceedings. Mrs Vigor (‘Lady’ Rondeau, wife of the English Resident at the Russian Court) writes of how Anna Ivanovna and Princesses Anna (Leopoldovna) and Elizaveta (Petrovna) would always form their circle first at a ‘court day’ and then the rest of the assembled group would follow suit.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn52-0265691412448045">52</xref></sup> This dominance was also reflected in the role that the empress could assume at the card table. Christoph-Hermann von Manstein, an ex-Prussian military officer serving in the Russian army, noted in his memoirs that Anna Ivanovna was not an enthusiastic card-player, since she tended to lose quite quickly. Instead, she favoured being the banker, which afforded her considerable control over certain games (as we will see below).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn53-0265691412448045">53</xref></sup> Similarly, the official court journals make clear that the rulers and the members of the imperial family would frequently play cards with smaller court circles of select guests (usually favoured courtiers or foreign ministers) in the afternoon or evening.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn54-0265691412448045">54</xref></sup> It has been suggested that card-playing, by its very nature a static pursuit, was favoured by the more mature and hence less energetic members of the court. For instance, Elizaveta Petrovna increasingly favoured cards as an alternative to dancing at court events as her reign progressed and her health worsened.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn55-0265691412448045">55</xref></sup> However, as Catherine II’s <italic>Mémoires</italic> make clear on a number of occasions, it was a common and largely unavoidable activity for all ages and abilities as part of the daily round of court life.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn56-0265691412448045">56</xref></sup></p>
<p>The second significant development in this period is that the available accounts provide some interesting details on the types of card-games that were commonly played at court. Carl-Reinhold Berch, a Swedish visitor to St Petersburg in the 1730s, noted that the court generally played <italic>jeux de commerce</italic> (skilled play being preferred to pure chance), before specifying that the empress would play <italic>piquet</italic> or stroll between the card tables.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn57-0265691412448045">57</xref></sup> Further details are contained in a law issued in 1761, dealing with the regulation of gambling amongst the nobility (discussed in the next section). This listed the popular card games of this period, which included faro, quintiche, ombre, quadrille, piquet and pamfille.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn58-0265691412448045">58</xref></sup> Some of these games were intended to be played by a small number of people and relied on one’s skills at cards rather than luck, notably quadrille (which involved only four players), thus encouraging an intimate atmosphere in which conversation and other forms of polite interaction could take place.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn59-0265691412448045">59</xref></sup> However, the element of risk was much stronger in other card games, particularly faro, in which the odds favoured the banker, perhaps explaining Anna Ivanovna’s preference for the role (noted above).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn60-0265691412448045">60</xref></sup></p>
<p>The very nature of such games meant that card-playing could prove an expensive pastime, even for a member of the elite; for example, Manstein claimed to have seen losses of 20,000 rubles in a single sitting of quinze or faro at Court.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn61-0265691412448045">61</xref></sup> Catherine’s <italic>Mémoires</italic> provide several instances of the high stakes nature of gambling at court, citing sums of 40–50,000 rubles being staked on cards.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn62-0265691412448045">62</xref></sup> Although there was doubtless a degree of literary licence at work, she emphasizes the harmful consequences of an aggressive and excessive, not to say mean-spirited, attitude at the gaming table. A particular offender in this respect appears to have been Maria Choglokova who, along with her husband, was both an inveterate gambler (particularly at the dangerous <italic>azardnye igry</italic>) and a sore loser.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn63-0265691412448045">63</xref></sup> Catherine’s account also provides brief mention of a fight between Count Zakhar Chernyshev and Colonel Nikolai Leontiev over gambling debts at Roman L. Vorontsov’s house in 1753.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn64-0265691412448045">64</xref></sup> The likelihood of such debts meant that a record of one’s winnings and losses was important to avoid embarrassment (or worse, as in the latter case). An example, dating to 1752, lists this information for the aforementioned Vorontsov. He clearly had a good year, as he won 7168 rubles from the likes of Counts Aleksandr and Ivan I. Shuvalov, Prince Petr I. Panin and Aleksei A. Khitrov (mainly at faro and ombré), whilst his losses (at cards and billiards) amounted to just 3270 rubles.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn65-0265691412448045">65</xref></sup></p>
<p>Although not on a par with the anecdotal evidence from other contemporary sources, such expenditure was potentially very harmful for a family’s fortunes in the longer term as there was little to be gained and much to be lost. Yet such incidents were hardly unusual in contemporary Europe – many of the accounts of Versailles note the losses incurred, not least by Madame de Montespan (believed to be 400,000 pistoles in one night) or Orry de Fulvy, <italic>directeur de finances</italic> (losing 20,000 <italic>louis</italic>, mysteriously paid off the following day).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn66-0265691412448045">66</xref></sup> Similarly, the leading political and society figures of Georgian London would commonly incur heavy gambling debts within the exclusive confines of the emergent clubs, such as White’s and Brooks’s.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn67-0265691412448045">67</xref></sup> Although an ever-present risk for card-players throughout Europe, these losses and debts point to the third significant development of this period – an increase in official reaction to the dangers of excessive gambling.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec5-0265691412448045"><title>IV. Regulations</title>
<p>Official concerns about the ruinous consequences that the demands of gambling debts could place on individual or family fortunes provided one of the principal motivations for a series of laws on gambling during this period. A personal law issued by Anna Ivanovna in January 1733 dealt with some of the concerns surrounding gambling for high stakes and was to be circulated amongst the people (<italic>v narod</italic>). It began by referring to a previous ban on playing games for money, promulgated by Peter I in 1717, in which participants were to be fined triple the amount of money wagered in the game. However, the law stated that gambling had continued in spite of this prohibition, both in a public and presumably social setting (using the curious phrase <italic>mnogie kompaniiami</italic> ‘many [people] with company’) and also in private houses (<italic>v partikuliarnykh domakh</italic>). More seriously, from an official point-of-view, gamblers had begun to wager not only money and household goods, but also serfs (referred to by the rather general term <italic>liudi</italic>) and villages whilst playing cards, dice and other games of chance.</p>
<p>The law makes clear that such gambling will not only bring financial ruin (<italic>krainee ubozhestvo i razorenie</italic>), but also represents a most grave sin (<italic>samyi tiazhkii grekh</italic>), with reference to the example of ‘God’s law’. The fact that the games are described in the law as ‘profane and ruinous games’ (<italic>bogomerzkiia i vreditel’nyia igry</italic>) leaves little doubt about the official attitude toward such activities. Consequently all gambling for money, goods, ‘yards’ (<italic>dvory</italic>) or villages was banned, both in private dwellings and in ‘free houses’ (<italic>v partikuliarnykh i vol’nykh domakh</italic>). The punishments were also listed in the law. For a first offence, the precedent of 1717 was followed, with two-thirds of the fine to be given to a hospital (not specified). A second offence was to be punished by a month in prison for officers and other ‘distinguished people’ (<italic>znatnye liudi</italic>), or a merciless (<italic>neshchadno</italic>) beating with sticks for ‘common people’ (<italic>podlye liudi</italic>). A third offence involved doubling the monetary value of the fine, and subsequent punishments were left to the discretion of the Police Chancellery, the local governor or the commanding officer.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn68-0265691412448045">68</xref></sup></p>
<p>Such prohibitions on gambling were not only intended to apply to the general populace, but also reflected concerns about its potentially corrupting influence on young minds. In June 1732, Count Burkhard Christoph von Münnich issued an order to Baron Johann-Ludwig Luberas von Pott, the first director of the Cadet Corps, to prohibit both the Corps’s officers and the cadets from visiting taverns and coffeehouses ‘where there are pool tables and other entertainments’. The order stated that such activities not only led to unnecessary expense, but were also conducted in places where ‘quarrels and fights and other indecencies’ could occur, which made it inappropriate for the members of the Corps to be present.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn69-0265691412448045">69</xref></sup> The same concerns are reflected in another law, issued in 1735, which banned court pages from certain drinking establishments (<italic>kabaki</italic> and <italic>vol’nye domy</italic>) where card and billiards were played. The consequences for the pages – details were not given in the law – were likely less severe than for the proprietors of such establishments, with the imposition of a large fine being amongst the punishments for hosting such games.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn70-0265691412448045">70</xref></sup></p>
<p>The difficulties of enforcing such prohibitions are highlighted by the fact that the law of 1717/33 was reissued in June 1743 and again in March 1747, with the addition of a sentence concerning ‘people of all ranks’ (<italic>vsiakogo china liudi</italic>) who had continued gambling for money in the aforementioned places, despite the restatement of the fines and punishments.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn71-0265691412448045">71</xref></sup> Nevertheless, there were some high-profile punishments in this period. For example, Baron Isaiah P. Shafirov, a state adviser (<italic>statskii sovetnik</italic>), was accused of squandering his estates at cards in 1745, and was banned from taking out loans or mortgaging properties, as well as prevented from gambling at cards or other games. In addition, his palace in St Petersburg was ordered to be turned over to the Office of the Commissariat, in lieu of his outstanding debts.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn72-0265691412448045">72</xref></sup> His behaviour led the Empress to order his confinement in the Donskoi monastery in 1747, although this sojourn did little to mend his ways – upon his release in 1749, his frivolous lifestyle continued unabated and he died in poverty in 1756.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn73-0265691412448045">73</xref></sup></p>
<p>A further revision of the law regarding gambling took place in mid-1761, which made clear the distinction between gambling, particularly card-playing, as a vice and as a social activity. The law in question ordered that card games (<italic>azardnyia v karty</italic>), namely faro, quintich and other similar games, were not to be played under any circumstances for money or for goods, except (significantly) in the empress’s apartments, that is between members of her close circle and courtiers. Importantly, an exception was made for a number of other card games, including ombré, quadrille, picquet and pamphille, which could be played for very small sums of money in aristocratic houses (<italic>v znatnykh dvorianskikh domakh</italic>). However this was to be ‘only for [the purposes of] passing the time’ (<italic>edinstvenno dlia preprovozhdeniia vremeni</italic>). Anyone playing for large sums was to be fined twice their annual salary and the amount of money gambled (or the value of any goods that were pawned to cover debts), while the owner of the premises in which the game took placed was to be fined as well. This fine was to be divided in four – one part was to be given to ‘the hospital’, a second part was to be used for the upkeep of the police, and the other two parts were to be used to reward informers who could provide adequate written proof of the illegal activity.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn74-0265691412448045">74</xref></sup></p>
<p>Any attempt to use promissory notes (<italic>vekseli</italic>) or bills of exchange (<italic>zaemnye kreposti</italic>) in place of money or any kind of pawned goods would result in their confiscation by the Treasury and a fine for those involved. Although the Police Chancellery or local officials were responsible for enforcing this ban, the final point added that the Senate should be informed about any fines, as well as the War College, the Admiralty or the regimental chancelleries for the Guards, since this could have a bearing on rank and promotion.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn75-0265691412448045">75</xref></sup> Several important points arise from these laws, which illustrate the official attitude towards gambling throughout this period. Card-playing was clearly perceived as a social pursuit. There was a clear preference for games involving small groups or a high degree of skill, such as quadrille, which promoted a sociable atmosphere, over those with a high degree of chance, like faro, which carried the risk of high losses and debt. As a corollary to that point, there were only certain spaces where this was considered appropriate, namely at court, in the apartments of the empress, and in the houses of distinguished nobles. Finally, this is the first time that the term <italic>azardnye</italic> (later <italic>azartnye</italic>) is used to draw a firm distinction between acceptable and unacceptable gambling practices. This distinction would be reflected in the legislation dealing with cards and other forms of gambling until at least the end of the reign of Alexander I.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn76-0265691412448045">76</xref></sup></p>
<p>Such legislation again fits with the pattern that was firmly established in other European states. For example, the French law on gambling was typified by an <italic>ordonnance</italic> issued in late 1717, which prohibited dice games and various specified card games, and then vaguely referred to other similar activities. This was followed by similar <italic>ordonnances</italic> issued in 1757, 1759 and 1765, with only the specified card games altered.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn77-0265691412448045">77</xref></sup> Property owners were held partially responsible for any gambling that took place there, with fines, confiscations or service in the galleys as the usual punishments. Both the law and contemporary moral opinion were chiefly concerned with the corrupting side-effects of gambling, rather than the games per se, hence exceptions were generally made for chess and draughts, which were considered <italic>jeux de commerce</italic> or <italic>jeux de société</italic>, and recreational card games in a domestic setting.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn78-0265691412448045">78</xref></sup> In England, laws were passed, both to restrict losses (a 1664 law allowed for the recovery of losses over £100, reduced to £10 in 1710) and to restrict access to certain games (the 1738 Gaming Act prohibited houses from hosting faro, basset and hazard and subsequent laws targeted dice and roulette games).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn79-0265691412448045">79</xref></sup> Significantly, however, these laws were often not prosecuted to the full extent of the law, and a degree of (unofficial) tolerance was almost inevitable, especially in the emerging fashionable clubs of the Georgian period (noted above).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn80-0265691412448045">80</xref></sup> As with many popular pastimes across early modern Europe, the frequency with which prohibitions against them appeared throughout the period suggests that enforcement of such laws was limited on practical grounds in many cases.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn81-0265691412448045">81</xref></sup></p>
<p>Beyond that, there were clear consequences, with confiscations, monetary fines or implications for one’s career advancement in the case of nobles, and criminal consequences (i.e. corporal punishment, at the very least) for those from a lower social background. The example of Shafirov’s punishment has been noted above, but another incident from 1765 provides further evidence of the results for those who were made an example of. Captain Petr A. Menshikov of the Preobrazhenskii Guards, grandson of the aforementioned Prince Aleksandr, was punished with a large fine (4000 rubles) for high-stakes gambling, which had resulted in a 30,000 ruble debt for Aleksei Saltykov (a titular adviser). This debt had been partially settled with an (illegal) exchange of serf villages, which attracted official attention. Both men were also punished by a month-long jail sentence in the Sts Peter and Paul fortress in St Petersburg.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn82-0265691412448045">82</xref></sup></p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec6-0265691412448045" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title>
<p>By the early 1760s, it is clear that card-playing had become established as an acceptable social activity for members of the Russian elite and a clearly common, but largely proscribed pursuit for many other social groups. Official recognition of its popularity as a pastime can be seen in the state’s attempt to profit from the sale of playing cards, increasing the customs duty on their import by foreign traders in the 1760s, whilst beginning to manufacture domestic alternatives.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn83-0265691412448045">83</xref></sup> This also provided a means to address some of the moral concerns about such activities, with Catherine II ordering that the recently increased customs duty on imported playing cards be directed to pay for the upkeep of the newly-established ‘Foundling Hospital’ (<italic>Vospitatel’nyi dom</italic>) in Moscow in August 1765.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn84-0265691412448045">84</xref></sup> This flow of funds proved difficult to regulate effectively, with only a small percentage of this customs duty filtering through to the intended recipient.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn85-0265691412448045">85</xref></sup> Indeed, the Foundling Hospital’s founder and director, Ivan I. Betskoi, petitioned the Procurator-General of the Senate, Prince Aleksandr A. Viazemskii, in 1774 for the right of his institution to play a more direct role in the production and sale of playing cards.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn86-0265691412448045">86</xref></sup> There were other similar operations, usually run by foreign merchants – by the 1770s, there were half a dozen playing card manufactories in St Petersburg alone.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn87-0265691412448045">87</xref></sup> The Foundling Hospital venture began in partnership with established foreign producers, but later grew to become self-sufficient by the early nineteenth century, and was protected by the grant of an imperial monopoly.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn88-0265691412448045">88</xref></sup></p>
<p>Another symbol of the increased profile of such card games came through their appearance in print. In many other European countries, there were published guides to playing these games, particularly from the mid-eighteenth century onward, and Russia proved no exception. The fullest treatment of the subject in Russian was provided by the two-part <italic>Description of Card Games</italic>, compiled by Grigorii Komov and published by the Artillery and Engineering Cadet Corps press between 1778 and 1779.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn89-0265691412448045">89</xref></sup> However, probably the most famous of these guides was Edmund Hoyle’s compendium of his earlier short treatises on card and board games, entitled <italic>Mr Hoyle’s Games</italic>, of which new editions were published through to the mid-twentieth century.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn90-0265691412448045">90</xref></sup> Hoyle’s treatise on whist was published in Russian translation (by A. M. Saltykov from the French version, for the Academy of Sciences press) in 1769, with a print-run of 300 copies. A longer version was subsequently published by a private press (in the name of I. K. Shnor) in 1791, although the size of the print-run is not known.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn91-0265691412448045">91</xref></sup> There were similar guides to other, mainly English and French card games, published during the 1780s and early 1790s, but no more than half a dozen titles appeared on cards in Russian translation during the eighteenth century.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn92-0265691412448045">92</xref></sup></p>
<p>The reasons for this consolidation are in part related to the perceived sociable function of cards and card-playing. In the newly emergent mixed-company and Europeanized setting of the Russian court, card-playing provided an important forum for interaction, albeit one with defined rules and roles for its participants, and a means to occupy one’s time in a (preferably pleasant) sociable fashion. However, as in many contemporary European countries, the potential excesses of this trend prompted a number of official concerns, not least the financial and moral costs of heavy gambling and its attendant vices. That the legislation issued to combat these corrupting tendencies was clearly limited in its effectiveness, as evidenced by the continuing incidence of high-stakes gambling amongst the elite, is also hardly unusual when compared to the cited experience of other European states. Beyond the obvious appeal of the very large potential winnings for participants and the use of such stakes as evidence of conspicuous wealth, the later eighteenth century also witnessed a growing belief, mainly amongst young noblemen, that gambling at cards was another means to prove one’s character. The risk of bankruptcy was a challenge to be faced down, and the need to settle one’s debts (leading, in some cases, to suicide) was an integral part of the process.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn93-0265691412448045">93</xref></sup> However, the appeal of card games throughout this period lay in the possibilities they offered to their players. For some, it was their sociable nature and who they were able to interact with during the game – for others, it was the possibility of winning, for prestige or for profit. The key was that one never quite knew what hand Fate would deal next.</p>

<fn id="fn8-0265691412448045"><label>8</label><p>Lotteries provide one example of such experimentation in Russia. The first state lottery was introduced to support invalided officers from the Seven Years War in 1760. However, it was abandoned in 1764 on the grounds of deficient administration which had resulted in a poor financial return: <italic>Polnoe sobranie zakonov Rossiiskoi imperii.

This could also have been linked to Catherine II’s disapproval of lotteries.

<p><bold>Paul Keenan</bold> has taught at the London School of Economics and Political Science since 2004. His research examines the social and cultural development of Russia during the eighteenth century. He has written recently on the appearance, attitudes and social activities of the Russian court in this period. He is currently finishing a monograph on the creation and development of St Petersburg in the first half of the eighteenth century, with particular emphasis on the extent of Russia’s ‘Europeanization’ and the role of the ruler’s court in that process.</p>
