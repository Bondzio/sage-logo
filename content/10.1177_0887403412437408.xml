<abstract>
<p>Aaron Cicourel conducted research in the 1960s on youths processed by the juvenile justice system, including the referral stage. His work described complex relationships and influences that affected juvenile justice decision making. Juvenile court data from the state of Missouri are used to conduct a partial replication of Cicourel’s work, focusing on the referral stage. The present study also extends the literature by examining the influence of legal and extralegal factors on disposition decisions for five referral sources (i.e., Social Service, School, Family, Juvenile Court, and Law Enforcement). The results suggest that the referral source is related to sentence outcome. The findings are supportive of contemporary theory and highlight the importance of studying context, role responsibilities, and stereotypes that may develop out of human experiences and affect decision making at the referral and disposition stages.</p>

<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0887403412437408">Aaron Cicourel (1968)</xref> is perhaps best known for his ethnographic research that focused on how youths are processed by the juvenile justice system, starting with the initial referral decision. His work revealed, and meticulously described, complex relationships, interactions among individuals—justice system professionals, school officials, and social service professionals—and institutional forces that affect decision making. The decision to refer a child to the juvenile court is important because it initiates a formal justice system response that often results in a disposition. While considerable research has been conducted on sentencing disparities and factors that affect disposition decisions, surprisingly little research have been conducted since the 1960s specifically examining the relationship between the referral source and dispositions. This study is a partial replication of Cicourel’s work in light of more contemporary theoretical formulations, and it attempts to discern whether his findings are consistent with referral decisions made in the 21st century. This study also attempts to extend the literature by examining the influence of legal and extralegal factors on disposition decisions for five referral sources (i.e., Social Service, School, Family, Juvenile Court, and Law Enforcement).</p>

<title>Theoretical Underpinnings of Juvenile Justice Decision Making</title>
<p>From the perspective of traditional Marxian theory, the juvenile justice system imposes sanctions to maintain the status quo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0887403412437408">Chambliss, 1973</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0887403412437408">Chambliss &amp; Seidman, 1971</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0887403412437408">Leiber &amp; Fox, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-0887403412437408">Quinney, 1970</xref>). In other words, while police, prosecutors, and judges consider legal variables in their decision making, they also permit extralegal variables (e.g., socioeconomic status and race) to influence their decisions. On the other hand, from the Durkheimian perspective the juvenile justice system upholds the values that are shared by the majority members of society (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0887403412437408">Durkheim, 1933</xref>). Although these theoretical positions are in complete opposition with one another, a similarity exists between the two: the justice system is designed in a way that permits extralegal factors (e.g., race, sex, and SES) to influence decision making (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0887403412437408">Hagan, Hewitt, &amp; Alwin, 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0887403412437408">Leiber &amp; Fox, 2005</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0887403412437408">Hagan, Hewitt, and Alwin (1979)</xref> argue that a possible explanation for the conflicting and often contradictory findings regarding the factors that affect decision making is the failure to consider the influence of the organizational structure of the juvenile justice system and its related processes.</p>
<p>Contemporary research on juvenile court decision making has drawn primarily from focal concerns theory (and associated perspectives, such as attributional theory) and organizational theory. Focal concerns theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0887403412437408">Guevara, Herz, &amp; Spohn, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr86-0887403412437408">Steffensmeier, Ulmer, &amp; Kramer, 1998</xref>, p. 766) asserts that judges have three focal concerns when deciding how best to dispose of a case: “the youth’s blameworthiness and the degree of harm caused to the victim; protection of the community; and practical implications of sentencing decisions.” Therefore, according to this perspective, sentencing decisions are based on the perceived dangerousness and the culpability of children. How serious is the current offense? What is the likelihood of recidivism? To what extent should children be held responsible for their behavior?</p>
<p>Since the answers to such questions are rarely available, judges are thought to engage in what is referred to as the “perceptual shorthand” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr86-0887403412437408">Steffensmeier et al., 1998</xref>), which is based on stereotypes that develop over time from personal and professional experiences. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr86-0887403412437408">Steffensmeier and associates (1998</xref>, p. 768) contend that stereotypes allow judges to attribute demographic characteristics (e.g., race, sex, and age) to “. . . social groups thought to be dangerous and crime prone.” <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0887403412437408">Feld’s (1999)</xref> research echoes Steffensmeir and associates’ findings. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0887403412437408">Feld’s (1999)</xref> study found that at various stages in the juvenile justice process decision makers permit their stereotypes to affect their disposition decisions.</p>
<p>Attributional theory, proposed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0887403412437408">Bridges and Steen (1998)</xref>, asserts a similar scenario. That is, while judges certainly consider legal factors (e.g., offense seriousness and delinquent history) in sentencing decisions, they are also influenced by extralegal factors such as perceptions of juveniles’ attitudes and motivations based on race and sex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0887403412437408">Heider, 1958</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-0887403412437408">Rodriguez, 2007</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0887403412437408">Leiber’s (2003)</xref> research reported findings consistent with Bridges and Steen’s findings. Similarly, the patterned response approach suggests that decisions are based on personal life experiences and outside environmental sources (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0887403412437408">Caroll &amp; Payne, 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0887403412437408">Hawkins, 1980</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0887403412437408">Heider, 1958</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0887403412437408">March &amp; Simon, 1958</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr80-0887403412437408">Shaver, 1975</xref>). A study conducted by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0887403412437408">Fontaine &amp; Emily (1978)</xref> found that judges consider stereotypes that are based on their interactions with other youth in their decision making. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0887403412437408">Lippman’s (1922)</xref> research as well as subsequent studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0887403412437408">Carroll, 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr87-0887403412437408">Stephan, 1975</xref>) obtained similar results.</p>
<p>Research conducted by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0887403412437408">Bridges and Steen (1998)</xref> supports the influence of stereotypic beliefs on sentencing. These researchers analyzed predisposition reports and found that while probation officers were more likely to attribute delinquency to external causes (e.g., peer group influences or problems at school or home) for White juveniles, they attributed African American delinquency to internal characteristics (e.g., aggressive tendencies or lack of remorse). With these attributions, African Americans appear to be more dangerous and prone toward violence than White juveniles and, therefore, receive more punitive dispositions.</p>
<p>Organizational theory attempts to take the complexities of juvenile justice decision making into consideration. Some decision-making stages are relatively independent of the other and, within those stages, decisions are made with little or no regard for decisions that will be made by others later in the system. This is often the case because each stage has different goals, concerns, and issues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0887403412437408">Albonetti, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0887403412437408">Bishop &amp; Frazier, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0887403412437408">Bishop, Leiber, &amp; Johnson, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0887403412437408">Cicourel, 1968</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0887403412437408">Hagen, Hewitt, &amp; Alwin, 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0887403412437408">Meyer &amp; Rowan, 1977</xref>). And the people working at each stage carry out their roles with different expertise and within different contexts. In short, the stages and actors within each stage have different responsibilities, and their decisions reflect those responsibilities.</p>
<p>On the other hand, some of the stages in the juvenile justice process are so intertwined—that is, there are numerous parties involved in the decision-making process—that it becomes difficult to discern the relationships among factors included in decision making (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0887403412437408">Bishop et al., 2010</xref>). In such cases, the decision that is made is a compromise and tends to reflect the goals and perspectives of those participating in the decision (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0887403412437408">Bishop et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0887403412437408">Feely, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0887403412437408">Hagan, Hewitt, &amp; Alwin, 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-0887403412437408">Sanborn, 1995</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-0887403412437408">2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr83-0887403412437408">Singer, 1996</xref>).</p>
<p>To date, there has been little attention paid to understanding the complexities of and the decisions made by referral sources. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0887403412437408">Dannefer and Schutt (1982)</xref> contend that the referral decision is a complex process characterized by loose coupling. We might gain insight into the loose coupling concept by considering <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0887403412437408">Bishop et al.’s (2010)</xref> comments about loose coupling at the intake stage:<disp-quote>
<p>once a youth is arrested, police, court intake officers, assistant district attorneys, detention personnel, and—at least occasionally—school officials, social service providers, and victims provide input [at intake] . . . to release the juvenile without action, to refer him to a community-based diversion program for informal handling, or to recommend formal processing. (p. 217)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Similarly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0887403412437408">Bishop et al. (2010)</xref> suggest that the disposition decision, made principally by judges, involves influences by numerous other agencies, making the disposition a loose coupling stage in the juvenile justice process. Judges consider probation officer reports, police reports, reports provided by family, social welfare agencies, school officials, and victims (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0887403412437408">Bishop et al., 2010</xref>). Thus the sentencing outcome is based on more than a single judge’s decision. Consequently, the initial referral may affect, although indirectly, sentencing outcomes.</p>
<p>The juvenile justice system has two goals: to protect society from harm and act in the best interests of the child. These two goals create an environment in which different agencies and decision makers are often at odds with each other (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0887403412437408">Bishop et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0887403412437408">Feely, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-0887403412437408">Sanborn, 1995</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr83-0887403412437408">Singer, 1996</xref>). Although police officers are responsible for the vast majority of initial referrals to juvenile court, other agencies are often involved before cases are formally processed, such as school administrators, social welfare agencies, and probation officers just to name a few (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0887403412437408">Bishop et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0887403412437408">Bortner, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0887403412437408">Krezmien, Leone, Zablocki, &amp; Wells, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-0887403412437408">Rodriguez, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr82-0887403412437408">Siegel &amp; Halemba, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr92-0887403412437408">Zhang, Katsiyannis, Barrett, &amp; Wilson, 2007</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr83-0887403412437408">Singer (1996)</xref> aptly stated that how a case is processed in the system depends on a negotiation of sorts between multiple agencies. Should a youth be formally petitioned or diverted out of the system? Should a child be sent home with his or her parents? To make informed decisions in the “best interests of the child” and at the same time protecting society, multiple agencies are involved. But having multiple agencies involved in the process also increases the difficulty in determining what factors should be considered in the sentencing decision.</p>

<title>Literature Review</title>
<p>A review of the literature reveals that researchers have generally not paid much attention to the referral stage in juvenile court sentencing research. Some studies fail to even include the referral stage when examining juvenile court dispositions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0887403412437408">Krezmien et al., 2010</xref>) and instead focus on decisions made by prosecutors and judges. Other studies simply mention that police officers constitute the majority of the referrals in their sample, but no attempt is made to control for how all referral sources affect disposition decisions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0887403412437408">Bishop et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0887403412437408">Bortner, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0887403412437408">Krezmien et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-0887403412437408">Rodriguez, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr82-0887403412437408">Siegel &amp; Halemba, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr92-0887403412437408">Zhang et al., 2007</xref>). Still other studies take an approach similar to that used by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0887403412437408">Cicourel (1968)</xref> in his groundbreaking research on juvenile court referrals. And, while Cicourel’s approach is said to have shed considerable light on the importance of understanding juvenile court referrals, very little research has been conducted to replicate his findings.</p>
<p>Research has identified a number of different organizations involved in the processing of youthful offenders and it has revealed that organizational contexts have a direct impact on decision making (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0887403412437408">Bishop et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0887403412437408">Dale &amp; Schutt, 1982</xref>). Based on <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0887403412437408">Cicourel’s (1968)</xref> social organizational theory, every agency that may be involved in processing youthful offenders maintains different goals. While some organizations may be involved with the law enforcement side of dealing with youth, others are involved with the social welfare of youth. In addition, professionals working within these organizations have personal experiences that shape their perceptions and beliefs, and these help form stereotypic beliefs about the youths they come into contact with on a daily basis while performing their jobs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0887403412437408">Albonetti, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0887403412437408">Albonetti &amp; Hepburn, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0887403412437408">Bell &amp; Lang, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0887403412437408">Cicourel, 1968</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0887403412437408">Clegg &amp; Dunkerley, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0887403412437408">Emerson, 1969</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0887403412437408">1983</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0887403412437408">1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr89-0887403412437408">Sudnow, 1965</xref>).</p>
<p>Therefore, although police officers are more likely to consider legal factors in their decision making because their organizational role is to serve and protect a community, they may also consider extralegal factors (such as race, sex, or age) based on their experiences interacting with troubled youth. In a similar way, probation officers are influenced by their organizational roles. They are supposed to make sure that probationers carry out court orders and assist juveniles in changing their lives for the positive. Hence, their reports not only deal with offense severity but also include the social histories of children in their charge and why these children initially offended and recidivate.</p>
<p>Although research conducted by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0887403412437408">Krezmien et al. (2010)</xref> did not examine sentencing decisions, it did study whether the number of youth referred to juvenile court by schools increased following the enactment of the Gun Free Schools Act in 1994. In essence, the Gun Free Schools Act was intended to reduce the discretion of school officials by stipulating that schools would no longer receive funding if they failed to adopt a zero-tolerance policy for youth who brought weapons onto school grounds and required a minimum of 1 year school suspension for all violators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0887403412437408">Heaviside, Rowand, Williams, &amp; Farris, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0887403412437408">Krezmien et al., 2010</xref>). The results of the study revealed that not only did referrals for gun violations increase as a result of the Act but also referrals for even minor offenses increased as well. Furthermore, the No Child Left Behind Act that was reauthorized in 2001 placed additional pressure on school officials to crack down on disruptive behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0887403412437408">Anderson, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0887403412437408">Hirschfield, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0887403412437408">Krezmien, Leone, &amp; Achilles, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0887403412437408">Kupckik, 2009</xref>), which also contributed to an increase of referrals by schools to juvenile courts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0887403412437408">Krezmien et al., 2010</xref>).</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-0887403412437408">Rasmussen (2004)</xref> examined the role of referral agents in determining whether or not youthful offenders are processed within the teen court system as opposed to being processed in the formal juvenile court system. His findings suggested that police officers, state’s attorneys, and municipal attorney’s consider different factors in determining whether or not to refer youthful offenders to teen court. Whereas police officers tend to focus their decision making solely on offense severity (referring only misdemeanor cases), states and municipal attorneys consider other offense and offender-related characteristics. For example, state and municipal attorneys consider the familial background of offenders and are more willing to refer offenders who commit more serious offenses (i.e., low-level felonies) to teen courts rather than the more formal juvenile court system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-0887403412437408">Rasmussen, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>There appear to be a number of individual-level factors that affect the disposition decision regardless of the referral source. Even when controlling for the type of crime committed or prior record, sentence severity typically increases in cases where youthful offenders are racial/ethnic minorities and male (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0887403412437408">Bailey &amp; Peterson, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0887403412437408">Bishop, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0887403412437408">Bishop, Frazier, &amp; Henretta, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0887403412437408">Bortner &amp; Reed, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0887403412437408">Champion &amp; Mays, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0887403412437408">Demuth &amp; Steffensmeier, 2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr84-0887403412437408">Steffensmeier &amp; Demuth, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0887403412437408">Edwards, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0887403412437408">Fagan &amp; Deschenes, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0887403412437408">Fagan, Forst &amp; Vivona, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0887403412437408">Fagan, Slaughter &amp; Hartstone, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0887403412437408">Guevara et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0887403412437408">Horwitz &amp; Wasserman, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0887403412437408">Johnson &amp; Scheubles, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0887403412437408">Leiber &amp; Fox, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-0887403412437408">Nagel &amp; Hagan, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-0887403412437408">Osbun &amp; Rode, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-0887403412437408">Rodgiguez, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr85-0887403412437408">Steffensmeier et al., 1993</xref>).

<title>The Present Study</title>
<sec id="section4-0887403412437408">
<title>Methodological and Empirical Specifications</title>
<p>We obtained juvenile court data for Missouri from the Missouri Department of Social Services. The data reflect court activities for the year 2000. This study includes only those cases that were formally processed in juvenile court. There are five referral agencies: School, Social Services, Juvenile Court, Family, and Law Enforcement. The dispositions we examined are out-of-home placements (OHP; which include placements to the Division of Youth Services, Foster Care, or a relative), probation with services (PwS), and informal adjustments with services (IAwS). These sanctions serve as the dependent variables.</p>
<p>The dependent variable was recoded into three dichotomous variables. Because the dependent variables are dichotomous, logistic regression was used as the statistical procedure. Logistic regression estimates the likelihood that an event will occur (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0887403412437408">Aldrich &amp; Nelson, 1984</xref>). The probability of an event occurring (coded 1) is always in reference to another event (coded 0).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0887403412437408">1</xref></sup> Three comparisons are made using logistic regression: OHP (1) is compared with PwS (0); OHP (1) is compared with IAwS (0); and PwS (1) is compared with IAwS (0). The OHP versus PwS is the only dependent variable examined in this article in which the dispositions are both formal juvenile court dispositions in response to delinquency. OHP versus IAwS and PwS versus IAwS involve formal juvenile court dispositions compared with informal adjustments. Along a continuum, OHP is the most intrusive and restrictive sentence outcome. Compared with OHP, PwS is a relatively less intrusive and restrictive sentence outcome. The level of restrictiveness would of course depend on the conditions of the probation sentence. IAwS is the least intrusive and restrictive disposition.</p>
<p>There were 25,580 cases formally processed in 2000 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0887403412437408">Table 1</xref>). There were 8,168 cases (31.9%) that received an OHP; 6,992 cases (27.3%) received a PwS; and 10,819 cases (42.3%) received an IAwS. About two thirds (66.9%) of School referrals resulted in IAwS, 22% were placed on PwS, and about 11% received an OHP. Most (78.7%) Social Service referrals resulted in an OHP. Only about 6% of Social Service referrals received an IAwS and 15% were placed on PwS. Juvenile Court referrals were fairly evenly distributed across the three dispositions: 37% were given an OHP, 39% were placed on PwS, and 24% received an IAwS. While more than half (54.3%) of Family referrals were dealt with through IAwS, 31% were sentenced to an OHP and 15% were placed on PwS. About one in five (17.8%) Law Enforcement referrals were sentenced to an OHP and the others were placed on PwS (30%) or disposed of with an IAwS (52%).</p>

<p>The independent variables and the coding scheme are found in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0887403412437408">Table 2</xref>. Race, sex, offense, most serious offense, drug/alcohol use, and pretrial detention are dichotomously coded. Age, number of delinquent offenses, number of status offenses, number of prior delinquent and status offenses, number of reported incidents of child abuse are intervally scaled. To assess multicollinearity, two statistical tests were performed. First, a tolerance test was used to determine the extent to which independent variables are linearly related to each other. The values produced by a tolerance test are proportions of variance not accounted for by other independent variables (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-0887403412437408">Neter, Kutner, Nachtsheim, &amp; Wasserman, 1996</xref>). When tolerance scores approach 1 it is interpreted to mean that there is a low correlation between independent variables. In the present study, the tolerance scores are considered highly satisfactory, with values ranging from 0.478 to 0.976. Second, we performed a variance inflation factor (VIF) test. VIF scores larger than 10 are considered to be an indication of multicollinearity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-0887403412437408">Neter et al., 1996</xref>). VIF scores ranged from 1.024 to 2.012. The tolerance and VIF scores suggest that multicollinearity is not a concern.</p>

<p>To assess the fit of each logistic regression model, we use the Nagelkerke statistic. The Nagelkerke pseudo <italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> is an estimate of the validity of logistic regression models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-0887403412437408">Meyers, Glenn, &amp; Guarino, 2006</xref>). As such, it is used to determine the percentage of the variance in the dependent variable explained by the independent variables.</p>
<p>As can be seen in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0887403412437408">Table 2</xref>, within each type of referral source, most juveniles (73.2%) are White. Schools referred the most Whites (87.1%) and Juvenile Court referred the least (58.2%). About two thirds of all referrals are male. Law Enforcement refers the most males (71.8%) and Social Services refer the least (50.5%). The average age of all referrals is 12.8. Law Enforcement refers the oldest (14.4) and Social Services referrals are the youngest (7.9).</p>
<p>Offense is the variable that shows the legal reason for which juveniles came into contact with juvenile court. More than three fourths (77.7%) of referrals were for delinquent acts, but when referral sources are examined a very different picture is revealed. For example, only about one third of referrals faced delinquency charges when they were referred by Schools (32%) and the Families (33.9%). On the other end of the spectrum, nearly all of the referrals from Social Services (96.6%) were for delinquent acts and somewhat less, were referred to juvenile court by Law Enforcement (82.6%).</p>
<p>The average number of charges associated with coming into contact with juvenile court is found in the Total Delinquent Offense and Total Status Offense variables. There is considerable variability when these variables are compared across referral source. Overall, juveniles faced an average of .77 delinquency charges and .29 status offense charges. Law Enforcement referrals had the greatest contrast with an average of 1.17 delinquency charges and .21 status offense charges. Social Service referrals were almost equally likely to face delinquency or status offense charges with an average of .09 delinquency charges and .06 status offense charges. School and Family referrals had larger average status offense charges (.87 and .85, respectively) than delinquency charges (.30 and .27, respectively).</p>
<p>Children referred to juvenile court had nearly twice the number of prior delinquency offenses (1.88) as status offenses (1.08). Similarly, Law Enforcement referrals had about twice the average number of prior delinquency offenses (2.22) as prior status offenses (1.00). Juvenile Court referrals were similar in that they also had more prior delinquency (3.01) than status offenses (1.78). Social Services made referrals involving children who had similar amounts of prior delinquent and status offenses (.38 vs .33, respectively). School and Family referrals are similar in that the children they refer to juvenile court had slightly more prior status offenses than prior delinquent offenses. School referrals had averages slightly higher for prior status offenses (1.89) than prior delinquent offenses (1.73). Likewise, Family referrals had a higher prior status offense average (1.54) than prior delinquent offense average (1.23).</p>
<p>Reported incidents of Child Abuse/Neglect provide further insight into the histories of juveniles who were formally processed in 2000. This variable reflects the average number of times for which there were formal reports that juveniles were victims of abuse or neglect. The average number of Abuse/Neglect cases was .31. Law Enforcement and School referrals had similar numbers of reported abuse/neglect cases (.21 vs. .22, respectively). Conversely, Social Service and Juvenile Court referrals were at least twice as likely to have histories of abuse/neglect (.58 and .44, respectively).</p>
<p>The Drug/Alcohol Use variable reports whether a juvenile has a history of drug or alcohol use. Data suggest that the percentage of juveniles who have a record of drug or alcohol use are uniformly large, and fairly consistent across referral sources, ranging from 82.2% for Law Enforcement referrals to 91.5% for Juvenile Court referrals to 97.5% for Social Service referrals. Pretrial Detention reflects whether a juvenile was placed in detention prior to adjudication for the present offense. Most juveniles, across all placements, were not detained prior to adjudication. Overall, 13.6% of referrals were detained prior to adjudication. Percentages ranged widely with only 2.1% of Social Service referrals placed in detention to 21.4% of Juvenile Court referrals placed in detention.</p>

<title>OHP Versus PwS</title>
<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0887403412437408">Table 3</xref> has logistic regression models for each referral source. These models show how independent variables influenced the decision to place juveniles out of home (OHP) versus placing juveniles on probation with services (PwS). The Nagelkerke pseudo <italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> statistic is small and relatively consistent across the models. The percentage of variance explained in our dependent variable ranges from a low of 3.1% for the Juvenile Court referral model to a high of 13% for the Social Service referral model. A survey of the five models in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0887403412437408">Table 3</xref> shows considerable differences among the factors that affected the decision to sentence juveniles to an OHP instead of PwS. For Social Service referrals, Whites (<italic>B</italic> = 1.588, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001) are 4.89 times more likely than Non-Whites to receive an OHP. As the number of delinquent charges decrease (Total Delinquent Offense, <italic>B</italic> = −.681, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001), the likelihood that juveniles will receive an OHP nearly doubles (1.97). And, those placed in detention prior to adjudication (Pretrial Detention, <italic>B</italic> = 1.233, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05) are 3.43 times more likely to be given an OHP.</p>

<p>The variables that affected an OHP when School is the referral source are somewhat different than what was found when Social Services referred children to court. Like the Social Service model, Race and Pretrial Detention affected the disposition imposed. Whites (<italic>B</italic> = .889, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01) and those placed in Pretrial Detention (<italic>B</italic> = .735, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05) are about twice as likely (2.43 and 2.08, respectively) to be sentenced to an OHP than their counterparts. The Sex of the child among School referrals also affected the disposition. Males (<italic>B</italic> = .527, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05) are 1.69 times more likely than females to receive an OHP.</p>
<p>Four variables affected the disposition decision when Juvenile Court is the referral agency: Race (<italic>B</italic> = .242, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05), Total Status Offense (<italic>B</italic> = −.360, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01), Prior Delinquent Offense (<italic>B</italic> = .088, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001), and History of Abuse/Neglect (<italic>B</italic> = .169, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01). Whites are slightly more likely (1.27) than Non-Whites to receive an OHP. The same is true for those with fewer Total Status Offenses (1.43), those with more Prior Delinquent Offenses (1.09), and those with more extensive Histories of Abuse/Neglect (1.18).</p>
<p>When Family is the referral agency, there are four variables that affect the decision to make an OHP. Like the Juvenile Court, the Race (<italic>B</italic> = .600, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05) of the juvenile affects the disposition decision but that is the only similarity. Also influential to the OHP decision are type of Offense (<italic>B</italic> = .786, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05), Total Delinquent Offense (<italic>B</italic> = −1.048, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001), and Prior Status Offense (−.113, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05). White youth are nearly twice as likely (1.82) as Non-White juveniles to be placed out of home. Those facing a Delinquency Offense are 2.19 times more likely than those facing a Status Offense to be sentenced to an OHP. The likelihood of an OHP increased by 2.85 as the number of Total Delinquency Offenses decreased. Likewise, the likelihood of an OHP increases slightly (1.12) for each unit decrease in Prior Status Offenses.</p>
<p>Law Enforcement referrals appear to be the most dynamic of all referrals ending in an OHP. Seven variables affected the OHP decision: Sex (<italic>B</italic> = −.181, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05), Age (<italic>B</italic> = −.087, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001), Total Delinquent Offense (<italic>B</italic> = −.176, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001), Prior Delinquent Offense (<italic>B</italic> = .029, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001), Prior Status Offense (<italic>B</italic> = .044, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01), Pretrial Detention (<italic>B</italic> = .822, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001), and History of Abuse/Neglect (<italic>B</italic> = .206, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001). Females are slightly more likely (1.20) than males to be sentenced to an OHP. Younger juveniles are more likely (1.09) to receive an OHP. Juveniles with fewer Delinquency Offenses are somewhat more likely (1.19) than those with more charges to be placed out of home. As the number of Prior Delinquent Offenses and Prior Status Offenses increase, so does the likelihood (1.03 and 1.04, respectively) of receiving an OHP. Those who were placed in Pretrial Detention were more than twice as likely (2.27) as those without Pretrial Detention to be placed out of home. A History of Abuse/Neglect made it nearly three times more likely (2.91) to receive an OHP than those without such a history.</p>
<p>It is noteworthy to mention that Race predicted OHPs in all models except for Law Enforcement referrals. Sex predicted OHP in the School and Law Enforcement models. Age was a significant predictor of a sentence outcome in only the Law Enforcement referral model. The Total Delinquent Offense variable, reflecting the number of charges, was significant in the Social Service, Family, and Law Enforcement referral models. And Pretrial Detention predicted OHP in the Social Service, School, and Law Enforcement referral models.</p>

<p>For Social Service referrals, Race (<italic>B</italic> = − 1.158, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001), Offense (<italic>B</italic> = 2.432, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001), Total Delinquent Offense (<italic>B</italic> = −1.181, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001), Prior Status Offense (<italic>B</italic> = −.151, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001), and Pretrial Detention (<italic>B</italic> = 1.788, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01) are statistically significant. Non-Whites are 3.18 times more likely than Whites to receive an OHP instead of IAwS. Those facing delinquency charges are 11.38 times more likely to be placed in an OHP compared with those facing status offense charges. As Total Delinquent Offenses decreases, the likelihood of an OHP increases by 3.26. Likewise, there is a slight increase (1.16) in the likelihood of an OHP as the number of Prior Status Offenses decrease. And, those who are placed in Pretrial Detention are 5.98 times more likely to be placed out of home than those who are not detained.</p>
<p>For School referrals, there are seven variables that predicted OHP: Offense, Total Delinquent Offense, Prior Delinquent Offense, Prior Status Offense, Pretrial Detention, Drug/Alcohol Use, and History of Abuse/Neglect. Juveniles facing delinquency charges are 6.65 times more likely than those facing status offenses to be placed out of home. As the Total Delinquent offense decreases, there is a 3.97 times greater likelihood of an OHP. Conversely, as the number of Prior Delinquent Offenses and Prior Status Offenses increases, there is a marginally greater likelihood of an OHP (1.13 and 1.07, respectively). Similarly, juveniles who have Histories of Abuse/Neglect are slightly more likely (1.26) to receive an OHP. Those with histories of Drug/Alcohol use are twice as likely (2.24) to be placed out of home. Finally, Pretrial Detention most strongly predicts an OHP. Those with a Pretrial Detention are nearly 12 (11.88) times more likely than without it to be placed out of home.</p>
<p>All three demographic variables—Sex (<italic>B</italic> = −.407, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01), Race (<italic>B</italic> = −.928, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001), and Age (<italic>B</italic> = −.203, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001)—are predictors of OHP for Juvenile Court referrals. Females are 1.5 times more likely than males to be placed out of home. Younger juveniles are more likely (1.22 than older juveniles to receive an OHP. And, Non-Whites are 2.53 times more likely to be placed out of home. The Total Delinquent Offense and Total Status Offense are about as equally likely to predict an OHP (1.65 and 1.61, respectively). Likewise, those with Prior Delinquent Offenses and Prior Status Offenses are more likely to receive an OHP (1.16 and 1.11, respectively). Juveniles with Pretrial Detention are 4.63 times more likely to be placed out of home.</p>
<p>Family referrals are more likely to result in OHPs when juveniles face delinquency charges (Offense, <italic>B</italic> = 3.485, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001); when juveniles face fewer Total Delinquent Offenses (<italic>B</italic> = − 2.364, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001); have more Prior Delinquent Offenses (<italic>B</italic> = .199, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001); and have served time in detention prior to adjudication (Pretrial Detention, <italic>B</italic> = 1.533, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001). Juveniles with delinquency charges are 32.62 times more likely to receive an OHP. Fewer delinquency charges resulted in a tenfold (10.63) increase in the likelihood of an OHP. Prior Delinquent Offenses made it somewhat more likely (1.22) for an OHP. And juveniles with Pretrial Detention are 5.34 times more likely to receive an OHP.</p>
<p>Nine of the 11 independent variables predicted OHP for Law Enforcement referrals. Non-Whites (Race, <italic>B</italic> = −.631, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001) and younger juveniles (Age, <italic>B</italic> = −.188, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001) are more likely than Whites and older juveniles (1.88 and 1.21, respectively) to receive an OHP. Juveniles who face Delinquency charges (Offense, <italic>B</italic> = 1.007, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001) are 2.74 times more likely to be placed out of home. Those with fewer Total Delinquent Offenses (<italic>B</italic> = −.203, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001) are more likely to receive an OHP. Prior Delinquent Offense (<italic>B</italic> = .122, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001) and Prior Status Offense (<italic>B</italic> = .077, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001) marginally increase the likelihood (1.13 and 1.08, respectively) of an OHP. Those with Pretrial Detention (<italic>B</italic> = 2.315, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001) are 10.12 times more likely to be placed out of home. Those with histories of Drug/Alcohol Use (<italic>B</italic> = .310, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01) and Abuse/Neglect (<italic>B</italic> = .205, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001) are 1.36 and 1.23 (respectively) times more likely to be placed out of home.</p>
<p>The factors that affect the decision to make an OHP rather than IAwS appear to have some consistency across the referral source. For example, the Total Delinquent Offense and Pretrial Detention variables are statistically significant for all referral sources. The type of Offense (Delinquent vs. Status) affects the OHP decision in four of the five referral models: the Social Service, Family, School, and Law Enforcement models. The Prior Delinquent Offense variable affects the sentence decision in four out of five referral models: the Family, School, Juvenile Court, and Law Enforcement models. And the Prior Status Offense variable affects the OHP decision in the Social Service, School, Juvenile Court, and Law Enforcement models.</p>
<p>It is worth noting here that Sex was a significant predictor in only one model, Juvenile Court. Race was statistically significant in the Social Service, Juvenile Court, and Law Enforcement models. Age predicted the sentence outcome in the Juvenile Court and Law Enforcement models.</p>
<p>A review of significant predictors in each model reveals that Social Service, Family, and School are similar. For all of those referral sources Offense, Total Delinquent Offense, and Pretrial Detention predict an OHP. The Social Service referral model is the only one in which Race is a significant predictor of sentence outcome. Sex and Age are not significant predictors of OHP for the referrals coming from Social Service, Family, and School. The variables that predicted OHP were similar for referrals coming from the Juvenile Court and Law Enforcement. There are a number of variables that are significant for both referral sources (Juvenile Court and Law Enforcement): Race, Age, Total Delinquent Offense, Prior Delinquent Offense, Prior Status Offense, and Pretrial Detention.</p>

<p>For Social Service referrals there are five variables that predict a PwS sentence: Race (<italic>B</italic> = − 2.822, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001), Offense (<italic>B</italic> = 3.087, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001), Total Delinquent Offense (<italic>B</italic> = −.568, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05), Total Status Offense (<italic>B</italic> = .735, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05), and Prior Status Offense (<italic>B</italic> = −.306, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001). Non-Whites are nearly 17 times (16.81) more likely than Whites to be placed on PwS instead of receiving an IAwS. Juveniles facing charges for delinquent acts are about 22 times (21.91) more likely than those facing status offense charges to be placed on PwS. Fewer Total Delinquent Offenses and more Total Status Offenses double (1.76 and 2.08, respectively) the chances of receiving a PwS sentence. Fewer Prior Status Offenses also increases the likelihood (1.36) of a PwS sentence.</p>
<p>Referrals from the Family are in some ways similar to referrals from Social Service agencies. For example, like Social Service referrals, Race (<italic>B</italic> = −.591, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05), Offense (<italic>B</italic> = 2.891, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001), and Total Delinquent Offense (<italic>B</italic> = − 1.418, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001) predict PwS. Non-Whites are about 2 times more likely than Whites to receive a PwS sentence. Those facing delinquency charges are 18.01 times more likely to be placed on PwS. Fewer Total Delinquent Offenses increase the likelihood (by 4.13) that juveniles receive a PwS sentence. Family referrals are also different from Social Service referrals. For example, having a Prior Delinquent Offense history (<italic>B</italic> = .154, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01) and having been placed in Pretrial Detention (<italic>B</italic> = 1.236, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 001) makes it more likely (1.17 and 3.44, respectively) that a juvenile will receive a PwS sentence.</p>
<p>There are a total of eight predictors of sentence outcome among the School referrals. These are Sex (<italic>B</italic> = −.354, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05), Race (<italic>B</italic> = −.463, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05), Offense (<italic>B</italic> = 1.332, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001), Total Delinquent Offense (<italic>B</italic> = − 1.032, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001), Total Status Offense (<italic>B</italic> = .062, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05), Prior Delinquent Offense (<italic>B</italic> = .106, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001), Prior Status Offense (<italic>B</italic> = .062, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 05), and Pretrial Detention (<italic>B</italic> = 1.689, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001). Females are 1.42 times more likely than males and Non-Whites are 1.59 times more likely than Whites to be placed on PwS. Juveniles facing delinquency charges are 3.79 times more likely to be sentenced to PwS than those charged with status offenses. Those with fewer Total Delinquent Offenses are 2.81 times more likely than those with a greater number of Total Delinquent Offenses to be sentenced to PwS; those with more Total Status Offenses are more likely (1.06) to receive PwS sentences. Prior Delinquent Offenses and Prior Status Offenses increase the likelihood of probation with services by 1.11 and 1.06, respectively. Juveniles who have been detained pretrial are 5.41 times more likely to receive a PwS.</p>
<p>Regarding Juvenile Court referrals, Sex (<italic>B</italic> = −.356, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05), Race (<italic>B</italic> = − 1.067, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001), and Age (<italic>B</italic> = −.202, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001) predict PwS sentences. Females are 1.43 times more likely than males, Non-Whites are 2.91 times more likely than Whites, and younger juveniles are more likely (1.22) than older juveniles to receive PwS sentences. Those facing delinquency charges (Offense, <italic>B</italic> = .737, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001) are 2.09 times more likely to be placed on PwS and those with fewer Total Delinquent Offenses (<italic>B</italic> = −.500, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001) are 1.65 times more likely to be placed on PwS. More Prior Delinquent Offense history (<italic>B</italic> = .075, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01) and less Prior Status Offense history (<italic>B</italic> = −.110, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001) increase the likelihood of PwS sentences by 1.08 and 1.12, respectively. Juveniles with Pretrial Detention are nearly 4 times (3.93) more likely to be placed on PwS and those with Drug/Alcohol use histories are 2.81 times more likely to be placed on PwS.</p>
<p>Law Enforcement referrals have the same nine variables as Juvenile Court referrals that predict PwS sentences: Sex, Race, Age, Offense, Total Delinquent Offense, Prior Delinquent Offense, Prior Status Offense, Pretrial Detention, and history of Drug/Alcohol Use. Yet, there are some differences. For example, while females referred by the Juvenile Court are more likely to receive PwS sentences, it is males (Sex, <italic>B</italic> = .174, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01) referred by Law Enforcement who are more likely (1.19) to be placed on PwS. Non-Whites are twice (2.05) as likely as Whites to receive PwS sentences (Race, <italic>B</italic> = −.716, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001). Younger juveniles are more likely (1.09) than older juveniles to receive PwS sentences (Age, <italic>B</italic> = −.089, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001). Delinquents are nearly twice as likely (1.94) as status offenders to be placed on PwS (Offense, <italic>B</italic> = .664, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001).</p>
<p>Youth who a larger number of Total Delinquent Offenses (<italic>B</italic> = .224, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001), have Prior Delinquent Offenses (<italic>B</italic> = .099, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001) and Prior Status Offenses (Prior Status, <italic>B</italic> = .055, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001) have an increase in the likelihood of receiving a PwS sentence by 1.25, 1.10, and 1.06, respectively. Those youth with Drug/Alcohol Use histories (<italic>B</italic> = .334, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001) are almost as likely to receive a PwS sentence as those facing delinquency charges, raising the chances for a PwS sentence by 1.40. Youth held in Pretrial Detention (<italic>B</italic> = 1.494, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001) are 4.45 times more likely than those who are not held in Pretrial Detention to receive PwS sentences.</p>

<title>Discussion and Conclusions</title>
<p>The referral source appears to be related to sentence outcome, and the findings are generally supportive of focal concerns and organizational theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0887403412437408">Bishop et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0887403412437408">Hagan, Hewitt, &amp; Alwin, 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0887403412437408">Leiber &amp; Fox, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr86-0887403412437408">Steffensmeier et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr92-0887403412437408">Zhang et al., 2007</xref>). The comparison between OHP and PwS yields somewhat predictable findings. According to both focal concerns perspective and organizational theory, one would expect to find that law enforcement primarily considers legal factors, and those factors ultimately affect the sentence outcome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0887403412437408">Bishop et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0887403412437408">Cicourel, 1968</xref>).</p>
<p>Given that the purposes of policing are to serve and protect, it is not surprising to see that Age, Total Delinquent Offense, Prior Delinquent Offense, Prior Status Offense, and History of Abuse/Neglect affect the sentencing outcome. Furthermore, according to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0887403412437408">Cicourel’s (1968)</xref> research, the factors that police consider are likely to be different when compared to “Social Work” or Non–Law Enforcement type agencies. His research showed that police focus on legal factors in their decision making (e.g., seriousness of the offense); however, their daily interactions with what they defined as “troubled youth” color their decisions. In other words, if police have more frequent negative interactions with Non-White youth, they are more likely to believe that Non-White youth are in fact troublemakers, and, therefore, need to be referred for formal processing in juvenile court.</p>
<p>On the other hand, at the disposition stage, there are multiple agencies involved in the decision-making process that <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0887403412437408">Bishop et al. (2010)</xref> defines as loose coupling. And, based on the loose coupling perspective, the findings are as expected. The results suggest that judges consider who is referring the child to juvenile court when they impose sentencing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0887403412437408">Bishop et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0887403412437408">Hagan, Hewitt, &amp; Alwin, 1979</xref>). This seems plausible because when juvenile court judges impose the disposition, they consider reports from a multitude of sources in an attempt to respond in the best interests of the child (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0887403412437408">Cicourel, 1968</xref>) and the protection of society.</p>
<p>Our results also indicate that judges considered legal variables (Total Number of Status Offenses, Prior Number of Delinquent Offenses, and History of Abuse/Neglect) as well as extralegal factors (Race) in their decision making. Unlike previous studies (see, for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0887403412437408">Bridge &amp; Steen, 1998</xref>), White youth are more likely than Non-White youth to receive an OHP. The stereotypic belief that Non-Whites are more dangerous than Whites and, therefore, receive more punitive dispositions is not supported by this particular referral model. On the other hand, according to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0887403412437408">Cicourel’s (1968)</xref> organizational theory, judges perceive that one of their goals is to ensure that dispositions are reflective of a youth’s entire history, not just the type of offense committed or the Race or Sex of children. Perhaps judges’ stereotypes of White youth represented in this study, is that they are the individuals who need the most intrusive form of intervention, OHP. But, this is mere speculation and points to a limitation of this study. We do not know what decision makers were thinking at the time, and we do not have access to the types of reports that Cicourel reviewed for his ethnographic study.</p>
<p>In the Law Enforcement referral model, females are more likely than males to be placed out of home. This finding is consistent with research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0887403412437408">Chesney-Lind, 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0887403412437408">Chesney-Lind &amp; Sheldon, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0887403412437408">Davis, 2007</xref>) that shows that females sometimes receive more punitive dispositions than male youthful offenders. Another important finding is that youth today do not appear to be given as many “second chances.” With the exception of referrals by Law Enforcement, youths with fewer status and fewer delinquent offenses are more likely to receive OHP than PwS. However, one needs to keep in mind that Cicourel’s work was conducted in the 1960s when society was more tolerant of youth compared to the get tough attitude that began in the 1980s. Furthermore, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0887403412437408">Cicourel’s (1968)</xref> research suggests that the reason for these particular differences is because law enforcement agents have become even more “law and order”–oriented, resulting in an increase in arrests and referrals for formal processing in the juvenile court system. An alternative interpretation to this may be that juvenile courts are intervening earlier in an attempt to address problems that are associated with persistent delinquent behavior patterns.</p>
<p>Similarly, age does not seem to play as an important a role in determining the sentence severity today as compared to the 1960s. Younger juveniles are more likely to receive OHP. This finding may reflect the practices of a less tolerant juvenile justice system or perhaps a system that attempts to intervene earlier in a child’s life. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0887403412437408">Cicourel (1968)</xref> also points out that the nature, structure, and goals of the justice system and the parties involved in the system change over time. Hence the practices of today may be reflective of more punitive attitudes toward youthful offenders.</p>
<p>Referrals from Social Services, Schools, and Families also relied on legal and extralegal variables, but the variables related to the disposition are different than those that predicted OHP for Juvenile Court and Law Enforcement referrals. For example, Pretrial Detention is the only legal variable that predicted OHP for School referrals. Race and Sex were the only other variables that predicted the disposition. For Family referrals, delinquent charges (Offense and Total Delinquent Offense) and Prior Status offense were the legal variables that predicted sentence outcome. The Race of the child was also a predictor of OHP for Family referrals. A possible explanation for this particular finding may be found in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0887403412437408">Cicourels’ (1968)</xref> assertion that law enforcement agents and other professionals such as probation officers and school officials frequently hold a stereotypic belief that Non-White families provide less stability and are therefore less likely to ensure that delinquent behaviors will desist. This may explain why we found that Non-White youth referred by Families are more likely than White youth to receive OHP sentences.</p>
<p>Finally, the number of delinquent charges (Total Delinquent Offense), Pretrial Detention, and Race predicted OHP for Social Service referrals. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0887403412437408">Cicourel’s research (1968)</xref> demonstrated that based on organizational theory, different agencies focus on different factors in their decision making. Focal concerns perspective echoes this argument (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr86-0887403412437408">Steffensmeier et al., 1998</xref>). Hence referrals from Schools, Social Services, and Families present a different configuration of factors in decision making when compared to youths referred by Law Enforcement and Juvenile Court.</p>
<p>When the sentence decision involved OHP versus IAwS, a different picture emerged: extralegal factors became more predictive of OHP among Law Enforcement and Juvenile Court referrals and legal factors became more common among Social Service, School, and Family referrals. For example, regarding extralegal variables, Race predicted OHP for Social Service referrals. No extralegal variable was related to OHP for the School and Family referrals. Race and Sex predicted OHP for Juvenile Court referrals and Race predicted OHP for Law Enforcement referrals. Legal variables played important roles in the decision to place children out of their homes for all referrals.</p>
<p>Many of the variables are relatively consistent across all of the referral models. Offense, Total Delinquent Offense, Total Status Offense, Prior Delinquent Offense, Prior Status Offense, and Pretrial Detention are related to OHP in at least 4 of the 5 referral models. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0887403412437408">Cicourel (1968)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0887403412437408">Hagan et al., 1979</xref>) posits that the results are reflective of the loose coupling of judicial decision making. But it appears that the disposition decision is made different somehow when the two possible sentences involved are at different ends of the spectrum—one being restrictive (OHP) and the other being informal (IAwS). Given the extreme difference between the severity of dispositions, it appears that judges consider reports from all relevant parties related to the involved youth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0887403412437408">Hagan et al., 1979</xref>).</p>
<p>When the sentence decision involved PwS or IAwS, the variables related to the disposition decision are similar to those found in the OHP versus IAwS models. There is one important exception: while Race predicted OHP from three referral sources (i.e., Social Service, Juvenile Court, and Law Enforcement), Race predicted the placement on PwS in all of the referral models. In addition, while Sex predicted OHP for Juvenile Court referrals, Sex predicted PwS for the School, Juvenile Court, and Law Enforcement referrals. Age predicted the disposition decision for Juvenile Court and Law Enforcement referrals for both the OHP (vs. IAwS) and PwS (vs. IAwS) models. As for the legal variable that predicted PwS, the Juvenile Court and Law Enforcement referrals are precisely the same. Although judges view it as their responsibility to try to impose dispositions that are in the best interests of children, judges are still closely connected to law enforcement. Judges work with law enforcement on a daily basis and they may come to accept the same viewpoints (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0887403412437408">Cicourel, 1968</xref>).</p>
<p>Offense, Total Delinquent Offense, Prior Delinquent Offense, Prior Status Offense, Pretrial Detention, and Drug/Alcohol Use predicted placement on PwS over IAwS. Six legal variables (Offense, Total Delinquent Offense, Total Status Offense, Prior Delinquent Offense, Prior Status Offense, and Pretrial Detention) predicted PwS sentences for School referrals. Both current offenses and prior records are related to PwS sentences for Social Service and Family referrals. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0887403412437408">Cicourel (1968)</xref>, school officials see their purpose simply as educating children in a safe and secure environment. Furthermore, more current research suggests that schools are more likely to refer youth for formal processing in juvenile court than in prior years as they view truancy as one of the most serious problems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0887403412437408">Baker, Sigmon, &amp; Nugent, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0887403412437408">Heaviside et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0887403412437408">Krezmien et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0887403412437408">Lehr, Sinclair, &amp; Christenson, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr88-0887403412437408">Stover, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr92-0887403412437408">Zhang et al., 2007</xref>). Therefore, school officials are likely to refer youth who have committed serious offenses or have prior delinquent histories.</p>
<p>Similarly, families try to provide a safe and nurturing environment for their children. But this may sometimes mean that parents refer their children for formal processing as a method to restore control over their children (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0887403412437408">Davis, 2007</xref>). Hence the severity of the current offense and the number of prior offenses are factors that affect sentencing decisions when the referral source is the family.</p>
<p>This study highlights the importance of studying context, role responsibilities, and stereotypes that may develop out of human experiences and affect decision making at the referral and disposition stages. Who makes the referrals—Social Services, Schools, Family members, Law Enforcement, or Juvenile Court personnel—appears to influence disposition decisions. Both legal and extralegal variables play a part in most sentencing decisions, but the roles they play are related to the referral sources. Additional research is needed to examine the structure (loose and tight coupling) of juvenile justice decisions. Future research on referrals may also examine how cases that are formally processed differ from those that are not processed through the juvenile court.</p>

<p>Likelihood ratios were calculated by hand. Likelihood ratios are the antilog of odds ratios (e2.13) and are useful for purposes of data interpretation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0887403412437408">Aldrich &amp; Nelson, 1984</xref>). A predictor variable, say sex, may be interpreted in the following manner: Males are “x” times more likely than females to be sentenced to an OHP. For interval variables like age or prior delinquent histories, likelihood ratios tell us the extent to which a unit change (e.g., a year in age or one or two prior illegal acts) affects an increase or decrease in the likelihood of a particular disposition. For example, a likelihood ratio calculated from a positive coefficient for age may be interpreted in the following way: For a unit increase in age (say from 12 to 13 years old) the likelihood of an OHP increases by “x.”</p></fn>
