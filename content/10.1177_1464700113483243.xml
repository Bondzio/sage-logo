<abstract>
<p>This article describes the use of idealised women's bodies as avatars of national identity and morality in early twentieth century Venezuela, as evidenced in works of classic literature from the period 1929–1949. Referencing two of Venezuela's most prominent authors, Teresa de la Parra and Antonia Palacios, the article describes how young girls in Venezuela in the first half of the twentieth century were enculturated to pursue ‘white’ ideals of beauty perceived as morally superior. Using the examples of Parra's semi-autobiographical novel <italic>Memorias de Mamá Blanca</italic> and Palacios’ similarly autobiographical <italic>Ana Isabel, una niña decente</italic>, this study investigates the topic of identity formation and the state, especially in regards to the control of women's sexuality and women's bodies in state ideologies, while exploring the specific racial overtones of beauty practices and education.</p>

<p>‘La negritud venezolana no es bella’ [Black women in Venezuela are not beautiful]. (Osmel Sousa, Director of Miss Venezuela in a 2002 interview)<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1464700113483243">1</xref></sup></p></disp-quote>In Susan Bordo's influential work on the body, she notes that ‘our bodies are necessarily cultural forms; whatever roles anatomy and biology play, they always interact with culture’ (1993: 16). One of these interactions in Latin America has been the control of women's bodies in the construction of national identity. As a review of the literature shows (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1464700113483243">Anderson, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1464700113483243">Sommer, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1464700113483243">Wright, 1995</xref>), in Latin America the social conventions governing pair-bonding and reproduction have codified existing hierarchies of race and class while allowing elites to embark upon a project of moral advancement for the good of the nation. In her work on the Venezuelan novel, for example, Julie Skurski argues that this process was seen as a chance to reclaim an ‘authentic’ Venezuelan past that rejected Spanish identity while creating a specific modern, creole self. This vision for the Venezuelan state sought a new sense of nationality that refused to embrace the indigenous or integrate other marginalised groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1464700113483243">Skurski, 1994</xref>). In order to achieve the goals of the project, society was responsible for maintaining the purity of European bloodlines through control of women's bodies.</p>
<p>This process of creating a national identity through careful breeding is not limited to the Venezuelan case. In many Latin American nations, this ideology led to the use of images of female beauty to create a vision of national morality that conflated the perfect female image with the values of the nation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1464700113483243">Lobato, 2005</xref>: 1). Women who embodied the desired traits of the state could be seen as a ‘sign of modernity’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1464700113483243">2</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1464700113483243">Lobato, 2005</xref>: 11), and the processes designed to seek out and reward women who embodied the physical features valued by the state were viewed as key components in building a ‘nosotros nacional’ or ‘national we’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1464700113483243">Bolivar, 2007</xref>: 75). These women who represented an aspirational national identity through their appearance stood in for the moral value of the whole, with the use of their ‘physical features as a verification of a supposed innate moral value’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1464700113483243">Bolivar, 2007</xref>: 77). A woman who was careful to manage and control her body could be trusted to find a mate with appropriately ‘white’ features, and have ‘whiter’ children.</p>
<p>In Venezuela, as in other nations, this construction of a national identity has been complicated by an unwillingness to confront socially entrenched disparities of race. Ingrid Bolivar notes that the process of identity construction in Colombia was limited to wealthy families who demonstrated ‘honour, respectability, antiquity’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1464700113483243">Bolivar, 2007</xref>: 75). These concepts of honour and respectability, not to mention wealth, are intrinsically tied to race in both nations. While the ideology of national authenticity in Venezuela might have theoretically sought a specifically American <italic>mestizaje</italic>,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-1464700113483243">3</xref></sup> this process in effect concealed and recreated the hierarchies of the colonial legacy. Indeed, as Skurski notes, the idea of racial mixing was understood as ‘part of an evolutionary movement toward “white”, understood as modern, culture’ (1994: 629).</p>
<p>By engaging in a historical study of concepts of physical beauty for women in Venezuela, scholars can learn much more about the role of women in the creation of national identity in Latin American nations. Beauty practices and work, learned and understood by women as the control and careful arrangement of the body, are one way in which societies create idealised national images of race, class, and femininity. That these idealisations, and the effort required to maintain them, are often damaging to women and their bodies is widely accepted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1464700113483243">Bartky, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1464700113483243">Bordo, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1464700113483243">Jeffreys, 2005</xref>). What bears further study is the way in which bodily control, understood as ‘beauty’, builds an image of morality and decency in Venezuela and other Latin American nations.</p>
<sec id="sec1-1464700113483243"><title>Historical background of race in Venezuela</title>
<p>The great project of building a ‘nosotros nacional’ in Venezuela has indeed traditionally been described by Venezuelans as a project to produce ‘<italic>café con leche</italic>’ or ‘coffee with milk’ citizens. However, it has always been understood that more milk is better than more coffee. In 1940, the Venezuelan poet-politician Andrés Eloy Blanco chastised an American counterpart on the issue of race relations by saying: ‘In my humble opinion, you have never known how to treat coffee or Negroes. The former you leave too light, the latter too black’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1464700113483243">Wright, 1995</xref>: 1). This sentiment – that the Afro-descended population would improve with the addition of European blood – has been shown to be a commonality amongst many Latin American thinkers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1464700113483243">Sommer, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1464700113483243">Wright, 1995</xref>).</p>
<p>Venezuela's racial history is similar to that of surrounding nations such as Colombia, but differs significantly to that of nations such as Mexico or Argentina. From the time of the first European settlers in the middle of the sixteenth century, indigenous populations were soon overrun by mainly Spanish immigrants. While many communities (especially those of the coast) were immediately devastated, others, such as the Wayao of far western Venezuela, retained their autonomy and language well into the nineteenth century. Despite the success of some remote tribes, the majority of indigenous populations of Venezuela were incorporated by the Spaniards into the <italic>encomienda</italic><sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-1464700113483243">4</xref></sup> system, with the result that by the end of the colonial era in the early nineteenth century, either there were no indigenous peoples left in the populated areas of Venezuela, or those who did identify as indigenous did so only as part of a mixed-race population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1464700113483243">Cunill Grau, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1464700113483243">Nichols and Morse, 2010</xref>: 189). By this time, indigenous Venezuelans were understood to be either mixed-race and impoverished people of colour or indecent, wild men and women who lived in remote corners of the nation.</p>
<p>The first significant number of African slaves was brought to Venezuela by Spaniards in the early 1600s to support the production of cacao. Cacao production devised a geographic model with separate spheres for cultivation and management, with white owners preferring to live in cities. The rural areas were then often associated with ‘barbarism generally and slavery and disease specifically’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1464700113483243">Nichols and Morse, 2010</xref>: 191). In the cities, slaves, European-descended immigrants, and free people of colour lived side by side in rigidly regulated social positions. White immigrants born in Europe held the most privileged position. Those Europeans who could prove their ancestry back to ancestors in Europe were ‘creole’ and were next on the social ladder. In the rural and coastal areas, however, less-wealthy white overseers, African slaves, free people of colour, and indigenous people all interacted and intermarried regularly with limited white contact.</p>
<p>While a few examples of remote tribes or isolated coastal cities represented small spaces wherein African and indigenous cultural heritage persisted in colonial Venezuela, economics and geography created a more general mixing of the population. Indeed, as Winthrop <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1464700113483243">Wright (1995)</xref> estimates, by the mid-twentieth century, some 70 per cent of the Venezuelan population could be identified as mixed-race ‘<italic>pardos</italic>’. This fact led to consternation on the part of the Venezuelan elites during the colonial period. By the late nineteenth century, Venezuelan scholars Laureano Vallenilla Lanz and José Gil Fortoul were writing essays that accepted that Venezuela was a nation of mixed-race people (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1464700113483243">Hernández González, 1997</xref>). These scholars, however, argued that the long process of mixing had wiped out all traces of unique African and indigenous identity and had discarded any negative impulse of the undesirable races (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1464700113483243">Nichols and Morse, 2010</xref>). They held that white blood was so superior that centuries of its influence would cancel out the negative undesirable blood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1464700113483243">Wright, 1995</xref>). Since racial differences have been discounted, no Venezuelan census has taken information on race since 1854.</p>
<p>What remained, therefore, was the issue of class. Positivist thinkers like Gil Fortoul opined that the deciding line between decent and indecent, good and bad, and civilised and uncivilised was found between rich and poor. In his 1853 etiquette manual, Manuel Carreño clearly laid out the fundamental difference between the rich (white, landed) elite and the poor (landless, African, indigenous or mixed) majority (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1464700113483243">Carreño, 2010</xref>). Each class deserved its assigned place, Carreño wrote, and each should accept it. Positivist thought of the period on race argued that Anglo-Saxon (white) societies were more successful because they had to work harder. It was therefore logical that people of colour were poorer because they were naturally lazy and unintelligent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1464700113483243">Wright, 1995</xref>). What was allowed, however, was the possibility of racial whitening through the acquisition of funds, status or land. From this phenomenon comes the widely repeated saying ‘money whitens’. All <italic>café con leche</italic> citizens could use wealth and power to bolster their claim to a position of ‘decency’.</p>
<p>This brief historical background helps illustrate the link between assumed decency and both race and wealth as related to social status. These linkages remain relevant today. In 2008, Lauren Gulbas completed research in Caracas, Venezuela, on the relationships among politics, race, class, and gender. Using a series of structured interviews, surveys, and archival research, Gulbas found that the nation's social structure ‘continues to be defined according to a dichotomy between the “white” and “wealthy” on the one hand and the “dark” and “poor” on the other hand’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1464700113483243">Gulbas, 2008</xref>: 138). She also found that markers of physical appearance still count in deciding the ‘value’ of a person. In Gulbas’ interviews, she encountered a strong trend of contemporary women who linked the concept of ‘white’ with ‘good’ or ‘good enough’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1464700113483243">Gulbas, 2008</xref>). For many of the women interviewed, the identification of race was dependent not on skin colour alone, but on both social status and specific physical features such as the nose or hair. Using a pile-sorting technique, Gulbas found that very curly hair and wide noses were indicators of ‘blackness’ while skin colour was not, necessarily. Wavy (not curly) hair and a thin nose are associated, in her findings, with ‘refinement’ and show an ‘underlying association with class and status’ while physical features associated with mixed blood are ‘ugly’ and ‘deformed’ (2008: 231).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec2-1464700113483243"><title>Race and literature</title>
<p>Gulbas' study shows how Venezuela's racial past has led to a modern preoccupation with physical beauty that privileges ‘white’ or ‘European’ physical features and problematises features perceived to be linked to marginalised groups. The roots of this preoccupation can be seen in the literature of the early twentieth century. There is significant worth in unpacking the conceptualisations of race, class, and gender that are embedded in literary texts. As Bordo affirms, it is useful to read ‘literary works, philosophical works, artworks, film, fashion … less naively and more completely, educated and attuned to the historically pervasive presence of gender-, class-, and race-coded dualities’ (1993: 16). The works studied here, are, in this way, windows into the social construction of and attitudes toward race and women's bodies in Venezuela.</p>
<p>Indeed, a review of fiction produced between 1920 and 1950 reveals the particular relevance of racial identification as it was associated with virtue and worth for women. Already considered to be less rational and less civilised than men, women of colour fell into the double bind of adding the stigma of savagery and lack of control associated with their race. This problem is similar to one faced by African-American women in the United States, who have been described as carrying ‘a triple burden of negative bodily associations’ through association with the temptations of the flesh, with race, and with slavery: ‘for in slavery, her body is not only treated as an animal body, but is property to be taken and used at will’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1464700113483243">Bordo, 1993</xref>: 10–11). In many nations, including Venezuela, the term ‘la negra’ (the black woman) has historically been synonymous with the above description: a woman without honour, an erotically charged plaything, or a woman of lower social standing who is used for the pleasure of men or as a servant of white women (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1464700113483243">Carter, 1985</xref>: 74; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1464700113483243">Nichols and Morse, 2010</xref>: 210). Some historical understandings and representations of women's race were based primarily on skin colour. In Venezuela, however, other physical features are often linked to perceptions and identifications of race. Given the more pronounced incidence of racial mixing in Venezuela, skin colour alone is a problematic marker of status and family position. For the purposes of this study, I will use two of the main features employed by researchers such as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1464700113483243">Gulbas (2008)</xref> in the identification of ‘race’ by physical features: specifically, hair and skin colour.</p>
<p>The roots of long, entrenched processes of image-building in Venezuela can be seen clearly in the works of the novelists Teresa de la Parra (1889–1936) and Antonia Palacios (1904–2001). Parra and Palacios are two of the early twentieth-century's best-known and most successful Venezuelan authors. Parra, a woman whose work ‘constitutes the foundation of Venezuelan literature’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1464700113483243">Pantin and Torres, 2003</xref>: 53), shows in all of her novels a preoccupation with the instruction and enculturation of women. In her novel, <italic>Mama Blanca's Memoirs</italic> (1929), this is explored through the eyes of a young girl. Palacios was an author of similar influence and interest both for her contemporaries and for succeeding generations of authors. Of Palacios’ works in prose, the novel <italic>Ana Isabel, a Decent Girl</italic> (1949) is arguably the best read and most respected. Like Parra's novel, the text gives a glimpse of Venezuelan society from the perspective of a young girl. Both semi-autobiographical works reveal the preoccupation with beauty for women as a symbol of class and racial purity. This preoccupation, then, is positioned as a key element in women's enculturation as reproductive beings responsible for the maintenance of wealthy, landed, creole lineage. Both novels provide a realistic description of the instruction of racial and class-consciousness for young women, especially as related to notions of honour and decency in early twentieth-century Venezuela.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec3-1464700113483243"><title>Writing of respectability</title>
<p>Teresa de la Parra and Antonia Palacios came to literature from different places of economic prosperity. Both were the daughters of well-established Venezuelan families, the type of families whose ‘antiquity’ would have made them responsible for the breeding of national identity. Parra was born in France, where her father served in the Venezuelan diplomatic corps. After returning to Venezuela, she lived for many years on the family's sugar plantation outside of Caracas. Shortly after her father's death in 1910, Parra moved with the family to Spain. Much of Parra's life after adolescence was engaged in travel with her family between Venezuela and Europe. Parra's most successful early work was the autobiographical <italic>Memoirs of Mama Blanca</italic>, which recounts her idyllic childhood on the plantation. However, this novel is often overshadowed by what is today her most famous work, <italic>Iphigenia: Or the Diary of a Young Girl Who Wrote Because She Was Bored</italic> (1924), a controversial novel that provided a scathing portrait of society life in Caracas in the 1920s.</p>
<p>As an adult, Parra was well recognised and was often held up as the one author who represented the tenuous possibility of talent in women, albeit talent that was always tied to ‘allusions to her beauty and grace’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1464700113483243">Pantin and Torres, 2003</xref>: 59). It also helped that Parra moved in the right social circles. In comparison, women who wished to enter the literary world but who were not blessed with the physical beauty or rich family of Parra were criticised and excluded (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1464700113483243">Pantin and Torres, 2003</xref>). Parra's position meant that she was read by many of her near contemporaries, such as Palacios. As modern critics contend, Parra, in questioning conventional marriage, family, and social mores in her novels, committed a ‘sacrificial act’ as a ‘young woman devoured by a nation not yet ready to comprehend’ her attack on convention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1464700113483243">Pantin and Torres, 2003</xref>: 59). Young intellectuals would have read her work, and the nation, ready or not, integrated that questioning into the social dialogue about women.</p>
<p>Palacios' upbringing was much more humble. She was born to a respected but impoverished Caracas family. As a result, Palacios was mainly self-taught, reading extensively the novels of well-known authors such as Parra. In contrast to Parra's experience of estates, travel, and private tutors, Palacios' childhood was a series of efforts to maintain appearances while living on the edge of genteel poverty behind closed doors. Palacios began to write in 1932, and continued her career through the publication of novels and poetry including her most famous work, <italic>Ana Isabel, a Decent Girl</italic>.</p>
<p>While the two women were separated by fifteen years and an economic gulf, their novels <italic>Mama Blanca's Memoirs</italic> and <italic>Ana Isabel, a Decent Girl</italic>, show remarkable similarities in the way that their protagonists approach issues of race and class, and especially in the way that these concepts manifest themselves in the arena of perceptions of feminine beauty. The two novels do, however, differ in tone and structure and are situated in different Venezuelan contexts (rural and urban). Nonetheless, the similarities are striking, giving a direct perspective of the formative experiences of a young girl in the intimate family space of a Venezuelan household. The observations of both young protagonists, their relationships with servants and family, and their perceptions of their bodies as they grow up link these two novels as portraits of how girls were instructed to become decent women with good hair.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec4-1464700113483243"><title>Observing race, status, and appearance</title>
<p>A key similarity between the two novels is the way in which the two young protagonists observe and relate to the household staff. Parra's novel is related to the reader in the form of a memoir recounted by the protagonist, Blancanieves. The girl spends the opening pages describing the members of her household, including her nanny, Evelyn, brought from the island of Trinidad specifically for her ability to speak English. This might have led the protagonist to view her nanny as more educated than other members of the household, as she holds specialised knowledge. However, much of the description devoted to Evelyn is related to her terrible facility with the Spanish language and to her appearance. According to Blancanieves, Evelyn:<disp-quote>
<p>bathed us, sewed our clothes, scolded us in a Spanish free of articles and appeared every morning very turned out in her corset, crisply ironed blouse, apron and leather belt. Contained in her corset, under her rebellious woolly hair, faintly shining and as straight as possible, Evelyn, in every moment, gave off an odour of order, symmetry, command, and a slight hint of coconut oil. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1464700113483243">Parra, 2008</xref>: 18)</p></disp-quote>Here, we see that in introducing Evelyn, the elements that the young Blancanieves finds most important are her lack of facility with Spanish and her appearance. Later, it will become increasingly obvious that for Blancanieves, while Evelyn is not a wholly negative figure, neither does she deserve the same respect as members of the family. Blancanieves continues with how the girls discovered that Evelyn had come:<disp-quote>
<p>for the express and exclusive purpose of teaching us girls English. But we ignored this detail completely, for the simple reason that, at that time, in spite of Evelyn, we didn't have the slightest suspicion that English even existed, a thing that must in any case be an unnecessary complication. In exchange, in the spirit of justice and compensation, when Evelyn would say indignantly: ‘Now you've dirtied dress, stubborn girl, sitting on ground,’ we would not reprimand her about articles, things which, in the end, were hardly indispensable either. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1464700113483243">Parra, 2008</xref>: 15)</p></disp-quote>The tone of condescension here is palpable. While Evelyn is the bilingual party in the conversational exchanges, she is portrayed as the party needing both the help of the children, and their forgiveness for her less-than-perfect Spanish. In both of the above descriptions, there is no doubt that Evelyn does not occupy the same social status as the other women in the house in terms of physical appearance, economic wealth or possibilities for social advancement. Indeed, appearance is key to characterisation in the novel, and this description of Evelyn will be discussed in more depth.</p>
<p>Blancanieves’ description of Evelyn is similar in many ways to her descriptions of another member of the estate's staff, Vicente Cochocho. Vicente is a handyman on the hacienda and a great favourite of Blancanieves and her sisters, but as more of a pet than a friend. The reader's first introduction to Vicente is once again articulated in terms of his appearance, specifically his feet (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1464700113483243">Parra, 2008</xref>: 82). These feet and his legs, we learn, are ‘short and twisted, always in intimate contact with the land and the water, always spattered in mud’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1464700113483243">Parra, 2008</xref>: 85). The repeated insistence on the connection of Vicente with the earth and the natural world is reinforced by the repetitive use of animal metaphors to describe him. Blancanieves tells us that the last name ‘Cochocho’ is not properly a family name, but rather a nickname. Cochocho, she informs us, means bug, ‘such a despicable little bug that you won't even find it in the dictionary’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1464700113483243">Parra, 2008</xref>: 100). Blancanieves’ relationship to Vicente is clearly that of social superior to inferior.</p>
<p>While Blancanieves' observations of the household servants are not couched in overtly negative terms, the titular character of Palacios’ novel has observations that, while similar, are much more fearful. Palacios' novel is told in simultaneous narration, through the eyes of eight-year-old Ana Isabel, a girl who, like Palacios herself, lives in a precarious state of genteel poverty with her brother, parents, and a minimal household staff in Caracas. Perhaps because of the much smaller economic gap between Ana Isabel and the Afro-descended citizens around her, her attitudes on the subject of race are much more complex. When Ana Isabel considers the household servant Gregoria (often referred to in the text as ‘la negra’), she spends a great deal of time considering her appearance. Gregoria is also represented in terms of uneducated speech, but is more clearly imagined for Ana Isabel in relation to her physical attributes, as in this passage where she considers Gregoria's observation that all souls will be the same in heaven:<disp-quote>
<p>If she has to become the same as Gregoria, then Ana Isabel doesn't want to die. She doesn't want to look like Gregoria, with those weepy eyes, red from the smoke, and those hands … Oh Gregoria's hands! With thick nails and veins and misshapen black fingers, twisted from kneading and washing … If she is going to have to look like Gregoria Ana Isabel doesn't want to die … (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1464700113483243">Palacios, 2009</xref>: 23)</p></disp-quote>Here, Gregoria's appearance is closely linked to her social status as a servant. The physical attributes that Ana Isabel finds so terrifying are a result of household work. However, Ana Isabel additionally has a more nuanced view of the problematic relationship between race, class, and decency that comes from her association with neighbourhood children who are more closely related to her position economically, if not in status.</p>
<p>One of these children is the boy Eusebio, once again usually referred to by Ana Isabel as ‘el negrito Eusebio’ (little black Eusebio) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1464700113483243">Palacios, 2009</xref>: 75). Eusebio is the son of a local shop employee and is a great friend to Ana Isabel. She likes to play with Eusebio because:<disp-quote>
<p>Little black Eusebio knows an amazing amount of games and songs. He sings songs that he writes himself. He says that he pulls them right out of his cap, sticking his hand up to his woolly head, laughing with such white teeth that Ana Isabel envies him. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1464700113483243">Palacios, 2009</xref>: 79)</p></disp-quote>In this passage, as in others, Ana Isabel shows her respect for Eusebio's knowledge, wit, and cleverness, a marked difference from the condescension that Blancanieves demonstrates. This does not mean that she is ignorant of the gulf between them or the importance of their differences. While Ana Isabel admires Eusebio enough to indulge in a childhood infatuation, she knows that any serious relationship is impossible. What follows in the text is Ana Isabel's childishly sophisticated consideration of the importance of bloodlines. Even in her impoverished family, her father has declared, ‘The blood of the Alcantará will never mix with common blood! We have a pristine bloodline and unsullied family crest’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1464700113483243">Palacios, 2009</xref>: 81). Because of this, Ana Isabel knows that she may never marry Eusebio.</p>
<p>The physical characteristics of Evelyn and Gregoria, Vicente and Eusebio are, for the young girls who interact with them, specific markers of societal importance (or lack thereof). As both girls grow up, they become even more aware of the importance of the body and its relationship to notions of decency and honour. What becomes most clear to both girls, in fact, is the need to control and manage their own bodies in order not to emulate the socially inferior people with whom they come into contact.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec5-1464700113483243"><title>Civilisation and barbarism: Controlling the wild body</title>
<p>Bordo asserts that women are traditionally cast in the role of ‘the body’, a position that carries very negative connotations. The cost of this for women ‘is obvious. For if, whatever the specific historical context of the duality, <italic>the body</italic> is the negative term, and if woman <italic>is</italic> the body, then women <italic>are</italic> that negativity, whatever it may be’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1464700113483243">Bordo, 1993</xref>: 5; emphasis in original). In the case of Venezuela, the negativity represented in a woman's body, and especially the body of a non-white woman, is the poverty and wildness associated with African and indigenous heritage. Therefore, in order to achieve a higher level of morality and virtue, women's bodies needed to be controlled. This imperative is notable in both novels. As semi-autobiographical works, each novel presents the reader with a historical view of the instruction that young girls receive on the ‘civilised’ and controlled white version of corporality.</p>
<p>Returning to the first description of Evelyn, one of the key elements of her physical description is a desire to control unruly elements of her body. She is ‘contained’ in a corset, and has worked to make her ‘rebellious woolly hair … as straight as possible’. It is this physical control of self that is credited in the passage for the fact that Evelyn gives off an ‘odour of order, symmetry, command’. Here, Evelyn clearly endeavours to ally herself with the values of the rich, white family through her appearance, wearing a European garment (a corset) and endeavouring to make her hair as straight as possible. For Evelyn, this effort is not one only concerned with physical appearance. In her desire to control her ‘rebellious’ hair and body, Evelyn believes herself morally superior to a figure such as Vicente Cochocho. Evelyn, Blancanieves reports, ‘had declared that Vicente was a filthy creature, worthy of our highest disgust, and being himself a louse, must have a head full of them’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1464700113483243">Parra, 2008</xref>: 85). Evelyn forbids the girls to talk to Vicente and names him dirty, uncouth, discourteous, and uneducated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1464700113483243">Parra, 2008</xref>: 86–87). This, Blancanieves reflects, reveals Evelyn's own self-hatred and consists of a<disp-quote>
<p>complicated and personal hatred of race. That’s why it was violent and without quarter. Evelyn, who had three quarters of white blood, cursed with that white blood the black blood. And since it was impossible to abuse the black she had inside her, she passed the hatred on to Vicente and abused him. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1464700113483243">Parra, 2008</xref>: 85–86)</p></disp-quote>Evelyn has been taught not only to control herself, but also to hate a perceived lack of control in others.</p>
<p>Young Ana Isabel's instruction in the need for bodily control, especially in those considered non-white, is communicated even more overtly. From her early years, when she is taught in the home that ‘the body is the punishment of the soul’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1464700113483243">Palacios, 2009</xref>: 50), to her time in school, Ana Isabel learns the rules governing race, moral values, and their relationship to physical appearance. In school and in the home, Ana Isabel has been taught that ‘blacks are not decent people’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1464700113483243">Palacios, 2009</xref>: 78). Considering this, she thinks about her friends and acquaintances who are considered black, including Nicasia, Estefanía, Eusebio and Carmencita, and how perceptions of them as indecent rule her interactions: ‘They don't let her hang out with black people’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1464700113483243">Palacios, 2009</xref>: 78). Though they live in the same neighbourhood, these are people that Ana Isabel knows are poorer than she is, and she is not allowed to play with them because of their perceived lack of moral value. Ana Isabel has learned that there is a clear, bright line linking ‘whiteness’ and decency, linking appearance and culture.</p>
<p>This is why, as with Evelyn, members of Ana Isabel's community make such an effort to appear as white as possible. One of the saddest episodes in the novel comes when Ana Isabel reaches out to her friend Carmencita. As earlier descriptions of Carmencita reveal, her physical attributes tend more to African-descended features than to the aspirational ‘white’ European ideal, with ‘her little dark face and two braids, so tangled like no one ever brushed them. But they do get brushed, because Ana Isabel has seen her on Sundays, very smoothed out with coconut oil and two red ribbons on the end of her braids … ’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1464700113483243">Palacios, 2009</xref>: 15). As with Evelyn, effort is made to tame Carmencita's hair and make it more ‘civilised’. When Ana Isabel innocently seeks to invite Carmencita to a neighbourhood party, it is clear that these efforts are for naught. When Carmencita appears, the hostess explains why Carmencita cannot stay. The party, the lady explains, is only for the birthday girl's friends. The fact that Carmencita plays with the girls every day is ‘not the same’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1464700113483243">Palacios, 2009</xref>: 100). What's more, she is told, ‘We do not know who her mother is, or her father … ’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1464700113483243">Palacios, 2009</xref>: 100). Ana Isabel is confused by this. She knows that Carmencita's parents are well known to the neighbourhood. What she is missing is the code embedded in the explanation, the justification of exclusion based on lineage and purity of blood. Carmencita's parents are ‘not known’ to society in their condition as non-white and non-rich. Therefore, the daughter is not allowed to attend the party because her morals are automatically suspect due to her lineage.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec6-1464700113483243"><title>Good hair</title>
<p>Blancanieves and Ana Isabel do not learn the moral imperative of body control through observation alone, however. Both receive specific instruction on the topic as well. This leads, in both novels, to a specific type of control that both girls and their families seek over their bodies: good hair.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-1464700113483243">5</xref></sup> In each novel, the girls' hair represents their status, their place in society, and in many ways, the family's honour and value.</p>
<p>Blancanieves' mother is described as a picture of gentility, honour, and beauty. As a traditional upper class woman, her body reflects careful management and breeding. She dresses meticulously in silks, ribbons, and taffetas, and can normally be found in her hammock, ‘in a white dress, covered in flounces and lace, attended by a maid, with her hair spilling in cascades … ’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1464700113483243">Parra, 2008</xref>: 21). The struggle for this beauty does not come as easily for Blancanieves, as is seen clearly in the fourth chapter of the novel, which is entirely concerned with the matter of Blancanieves’ hair. We learn that the girls’, ‘silky, large curls’ represent a significant part of the family's identity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1464700113483243">Parra, 2008</xref>: 32). The problem is that Blancanieves’ curls are not natural. Her hair is silky, yes, but is stick-straight. This is a great trial to her mother, whose vanity, ‘much more than in her own person … had fixed its attention on our six heads’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1464700113483243">Parra, 2008</xref>: 31).</p>
<p>For Blancanieves’ mother, that her daughter's hair does not conform to societal expectations is deeply shameful. It is therefore her job to fight the rebellious hair. Indeed, as the lady of the house of a wealthy plantation, taming Blancanieves’ hair is the only work she pursues. Blancanieves relates, ‘Since Mama was a mother, she was obliged to be embroiled in a battle without quarter that must be renewed every morning’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1464700113483243">Parra, 2008</xref>: 33). As Blancanieves remembers, ‘If mother suffered from the fact that I had straight hair, I suffered a thousand times more’ as ‘that immoderate interest in my hair caught in its claws a great part of my time’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1464700113483243">Parra, 2008</xref>: 34). Blancanieves is forced to sit every day while her mother puts her hair in curling papers, applying a series of ever-more-elaborate potions to her hair, all in an effort to achieve the acceptable appearance.</p>
<p>The reason for Blancanieves’ mother's deep concern for hair is partially communicated in a conversation recounted in the same chapter when her mother asks: ‘But from where did you get this terribly straight hair, Blancanieves, my dear daughter?’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1464700113483243">Parra, 2008</xref>: 33). This reproach provides insight into the source of her mother's concern. The origin of, or the lineage that might have produced such hair is of utmost importance. Hair that is too wavy, coarse, or curly would indicate an undesirable amount of African heritage. Conversely, hair that is too straight suggests indigenous blood. In either case, a woman's hair is representative of her family's bloodline. As a mother it is a woman's responsibility not only to present perfectly groomed girls to the world, but also to prove her own reproductive responsibility by having given birth to children with perfect appearances. Her mother's concern, as well as the strict lesson on taming the unmanageable body, are all explicitly communicated to Blancanieves, who learns by the age of five that she has an ‘arduous duty to appear beautiful’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1464700113483243">Parra, 2008</xref>: 35).</p>
<p>In the case of Blancanieves and her mother, the deficit in nature is made up for by the willingness to work, and by the self-control and abnegation found in the hours and hours spent in front of a mirror. If the ideal of white beauty cannot be achieved by perfect breeding, Blancanieves learns, self-sacrifice is an acceptable substitute. Ana Isabel learns the same lesson as she faces similar struggles with her hair, engaging in more specific consideration of the relationship between beauty, morality and women's hair. Early in the novel, Ana Isabel thinks about the funeral of a prominent member of the upper class, Miss Ercilia. Ana Isabel had often seen Miss Ercilia walking to mass with ‘her black hair parted into two wings, straight and symmetrical, which peeked out of her headscarf’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1464700113483243">Palacios, 2009</xref>: 21). Miss Ercilia is lauded for her piety by the local priest, and Ana Isabel finds that this hairstyle, controlled and managed, fits the situation perfectly, a young woman of high status who follows society's moral and religious expectations. Ana Isabel's father, however, is quick to explain that Miss Ercilia's family has not always been rich: ‘A few years ago they were walking around barefoot and now look at the airs they put on’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1464700113483243">Palacios, 2009</xref>: 21). This leads Ana Isabel to think about Miss Ercilia on the plains, and specifically about her hair:<disp-quote>
<p>A few years ago they were walking around barefoot in the open country. Miss Ercilia didn’t have that cleanly parted, smooth, and symmetrical hair under pleats of a fine Spanish scarf, because she didn’t wear such a fine scarf in the breeze of the plains, only two tangled, black, and heavy plaits that fell to her shoulder and sometimes, the flame of a brightly coloured flower braided in them. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1464700113483243">Palacios, 2009</xref>: 21)</p></disp-quote>When Ana Isabel imagines Miss Ercilia, she is poor, close to the earth and wild. Her hair reflects this, tangled and woven with flowers. In the city, ‘the plaits came apart and in their place came those symmetrical straight wings’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1464700113483243">Palacios, 2009</xref>: 21). For Ana Isabel, respectability and civilisation is directly translated to a change in hairstyle.</p>
<p>Both Blancanieves and Ana Isabel learn that hair needs to be ‘white’, needs to be controlled; it cannot be left natural and must be beautiful. Both girls learn the lesson that attention must be paid to controlling their bodies and especially to their hair, as it represents their place in the social, economic, and racial structure. In one of the last chapters of <italic>Ana Isabel</italic>, Eusebio dies, and with him, Ana Isabel's childhood dies too. It is no coincidence, then, that the penultimate chapter of the novel opens with Ana Isabel at the mirror, brushing her hair. She has, we learn, spent more than an hour trying to manage her hair, trying to make it perfect. Her brother Jaime wants to play in the park as before, but her childhood is behind her. As a ‘decent’ young woman, she is now concerned with appearance and bodily control.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec7-1464700113483243"><title>Conclusions: Beauty and virtue, struggle and sacrifice</title>
<p>Throughout this article, I have illustrated how the importance of racial purity is understood as a demonstration of moral virtue. In the drive to produce ever more modern and ‘European’ citizens who would increase the civilisation of the state, women were responsible for full control of their bodies both before and after conception. Women were tasked with maintaining as white a bodily image as possible in order to find a suitable mate who would allow them to bear a whiter child than the previous generation. This maintenance required a great deal of work and control. Women needed to be very careful in their appearance, in their clothing, in their skin and hair care, to produce the desired result. Thus, a perfectly dressed and arranged woman could be assumed to have a strong work ethic, high family and moral values, and a great deal of self-control; the ideal citizen for the state.</p>
<p>These ideas help give insight into the contemporary situation of women in Venezuela. Firstly, as Gulbas asserts, it is necessary to understand how ‘patriarchal attitudes towards the body are also situated within broader discourses of race and social class’ (2008: 4). The constructions of societal ideals of race, social class, and gender may tell us much about the position of women within Venezuelan society. This is particularly important in a context where race is often dismissed or ignored as a factor in social status or relationships. In addition, an understanding of the historical roots of beauty practices in Venezuela may provide further insight regarding the avenues open to women as they move into public life. A preliminary look at this topic suggests that contemporary women's ability to shape their bodies into acceptable forms is understood as a guarantee of success (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1464700113483243">Gulbas, 2008</xref>: 15). With this greater understanding, cultural phenomena that might otherwise be dismissed as irrelevant acquire serious scholarly interest. One example would be the international reputation of modern Venezuela as a nation that places high value on feminine beauty, going to great lengths to achieve it.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-1464700113483243">6</xref></sup> Research estimates that 20 per cent of all average household incomes in Venezuela are spent on beauty products and enhancements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1464700113483243">Obiko Pearson, 2006</xref>). There is much to be learned from the fact that Venezuelan women see the examples of the nation's beauty workers – pageant winners and contestants who go on to high-profile careers – as models of success to follow (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1464700113483243">Nichols and Morse, 2010</xref>). As Juan Andrés Bello demonstrates in his documentary <italic>La reina del pueblo</italic> (The people's queen) (2010), beauty pageants in Venezuela have a long history not only of uniting Venezuelans around a ‘decent’ candidate, but also of grooming women to represent national ideals through an aspirational ideal of physical attractiveness. That the ideal is both ‘civilised’ and ‘white’ can be viewed as a product of fear. In this case, the fear is built by society, which communicates the message that the ‘wild’ and ‘savage’ elements of African or indigenous culture that persisted in remote areas through the colonial period will ‘infect’ the pure and ancient bloodlines of the nation. For this reason, in order to civilise, control (and whiten) the nation, women and their wild bodies must be disciplined. Hair must be straightened (or curled), skin must be lightened, and noses must be thinner. Only through further analysis of the beauty work, images, and practices of the Venezuelan nation can these complex contemporary interrelationships be understood.</p>
<p>The novels studied here show the historical roots of those relationships as well as how they were built and maintained. Autobiographical novels such as <italic>Ana Isabel, a Decent Girl</italic> or <italic>Mama Blanca's Memoirs</italic>, however fictionalised, offer a window into the enculturation of the young into gendered and racialised standards and expectations of beauty. Further research into the cultural production of both historical and contemporary Venezuela will provide significant advances into the understanding of women's position and gender relations in the nation.</p>
