               <title>Purpose:</title>
               <p>Vermont law strictly regulates the interactions between pharmaceutical manufacturers and health care providers, including gifts, meals, and medication samples. The purpose of this study was to describe providers’ awareness and perceptions of current requirements.</p>
            </sec>
            <sec>
               <title>Methods:</title>
               <p>An online survey was completed by Vermont providers, including prescribers and pharmacists. The survey asked providers about their awareness of 15 different legal requirements and about their level of agreement with these requirements.</p>
            </sec>
            <sec>
               <title>Results:</title>
               <p>Four hundred and eleven providers completed the survey (61% male, mean age 52 years, and 71% physicians). Awareness of the 15 requirements ranged from 28.4% to 93.8%. Most providers agreed or had no strong opinions. Responses at significance levels of <italic>P</italic> &lt; .001 were noted in 8 of 15 requirements when perceptions were stratified by providers who had any interactions with pharmaceutical representatives in the past year (N = 227, 55.4%) versus providers who reported no interactions (N = 183; 44.6%).</p>
            </sec>
            <sec>
               <title>Conclusions:</title>
               <p>A high proportion of Vermont providers are unaware of the current law. Most agreed or had no strong opinions about the requirements; however, at least a quarter disagreed with banning small gifts and meals. Having any interaction with pharmaceutical representatives changed how providers perceived the requirements. These data may be useful for other states considering similar laws.</p>

         <p>There are tensions over the role of government regulating interactions between pharmaceutical manufacturers and health care providers. The Physician Payment Sunshine Act requires pharmaceutical manufacturers to report all payments to physicians and teaching hospitals to the Department of Health and Human Services.<sup>
               <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0897190012451932">16</xref>
            </sup> Amidst federal legislation, individual states are facing controversy in regulating manufacturer–provider interactions. In April 2011, the Massachusetts House of Representatives voted (128-22) to repeal a law that required disclosure and banned gifts to providers.<sup>
               <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0897190012451932">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0897190012451932">18</xref>

            </sup> Also in 2011, the US Supreme Court heard arguments regarding a Vermont law that banned prescription data mining (the sale of individual provider prescribing practices for marketing purposes) without prescriber consent.<sup>
               <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0897190012451932">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0897190012451932">21</xref>

         </p>
         <p>Vermont has been a national leader in regulating interactions between pharmaceutical manufacturers and health care providers, including prescribers and pharmacists.<sup>
               <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0897190012451932">23</xref>
            </sup> Vermont’s Prescribed Product Gift Ban and Disclosure Law, enacted in 2002 and substantially revised in 2009, regulates health care provider-related expenditures and increases transparency through reporting requirements by manufacturers of pharmaceuticals, biological products, and medical devices.<sup>
               <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0897190012451932">24</xref>

            </sup> For example, under the law, manufacturers are banned from providing gifts to health care providers. Gifts are defined as “any payment, food, entertainment, travel, subscription, advance, service, or anything else of value provided to a health care provider.” Small items such as pens or modest meals are considered gifts and are not allowed. Pharmaceutical manufacturers may provide medication samples to health care providers; however, the manufacturers must report the medication, health care provider recipient, number of units, and dosage to the Office of the Attorney General annually. Payments to health care providers for activities such as promotional speaking or salary support for research are allowed but are required to be reported by manufacturers and are made publicly available on the Office of the Attorney General’s Vermont Prescribed Products Public Data Web page.<sup>

         </p>
         <p>The extent to which individual Vermont health care providers are aware and agree with the Prescribed Product Gift Ban and Disclosure Law is unknown. The purpose of this exploratory study was to describe Vermont prescribers’ and pharmacists’ awareness and perceptions of the requirements of Vermont’s Prescribed Product Gift Ban and Disclosure Law regulating interactions with pharmaceutical manufacturers.</p>

         <title>Methods</title>
         <sec id="section3-0897190012451932">
            <title>Study Design and Sample</title>
            <p>This study surveyed Vermont health care providers during November and December 2010. Health care providers were eligible if they were self-reported prescribers and pharmacists licensed to practice in Vermont. There were no exclusion criteria. We recruited by convenience sample by requesting leaders of hospital departments (eg, medicine and pharmacy) and Vermont professional societies (eg, medicine, pharmacy, and nurse practitioner) distribute the survey as a link embedded within an e-mail message on our behalf to their health care providers. We asked the leaders to send a reminder 10 days later. By asking the leaders to send the survey, we did not require access to individual names, e-mail addresses, or other identifiable information. This study was approved by the University of Vermont’s Institutional Review Board.</p>
            <p>The Vermont Board of Medical Practice (www.healthvermont.gov) and the Vermont Secretary of State (www.vtprofessionals.org) maintain publicly available rosters of licensed prescribers (physicians, physician assistants, and nurse practitioners) and pharmacists. As of February 2011, the following numbers of individuals had active licenses and a Vermont address: 1945 physicians, 444 nurse practitioners, 241 certified physician assistants, and 499 pharmacists, for a total target population of 3129 Vermont health care providers.</p>
            <p>The true denominator of this study is unknown, since we did not have access to identifiable information as part of this research. The survey was sent to 2079 e-mail addresses, according to the numbers provided to us by individual hospital and professional leaders. However, there is an overlap as many prescribers and pharmacists are employees of a hospital and also members of a professional society and could have received duplicate messages from different organizations.</p>
         </sec>
         <sec id="section4-0897190012451932">
            <title>Survey Instrument</title>
            <p>The survey was designed using the online tool, SurveyMonkey™ (www.surveymonkey.com). The survey asked about the awareness of legal requirements regulating the pharmaceutical industry’s interaction with Vermont health care providers and about the level of agreement or disagreement with the legislative policies. The survey language was taken directly from the provisions and was reviewed by the Vermont Attorney General’s Office for accuracy prior to survey distribution. Awareness was asked as “are you aware that this statement is true” and was collected as a dichotomous variable (yes, no). Perception was asked as “please rate your agreement with this provision” and was collected on a scale from 1 to 7, with 1 meaning “<italic>highly agree</italic>” and 7 meaning “<italic>highly disagree</italic>.” Demographic information included age, gender, training, practice, location, and years in practice. The survey also asked about relationships with the pharmaceutical industry and whether or not the provider accepted medication samples within the past year.</p>
         </sec>
         <sec id="section5-0897190012451932">
            <title>Data Analysis</title>
            <p>Fisher’s exact test was used to conduct all comparisons between provider characteristics and responses. We collapsed the perception variable into 3 categories; agree (1-2), disagree (6-7), or no strong opinion (3-5), for ease of analysis and presentation. STATA 10 (STATA Corporation, College Station, Texas) was used to conduct the analyses. This is exploratory research without an a priori hypothesis and, therefore, we did not account for multiple comparisons. A 2-sided <italic>P</italic> &lt; .05 was required for statistical significance.</p>

Four hundred and eleven providers responded that they were eligible and answered at least 1 of the survey questions. Sixty-one percent were male with a mean age of 52 years (median 54 years, range: 26-78 years). Seventy-one percent of providers (N = 292) were physicians, followed by nurse practitioners (N = 51; 12.4%), pharmacists (N = 49; 12.0%), physician assistants (N = 14; 3.4%), and other prescribers (N = 4; 1.0%). A third of providers were in primary care, defined as internal medicine (N = 52; 13.1%), family medicine (N = 53; 13.4%), or pediatrics (N = 33; 8.3%). Two hundred and twelve prescribers (53.5%) practice specialty medicine or other. Examples of specialties provided as free text included surgery, obstetrics and gynecology, and psychiatry. Seventy percent (N = 288) of providers identified the outpatient setting as their primary practice location. Over half of providers have practiced for 16 years or longer (N = 217; 53.4%).</p>

         <p>Three survey questions asked providers about their relationship with pharmaceutical manufactures (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0897190012451932">Table 1</xref>). The majority of providers have not accepted medication samples in the last year (N = 268; 65.8%). There was variability in meeting with pharmaceutical industry representatives: 8.7% (N = 36) met with representatives daily or weekly, 20.5% met monthly or quarterly (N = 84), 26.1% (N = 107) met once or twice in the past year, and 44.6% (N = 183) never met with representatives within the past year. Only 16 providers (N = 3.9%) stated they were a paid speaker within the past year.</p>
         <p>Overall awareness and perceptions are presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0897190012451932">Table 2</xref>. Awareness of the 15 provisions ranged from 28.4% (Vermont health care providers have no obligations under state law to report payments from pharmaceutical companies) to 93.8% (a pharmaceutical manufacturer or its representative may not give you a gift of large value, eg, sports or theater tickets, trip). There was at least 75% awareness in 6 of 15 provisions. Most providers agreed or had no strong opinion. The proportion of providers who disagreed with the provisions ranged from 4.4% (a pharmaceutical manufacturer or its representative may not give you a gift of large value, eg, sports or theater tickets, trip; and a pharmaceutical manufacturer or its representative may give you peer-reviewed journal articles) to 36% (Vermont health care providers have no obligations under state law to report payments from pharmaceutical companies). There was at least 25% disagreement in 5 of 15 provisions.</p>

         <title>Discussion</title>
         <p>The results indicate many of the health care providers were not aware of the specific requirements of the Vermont Prescribed Product Gift Ban and Disclosure Law. The provisions are directed toward actions by pharmaceutical manufacturers, not individual health care providers. For example, the law states, “A pharmaceutical manufacturer or its representative may not give you a gift of small value.” The law does not state that a health care provider may not accept a gift of small value. This distinction is subtle but may be one explanation for a general lack of awareness by Vermont health care providers. To our knowledge, implementation of the law did not require formal education for Vermont prescribers or pharmacists, possibly contributing to the observed results. Perceptions of the provisions were mostly favorable or neutral.</p>
         <p>Our findings are in contrast to other recent studies. Korenstein and colleagues conducted a cross-sectional survey of 590 physician faculty and trainees in 9 hospitals in New York and New Jersey.<sup>
               <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0897190012451932">27</xref>
            </sup> The respondents were more positive about pharmaceutical manufacturers than in our results. The majority of respondents in the survey considered meals as appropriate (72.2%) versus less than a third of the respondents in the current survey. There were also differences in feelings about gifts of large value with 25.4% considering these gifts appropriate versus less than 5% in the current survey. Campbell and colleagues conducted a national survey of 3167 physicians to review the financial relationships with pharmaceutical manufacturers after implementation of the 2002 PhRMA code of conduct.<sup>
               <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0897190012451932">28</xref>
            </sup> The results showed that 94% of surveyed physicians had some type of relationship. These findings are substantially different than the results from the current study, which found 55% of prescribers and pharmacists met with representatives of the pharmaceutical industry.</p>
         <p>The reasons for the contrast in findings are unknown but could be due to differences in research methodology or could be a reflection of the influence of decade-old laws in Vermont influencing pharmaceutical manufacturer activity. For example, payments to Vermont health care professional organizations are declining. Vermont health care providers and organizations received an estimated $4.9 million in payments from pharmaceutical manufacturers between 2002 and 2004.<sup>
               <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0897190012451932">29</xref>
            </sup> Recent changes to the law make year-to-year comparisons difficult, however, excluding payments related to clinical trials, overall payments decreased to $1.8 million between July 2009 and June 2010.<sup>
               <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0897190012451932">30</xref>
            </sup>
         </p>
         <p>Interestingly, the perceptions varied widely based on self-reported interactions with pharmaceutical representatives. Providers willing to interact with pharmaceutical representatives were more likely to agree with the distribution of medication samples, journals reprints, patient education materials, and small gifts and meals, compared to providers without interactions with the industry. The reason for this finding is unclear and may reflect how familiarity with pharmaceutical manufacturers or the development of social relationships between health care providers and representatives of the pharmaceutical industry contribute to different perceptions.</p>
         <p>The strengths of this study include its novelty and timeliness with respect to recent amendments of the law. To our knowledge, this is the first statewide survey to evaluate perceptions of emerging regulations governing how pharmaceutical manufacturers interact with health care providers.</p>
         <p>There are several limitations to this exploratory study. To avoid any perceived conflicts of interest, the authors created an anonymous survey with no funding. This decision prevented a complete understanding of the true denominator as well as more sophisticated methods for survey administration and data collection. Relying on organizational champions to send the survey on our behalf meant that not every Vermont health care provider had the opportunity to receive the survey. This may have biased the sample toward employees of hospitals and those affiliated with professional societies. The sample size is small with a selection bias toward individuals who were interested in the topic. To minimize the response burden, the survey addressed only 15 provisions considered important to health care providers but was not comprehensive of the entire law. We only explored pharmaceuticals and did not include the domain of medical devices. It is unknown how these results would translate to other states, especially to those without strict gift ban laws.</p>
         <p>A high proportion of Vermont health care providers are unaware of recently implemented laws. Most providers agreed or had no strong opinions about the regulations; however, at least a quarter of providers disagreed with regulations banning small gifts and meals. Having any interaction with pharmaceutical representatives changed how Vermont health care providers perceived the regulations.</p>
