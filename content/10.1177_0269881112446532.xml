<abstract>
<p>Our group and others internationally have previously reported data on the use of low-dose flumazenil administered intravenously for the management of benzodiazepine withdrawal. This paper describes the first reported use of subcutaneous flumazenil infusion in the management of acute benzodiazepine withdrawal. Self-reported withdrawal symptoms and psychological state and anxiety sequelae were collected at baseline and then at intervals to 5 days following initiation of subcutaneous flumazenil infusion. Data indicate that patient subjective benzodiazepine withdrawal symptoms were well managed, with significant reduction in psychological distress seen over the duration of treatment. Perceived difficulty in performing everyday functions was positively correlated with withdrawal severity and improved over treatment. Patients reported high treatment comfort, willingness to undertake a future subsequent treatment using this technique, and willingness to recommend this treatment to a friend. This small proof-of-concept study indicates that subcutaneous flumazenil infusion has excellent tolerability, efficacy and improvement on measures of psychological distress. Given this technique is less invasive and requires fewer staff resources compared with intravenous administration, it may prove a significant asset in the management of benzodiazepine withdrawal.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Following long-term benzodiazepine use, between 15–44% of persons become dependent, even while adhering to therapeutic doses, and upon cessation experience protracted moderate to severe withdrawal symptoms that, if left untreated, can result in significant morbidity and, rarely, mortality. Most relapse back to regular benzodiazepine use (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0269881112446532">Ashton, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0269881112446532">Basinska et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0269881112446532">de las Cuevas et al., 2000</xref>). Benzodiazepine withdrawal management in primary care commonly involves gradual reduction in benzodiazepine dose, also known as ‘benzodiazepine taper’, with or without concomitant psychological interventions ranging from supportive counselling to cognitive behaviour therapy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0269881112446532">Lader et al., 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Where a severe withdrawal syndrome or other sequelae are anticipated, inpatient dose tapering for 2–4 weeks or longer is usually recommended. These treatment programmes are frequently not cost effective because completion rates and subsequent abstinence rates are often low. One study found that only 10 of 44 patients undergoing either fixed or symptom-triggered dose taper completed an 8 day inpatient taper protocol and were benzodiazepine free at the time of discharge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0269881112446532">McGregor et al., 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>Severity of acute withdrawal has been shown to be associated with higher dosage of benzodiazepines, the use of multiple benzodiazepines, oral rather than injected use (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0269881112446532">Seivewright and Dougal, 1993</xref>), duration of use, shorter half-life benzodiazepines, and more rapid taper. Patient variables have also been indicated such as higher pretreatment anxiety and depression, personality pathology, panic disorder diagnosis, and history of alcohol/drug abuse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0269881112446532">Schweizer and Rickels, 1998</xref>). These factors may also be predictive of longer-term outcomes; for example, high baseline levels of psychological distress, anxiety and dosage predict poor outcomes at 3 months following a supported outpatient dose taper treatment intervention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0269881112446532">O’Connor et al., 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>A small but growing body of research has indicated a role for flumazenil, a benzodiazepine receptor antagonist, in the management of benzodiazepine withdrawal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0269881112446532">Gerra et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0269881112446532">Hood et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0269881112446532">Lader and Morton, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0269881112446532">Quaglio et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0269881112446532">Saxon et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0269881112446532">Savic et al., 1991</xref>). Flumazenil has a high first-pass metabolism, resulting in less than 25% systemic bioavailability and a short half-life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0269881112446532">Roncari et al., 1993</xref>). Accordingly, its major mode of administration for benzodiazepine withdrawal has been via intravenous administration using multiple bolus infusions of flumazenil either alone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0269881112446532">Lader and Morton, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0269881112446532">Saxon et al., 1997</xref>) or in conjunction with tapering doses of benzodiazepines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0269881112446532">Gerra et al., 2002</xref>). Our group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0269881112446532">Hood et al., 2009</xref>) recently reported on the continuous intravenous delivery of flumazenil for up to 4 days (2 mg/24 h continuous intravenous flumazenil infusion for 96 h with oxazepam tapering). In conjunction with similar studies, prima facie evidence exists of the effectiveness of multiple bolus or continuous intravenous infusion of flumazenil in (1) preventing clinically significant benzodiazepine withdrawal syndromes, and (2) achieving short-term benzodiazepine abstinence. Notwithstanding positive clinical outcomes, intravenous infusion over several days is associated with a number of technical and clinical features that reduce its clinical utility. In particular, difficulty in obtaining peripheral venous access may sometimes require more invasive central venous cannulation, and the need for high-intensity medical monitoring during intravenous infusion makes this is a resource-intensive procedure. Subcutaneous infusion could provide an effective alternative.</p>
<p>This paper describes the first reported use of subcutaneous flumazenil infusion in the management of acute benzodiazepine withdrawal in a clinical population, focusing in particular on the management of withdrawal symptoms and psychological state and anxiety sequelae during acute withdrawal. The relationship of patient and drug use variables to withdrawal severity is examined. Patient acceptability of the procedure is also reported.</p>

<title>Method</title>
<sec id="section3-0269881112446532">
<title>Clinical setting</title>
<p>The study was conducted at an outpatient treatment clinic and a supervised residential facility. The study was conducted under the auspice of the University of Western Australia Research Ethics committee (RA/4/1/4185). The data were collected between April 2009 and October 2010.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0269881112446532">
<title>Design</title>
<p>The study was an observational case series.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0269881112446532">
<title>Participants</title>
<p>Patients presenting for treatment who were benzodiazepine dependent (DSM-IV) and wishing to withdraw from and cease using benzodiazepines were considered for treatment with flumazenil. Inclusion criteria: benzodiazepine dependent (daily use &gt;3 months @ &gt;10 mg per day diazepam equivalents). Exclusion criteria: less than 18 years of age; medical conditions precluding cessation of benzodiazepines; known epilepsy; an inability or unwillingness to consent to participation in the study; and pregnancy (urine βHCG positive) or current breast feeding. Patients’ medical assessment included seizure history. Patients were assessed on an individual basis and a clinical assessment was made as to whether a previous history of seizures precluded inclusion in the trial. Known epilepsy was an exclusion criteria. Of note, pre-existing psychiatric disorders were not an exclusion criterion.</p>
<p>All participants gave written informed consent, including understanding of the off-label nature of the use of flumazenil, before entering treatment, and permission for their clinical records to be used for research purposes.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0269881112446532">
<title>Treatment regimen</title>
<p>Subjects were treated with a subcutaneous flumazenil solution containing 16 mg of flumazenil infused over a 92 h period: 4 mg/24 h period (±20%). The flumazenil infusion was augmented with a rapid dose taper regimen of 60, 30, 15 mg of oxazepam – equivalent to 10, 5, and 2.5 mg diazepam (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0269881112446532">SA Health, 2009</xref>) – over the first 48 h of treatment starting at baseline then 24 and 48 h after the initiation of the infusion. Based on clinical assessment for residual withdrawal symptoms at the end of the 96 h infusion, patients were offered a second infusion treatment of up to further 96 h duration. Thus some patients received treatment for up to 8 days. For consistency, this paper reports outcomes for all patients up to 96 h of treatment. Treatment was provided on an ambulatory basis. Flumazenil infusions were commenced in the treatment clinic and the patients then transferred to a residential withdrawal facility associated with the clinic for monitoring by trained staff. Medical staff were on 24 h call. Adjunctive anti-convulsive medications were available if required. Patients returned to the clinic daily for infusion site inspection and clinical review.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-0269881112446532">
<title>Investigational agent</title>
<p>Commercially available pharmaceutical preparations of flumazenil (e.g. Anexate®, Roche Pharmaceuticals) have a pH of around 4.0. Our earlier experience with intravenous flumazenil infusion indicated that treatment with continuous subcutaneous flumazenil infusion for at least 4 days would be necessary, and possibly longer if protracted withdrawal symptoms were evident. In order to minimize the likelihood of irritation around the infusion site we therefore used a flumazenil formulation with a pH of 6.8. Quantities sufficient for research purposes were manufactured by Greens Compounding Pharmacy (South Australia) under current Good Manufacturing Practice (cGMP) guidelines. Greens provided documentation detailing formulation and autoclaving data. A certificate of quality assurance was provided by Greens for the manufactured product. Accelerated aging of the flumazenil drug solution was conducted by GoMedical Industries (Western Australia) at 60°C and confirmed drug stability for an equivalent period of 6 months at 30°C.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-0269881112446532">
<title>Infusion apparatus</title>
<p>Subcutaneous flumazenil infusion was administered via a syringe pump (Springfusor® 30 syringe infusion pump: GoMedical Industries, Australia, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0269881112446532">Figure 1</xref>) connected to a Y infusion device (the BD Saf-T-Intima® Subcutaneous Infusion Device with Y adaptor). The Springfusor® consists of a spring-driven cartridge to drive the syringe and a Flow Control Tubing (FCT) to control the output from the syringe. The Springfusor® 30 infusion pump was attached via butterfly needle inserted on the anterior abdominal wall (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0269881112446532">Figure 2</xref>), and carried in a pouch worn on a belt. Patients were fully ambulatory with the Springfusor® device in place.</p>

<title>Assessment and data collection</title>
<p>A structured interview schedule was developed to collect demographic information, drug use history, psychiatric and physical comorbidities, and treatment history. Withdrawal symptoms and cravings and psychological indicators were monitored with validated clinical instruments and data were collected prospectively. The Benzodiazepine Withdrawal Scale – CIWA-B (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0269881112446532">Busto et al., 1989</xref>) – was used to monitor withdrawal symptom severity in all patients across five data points, at the commencement of the infusion, and thereafter at approximately 24, 48, 72 and 96 h post commencement. Throughout the rest of this report these time periods are referred to as day 1, day 2, day 3, day 4, and day 5 respectively. The K10 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0269881112446532">Kessler et al., 2002</xref>), and BSI (Brief Symptom Inventory) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0269881112446532">Derogatis and Melisaratos, 1983</xref>) were administered to monitor psychological state. A modified version of the K10 was used for repeated assessment of symptoms ‘in the last 3 days’. The GAD7 (Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0269881112446532">Spitzer et al., 2006</xref>) was used to measure baseline anxiety symptoms. As these data were collected as part of standard clinical care rather than under a strict research protocol, staff clinical responsibilities took priority over research data collection beyond standard clinical monitoring, thus a full data set is not available on all measures. Bloods were taken from three patients to confirm and monitor plasma flumazenil throughout the study period.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-0269881112446532">
<title>Plasma flumazenil assay</title>
<p>The samples were analysed by an established LC-MS/MS method for the quantification of flumazenil in plasma. On the day of analysis, samples were thawed at room temperature and vortex mixed. Aliquots of samples were extracted into organic solvent hexane: (dichloromethane, 1:1) using zolpidem-d6 (10 ng/mL in 50% acetonitrile/water) as the internal standard. Two samples from each participant were analysed to ensure consistency of the quantification method (<italic>r</italic>(11)=0.970, <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.001).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-0269881112446532">
<title>Statistical methods</title>
<p>Data analysis was conducted to investigate self-reported withdrawal and psychological distress symptoms over the 96 h infusion treatment. Data were analysed using SPSS Version 19. A one-way repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) with post hoc analysis and paired samples <italic>t</italic>-tests with Bonferroni corrections were employed to compare differences across the duration of treatment. Pearson product-moment correlation was used to examine the strength and direction of the linear relationship between continuous variables and Spearman’s Rho used with ordinal variables. Given the small sample size, the authors urge caution in the interpretation of results, and all analyses should be considered exploratory.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<sec id="section13-0269881112446532">
<title>Patient characteristics</title>
<p>Results from a total of 23 patients are reported; 56% were female. The mean age was 39 years (standard deviation (SD) 9.6, range 26–66 years). Of the participants, 80% were currently using other licit or illicit psychoactive drugs in addition to benzodiazepines, the most common being cannabis (43%), and 80% of patients smoked tobacco. Four patients had used two or more psychoactive substances in addition to benzodiazepines and tobacco in the week prior to admission.</p>
<p>All participants used benzodiazepines daily, with a history of long-term benzodiazepine use (mean number of years of benzodiazepine use was 11.9 (SD 7.8), range 1–29 years), and continued their benzodiazepine use up until the commencement of flumazenil treatment. Whilst diazepam was the most commonly used benzodiazepine (65%), two-thirds of participants (65%) were currently using multiple benzodiazepines. For ease of comparison, benzodiazepine dosage was converted into ‘diazepam equivalent dose’. The mean diazepam equivalent daily dose used by participants was 169 mg (sd=181), range 20–840 mg. All participants reported previous unsuccessful attempts to reduce or abstain from benzodiazepine use. Some of these were under medically supervised dose taper regimes, others were simply patients’ own attempts to ‘cut back’. As this data was entirely self-reported it has not been reported.</p>
<p>A subset of 11 participants completed the GAD7 (Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale) to measure baseline anxiety symptoms (mean=12.5, sd=4.95). A score of 10–14 is considered moderate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0269881112446532">Spitzer et al., 2006</xref>). A score of 15–21 indicates a severe level of anxiety severity. Two patients had scores within in the severe range (19, 21). The GAD7 also asks participants to rate on a scale of 1–4 the effect of their anxiety symptoms in terms of how difficult it is to perform everyday functions at work, home and socially. The mean difficulty rating was 3.09 (SD=0.70) equating to ‘very difficult’.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section14-0269881112446532">
<title>Severity of withdrawal</title>
<p>Withdrawal symptoms in all study participants (<italic>n</italic>=23) were assessed with the CIWA-B at the commencement of the infusion (day 1), and at 24 h (day 2), 48 h (day 3), 72 h (day 4), and 96 h (day 5) of treatment, providing five data points. Severity of withdrawal as measured by the CIWA-B is generally interpreted as follows: 1–20 ‘mild’, 21–40 ‘moderate’, 41–60 ‘severe’, 61–80 ‘very severe’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0269881112446532">Busto et al., 1989</xref>). Mean withdrawal scores, although ‘mild’ throughout the infusion period, were highest on day 1 (mean=20.2, sd=13.1) and day 2 (mean=19.5, sd=14.8) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0269881112446532">Figure 3</xref>).</p>

</fig>
<p>A one-way repeated measures ANOVA was used to compare 21 participants’ withdrawal scores on the CIWA across 5 days. (Note: as there were missing data for two patients their scores were excluded from this analysis). Mauchly’s test indicated that the assumption of sphericity had been violated (chi-square=21.155, <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.05), therefore degrees of freedom were corrected using Huynh–Feldt epsilon. ANOVA results indicate significant change on the CIWA across the time period, <italic>F</italic>(3.25, 65)=5.547, <italic>p</italic>=0.001, partial <italic>η</italic>=0.217. Post hoc analysis with Bonferroni corrections revealed that the CIWA score on day 2 (<italic>M</italic>=19.85, <italic>SD</italic>=3.29) was significantly higher (<italic>p</italic>&lt;0.001) than the CIWA scores reported on day 3 (<italic>M</italic>=15.62, <italic>SD</italic>=2.78). No other significant differences were found between CIWA scores on any other days (<italic>p</italic>&gt;0.05). However, the number of participants reporting severe to very severe withdrawal on the CIWA decreased from 11 people at baseline to six people reporting this high-level severity on day 5.</p>
<p>Patient drug use history was examined to determine any correlation between benzodiazepine use variables and severity of withdrawal as measured by the CIWA-B. There was a non-significant low correlation between the number of years of benzodiazepine use and mean CIWA score (mean score across the 5 days) (<italic>r</italic>=0.191, <italic>p</italic>=0.384) and a non-significant low correlation between the average daily diazepam equivalent dose and mean CIWA score (mean score across the 5 days) (<italic>r</italic>=0.111, <italic>p</italic>=0.613).</p>
<p>There was a non-significant low correlation between baseline scores on the GAD7 and mean CIWA score (mean score across the 5 days) (<italic>r</italic>=0.065, <italic>p</italic>=0.849). There was a significant correlation between GAD7 ‘difficulty in performing everyday function’ scores and mean CIWA (<italic>r</italic>=0.840, <italic>p</italic>=0.018) Note: <italic>N</italic>=11.</p>

<title>Psychological distress</title>
<p>Self-reported levels of psychological distress were recorded for 11 participants at baseline (day 1) and for 5 days of flumazenil infusion using the Kessler Psychological Distress Scale (K10). A significant difference was found between scores on day 1 <italic>(M</italic>=27.11, <italic>SD</italic>=8.831) and on day 3, 4, or 5 of treatment (<italic>M</italic>=16.95, <italic>SD</italic>=7.230), (<italic>t</italic>(18)=4.006, <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.001).

A significant difference was reported between the baseline Global Severity Index (<italic>M</italic>=89.55, <italic>SD</italic>=28.38) and scores taken on day 4 or 5 of treatment (<italic>M</italic>=60.64, <italic>SD</italic>=26.96), (<italic>t</italic>(10)=3.334, <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.001).</p>

<title>Patient acceptance of procedure</title>
<p>Thirteen patients provided information about acceptability of the procedure. The majority of these patients rated the subcutaneous infusion method highly on all three dimensions: How comfortable was the procedure? In total, 75% of patients rated the procedure as extremely comfortable (Median=5, Median Absolute Deviation=0.39, a score of 1 indicating ‘extremely uncomfortable’ and a score of 5 indicating ‘not uncomfortable at all’); Would you have the procedure again? Some 85% of patients reported that they would definitely have the procedure again (Median=5, Median Absolute Deviation=0.39, a score of 1 indicating ‘definitely not’ and 5 indicating ‘definitely’); Would you recommend the treatment to a friend? Of the patients, 85% reported that they would recommend the treatment (Median=5, Median Absolute Deviation=0.39, a score of 1 indicating ‘definitely not’ and 5 indicating ‘definitely’).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Previous studies have shown that intravenous infusion with commercially available pharmaceutical preparations of flumazenil has efficacy in the management of both acute and long-term benzodiazepine withdrawal symptoms. The current study data indicate that subjective benzodiazepine withdrawal symptoms as assessed by CIWA-B were well managed by the subcutaneous flumazenil infusion, and provide proof of concept that continuous subcutaneous infusion of flumazenil formulation is a feasible alternative to intravenous flumazenil administration or benzodiazepine tapering for the management of acute benzodiazepine withdrawal. Given the significant benzodiazepine use history of this cohort, it is apparent that flumazenil is an effective pharmacotherapy for the management of the acute withdrawal phase for a difficult-to-treat patient group. Only mild to moderate withdrawal symptoms were seen, whereas one might otherwise expect to see quite severe withdrawal symptoms in this patient group.</p>
<p>Although plasma flumazenil levels were collected for three patients only, these data demonstrate that flumazenil delivered via the subcutaneous route is associated with flumazenil bioavailability via blood from day 1 of the infusion. CIWA symptoms peaked at day 1 with a significant drop in CIWA score between day 2 and 3. This may suggest that the benzodiazepine withdrawal treatment action of flumazenil is not determined by blood levels but by central nervous system levels, likely associated with increased GABA receptor occupancy, as has been suggested by other researchers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0269881112446532">Savic et al., 1991</xref>). Although data are available regarding receptor occupancy levels with bolus intravenous infusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0269881112446532">Savic et al., 1991</xref>), no data are available to indicate receptor occupancy achieved with continuous subcutaneous or intravenous flumazenil infusion as reported here and in our earlier study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0269881112446532">Hood et al., 2009</xref>). The use of imaging modalities such as positron emission tomography to further explore changes in receptor occupancy over the withdrawal period and associated effects on withdrawal and psychological sequelae is desirable, and could be examined in a future research project.</p>
<p>On both measures of psychological distress (K10 and BSI) significant improvements were seen over the duration of treatment. Persons scoring above 16 on the K10 scale have a one in four chance of having a current anxiety or depressive disorder and 1% chance of ever having made a suicide attempt (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0269881112446532">Andrews and Slade, 2001</xref>). While all but one patient screened scored above 16 at baseline, these had dropped below this level in 60% of participants post-infusion initiation. Baseline anxiety scores assessed by the GAD7 were not found to correlate with withdrawal severity, although perceived difficulty in performing everyday functions was positively correlated with withdrawal severity. It is worth noting that the effect of this indicator of baseline anxiety on withdrawal severity was apparent even when patients were prescribed augmented oxazepam taper over the first 72 h to ameliorate symptoms. Our finding is consistent with those of other researchers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0269881112446532">O’Connor et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0269881112446532">Rickels et al., 1990</xref>) on the importance of baseline anxiety as a predictor of benzodiazepine withdrawal severity. In contrast, patient drug use variables that have been shown in previous studies to be associated with more severe withdrawal, namely benzodiazepine dose and years of use, were not significantly associated with severity of withdrawal symptoms in this study.</p>
<p>Caution must be exercised in interpretation of these data, given that sample size is small and data were not collected under clinical trial conditions. Due to the ambulatory nature of this treatment it is possible that patients may have been able to self-administer benzodiazepines undetected. Although we consider this unlikely, any undetected use would affect the validity of CIWA-B scores.</p>
<p>Subcutaneous infusion has considerable benefits over intravenous administration. Patient acceptance of subcutaneous flumazenil treatment was high on the three measured areas of individual treatment comfort, willingness to undertake a future subsequent treatment using this technique, and willingness to recommend this treatment to a friend. In addition, the need for more invasive, intensive and expensive resources associated with the intravenous route is ameliorated. Also appealing is the ability for patients to remain mobile for the duration of their benzodiazepine withdrawal, either within the environment of an inpatient or residential treatment facility or potentially even within their home environment. The urgent need now for future studies providing direct comparisons between both subcutaneous and intravenous routes, flumazenil blood levels and clinical outcomes is acknowledged.</p>
<p>Having achieved preliminary encouraging results with both subcutaneous and intravenous administered flumazenil in the management of acute benzodiazepine withdrawal, an additional clinical challenge is to address the high relapse rates that continue to plague long-term withdrawal management. Appropriate management may involve the long-term administration of flumazenil over several weeks or months, with intravenous or subcutaneous infusion an impractical method for this long-term flumazenil delivery. Given the good subcutaneous tissue biocompatibility for flumazenil demonstrated in this study, one possible solution is the development of sustained release or depot flumazenil formulations. Authors Hulse and O’Neil have conducted animal studies on an implantable polylactide microsphere and implant flumazenil formulation similar to the biodegradable naltrexone implant which has been developed and used for the long-term management of heroin dependence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0269881112446532">Hulse et al., 2009</xref>). The evident biocompatibility of the current subcutaneous flumazenil formulation is encouraging, and safety testing of a subcutaneous flumazenil implant on human subjects is planned in the near future.</p>
<p>A novel subcutaneous flumazenil infusion therapy for the treatment of benzodiazepine dependence has been presented here in a clinical sample, providing early evidence of excellent tolerability, efficacy and improvement on measures of psychological distress. This is a proof-of-concept study; clinical efficacy of subcutaneous flumazenil infusion for this indication is yet to be substantiated in a randomized clinical trial with strict adherence to a standardized treatment protocol. Nevertheless, this method has potential advantages over existing therapies and is worthy of ongoing research evaluation.</p>
