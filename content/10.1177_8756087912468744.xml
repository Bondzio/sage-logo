<abstract>
<p>Soy protein isolate film modified with gelatin was prepared via solvent casting. The effect of gelatin contents on visual, mechanical, water barrier properties and surface hydrophobicity of the films was investigated. It showed that the film containing 30 wt% gelatin had higher tensile strength, elongation at break, contact angle, and lower water vapor transmission rate. Soy protein isolate/gelatin blend film structures were characterized by Fourier transform infrared. Compared with the other films, the 30 wt% gelatin composite film peak intensity is stronger at 1380 cm<sup>−1</sup> and weaker at 1538 cm<sup>−1</sup>, indicating that the strong hydrogen bonding between –COOH in the soy protein isolate film and –NH<sub>2</sub> in the gelatin led to exposing the –CH<sub>3</sub> groups in the soy protein isolate film. Scanning electron microscopy showed that the 30 wt% gelatin composite film phase morphology was much finer than the other films. This confirmed that the 30 wt% gelatin soy protein isolate/gelatin composite film has good compatibility. The tests performed showed the potential for gelatin to improve the soy protein isolate film properties. This work provided a new approach to explore such films without plasticizer as biodegradable food packaging.</p>

<p>Since late 1980s, edible films from natural polymers have become an ecologically important alternative common synthetic polymer for food or drug packaging.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-8756087912468744">1</xref></sup> Edible films can be made from natural polymers, including proteins, polysaccharides, lipids, or the combination of these components.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-8756087912468744">2</xref></sup> Among them, protein-based edible films are most attractive. Soy protein isolate (SPI) is abundant, inexpensive, biodegradable, and a renewable raw material. It is composed almost exclusively of two globular protein fractions differentiated by sedimentation coefficient: 7S (β-conglycinin) and 11S (glycinin).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-8756087912468744">3</xref></sup> Both fractions have the ability to form films by a two-step process. During the preheating step, protein is unfolded and polymerized into soluble aggregates,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-8756087912468744">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-8756087912468744"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-8756087912468744"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-8756087912468744"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-8756087912468744">8</xref></sup> followed by a cooling step and subsequent surface dehydration, which results in the forming a film network through disulfide cross-linking and hydrophobic bonds. Sulfhydryl groups of 11S protein were reported to be responsible for forming disulfide linkages that results in a three-dimensional network.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-8756087912468744">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-8756087912468744">10</xref></sup> In addition, intermolecular hydrogen-bonded β-sheet structure is essential for the network formation in soy protein film.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-8756087912468744">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-8756087912468744">11</xref></sup></p>
<p>In general, protein films are effective lipid, oxygen, and aroma barriers at low relative humidity (RH). However, soy protein-based films generally exhibit a poor mechanical and water resistance properties. Methods investigated for modifying SPI film properties include physical, chemical, and enzymatic treatments.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-8756087912468744">12</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-8756087912468744"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-8756087912468744"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-8756087912468744"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-8756087912468744"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-8756087912468744"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-8756087912468744"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-8756087912468744"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-8756087912468744"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-8756087912468744"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-8756087912468744">22</xref></sup></p>
<p>An effective approach to improve protein film mechanical strength could be to combine SPI with lipids, polysaccharides, or other proteins. These combinations could give rise to synergistic effects between the components which would make the film properties such as reduced water vapor permeability and optimum flexibility suitable for food packaging. Films from SPI and different compounds mixtures have been obtained.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-8756087912468744">23</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-8756087912468744"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-8756087912468744"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-8756087912468744"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-8756087912468744"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-8756087912468744">28</xref></sup> Gelatin is a water-soluble protein obtained from collagen by acid or alkaline hydrolysis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-8756087912468744">29</xref></sup> As a new material for edible films, its ability to form flexible glassy films has attracted more and more attention.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-8756087912468744">30</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-8756087912468744"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-8756087912468744">32</xref></sup></p>
<p>The mechanical properties of SPI-based films, which were prepared by solution casting or compression molding, can be improved by incorporating gelatin in the soy protein.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-8756087912468744">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-8756087912468744">33</xref></sup> However, there have been few studies on SPI film properties modified with gelatin without plasticizer.</p>
<p>The objective of this work is to prepare SPI films modified with gelatin to increase the mechanical and water barrier properties. The effect of gelatin concentration on the microstructure, mechanical performance, and water resistance of the blended films was elaborated. It is expected that these blend films have potential applications in edible packaging films.</p>

<p>SPI (protein content, minimum 90%, MI600 type) was purchased from Sun-Green Bio-Tech Co., Ltd (Nantong, Jiangsu, China). Gelatin was purchased from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec4-8756087912468744"><title>Preparation of protein composite films</title>
<p>SPI and gelatin film-forming dispersions were prepared as follows. Five grams of SPI was dissolved in 100 mL deionized water at 25°C stirring for about 10 h. Gelatin was hydrated at room temperature for 30 min, and then dissolved in a 50°C water bath stirring for about 2 h. Blend film-forming solutions of 5 wt% total protein were prepared by mixing the above two dispersions with the different SPI to gelatin ratios (100/0, 90/10, 80/20, 70/30, 60/40, 50/ 50, 40/ 60, 0/100 [w/w]). Air bubbles in the SPI/gelatin composite film-forming solutions were removed by dropping ethanol (only minuscule amounts of ethanol were used). The film-forming solutions were cast onto leveled glass plates (10 × 10 cm). The film thickness was controlled by casting the same volume solution (40 mL) on each plate. The castings were dried at 50°C for 5 h. The finished intact films were peeled off the plates. All film samples were preconditioned at room temperature and 65% RH for at least 48 h before testing.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec5-8756087912468744"><title>Characterization</title>
<p>Thickness of the films was measured using a manual stage micrometer (CH-B, Shanghai Shuaining Instrument Co., Ltd., China). Measurements were made in at least six random locations for each film, and an average value was calculated. The average value was used in tensile property and water vapor transmission rate (WVTR) calculations.</p>
<p>All film samples were preconditioned at room temperature and 65% RH, and then weighed (<italic>W</italic><sub>m</sub>). After weighing, they were dried at 105°C for 24 h, and then cooled and weighed (<italic>W</italic><sub>d</sub>). The dry matter content (DM%) was calculated as follows:

</p>
<p>Film transparency was determined by measuring the percent transmittance at 660 nm using a UV/visible spectrophotometer (UV-1000, PGENRAL Co., Ltd, China).</p>
<p>Surface hydrophobicity was estimated by measuring contact angle using a contact angle measuring instrument (Drop Meter A-100, MAIST Co., Ltd, China). Deionized water was placed on the film surface with an automatic piston syringe and photographed. A picture was taken 12 s after the drop was set onto the film. Dynamic contact angles can be calculated by software through analyzing the drop shape. The mean contact angle was calculated from five measurements.</p>
<p>Tensile strength (TS) and elongation at break (EB) were measured on a microcomputer-controlled electronic testing machine (Shenzhen Kaiqiangli Testing Instruments Co., Ltd, China) with an extension rate of 5 mm/min according to ISO527-3: 1995 (E). The measurement was repeated five times for each film, and an average calculated.</p>
<p>WVTR was determined gravimetrically at 25°C according to the ASTM E96-95 method.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-8756087912468744">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-8756087912468744">35</xref></sup> An open aluminum cells containing anhydrous calcium chloride (0% RH) was prepared. The test film was fixed using microcrystalline paraffin, and then placed on the cell. The cell assembly was weighed. It was then placed in a chamber containing saturated potassium chloride solution (83 ± 2% RH) at 25 ± 1°C for 12 h and weighed. The assembly was put in the chamber again and weighed at a given time interval. This step was repeated until a stable permeation (the weight gain difference between two successive weighing was less than 5%) to determine the WVTR through the film. WVTR was measured in triplicate.</p>
<p>The film structure was characterized by Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) (FTLA2000-104, ABB Co., Canada).</p>
<p>The film morphology was characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) (Quanta-2000 type, Fei Company, Dutch) at room temperature.</p>

<sec id="sec8-8756087912468744"><title>Dry matter content and light transmittance</title>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-8756087912468744">Figure 1</xref> shows dry matter (DM) content of SPI/gelatin composite films versus weight percent gelatin. The DM for pure SPI film was 19.4 ± 1.0%, and the pure gelatin film was 13.8 ± 0.7%. It is important to recognize that the SPI film matrix is 80.6% water and the gelatin film is 86.2% water. The composite films were between 13.2 ± 0.7 and 17.0 ± 0.9%, indicating that the composite films contained 83.0–86.8% moisture. The residual moisture in the films is bound water, which acts as a plasticizer.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-8756087912468744">12</xref></sup>
<fig id="fig1-8756087912468744" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p>Dry matter content (DM) of soy protein isolate (SPI)/gelatin composite films with different gelatin fraction.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_8756087912468744-fig1.tif"/>
</fig></p>
<p>Non-linear relationships can describe how DM value for SPI/gelatin composite films change as a function of gelatin content (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-8756087912468744">Figure 1</xref>). Gelatin has an important effect on DM value between 10 and 60 wt% gelatin content. The 20 wt% gelatin content film showed the lower DM value at 13.2 ± 0.7%, suggesting a lower bound water content. The fact is due to an SPI/gelatin interaction. Gelatin can interact with the SPI polar groups, thus hydrophilic sites along the protein chains are not exposed to water molecules, resulting in a lower bound water content.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-8756087912468744">11</xref></sup> A similar explanation was given by Guerrero,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-8756087912468744">33</xref></sup> who worked on SPI and gelatin films processed by compression molding.</p>
<p>Optical transparency is one criterion to judge the additive compatibility in the matrix. Light transmission (T%) at the selected wavelength (660 nm) for SPI/gelatin composite films are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-8756087912468744">Table 1</xref>. The films prepared from 10 to 30 wt% gelatin, compared with the films made from the higher gelatin content, showed higher light transmission at 660 nm. These results showed that the films from SPI and gelatin had good optical transmittance. Increase in optical transmittance of composite films is evidence for good compatibility between SPI and gelatin. As for the films with lower gelatin content (10–30 wt% gelatin), the gelatin fractures were hardly visible, owing to unfolding of gelatin in the SPI matrix and the result of a dilution effect in higher SPI: gelatin ratio systems. A similar phenomenon was found in other study.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-8756087912468744">36</xref></sup> Thus, the uniform network could be formed and the light passed through such a network more easily. As for the films with higher gelatin content (&gt;40 wt%), gelatin content approached saturation in the SPI matrix and intermolecular agglomeration of gelatin might appear. Similar behavior was observed by other authors working with deamidated gluten films,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-8756087912468744">37</xref></sup> where the poor compatibility between SPI and gelatin in SPI/gelatin films with higher gelatin content was observed.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec9-8756087912468744"><title>Surface hydrophobicity</title>
<p>Surface hydrophobicity has been used as an important indication for the protein film. It is usually evaluated by the contact angle between the film surface and the water droplet. Practically, a large contact angle represents a hydrophobic surface, and a small contact angle implies a hydrophilic surface.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-8756087912468744">38</xref></sup></p>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-8756087912468744">Figure 2</xref> shows the contact angles of SPI/gelatin composite films with different gelatin fraction. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-8756087912468744">Figure 2</xref>, the pure SPI film and gelatin film contact angles were 66.5° and 75.0°, respectively, and contact angles of SPI/gelatin composite films were between 65.0° and 109.0°. The SPI/gelatin ratio affects the surface hydrophilicity. The 30 wt % gelatin contact angle was 109.0°. This means that SPI/gelatin composite film with 30 wt% gelatin was less readily wetted, suggesting a higher surface hydrophobicity. This result is attributed to the molecular nature of linear gelatin and globular SPI and the interaction force between SPI and gelatin. The pure SPI film and gelatin film surfaces are hydrophilic in the presence of hydroxyl, amino, carboxyl groups. The gelatin content had an important effect on interaction force between SPI and gelatin, which would result in the exposing hydrophobic groups initially buried in the SPI.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-8756087912468744">33</xref></sup> In addition, as discussed above (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-8756087912468744">Table 1</xref>), when 30 wt% gelatin was incorporated into SPI, good compatibility between SPI and gelatin was observed, indicating strong interaction force between SPI and gelatin. Thus, the more hydrophobic groups were exposed and the higher contact angle was obtained. This corresponded well to the fact that the surface of SPI/gelatin composite film with 30 wt% of gelatin was more hydrophobic. However, as for the films with higher gelatin content, the more hydrophilic groups were incorporated into SPI/gelatin films, resulting in poorer hydrophobicity and the lower contact angles.

<sec id="sec11-8756087912468744"><title>Mechanical properties</title>
<p>TS and EB are film mechanical properties. The effect of gelatin content on TS and EB of composite films are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-8756087912468744">Figure 3</xref>. The TS and EB of pure SPI films were 16.2 MPa and 33.3%. Pure SPI film is known to have a rather low mechanical strength with medium elongation. The gelatin used in current work comes from animal skin, bone, and tendon, and then was processed by alkali hydrolysis. The gelatin film has better mechanical properties.

</fig></p>
<p>As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-8756087912468744">Figure 3</xref>, the composite film TS increased, and subsequently decreased with increased gelatin. The TS was highest (36.5 MPa) at 20 wt% gelatin content. The fact may be attributed to the protein/protein interaction. The SPI amido and the gelatin carboxyl might form hydrogen bonding between the two polymers. The protein/protein interactions were enhanced and the network structure was formed. The network microstructure could improve TS of the SPI/gelatin composites film. A similar result was observed by Jiang et al. working with whey protein isolate and gelatin composite films.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-8756087912468744">39</xref></sup></p>
<p>The EB of the blended film is related to many factors such as structure of composite film, film-forming conditions, and additives. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-8756087912468744">Figure 3</xref>, the EBs of all composite films are between 5 and 65%. This result might be attributed to intermolecular interactions, which causes the protein chains to lack the fluidity and forms a rigid structure. The EB increased, and then decreased with the increasing gelatin content. The 40 wt% gelatin content film showed the highest EB value at 65%. The higher EB was the result of macromolecular relaxations of gelatin. Similar conclusions have been drawn from the research of Cao et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-8756087912468744">28</xref></sup> When the gelatin ratio in the film increased, gelatin-SPI interactions occurred to a lower extent, strongly suggesting that at greater than 40 wt% the gelatin proteins may act as a simple filler in the SPI network, causing phase separation between dispersed gelatin phase and continuous SPI phase and the films with 40–60 wt% gelatin have less EB. A similar phenomenon was also observed by Mauri et al. in investigating blended films of SPI and cod gelatin.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-8756087912468744">36</xref></sup> These results agree with the above discussion, where the gelatin chains plasticized the SPI films at 20–30 wt% gelatin content while the phase separation between dispersed gelatin phase and continuous SPI phase appeared at 40–60 wt% gelatin content. Therefore, the EB increased and then decreased with increasing gelatin content.</p>
<p>Cao<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-8756087912468744">28</xref></sup> reported that the mechanical properties of films made from gelatin and SPI improved progressively with increasing gelatin content and the elongation of films prepared from gelatin alone was higher than all the blended films. The higher TS and EB of films with 20–30 wt% gelatin observed in the present study suggests a plasticization of the SPI films matrix by gelatin, which was caused by interaction forces between SPI and gelatin.</p>

<sec id="sec12-8756087912468744"><title>Barrier property</title>
<p>Barrier property can be measured by WVTR. The macromolecular structure/morphological characteristics of the polymeric matrix affects the barrier characteristics. As depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-8756087912468744">Figure 4</xref>, with 20–40 wt% gelatin in blend films, SPI/gelatin blend films showed lower WVTR to SPI/gelatin blend films with 10 wt% or 50–60 wt% gelatin. WVTR is related to the micropaths in the network microstructure. As discussed in the above section, compared with other films, increasing reticulation of the network is present in composite films with 20–40 wt% gelatin because of interaction between SPI and gelatin. This led to reduce interstitial space among the SPI molecules. The interstitial space is a measure of film free volume, which determines the mass permeability.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-8756087912468744">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-8756087912468744">41</xref></sup> For the SPI/gelatin composite films with 20–40 wt% gelatin, the decrease in free volume of the SPI matrix could increase the tortuosity of the water molecules pathway through the network, with the consequent decrease in WVTR. However, the trend of increasing WVTR was observed in SPI/gelatin composite films with 50–60 wt% gelatin. It is attributed to the poor compatibility between two proteins in SPI/gelatin composite films with 50–60 wt% gelatin, which cause the reorganization of the polymer network and increase in free volume, with the consequent increase in WVTR.

The broad band observed at 3306 cm<sup>−1</sup> is attributable to free and bound O-H, which are able to form hydrogen bonding with the carbonyl group of the peptide linkage in the protein. Absorption peak at 1380  cm<sup>−1</sup> is attributed to −CH<sub>3</sub> vibration. When gelatin was blended with SPI, the peak intensity at 1380  cm<sup>−1</sup> for the SPI/gelatin composite films with 30 wt% gelatin was stronger, compared with pure SPI film (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-8756087912468744">Figure 5b</xref>), indicating that the SPI hydrophobic group (−CH<sub>3</sub>) is exposed under the strong intermolecular force between SPI and gelatin, such as hydrogen bonds, dipole-dipole, and hydrophobic interactions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-8756087912468744">33</xref></sup> In addition, when gelatin was blended with SPI, some gelatin peaks in the 1300–1000 cm<sup>−1</sup> range disappeared, indicating an interaction between gelatin and SPI. So it is evident of good surface hydrophobicity for SPI/gelatin composite film with 30 wt% of gelatin. This is consistent with the larger surface contact angle of SPI/gelatin composite film with 30 wt% gelatin.

<p>The surfaces of pure SPI, pure gelatin, and SPI/gelatin composite films with 10, 30, 60, wt% gelatin were investigated by SEM. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-8756087912468744">Figure 6</xref>, pure SPI film (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-8756087912468744">Figure 6(A)</xref>) and pure gelatin film (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-8756087912468744">Figure 6(E)</xref>) microscopic structures were homogeneous.

The composite film with 30 wt% gelatin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-8756087912468744">Figure 6(C)</xref>) presents much finer phase morphologies, which can be comparable with pure SPI or pure gelatin film, exhibiting good SPI and gelatin compatibility. However, when the gelatin content was 10 wt% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-8756087912468744">Figure 6(B)</xref>) or 60 wt% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-8756087912468744">Figure 6(D)</xref>), it dispersed into SPI matrix unevenly, a scale that showed obvious phase separation. The changing SPI/gelatin surface morphology with increasing gelatin content is due to a strong hydrogen bond interaction between SPI and gelatin. This interaction goes through a maximum at 30 wt% gelatin with better dispersion and a homogeneous and smooth surface. This results in higher mechanical properties with 34.5 MPa TS and 65% EB.

<p>Blend films were prepared based on SPI and gelatin by a simple solvent casting method. Adding 10–30 wt% gelatin into SPI matrix could induce the interactions between SPI and gelatin, leading to a notable compatibility with good visual properties, high surface hydrophobicity, mechanical properties (both TS and EB), and water barrier properties. As gelatin content increased, gelatin content approached saturation in the SPI matrix, which caused phase separation. Thus, these SPI/gelatin composite films showed poor mechanical properties. Therefore, SPI/gelatin composite film containing 30 wt% gelatin has higher surface hydrophobicity and higher water barrier property than other blend films. These results were confirmed by FTIR and SEM. Although some physical properties are good (mainly TS and EB), these blend film containing 30 wt% gelatin is nevertheless highly water-sensitive, making them still far from being a real alternative to the synthetic polymers. These novel SPI/gelatin blend films could, however, serve as an efficient carrier film for active components to be used in food preservation. Further work is headed to investigate the properties of SPI/gelatin blend films with higher gelatin content (&gt;60 wt%) for a better understanding of this biodegradable and edible film.</p>
