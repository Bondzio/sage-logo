<title>A thank you to the previous Editors</title>
<p>I would like to begin this, my first editorial, not by introducing myself but to take this opportunity straight away, to give a big thanks to Graeme Douglas, Steve McCall and Mike McLinden for their excellent work on the journal. As some of you are aware, the Editor(s) of the journal has changed and one cannot deliver enough gratitude for the work the previous editors have done on the journal. As I reflect back on the issues that have been covered by Graeme, Steve and Mike, I certainly see a strong dedication to something that I hope we all believe in, and that is an interdisciplinary and collaborative approach to research, policy and practice.</p>
<p>Under their guidance and watchful eye we have all seen the journal go from strength to strength, aided by some excellent research papers that have taken the journal forward in very positive directions. Directions I hope to continue.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-0264619612445530">
<title>Future directions</title>
<p>In order to aid me in my phase as Editor of the journal, I think it would be useful to comment on my future vision for the journal and for the work I would like to see submitted. As you have probably guessed I believe very strongly in an interdisciplinary approach—where holistic programmes and approaches to research deliver, for me, the highest impact for children and adults who have visual impairment. With this in mind I would like to broaden the submissions of papers to the journal in three particular ways. Firstly to link medical and health with education, social work, and community. For example, I would like to see an increase in submissions from more orthoptists, and ophthalmologists. This does not mean that I wish to take the journal in a medical direction. Far from it, I would like to see in these submissions not only the necessary medical innovations, but how these innovations and research will have a direct impact on the individual or groups of individuals in the community whether at school, home or elsewhere. Linkage between these groups is for me, both necessary and sufficient in order to advance the field.</p>
<p>Secondly, I also wish to encourage more submissions from researchers who are using “newer”, and I use this term very loosely, research methodologies. As the journal is both international and interdisciplinary, I would like to see a broader range of research methodologies utilized. Methodologies that are used within such areas as by anthropologists, demographers, economists, epidemiologists, geographers, historians, physicians, psychologists, sociologists, educators and other scientists, social or otherwise. For example, we see an increase within the education journals the use of ethnography and critical incidence studies, in epidemiology, capture/recapture methods, and so on. Consequently, I would like to broaden the scope of research methodologies within the journal and as the previous editorial team have done, maintain the highest rigour within these methodologies.</p>
<p>This discussion about new methodologies brings me onto the third area where I think the journal can have a greater and more substantial impact within the field. We have all seen over a few years the blurring between academic researchers and professionals working within the field becoming researchers. This blurring or merging of roles as researchers is to be welcomed and supported by this journal. True critical reflection that can be afforded by professionals is something that is of extreme importance and value to all, and by encouraging professionals to become researchers, and to disseminate their critical reflective practice can only enhance the outcome for all.</p>

<sec id="section3-0264619612445530">
<title>A new way to submit articles for publication</title>
<p>Along with the change of editor comes a change of submission procedure, and without sounding like I am stating the obvious, the function of the journal has been and will continue to be to disseminate research. The Editor and Editorial Board has a responsibility to ensure as far as possible that the results reported are valid, and that the conclusions within the paper are supported by the data contained within the article. It is not our job to obstruct the dissemination of research but to promote the best research there is within our field. Reviewers and Editors of papers are responsible for giving thoughtful and constructive advice even if this means papers are rejected. As such I will be continuing the position the previous editors maintained in that I shall be asking reviewers of papers to pay particular attention to the method, data and conclusions of the paper, ensuring that data supports what is being said.</p>
<p>The Journal has a new online submission procedure which can be found at the Journal’s website <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://jvi.sagepub.com/">http://jvi.sagepub.com/</ext-link>. Only submissions through the new online procedure will be considered for anonymous peer review.</p>

<title>To conclude</title>
<p>Although I am a new Editor to the British Journal of Visual Impairment, the previous team will be staying on the Editorial Board—and for that I thank them. I am excited to take over this important role, and I look forward to the next engagement of this journal’s history.</p>
<p>I hope you find this issue and the others to follow interesting, stimulating and most importantly, beneficial.</p>
