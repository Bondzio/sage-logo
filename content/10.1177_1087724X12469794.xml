<abstract>
<p>Local funds for transportation infrastructure are increasingly necessary, even though the U.S. federal government provides billions for urban rail projects. Through analysis of a competitive federal rail program (New Starts), this research tests the hypothesis that local financing decisions—as a demand-side factor in funding allocations—can drive federal rail spending. The analysis also considers alternative explanations for funding outcomes: transportation benefits and political clout. Based on a statistical analysis of 60 projects and 2 brief project profiles, findings indicate that local financial commitment—more than other factors—explains federal awards. Rail expansions that <italic>most</italic> advance federal transportation goals, as captured by program evaluation criteria, are not more likely to receive New Starts awards, but funded projects all met a minimum threshold for benefits. As a result, local decisions on transit funding both rely on and affect the allocation of federal monies.</p>

<p>Local sources of funding provide a growing share of funds for transportation infrastructure. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1087724X12469794">Goldman and Wachs (2003)</xref> identify the related growth in local option taxes as a “quiet revolution in transportation finance.” For transit, funds from the federal level have grown but not as rapidly as has local funding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1087724X12469794">American Public Transportation Association [APTA], 2011</xref>). To enable rail expansion, some cities, special districts, and counties have levied local taxes, and in some areas, like Denver, Miami, and Seattle, voters have approved increased sales tax.</p>
<p>Even with increasing funds from local sources, federal dollars are still vital for most transit expansion projects. The Federal Transit Administration (FTA) enables many rail and other fixed guideway investments through its New Starts (NS) program. In annual project evaluations, the FTA considers both project benefits and local financial commitment, officially with equal weight. With ridership levels frequently well below projections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1087724X12469794">FTA, 2008</xref>), actually implemented projects arguably may not bring the most benefits possible from federal investment.</p>
<p>Given the increasing importance of local funding and capacity, this research hypothesizes that federal award patterns are a response to local financial commitment, beyond the NS evaluation. While previous work on finance has identified the increase in local transportation funding or explored case studies, this research uses a national data set to explore how federal-level awards <italic>respond</italic> to local funding decisions. Local financial commitment, not project benefits, explains funding outcomes among projects in the federal pipeline. The research design also allows for alternative explanatory factors related to project benefits and political factors, while controlling for key metropolitan demand characteristics and exploring two projects in context. Findings show that local actors lead federal action, even as they often depend on federal help, because the strength of local funding can determine the allocation of federal monies. Thus, as in other policy areas, transportation policy makers need to better account for demand-side factors and applicant capacity in program design. The following section describes the evolution of federal funding for urban rail and the NS program. The article next presents existing literature on intergovernmental grantmaking and then presents the NS model and findings.</p>
<sec id="section1-1087724X12469794">
<title>The Evolving Role of Federal Funds for Metropolitan Rail</title>
<p>Local revenue has long been a critical source of funds for transportation infrastructure. During the early 20th century in the United States, cities funded roadway infrastructure through property taxes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1087724X12469794">Taylor, 2004</xref>), and states and the federal government provided some subsidies for rural roads. During the Depression, federal agencies began to provide limited support for urban highways and to envision an interstate system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1087724X12469794">Jones, 2008</xref>). The federal role in infrastructure, of course, dramatically expanded through the interstate program and the highway trust fund, the latter which Congress created in 1956.</p>
<p>Following the launch of the highway trust fund and interstate construction, big city advocates pushed for federal intervention in mass transit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1087724X12469794">Jones, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1087724X12469794">Taylor, 2004</xref>). The federal government began supporting transit by issuing loans. Soon thereafter in 1964 Congress appropriated funds for a program of capital grants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1087724X12469794">Jones, 2008</xref>, p. 144). Currently, the FTA provides substantial capital funds via formula and additional expansion money through the competitive NS program.</p>
<p>The costs of rail infrastructure are tremendous. Even with federal support, local sponsors must secure substantial funds. Since 1995, federal spending on transit capital costs has grown (125%) but more slowly than local and state spending (184% and 156%, respectively; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1087724X12469794">APTA, 2011</xref>, p. 11). The majority of capital spending (US$11 billion of US$16.1 billion in 2008), across local, state, and federal agencies, supports a state of good repair rather than expansion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1087724X12469794">U.S. Department of Transportation, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>The FTA administers the NS program, the current major federal program for rail and other fixed guideway transit expansion.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1087724X12469794">1</xref></sup> In 2005 legislation, Congress authorized US$6.6 billion for the program, initially for a 4-year period (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.fta.dot.gov/12304_2607.html">http://www.fta.dot.gov/12304_2607.html</ext-link>). To receive NS funds, project sponsors must complete a multistage application process.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1087724X12469794">2</xref></sup> After local agencies conduct comprehensive transportation “systems planning” and “alternatives analysis,” they seek FTA authorization for a project to enter into the official first stage, “preliminary engineering” (PE). If successful, the project sponsor and the FTA will sign a full funding grant agreement (FFGA),<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-1087724X12469794">3</xref></sup> after passing through the second stage (“final design”). More projects are in the official pipeline than the FTA will be able to fund (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1087724X12469794">Government Accountability Office [GAO], 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>The FTA annually evaluates projects in the NS pipeline and reports these ratings to Congress. A project’s overall rating is an equal combination of categorical ratings for “local financial commitment” and “project justification,” with the latter approximating benefits. The FTA rates financial commitment based on the share of funds from non-NS sources, the strength of the capital funding plan, and the strength of operating funding (the long-term fiscal capacity of the operator with an expanded system). The FTA may provide up to 80% of project capital costs, although the agency has stated a preference for projects that request a smaller NS share. The FTA provided an average of 55% of capital costs in the grant agreements analyzed in this study (1998-2011).</p>
<p>The Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act of 1991 (ISTEA) defined most of the criteria for project justification or benefits: cost-effectiveness, operating efficiencies, land use, mobility improvements, and environmental benefits. Later legislation added economic development as a criterion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1087724X12469794">GAO, 2008</xref>).The FTA has repeatedly modified the specific <italic>measures</italic> and weights for criteria. For example, prior to the mid-2000s, the FTA used capital cost per <italic>new transit</italic> rider as its measure for cost-effectiveness. This disadvantaged projects along corridors and from metropolitan areas with high transit use. Now, the agency measures cost-effectiveness in hours of transportation system user benefits, a complex tabulation that some claim fails to capture all the benefits from transit investment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1087724X12469794">GAO, 2008</xref>). Most recently, the FTA has proposed a return to anticipated project trips (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1087724X12469794">Reconnecting America, 2012</xref>).</p>
<p>Existing research on transit funding has been highly specialized. Research has examined the challenges of and strategies associated with winning measures to levy taxes for transportation, but without a national cross-section (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1087724X12469794">Beale, Bishop, &amp; Marley, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1087724X12469794">Hannay &amp; Wachs, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1087724X12469794">Peterson, Kinsey, Bartling, &amp; Baybeck, 2008</xref>). Furthermore, these studies have not provided insight on how local funding dynamics <italic>interact</italic> with federal funding decisions. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1087724X12469794">Chen (2007)</xref> uses the NS program to explore the potentially conflicting interests of a principal and agent but does not illuminate why some and not other projects receive federal funds.</p>
<p>This NS analysis hypothesizes that local financing affects federal allocations. The article argues the NS program exemplifies what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1087724X12469794">Altshuler and Luberoff (2003)</xref> term “bottom-up federalism,” in which local actors conceive of and advance projects that secure federal money, with limited relationship to federal objectives. Altshuler and Luberoff use bottom-up federalism to describe the mid-20th century during which “urban mega-projects almost invariably originated and drew their main constituency support locally, with little if any regard for national purposes” (p. 221). Their framework, however, does not utilize existing political science findings on the effects of demand-side factors and capacity on federal allocations.</p>

<sec id="section2-1087724X12469794">
<title>Intergovernmental Grantmaking</title>
<p>Extensive research has examined the allocation of federal funds to subnational governments and other grantees. Work within the fiscal federalism framework (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1087724X12469794">Oates, 2005</xref>, for an overview) has considered fiscal decentralization and municipal budgets. Other research examines more specifically how supply- and demand-side factors influence federal grantmaking. In supply-side studies, federal funds represent a “supply” of money that politicians and officials seek to use for electoral advantage. According to this framework, legislators will direct funding toward their districts to secure voter allegiance, resulting in “pork barrel” spending. Congressional committee memberships could better position legislators to funnel money to their constituents, and several studies have found Senate and House committee memberships have different effects on federal funding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1087724X12469794">Brown, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1087724X12469794">Gamkhar &amp; Ali, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1087724X12469794">Lauderdale, 2008</xref>). Similarly, allocations at the state level may be part of presidential election strategies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1087724X12469794">Gamkhar &amp; Ali, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1087724X12469794">Larcinese, Rizzo, &amp; Testa, 2006</xref>), with swing states potentially receiving more funds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1087724X12469794">Gamkhar &amp; Ali, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>In transportation, evidence for supply-side effects is limited. In a study of highway demonstration grants, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1087724X12469794">Gamkhar and Ali (2007)</xref> find more effect from whether a state is a presidential election swing state or a highway trust fund “donor” state than from Congress-related variables. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1087724X12469794">Brown (2003)</xref> finds statistically significant relationships between total earmarked transit capital dollars received by each state and total state population, percentage of urban population, and whether the state had members on two key House committees. Political variables have limited significance, however, on a per capita basis in his work. Referring to supply-side studies more broadly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1087724X12469794">Lowry and Potoski (2004)</xref> assert evidence for supply-side factors is mixed and “those effects that are found are often subtle and conditional” (p. 515).</p>
<p>Demand-side studies of federal funding instead consider how grantee and local factors—in other words constituent characteristics—influence federal funding patterns. Across seven policy areas, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1087724X12469794">Lowry and Potoski (2004)</xref> conclude the strength of organized interests has significant effects on federal discretionary grants. Lazarus (2010) even argues that constituent characteristics are important in the distribution of earmarks. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1087724X12469794">Bickers and Stein (2004)</xref> find the federal government awards more grants to metropolitan areas with more formal interlocal agreements, suggesting that such agreements create “institutional infrastructure” for federal grants.</p>
<p>Indeed, institutional infrastructure and other capacity issues may be paramount. Capacity was a critical determinant of whether potential grant recipients applied for and did well in another federal, competitive funding program. In an analysis of the educational program called Race to the Top, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1087724X12469794">Manna and Ryan (2011)</xref> find that states with greater capacity were more likely to apply to the Race to the Top program. As for NS, the federal government relies on subnational governments to implement policies, states in the case of Race to the Top, and typically transit agencies for NS.</p>
<p>Given current interest in local funding and history of bottom-up federalism in transportation, this research hypothesizes that the FTA will award NS grants based on local funding conditions. Local financial capacity as a critical variable fits into a demand-side framework, since local financial commitment is a constituent characteristic. The contribution of this research is twofold: First findings build on nascent work on capacity as a demand-side factor. Second, for transportation researchers and policy makers, findings illuminate the interplay of financing across government levels. The analysis below not only tests financial commitment as the critical factor behind success but also allows for alternative explanations, both supply and demand side.</p>

<sec id="section3-1087724X12469794">
<title>Research Design</title>
<p>This research tests the hypothesis that local funding determines federal transit awards, more than program design accounts for. To identify factors that correlate with whether the FTA issues a grant agreement for a project (the dependent variable), this research uses a binomial logistic regression. The data set includes projects that the FTA reviewed for fiscal years 1998 to 2011 (<italic>n</italic> = 60). Project information, including FTA ratings, is available in the agency’s annual reports to Congress. While 60 projects formed the initial set for analysis, the binomial models exclude three projects that were evaluated but sought a 0% share from NS, making a grant agreement impossible. As another indicator of the role of local finance, the research considers the length of time funded projects took to progress through the official pipeline. This dependent variable was modeled using linear regression, with success as a reduced amount of time in the pipeline. The data set for this analysis includes only the funded projects (<italic>n</italic> = 38). For both types of success, funding outcome and time in pipeline, I present a fully specified and parsimonious (simplified) model.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-1087724X12469794">4</xref></sup> The remainder of this subsection describes the independent variables; their descriptive statistics are summarized, by funding outcome, in <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-1087724X12469794">Appendix 1</xref>. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1087724X12469794">Table 1</xref> presents the measures for all independent and dependent variables.</p>

</table-wrap>
<p>The proxy for local financial commitment, the hypothesized critical factor, is the FTA’s financial ratings for each project. As noted above, the FTA financial rating for a project is based on the share of funds from non-NS sources, the strength of the capital funding plan, and the strength of operating funding (the long-term fiscal capacity of the operator with an expanded system). The ratings are ranked categories, which were transformed into ordinal rankings.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-1087724X12469794">5</xref></sup> Because local financial sources and context can change over time, the full model includes the FTA’s first and last ratings as proxies for local financial conditions and support. The financial rating was predicted to show a strong, positive correlation with whether projects were funded. As a secondary indicator of local financing, the fully specified models include the NS share of project costs. A lower share would indicate that local agencies are paying more toward capital investment.</p>
<p>As discussed above, the model allows alternative explanations for funding outcomes. First, the program’s official evaluation bases 50% of its overall rating on “project justification,” or project benefits. Thus, the model uses the FTA’s justification ratings as a proxy for overall project benefits. A significant and positive coefficient that is similar to the financial commitment coefficient would provide evidence that evaluation determines funding. To explore for alternative project factors, the fully specified models also include total project cost.</p>
<p>A second alternative explanation—that supply-side political factors are significant—also was modeled. Following <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1087724X12469794">Brown (2003)</xref>, this research uses Congressional committees as an analysis point. The model incorporates chairpersons rather than the full committee roster, given the large set that would result from membership across 13 years. Every session in which the metropolitan region of the project had a congressperson in a leadership position (on eight committees) was totaled.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-1087724X12469794">6</xref></sup> House and Senate committees were totaled separately, since the chambers may have different effects on federal spending, as discussed above. As a third variable of political clout, the full model includes the number of times a project’s state was a presidential election swing state during the study period (2000, 2004, and 2008).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-1087724X12469794">7</xref></sup></p>
<p>Finally, the fully specified models incorporate several controls to represent metropolitan demand-side factors. Since <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1087724X12469794">Emerson (2002)</xref> found larger metropolitan areas received most NS awards, the model includes urbanized area population (2000 U.S. Census). Given the potentially influential role of metropolitan transit use, the model also includes the share of commuters using transit. Other metropolitan characteristic controls include the number of transit agencies and metropolitan planning organizations in the urbanized area, both to act as proxies for local organized interests.</p>
<sec id="section4-1087724X12469794">
<title>Project Profiles</title>
<p>To provide context for the quantitative findings, this research also includes two brief case studies, from a larger body of work on fast-growth regions.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-1087724X12469794">8</xref></sup> Using interviews and document review, the projects illustrate a range of complex local dynamics that can affect federal spending. The two cases were selected from among the three unfunded projects with high ratings for the variable of significance (local funding). Houston’s light-rail project was selected as a rare case in which local sponsors sought a 0% share. Orlando’s light rail was selected as the project predicted to bring the greatest transportation benefits among the unfunded projects with the highest financial ratings.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-1087724X12469794">9</xref></sup></p>

<title>Success at Reaching a Grant Agreement</title>
<p>Statistical tests provide evidence for the main hypothesis, that local financial capacity determines which projects receive federal funds. The model failed to provide evidence for alternative explanations. In binomial logistic regressions, there is a significant correlation between local financial commitment and the award of funds. The share of commuters using transit, a control for metropolitan characteristics, also correlates with an increased likelihood of funding. Cross-tabulations do show that project benefits met a minimum threshold for funding, but evidence overall fails to indicate that greater benefits correlate with an increased likelihood of funding.</p>
<p>The fully specified regression (Model 1) includes all the independent variables above and has a modest goodness-of-fit score (Cox and Snell <italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> score = .463). It correctly predicted 87% of project outcomes, as seen in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1087724X12469794">Table 2</xref>. The model predicted funded projects more accurately than unfunded projects (92% vs. 76%). As seen in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1087724X12469794">Table 3</xref>, only the project’s last financial rating and the share of commuters using transit have significant coefficients. The coefficient for a project’s last financial rating (3.1) is in the anticipated direction and significant at the .05 level. The share of commuters using transit likewise had a coefficient (42.5) in the anticipated direction; it is significant at the .1 level. A more parsimonious model (Model 2) yielded a slightly weaker goodness-of-fit score (Cox &amp; Snell <italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> score = .415). Its predictions for unfunded projects were also weaker, as seen in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-1087724X12469794">Table 4</xref>. Again, a project’s last financial rating and share of commuters using transit were the only variables with significant coefficients, both in the anticipated direction (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1087724X12469794">Table 3</xref>). The coefficients for both decreased slightly while their significance increased slightly, though remaining at the .05 and .1 levels, respectively. The coefficients for the remainder of the variables, again, lacked statistical significance.</p>

<title>Time in the Pipeline</title>
<p>Linear regression models provide consistent evidence for one alternative explanation, that project benefits increase funding success, if success is defined as speed in the pipeline. Some results indicate a correlation between speed and other independent variables. In these models, the dependent variable is the number of years a project is in the pipeline, with fewer years (less time) indicating increased success. Thus, a variable with a coefficient that is negative indicates a correlation with increased success, while a positive coefficient is associated with less success and speed.</p>
<p>The fully specified model (Model 3) has an <italic>F</italic> statistic indicating the model’s significance, as seen in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table6-1087724X12469794">Table 6</xref>. Two project variables have significant coefficients: first justification scores (at the .01 level) and the NS share of costs (at the .05 level), as <xref ref-type="table" rid="table7-1087724X12469794">Table 7</xref> displays. As the explanation based on evaluation criteria would predict, more beneficial projects (as captured by higher justification ratings) spend less time in the pipeline: a reduction of 2.3 years for each increase in rating. Despite the FTA’s stated preference for projects with smaller NS shares, projects for which the NS share is larger were more successful at moving through the program quickly. According to this model, a 10% larger NS share correlates with a reduction of .7 years in the pipeline.</p>

<p>A more parsimonious model also indicates a significant relationship between time and benefits as well as other variables. Again, the first justification rating had a significant coefficient at the .01 level and the NS share at the .05 level. In this model, Senate leadership appointments, transit commute share, and the first financial rating also had significant coefficients. The coefficient for the first financial rating does have significant effect in the anticipated direction; a higher rating correlates with decreased time and increased success/speed. Its coefficient is smaller and less significant than the first justification rating. The share of residents commuting by transit is a metropolitan control, which is significant in this more parsimonious model. Its positive coefficient indicates increased time for areas with a larger share of transit commuters, a finding that is contrary to expectations that areas with significant transit use are more successful. An increase in Senatorial leadership appointments correlates with a greater length of time in the pipeline and hence less success. This runs counter to the alternative hypothesis that political clout (through pork barrel spending) would shape federal funding patterns. Finally, the NS share of costs again is significantly correlated with success. The main hypothesis and alternative explanations fail to account for the three preceding relationships.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-1087724X12469794">
<title>Case Profiles</title>
<p>The following two projects indicate a potentially wide range of local funding and political factors that can shape federal spending. The first case is a highly rated but unfunded project, a light-rail proposal in metropolitan Orlando, Florida. The Orlando project was selected because it had the highest average justification scores, among the unfunded projects with high financial ratings. Prior to what would have been the next evaluation, the local financial commitment collapsed and the project was terminated.</p>
<p>The area’s transit operator, LYNX, sponsored this light-rail proposal to connect downtown Orlando and the tourist corridor adjacent to Walt Disney World in Orange County, Florida. The Orlando mayor led efforts to implement the line in the late 1990s, but some high-profile tourist businesses opposed the project. After a change in the Orange County Commission’s leadership and continued business pressure, the commission voted (4 to 3) to withdraw its funding for the project. As a result, the Florida Department of Transportation withdrew its funds, and the Orlando mayor then also abandoned the project (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1087724X12469794">Grovdahl, 2007</xref>). Put simply, the failure to reach a full funding grant agreement with the FTA was due to the demise of the sponsor’s partnership and funding plan in 1999, not FTA action. In fact, the collapse of the rail project, with federal funds in place, strained relations between Orlando agencies and the FTA, according to a city official:
<disp-quote>
<p>And it has taken us since that time to recover with FTA and FHWA [Federal Highway Administration] . . . we were the laughing stock for a long time. [The FTA’s position was] . . . do not do what Orlando did. If you’re going to turn something down, don’t bring us to the altar. That is a bad time to have a change of heart.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>For the second profiled project, the sponsor requested a 0% NS share. It thus was the only project, among three projects with the highest financial ratings, with a 0% funding request. The project is a light-rail line from downtown Houston to the Astrodome (7.5 miles). The FTA’s profile for fiscal year 2001 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1087724X12469794">FTA, 2000</xref>) included a substantial NS share, but the subsequent profile’s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1087724X12469794">FTA, 2001</xref>) financial plan had a 0% NS contribution.</p>
<p>Congressional action seems to account for this shift. Representative Tom DeLay, a staunch opponent of light-rail transit who hails from suburban Houston, inserted a provision into federal legislation that temporarily prohibited federal funds for light rail in Houston (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1087724X12469794">Mason, 2001</xref>). Using a county sales tax, the transit agency was able to build the line without NS funds. A real estate developer, who led the rail coalition, explained the mayor’s role in advancing light rail, despite DeLay’s ban on federal funds:
<disp-quote>
<p>Cities all over the country were getting federal funds to do this and we couldn’t get a dime. He [DeLay] cut out his own city, he was chopping off. So we had to deal with that, which was not easy or fun. Fortunately we had a mayor who believed in light-rail, and a number of us were able to show him that it made sense to do it.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>At first glance, it seems odd that the transit agency would expend resources to keep the project in the federal pipeline, but it may have had a longer-term strategy. In fact, later federal legislation directed the U.S. Secretary of Transportation to consider the US$324 million, already expended for the Astrodome line, as a local contribution for future NS projects. By including these funds, the local (non-New Starts) share for the proposed Houston North Corridor Line is higher (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1087724X12469794">FTA, 2010</xref>, p. A-94). Even these brief profiles indicate the complex interaction between local financing, other demand-side characteristics, and federal grant awards.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-1087724X12469794">
<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Statistical analysis supports the hypothesis that local funding influences federal spending patterns. As hypothesized, financial ratings, the proxy for local funding capacity, consistently demonstrated a statistically significant relationship with whether a project received an NS grant agreement. Local financial commitment had a weaker relationship to the time a project spent in the federal pipeline, with a significant correlation in only one model. For the projects described, initially strong financial commitment can fall apart or face roadblocks, and thus, complex dynamics at the local level affect where NS funds are awards. In both cases, actions beyond the FTA’s control and its evaluation demonstrate the variability of local actions on, coalitions for, and opposition to rail projects.</p>
<p>The alternative explanation—that program evaluation criteria determine success at securing federal investment—had evidence only for one measure of success. Local financial commitment is one component of federal evaluation, but its solitary, prime role in the prediction of funding awards exceeds its official role. Only funding commitment, along with a metropolitan variable, correlated with outcomes. Project benefits did not have any coefficients with significance in the prediction of whether a project received a grant agreement. Without relationship to both official rankings, findings suggest a limited influence for evaluation as a whole. On the other hand, the coefficient for project benefits did have significance for the other indicator of success—how long funded projects spent in the pipeline. Another aspect that is part of the official evaluation, the NS share, had a significant but unanticipated impact on the time in the pipeline.</p>
<p>No evidence supported the explanation that supply-side variables for political clout and pork barrel politics determine federal funding. None of the proxies used had significance in the model predicting whether projects were funded. In the prediction of time in the pipeline, Senatorial leadership appointments had significance in one model. The coefficient, however, indicated a relationship opposite to that predicted: Increased Senatorial appointments correlated with less success or longer time spent in the pipeline. Thus, the one instance of significance still does not support this explanation.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Existing research studies and policy reports identify a central role for local financing of infrastructure but often rely on case studies. This research has expanded beyond case studies to a larger set of nation-wide projects. Furthermore, the analysis looks beyond local financing to explore whether federal support, which remains important, <italic>responds to</italic> local capacity and financing decisions for rail.</p>
<p>Statistical analysis supports the hypothesized influence of local financing on whether projects receive funds through the NS program. Evidence was consistently significant for this demand-side explanation—that local financial capacity influences whether a project receives a federal award. This, along with the metropolitan area’s share of transit commuters, were the only consistently significant variables in models predicting which projects were funded. Models did not provide evidence supporting alternative explanations for which projects receive awards.</p>
<p>Local funding, however, had an inconsistently significant relationship to quick movement through the pipeline, another aspect of success. For speed in the pipeline, increased project benefits had a significant effect to shorten time. No proxies for pork barrel politics yielded significant relationships in the anticipated direction for either aspect of success. In fact, in metropolitan Houston, a legislator blocked funds for his region.</p>
<p>Results show some role of program design in funding outcomes but that the actual and official factors differ. As the program evaluation incorporates local financial commitment, some relationship would align with the program’s design. The primacy of this factor alone, without a similar relationship for benefits, however, indicates the importance of local action. Program design may have some effect, as all funded projects at least met the threshold of medium for both benefits and financing. The formal evaluation process may also deter potential sponsors from submitting projects less in line with federal goals. Yet the potential gap between official and actualized funding outcomes frequently is beyond the federal control. Profiled projects demonstrate that complex and unique factors affect whether projects reach grant agreements with the FTA.</p>
<p>The link from local funding to federal decisions may reflect a larger system of federalism and grant making. The underlying structure of the NS program—a competitive program in which federal awards are given to locally created initiatives—is typical of many current federal urban interventions. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1087724X12469794">Altshuler and Luberoff (2003)</xref> describe the bygone era of mega-projects as “bottom-up federalism,” but this characterization may still hold true for rail infrastructure. Federal investment in urban infrastructure relies on subnational capacity, like the educational program discussed above (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1087724X12469794">Manna &amp; Ryan, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>Federal money and national actions can be vital for implementation, but the federal level follows local action rather than shapes national direction for rail investment. For effective policy, regulatory, or programmatic change, policy actors must account for this dynamic and its supporting structures. Because increased benefits do not correlate with an increased likelihood of funding, proposals to change measures of or weights for project benefits will likely have modest results. Federal agencies could seek to support the operating and institutional capacity of transit agencies serving large populations rather than potentially widening the gap between well-funded and fiscally troubled agencies.</p>

<p>A guideway (e.g., a catenary system) or an exclusive right of way makes transit service “fixed guideway.” Rail is fixed guideway, and bus rapid transit with a special right of way can qualify as fixed guideway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1087724X12469794">New Starts Working Group, 2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-1087724X12469794">Appendix 1</xref>).</p>

<p>In the full funding grant agreement (FFGA), the Federal Transit Administration (FTA) commits to seeking Congressional appropriations for the full New Starts (NS) share. Historically, securing appropriations for projects with FFGAs has not proved an obstacle. The FFGAs are multiyear contracts and were developed to protect the federal agency against projects that demanded more federal money for completion than awarded (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1087724X12469794">Chen, 2007</xref>).</p>

<p>The parsimonious binomial model excludes congressional clout measures but retained the swing-state measure, given the limits to the congressional proxies and potentially more important role of swing states/presidents. Speculating <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1087724X12469794">Emerson’s (2002)</xref> finding on large metropolitan areas may have been due to large metros having higher transit shares, the limited model includes just transit share. The organizational proxies for metropolitan capacity (MPOs and transit agencies) were excluded, as they were only experimental. Finally, anticipating that ultimate ratings were more important than initial ratings for funding outcomes, the latter was excluded. The reduced linear model retained the first set of FTA ratings, as these should shape the forward progress and other measures with significance in Pearson’s correlation tests or the initial model (Senate appointments, transit commute share, and NS share of costs).</p>
