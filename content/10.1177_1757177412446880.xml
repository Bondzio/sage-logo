<p>I believe it was Sir Francis Bacon who is quoted as being the first to say ‘knowledge is power,’ back in the 1500s. I am convinced that this is even truer today than it was when he was alive. We live in the age of the global internet where information is only the click of a mouse away. The problem we have is there is no quality control on the internet, so copious amounts of information (much of which is inaccurate) can be retrieved and quoted as fact.</p>
<p>This extends to infection-related information – meticillin resistant <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> (MRSA) bacteraemia data is increasingly misquoted as MRSA data, with communications teams, senior members of hospital staff, and members of the public proudly reporting their trust has had no cases of MRSA for three months/six months/a year. The reality is that these organisations are still seeing cases of MRSA colonisation, and non-bacteraemia infections. There is no doubt that massive improvements in the overall infection rate due to MRSA have been achieved in the past decade, but the remaining burden is perhaps hidden by the misquoted good news on MRSA bacteraemia.</p>
<p>The vision of the Infection Prevention Society is that no person is harmed by a preventable infection, and we remain a long way from that aspirational vision despite the amazing progress made in recent years. If we are to continue moving towards that outcome, we need continuously to generate and access accurate information that informs our knowledge base in relation to healthcare associated infections (HCAI).</p>
<p>A cornerstone of knowledge development is accurate surveillance of infection. Between 2009 and 2011 the European Centers for Disease Control (ECDC) developed methodology for a European Union (EU) survey of healthcare associated infection and antimicrobial resistance. This survey has a number of aims, including the provision of information that can be used at local, regional, national and EU level to guide improvement work. England, Wales and Scotland have all participated and completed data collection and analysis, and Northern Ireland will be participating in the spring this year along with many other EU countries. Wales and Scotland asked all of their hospitals to participate, whereas in England it was left to individual trusts to decide whether to participate or not.</p>
<p>At the time of writing, only Scotland has published their data, and we await with interest the publication of the remaining country-based reports. Headlines from the point prevalence survey (PPS) in Scotland demonstrate an HCAI prevalence of 4.9% in acute care and 2.5% in community hospitals, approximately a third lower than that identified in the previous PPS in Scotland 2005/06. Their results also highlight that the proportion and types of HCAIs changed between 2006 and 2011. Urinary tract infection mainly linked to urinary catheters; surgical site infection; pneumonia; and bloodstream infections comprise the majority of HCAI in acute care, with a much lower number of gastrointestinal infections including <italic>Clostridium difficile</italic> than was seen in 2005/06. Given the focus on HCAI reduction across all countries of the UK and Ireland over the past 5–10 years, it is hoped that a similar reduction in the prevalence of HCAI will be seen when these reports are published.</p>
<p>The data from these PPS reports will add to the surveillance information that already exists both within organisations and that which is publicly available, and it is important that it is used to inform local knowledge for improvement. The outputs from the PPS can be used to identify where local action is needed on hotspot areas, or on specific types of infection, and this can be scaled up to tackle problems at health economy, regional and national level.</p>
<p>As previously stated, infections other than MRSA and <italic>C. difficile</italic> rarely get discussed in broader professional and public arenas, yet the knowledge generated from a survey such as the PPS can provide powerful evidence for action and improvement. The Patients Association recognises the need to move beyond the current ‘target organisms,’ and they state on their website that, ‘A more accurate measure of HCAIs is required in order to generate robust, reliable and credible information for public and professional consumption.’ Surveillance data from the PPS, from existing national surveillance systems, and from local surveillance should provide the cornerstone of knowledge that is needed to achieve this more accurate measure.</p>
<p>There are, however, many gaps in the surveillance information that we have at present. Professor Judith Tanner presented an excellent Webber teleclass in February 2012, which highlighted some of the issues and challenges in achieving robust and reliable surveillance data. The challenges include the need to perform robust post-discharge surveillance, in order to determine the true burden of HCAI, and this is perhaps an area for further development in the future. Given the changing nature of health care, especially in England, it will be more important than ever to have accurate information on infection rates attributable to different organisations and procedures to enable commissioners and the public to make informed choices about providers of care.</p>
<p>Individual organisations who participated in the European point prevalence survey will wish to review their data, identify local hotspot areas, and target improvements. Those with low prevalence rates will I am sure wish to share this news publicly with their local populations and commissioners. Given the current resource constraints within health care across all countries, and the service changes (especially in England), that are resulting in the loss of many experienced infection prevention and control practitioners I very much hope the results from the PPS will also be used to reignite debate. These results provide focus on the overall burden of HCAI across all care settings, and highlight the need to continue to drive down HCAI as an essential element of patient safety programmes. Knowledge is power, and we each need to use the knowledge provided by surveillance to achieve continued improvement for our patients.</p>
