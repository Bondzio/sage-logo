<sec id="section1-1090820X12455190">
<title>Background:</title>
<p>High-intensity focused ultrasonography (HIFU) is a nonsurgical, noninvasive method for body sculpting in nonobese patients. The technique ablates subcutaneous adipose tissue by causing molecular vibrations that increase tissue temperature and induce rapid cell necrosis.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-1090820X12455190">
<title>Objectives:</title>
<p>The authors evaluate the long-term safety of a HIFU device for sculpting the abdomen and flanks.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-1090820X12455190">
<title>Methods:</title>
<p>Adults with subcutaneous abdominal fat ≥2.5 cm in thickness who met screening criteria were randomized to receive HIFU treatment of the anterior abdomen and flanks at 1 of 3 energy levels (3 passes per patient): 47 J/cm<sup>2</sup> (141 J/cm<sup>2</sup> total), 59 J/cm<sup>2</sup> (177 J/cm<sup>2</sup> total), or 0 J/cm<sup>2</sup> (no energy applied; sham control). Safety was assessed for 24 weeks and included laboratory testing, physical examinations, and documentation of adverse events.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1090820X12455190">
<title>Results:</title>
<p>Adverse events (AE) included mild to moderate discomfort, ecchymosis, and edema, all of which were transient. There were no reports of scarring or burns and no clinically meaningful changes in lipid panel findings, inflammatory markers, or renal or hepatic function. Physical examination results were unremarkable.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1090820X12455190">
<title>Conclusions:</title>
<p>This HIFU device exhibited an AE profile similar to that of sham treatment. There were no significant changes from baseline in laboratory values, including lipid levels.</p>

<body>
<p>Body-sculpting procedures are an effective adjunct to diet and exercise for the improvement of body contour. For nonobese patients who desire a noninvasive approach to fat reduction for specific problem areas (eg, abdomen, hips, thighs), newer noninvasive body-sculpting technologies are an option. Noninvasive body-sculpting methods currently in use or development include cryolipolysis,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1090820X12455190">1</xref></sup> radiofrequency ablation,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1090820X12455190">2</xref></sup> low-level external laser therapy, injection lipolysis, low-intensity/low-frequency nonthermal ultrasonography,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1090820X12455190">3</xref></sup> and high-intensity focused ultrasonography (HIFU).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1090820X12455190">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1090820X12455190"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1090820X12455190">6</xref></sup> High-intensity focused ultrasonography ablates subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT) by causing molecular vibrations that increase the temperature of local tissue and induce rapid cell necrosis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1090820X12455190">7</xref></sup> It also has been reported to contract collagen.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1090820X12455190">8</xref></sup> The characteristics of HIFU make it well suited for removing localized deposits of SAT while sparing surrounding and superficial tissue.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1090820X12455190">7</xref></sup></p>
<p>At high frequencies (eg, 2 MHz), ultrasound energy is highly convergent, such that tissue damage is confined to a small focal volume<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1090820X12455190">9</xref></sup> and the length of the lesion can be controlled by increasing or decreasing the energy dose.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1090820X12455190">7</xref></sup> Thus, ablation of SAT can be accomplished without damaging the dermis or other tissues outside the focal point. After the lesion is formed within the SAT, the body’s normal healing process occurs. Macrophages proliferate in the treated area and remove the cellular debris, including extracellular lipids.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1090820X12455190">10</xref></sup> The liberation of lipids from adipocytes has not presented a safety concern; in clinical studies, there has been no increase in systemic lipid profile values or related adverse events (AE) such as fat emboli and gallstones.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1090820X12455190">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1090820X12455190">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1090820X12455190">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1090820X12455190">12</xref></sup></p>
<p>An HIFU device with user-adjustable fluence and depth (LipoSonix system; Medicis Technologies Corp, Scottsdale, Arizona) has market clearance in the United States, Canada, and the European Union. Safety and efficacy data from 2 randomized trials of a single HIFU treatment have been published. In a 12-week, randomized, uncontrolled, single-blind trial, HIFU treatment of the anterior abdomen at energy levels of 47, 52, or 59 J/cm<sup>2</sup>, each applied in 3 passes at graduated depths, significantly reduced the least squares (LS) mean waist circumference by 2.5 cm.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1090820X12455190">6</xref></sup> A randomized, sham-controlled, single-blind trial evaluated the efficacy of HIFU through 12 weeks and safety through 24 weeks after HIFU treatment of the anterior abdomen and flanks with energy levels of 0, 47, or 59 J/cm<sup>2</sup>, each in 3 passes at a single depth.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1090820X12455190">4</xref></sup> Both active treatments reduced LS mean waist circumference by &gt;2 cm.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1090820X12455190">4</xref></sup> In both of these trials, positive aesthetic outcomes also were indicated by secondary subjective aesthetic assessments, investigator evaluation on a Global Aesthetic Improvement Scale, and a nonvalidated patient satisfaction questionnaire.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1090820X12455190">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1090820X12455190">6</xref></sup> Overall, HIFU treatment was well tolerated; AE consisted mainly of mild or transient abdominal ecchymosis or redness.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1090820X12455190">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1090820X12455190">6</xref></sup></p>

<title>Study Design</title>
<p>This randomized, single-blind, sham-controlled study of the safety and efficacy of an HIFU device for waist circumference reduction was conducted at 9 clinical sites in the United States. The study received investigational device exemption and was approved by the Western Institutional Review Board (Olympia, Washington) and conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and Good Clinical Practice guidelines. All patients provided written informed consent. The trial was registered on May 19, 2009 (ClinicalTrials.gov NCT00906815), and the first patient was enrolled on June 17, 2009.</p>
<p>Efficacy was assessed through 12 weeks posttreatment, and safety was evaluated through 24 weeks posttreatment. Detailed methods and 12-week safety and efficacy findings have been published.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1090820X12455190">4</xref></sup> The present study focused on the full safety data through posttreatment week 24.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-1090820X12455190">
<title>Patients</title>
<p>Men and women (18-65 years of age) whose body mass index (BMI) was ≤30 mg/kg<sup>2</sup> and SAT thickness was ≥2.5 cm in the treatment region were eligible to participate. Pregnant or lactating women were excluded. Other major exclusion criteria were coagulation disorders or medications that could affect coagulation, diabetes and cardiovascular disease, prior aesthetic procedure or surgery/surgical scar in the treatment region; skin or tissue abnormality in the treatment region, and weight reduction medication or procedures. After excluding patients with these conditions, 180 qualifying men and women were included in the study. Patients were instructed to not change their normal diet or exercise routines during their participation in the study. This requirement was reinforced verbally by the study staff and by reminder cards given to the patients at each visit.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-1090820X12455190">
<title>Treatment</title>
<p>Patients were assigned randomly, in single-blind fashion, to receive HIFU treatment of the anterior abdomen and flanks at 1 of 3 total doses of energy: 177 J/cm<sup>2</sup> (3 passes at 59 J/cm<sup>2</sup>), 141 J/cm<sup>2</sup> (3 passes at 47 J/cm<sup>2</sup>), or 0 J/cm<sup>2</sup> (3 passes at 0 J/cm<sup>2</sup>; sham group). Each pass was applied at a focal depth of 1.3 cm below the skin to a series of 2.8 × 2.8-cm treatment grids that had been marked by the investigator beforehand. Patient discomfort was managed at the investigator’s discretion (eg, oral analgesics could be administered before, during, or after the procedure). Each treatment zone took approximately 60 seconds for the HIFU treatment. Depending on the number of zones to be treated, The zone would be re-treated in 12 to 15 minutes, as the zones were sequentially treated.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-1090820X12455190">
<title>Assessments</title>
<p>Patients returned for follow-up visits at posttreatment weeks 4, 8, 12, and 24. In addition, they received a telephone call at weeks 16 and 20 to assess AE and concomitant use of medication.</p>
<p>Patients underwent a comprehensive physical examination at screening and week 12. At each visit, patients were questioned about any changes to their diet or exercise habits, and their weight was monitored for any significant changes that might indicate changes in diet or exercise. The treatment area was examined at each visit, waist circumference was measured,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1090820X12455190">13</xref></sup> and diagnostic ultrasonography of the treatment area was performed at screening and posttreatment weeks 4, 12, and 24 to detect any abnormalities. During the procedure, patients rated their level of discomfort using a 4-point verbal pain assessment scale (ie, none, mild, moderate, severe). Discomfort on the first 7 days posttreatment was evaluated using a 100-mm visual analog scale (VAS; 0-4 = no pain, 5-44 = mild pain, 45-74 = moderate pain, 75-100 = severe pain).</p>
<p>Blood samples were obtained at baseline, within 1 hour after treatment, and at each follow-up visit and were used to analyze lipid panel values (total cholesterol, high- density lipoprotein [HDL], low-density lipoprotein [LDL], triglyceride, free fatty acid, very low-density lipoprotein [VLDL]), inflammatory markers (erythrocyte sedimentation rate, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein [hsCRP], rheumatoid factor), coagulation (prothrombin time, partial prothrombin time, fibrinogen), and renal function (creatinine, blood urea nitrogen). These blood samples also were used to evaluate hematology (white and red blood cell counts, hematocrit, hemoglobin, mean corpuscular volume, mean corpuscular hemoglobin, mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration, relative cell distributive width, platelet count, mean platelet volume), liver and pancreatic function (alanine transaminase, aspartate aminotransferase, alkaline phosphatase, γ-glutamyl transpeptidase, total bilirubin, amylase, lipase, albumin, total protein), and chemistry (sodium, potassium, chloride, bicarbonate, glucose, uric acid, calcium, phosphorus, magnesium, glycerol).</p>
<p>Adverse events were assessed by the investigator during each visit and telephone interview. An AE was defined as serious (SAE) if it was life threatening, resulted in permanent impairment of a body function or permanent damage to a body structure, or necessitated medical or surgical intervention to preclude these outcomes. An unanticipated adverse device-related effect was defined as any serious effect on health or safety, life-threatening problem, or death associated with the device that had not been specified in the investigational plan or labeling information.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-1090820X12455190">
<title>Statistical Analysis</title>
<p>Efficacy and safety were analyzed in the intent-to-treat (ITT) population, which comprised all treated patients. Efficacy also was analyzed in the per-protocol (PP) population, which included only the patients who had no major protocol violation. The primary efficacy end point was analyzed using analysis of covariance of the LS mean, with treatment and study site as fixed effects, and baseline waist circumference and change in weight from baseline as covariates. Least squares mean (the group mean, corrected for imbalances in other variables by holding them at the mean value) was used to help control for any changes in body weight. Safety data were analyzed using descriptive statistics.</p>

<title>Adverse Events</title>
<p>The most common AE deemed related to treatment were procedural pain, postprocedure pain, ecchymosis, and swelling (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1090820X12455190">Table 2</xref>). Most patients had mild or moderate pain during the procedure. Three patients (5%) in the 47-J/cm<sup>2</sup> group and 6 patients (10%) in the 59-J/cm<sup>2</sup> group reported severe pain. After the procedure, no patient reported severe pain. All pain resolved within 7 to 10 days after the procedure. Among the active-treatment population, 60 patients (49%) experienced mild ecchymosis, 20 (16%) had moderate ecchymosis, and 1 (&lt;1%) had severe ecchymosis. The average times to resolution in the 47-J/cm<sup>2</sup> and 59-J/cm<sup>2</sup> groups (respectively) were 12 and 14 days for ecchymosis, 13 and 16 days for swelling, and 8 and 10 days for postprocedural pain.</p>

<p>Discomfort directly after treatment, as measured by the 100-mm VAS, was greater for active-treatment patients (47 J/cm<sup>2</sup>, 23.5 mm; 59 J/cm<sup>2</sup>, 32.5 mm) than for sham controls (3.0 mm). Mean VAS scores remained higher with active treatment (range, 2.4-32.5 mm vs ≤4 mm for sham) at all assessments until day 5, at which time the mean score was 3.9 mm in the 47-J/cm<sup>2</sup> group and 7.4 mm in the 59-J/cm<sup>2</sup> group. Ratings (verbal scale) of no or mild pain (VAS 0-44), moderate pain (VAS 45-74), and severe pain (VAS 75-100) during treatment were given by 54% (32 of 59), 41% (24 of 59), and 5% (3 or 59) of patients in the 47-J/cm<sup>2</sup> group (respectively); by 29% (18 of 63), 60% (38 of 63), and 11% (7 of 63) of patients in the 59-J/cm<sup>2</sup> group; and by 98% (57 of 58), 2% (1 of 58), and 0% of sham controls. On posttreatment day 1, the percentage of patients who rated their pain as none/mild, moderate, or severe was 79% (46 of 58), 19% (11 of 58), and 2% (1 of 58) in the 47-J/cm<sup>2</sup> group; 67% (41 of 61), 23% (14 of 61), and 10% (6 of 61) in the 59-J/cm<sup>2</sup> group; and 96% (54 of 56), 4% (2 of 56), and 0% in the sham group. By posttreatment day 5, the mean VAS scores reflected mild pain (score &lt;10) for all groups.</p>
<p>At the discretion of the treating investigator, some patients (22%; 40 of 180) received an oral analgesic before, during, or after the procedure. Analgesia use increased with energy level: sham, 7 of 58 patients (12%); 47 J/cm<sup>2</sup>, 13 of 59 patients (22%); and 59 J/cm<sup>2</sup>, 20 of 63 patients (32%). Analgesics were most frequently administered before the procedure (sham, 10.3%; 47 J/cm<sup>2</sup>, 20.3%; 59 J/cm<sup>2</sup>, 28.6%) as opposed to during the procedure (sham, 5.2%; 47 J/cm<sup>2</sup>, 13.6%; 59 J/cm<sup>2</sup>, 20.6%) or after it (sham, 6.9%; 47 J/cm<sup>2</sup>, 11.9%; 59 J/cm<sup>2</sup>, 22.2%). Most analgesics were nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs such as acetaminophen, ibuprofen, and naproxen; all were administered orally.</p>
<p>No AE reported after week 12 was determined to be treatment related. There were 2 SAE: community-acquired pneumonia and breast cancer. Both were deemed unrelated to HIFU treatment. No unanticipated device-related AE occurred at any time during the study.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In this randomized, sham-controlled, single-blind trial, the safety profile of total HIFU doses of 141 J/cm<sup>2</sup> and 177 J/cm<sup>2</sup> (3 passes each of 47 J/cm<sup>2</sup> or 59 J/cm<sup>2</sup>, respectively) applied to the anterior abdomen and flanks was similar to that of sham treatment (3 passes at 0 J/cm<sup>2</sup>). Active treatment was generally well tolerated through 24 weeks posttreatment. There were no burns or other skin AE and no meaningful changes in laboratory tests, including lipid profile, inflammatory markers, liver function, or renal function.</p>
<p>Previous clinical reports of HIFU treatment for body sculpting, which included follow-up to ≤16 weeks, consistently demonstrated mild transient AE such as edema, ecchymosis, and pain.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1090820X12455190">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1090820X12455190">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1090820X12455190">14</xref></sup> Safety findings of the current report, the first randomized trial to assess safety through 24 weeks posttreatment, are consistent with those data. Common treatment-related AE that were more common with active treatment (vs sham) were procedural and postprocedural pain, ecchymosis, and swelling,―none of which persisted beyond 16 days posttreatment. No new treatment-related AE occurred after the initial 12 weeks of follow-up. In a report of the efficacy and safety of HIFU during the initial 12 weeks of this study, we noted that pain during the first week posttreatment (VAS) was mild (on average) and resolved within 7 to 10 days after treatment; 22% of the overall study population used analgesics before, during, or after the procedure.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1090820X12455190">4</xref></sup> During the 24-week follow-up, there were no treatment-related SAE or unanticipated adverse device-related effects.</p>
<p>There were no reports of skin dimpling, indurations, or increased skin laxity in the current study. The absence of skin damage, such as burns and scars, is consistent with the properties of HIFU, which, at the frequency used (2 MHz), consist of highly convergent energy that produces a tissue effect only within the focal volume, with preservation of surrounding and superficial tissues.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1090820X12455190">9</xref></sup> Compared with the lower HIFU frequencies used in low-intensity nonthermal focused ultrasonography (0.2 MHz),<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1090820X12455190">15</xref></sup> 2-MHz waves are attenuated faster, reducing the likelihood of the mechanical process of acoustic cavitation, which can lead to irregular lesions and adversely affect overlying tissue.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1090820X12455190">7</xref></sup> At 2 MHz, the tightly focused transducer of the system used in this study produces lesions that are approximately 1 mm wide and 10 mm long.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1090820X12455190">7</xref></sup> In pilot studies, gross pathologic and histologic findings of patients undergoing HIFU treatment before abdominoplasty repeatedly demonstrated discrete regions of coagulative necrosis of adipocyte tissue spatially isolated from the dermis and epidermis, consistent with focal depth of the ultrasonic energy.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1090820X12455190">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1090820X12455190">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1090820X12455190">11</xref></sup> Resorption of the damaged tissue was observed between 8 and 16 weeks posttreatment, with no dystrophic calcification, fat necrosis, sterile abscess, or fistula.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1090820X12455190">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1090820X12455190">16</xref></sup> Computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging showed no skin or intra-abdominal organ damage.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1090820X12455190">11</xref></sup> We excluded patients who had underlying abnormalities of the skin or soft tissues of the abdominal wall (eg, hernia) in the areas to be treated, in an effort to reduce the potential for treatment-related complications in those regions; this practice should be mandatory.</p>
<p>During the 24 weeks of follow-up, there were no clinically meaningful changes or trends from baseline in lipid panel findings, liver function, renal function, or inflammatory markers in any study group. This was expected given the mechanism of action of HIFU, whereby lesion formation is followed by a normal healing process in which macrophages remove free lipids. Histologic studies in patients who received HIFU treatment have shown a mild tissue response 7 days after treatment consisting primarily of macrophages, and macrophages containing released lipids have been seen 8 to 12 weeks posttreatment.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1090820X12455190">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1090820X12455190">11</xref></sup> There was no indication that the lipids liberated from HIFU treatment had been released directly into the systemic circulation. Similarly, a preclinical study of HIFU treatment showed no fatty liver changes or other systemic abnormalities.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1090820X12455190">16</xref></sup> Moreover, pilot clinical studies of HIFU treatment for body sculpting showed no clinically significant changes from baseline in findings on lipid panels, metabolic panels, amylase, lipase, or hematology.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1090820X12455190">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1090820X12455190">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1090820X12455190">17</xref></sup> Thus, the 24-week safety results for the present study were consistent with those of preclinical and early pilot studies of HIFU and with the 12-week data for the current study.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1090820X12455190">4</xref></sup></p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>In this randomized, sham-controlled study of noninvasive sculpting of the abdomen, the 24-week safety profile of HIFU was similar to that of sham treatment. The procedure was generally well tolerated at total doses of 141 J/cm<sup>2</sup> and 177 J/cm<sup>2</sup>. The most common treatment-related AE were pain, ecchymosis, and swelling. No burns or scarring occurred, and there were no clinically meaningful changes in lipid findings or inflammatory markers.</p>
