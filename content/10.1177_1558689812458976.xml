<abstract>
<p>A mixed method design was used to conduct a content analysis of the mission statements of colleges of engineering to map inductively derived codes with the EC 2000 outcomes and to test if any of the codes were significantly associated with institutions with reasonably strong representation of women. Most institution’s (25 of 48) mission statement had two or fewer of the outcomes endorsed by the accrediting agency. The diversity code was significantly related to the representation of women, but is not one of the outcomes identified by the accrediting agency. The research demonstrates how mixed methods can be applied to content analysis.</p>

<body>
<p>Virtually every institution in higher education has a mission statement that is designed to communicate with a variety of internal and external audiences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1558689812458976">Walton, 2005</xref>). They are often produced through the strategic planning process in organizations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1558689812458976">Firmin &amp; Gilson, 2010</xref>) or in preparation for an accreditation visit. In the best of all worlds, they are cultural artifacts in that they are written to mirror an institution’s overall vision and purpose (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1558689812458976">Kibuuka, 2001</xref>), to distinguish them from other institutions, and to serve as a guide for everyday practice. A more skeptical view is that mission statements are aspirational in nature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1558689812458976">Walton, 2005</xref>) and use vague language that promises generic qualities, such as excellence, that cannot be measured (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1558689812458976">Morphew &amp; Hartley, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>ABET (formerly the Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology) is a U.S.-based nonprofit organization that provides accreditation standards that apply to more than 3,100 programs in the applied sciences, computing, engineering, and technology education at more than 600 colleges and universities worldwide (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.abet.org">http://www.abet.org</ext-link>). In 1996, ABET undertook a lengthy process of seeking input about revising the accreditation standards for engineering programs. Revisions to the accreditation standards, referred to variously as ABET engineering criteria or Engineering Criteria 2000 (EC 2000), reflect an emphasis on educational outcomes, assessment, and a set of skills above and beyond the foundational requirements for technical and mathematical competency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1558689812458976">ABET, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1558689812458976">National Academy of Engineering, 2004</xref>). The new accreditation standards required that engineering programs demonstrate that their graduates achieved 11 learning outcomes. These extend from the ability to apply foundational knowledge to practice to a broader set of skills sometimes associated with the liberal arts, such as the ability to work on teams, communicate effectively, design systems, and understand the global impact of engineering solutions. The changes to the accreditation standards in engineering were predicted to permeate institutional culture and to reshape college students’ educational experiences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1558689812458976">Lattuca, Terenzini, &amp; Volkwein, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>The emphasis on a broader set of skills found in EC 2000 reflects the interests of employers, but also seem to reflect an interest to create a more diverse engineering workforce. Some of the outcomes refer to aspects of engineering that are thought to have a particular appeal to women. Collaboration, an emphasis on teaching and personal interaction with faculty, and the potential to design creative solutions with wide social impact have been said to be elements of the engineering curriculum that are particularly attractive to women (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1558689812458976">Felder, Felder, Mauney, Hamrin, &amp; Dietz, 1995</xref>; Robinson &amp; Reilly, 1993). It has not been documented that there are significant differences by gender in the role an interest in diversity plays in the choice of curriculum or institution.</p>
<p>A comparison of the themes emphasized in a mission statement by colleges/schools of engineering<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1558689812458976">1</xref></sup> with above-average and below-average enrollment of women provides a way to test the hypothesis that the ABET engineering criteria had the potential to promote diversity by attracting more women to engineering.</p>
<sec id="section1-1558689812458976">
<title>Purpose</title>
<p>This research addresses two practical questions of interest to prospective students and faculty members in engineering as well as industry partners. This is whether there are meaningful differences between the cultural values and beliefs espoused in mission statements developed by colleges of engineering and those promulgated by EC 2000 and whether there is any significant association between any of the new criteria and greater representation of women. The study used a two-phase exploratory mixed methods design (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1558689812458976">Creswell &amp; Plano Clark, 2011</xref>) by conducting a content analysis with both inductive (qualitative) and deductive (quantitative) phases to analyze the themes in the mission statements of a stratified sample of colleges of engineering with ABET accredited programs in the United States. Content analysis provided a methodology to identify which of the educational outcomes officially endorsed by the engineering accrediting agency have been most broadly incorporated into the culture and practices of colleges of engineering. The inductive approach used in the first phase of the study made it possible to explore the outcomes identified in mission statements that extend beyond those officially sanctioned by the accreditation standards. An added reason for incorporating an inductive component to the study is to offset the tendency of deductive or hypotheses testing approach to be confirmatory.</p>
<p>The deductive phase of this research tested the hypothesis that the appearance of certain words in a mission statement, such as collaboration and an emphasis on the social implications of engineering applications, is associated with higher than average enrollments of women than those that lacked such references. The interest in gender reflects the link between this research and a recently completed study funded by the National Science Foundation (GSE 0522767) that hypothesized but failed confirm with quantitative statistical procedures a pattern of systematic differences in the cultures of institutions with low and high proportional enrollments of women in undergraduate engineering (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1558689812458976">Creamer, 2011</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1558689812458976">2012</xref>).</p>

<title>Related Literature</title>
<p>Content analysis is a methodology used to make replicable or valid inferences from texts, which can include text as well as visual media and artifacts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1558689812458976">Krippendorff, 2004</xref>; Weber, 1985). Content analysis has most frequently been done using a quantitative approach, mainly through counting the occurrence of words (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1558689812458976">Hsieh &amp; Shannon, 2005</xref>). As an unobtrusive measure, one of the advantages of content analysis is that the data cannot be contaminated during the process of data collection.</p>
<p>Scholars in a variety of academic fields also have used content analysis to analyze themes present in mission statements. Mission statements are official documents that can be readily accessed by the public through the Internet. Although <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1558689812458976">Delucchi (1997)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1558689812458976">Morphew and Hartley (2006)</xref> are among the authors that have maintained that there is little research about mission statements in higher education, what is a more accurate statement is that the research literature is dispersed across a variety of disciplines. Articles reporting on findings from a content analysis of mission statements were found in fields as diverse as consumer studies, business, Christian education, and educational policy and management. No research was uncovered, however, that examined mission statements in engineering or STEM-focused institutions, nor that used a mixed methods approach.</p>
<p>Mission statements have been examined in a variety of contexts in higher education. These range from a broad comparison of U.S. institutions by Carnegie Classification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1558689812458976">Morphew &amp; Hartley, 2006</xref>) to a narrower framework comparing the mission statements of institutions from the same sector. An analysis of mission statements within the same sector included a comparison of women colleges (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1558689812458976">Lundquist &amp; Rice, 1991</xref>), Christian colleges (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1558689812458976">Firmin &amp; Gilson, 2010</xref>), and liberal arts colleges (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1558689812458976">Delucchi, 1997</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1558689812458976">Stearns and Borna (1998)</xref> used a content analysis of mission statements to assess the diffusion of accreditation standards in business programs. This is an example of an analysis at the school or college, rather than departmental, level.</p>
<p>In the international arena, mission statements have been studied to compare corporate and traditional universities in the United States and the United Kingdom (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1558689812458976">Walton, 2005</xref>) and higher education institutions in Wales (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1558689812458976">James &amp; Huisman, 2009</xref>) and East Africa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1558689812458976">Kibuuka, 2001</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1558689812458976">Walton (2005)</xref> concluded that there was greater diversity in the mission statements from institutions in the United States than in the United Kingdom but that higher education institutions in the two countries shared many foundational variables or codes, such as references to research, scholarship, learning, and service. The same codes emerged during James and Huisman’s analysis.</p>
<p>A comparison of the codes that emerged from the analysis of mission statements within different sectors of higher education in the United States reveal a few common codes but at the same time great variety. References to teaching and learning, research and scholarship, collaboration and partnerships, and service and outreach emerged in most of the studies examined. References to diversity were noted only in studies that included the mission statements of liberal arts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1558689812458976">Delucchi, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1558689812458976">Morphew &amp; Hartley, 2006</xref>) and doctoral institutions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1558689812458976">Morphew &amp; Hartley, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1558689812458976">Morphew and Hartley (2006)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1558689812458976">Walton (2005)</xref>, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1558689812458976">James and Huisman (2009)</xref> are among the researchers that have expressed surprise in the variety of themes encountered in mission statements. The broader the scope of the comparison, the greater the number of themes that are likely to emerge in an inductive analysis. Studying statements from variety of institutional types, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1558689812458976">Morphew and Hartley’s (2006)</xref> inductive method produced 118 distinct codes among 299 mission statements. The inductive approach is labor intensive but has the potential to identify elements of practice that may be emerging in a segment within higher education. The caveat with either a deductive or inductive approach is that there is no way to determine if the values endorsed in mission statements emerged from practice and reflect institutional culture or if they, instead, are aspirational in nature and motivated by the desire to change attitudes and drive practice.</p>

<title>Methodology</title>
<p>Mixed methods research deliberately sets out to consider a question of interest through both a qualitative or inductive and quantitative or deductive lens. We conducted this sequential exploratory mixed methods content analysis of mission statements in two phases. This sequential mixed methods research project had an initial inductive phase of analysis that was followed by a deductive or quantitative component.</p>
<sec id="section4-1558689812458976">
<title>Sample of Institutions</title>
<p>We used mission statements from an identical sample of institutions in the qualitative and quantitative phases of the study. Both were drawn adhering to standards set by the quantitative tradition. Because it is based on probalistic sampling, the sampling method used for the study means that the results are generalizable. This could be taken as an indication that priority was awarded to the quantitative portion of the study.</p>
<p>In the fall of 2010, the authors identified a stratified random sample of 48 colleges/schools of engineering from data supplied by 342 colleges and school of engineering and made publicly available online and now called the <italic>Engineering College Profiles and Statistics Book</italic> by the American Society of Engineering Education (ASEE). This database was used because it includes a broad range of information relevant to the study, including information by year about the number undergraduate and graduate degrees awarded by engineering subdiscipline, the proportion and number of degrees awarded to women and minorities, and the representation of women among the faculty in engineering. We first used an Excel database supplied by ASEE to rank colleges by the percentage of women among the 2008-2009 graduating class. The sample was structured so that the number of institutions was equally divided among four categories of proportional enrollment of women (less than 10%, 11% to 17%, 18% to 25%, and 26% or more). A random sample within each category was selected next.</p>
<p>We only coded statements that were labeled as a mission statement and that were available through the institution’s Internet webpages or that were emailed to the second author on request. Statements ranged in length from a single to multiple paragraphs.</p>

<p>A comparison of the disciplinary mix of programs at the institutions in the sample shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1558689812458976">Table 1</xref> and the national profile provides support for the representativeness, and thus generalizablity, of the sample of institutions. Despite a selection criterion that stratified the sample by proportional enrollment of women, it is representative of the national profile in terms of disciplinary mix. In 2009-2010, mechanical engineering awarded the largest number of degrees, followed by civil, electrical, computer science, and chemical engineering (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1558689812458976">Gibbons, 2011</xref>). The same five disciplines appear in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1558689812458976">Table 1</xref> as the most frequent disciplines among the sample of institutions whose mission statements were used for the analysis.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1558689812458976">
<title>Procedures: Phase 1</title>
<p>The first phase of the analysis was qualitative. The authors first independently open coded the mission statements without familiarity with the outcomes identified by the accrediting agency. It was possible to approach this task inductively because neither author has a content expertise in engineering education, nor have they ever been engaged in activities related to accreditation in engineering.</p>
<p>The unit of analysis was a word or phrase that pointed to a value, outcome, or skill. We did not code references to institutional context, such as to location or selectivity. The researchers coded for both implicit and explicit content. Both these involve some level of interpretation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1558689812458976">Graneheim &amp; Lundman, 2003</xref>). Because the concern was for the breadth of values, outcomes, or skills identified in the mission statements that might distinguish the institutions in the sample, the researchers applied each code only once in any statement.</p>
<p>Creamer and Ghoston coded the mission statements in six separate rounds, meeting after each round to refine the coding scheme and to reach agreement about the final coding for each statement. A coding scheme was compiled after the first round of reviews and then refined throughout subsequent rounds until no further changes were needed.</p>
<p>To better facilitate the statistical analysis conducted in the second phase, 5 of the original 23 variable codes were merged so that none of the final pool of codes (<italic>N</italic> = 19) had a cell size of less than 5. The inductive coding scheme was finalized before either author examined any information about the outcomes identified in the ABET accreditation standards.</p>
<p>Validity was established through peer debriefing on a weekly basis during the coding process and by steps taken to establish interrater reliability. Interrater reliability reached the level of 85% in the final two rounds of coding. This is more than the accepted standard of 60% for categorical data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1558689812458976">Landis &amp; Koch, 1977</xref>). One additional step was taken to demonstrate validity prior to finalizing the coding scheme. To bring in a third reviewer who had received training in conducting qualitative analysis. Following several hours of training and review of the purposes of the study, the third reviewer was then given a subset of mission statements to code. The interrater reliability was determined to be 86% between the third reviewer’s codes and the final coding agreed on by the first and second authors.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1558689812458976">
<title>Procedures: Phase 2</title>
<p>The deductive or quantitative portion of the study began with the development of a database that included descriptive information about the institutions from the ASEE college profiles that are accessible through the Internet (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1558689812458976">ASEE, 2010</xref>). Qualitative data about the values/objectives that were emphasized in each mission statement was converted to a nominal numeric value (1 = <italic>no</italic>; 2 = <italic>yes</italic>) and added to the institutional database. This included information about which codes were evident in their mission statement, as well as other descriptive information about the faculty, students, and programs in engineering that were extracted from the college profiles made available by ASEE. Basic descriptive statistics were then conducted to answer the research questions.</p>
<p>The mission statements we coded were broad statements representing overriding values of the college or school of engineering. The statements had to be generic enough to embrace multiple disciplines and programs. Although updating or revising a mission statement is generally part of the process of preparing for an accreditation visit, there is no way to know if the statements we studied were crafted with any consideration of the ABET engineering criteria.</p>

<p>The final coding system produced a more diverse set of outcomes or goals than those listed in EC 2000. It contains 19 variables, as compared to the 11 outcomes identified by ABET. There was a match between the variables in the coding scheme we developed and all but one of the outcomes. That is for Criterion C: Ability to design, implement, and evaluate a computer based system or process.</p>
<p>The outcomes endorsed in EC 2000 were not broadly diffused in the mission statements. Only two of ABET-related outcomes were identified in the majority of mission statements: (a) design and conduct experiments and (b) broad education to understand global impact. Most institutions’ (25 of 48 [52%]) mission statement had two or fewer ABET-endorsed values or outcomes. The greatest diffusion of the ABET standards was reflected in the eight institutions that had mission statement with four matching codes, and the three institutions that had five matching codes. Key areas identified as reasons for revising the accreditation standards, including design and communication skills, were not values implicitly or explicitly communicated in the majority of the mission statements.</p>
<p>The juxtaposition of the qualitative and quantitative data made it possible to identify a list of values that are endorsed by engineering schools/colleges that are not explicitly articulated in the list of EC 2000 outcomes. These are commitment to service/outreach, diversity, innovation, sustaining industry partnerships, and producing leaders in the profession. These outcomes may be endorsed in other sections of the accreditation standards.</p>

<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1558689812458976">Table 3</xref> provides an example of a different type of integration of qualitative and quantitative data used in mixed methods research known as data transformation.

<p>The analysis reported in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1558689812458976">Table 3</xref> provided a way to consider the question about whether it is possible to identify values or outcomes of an institutional culture or climate singled out in a mission statement that might serve to attract women faculty and students. The table displays the results of correlations between the frequency of the occurrence of the qualitatively derived codes and three measures of the representation of women in engineering among institutions in the sample reported in the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1558689812458976">ASEE 2010</xref> data set. These measures are (a) the proportion of women among graduates in engineering, (b) the number of women among graduates in engineering, and (c) the number of women among the faculty in engineering.</p>
<p>Results provide only modest support for the hypothesis that the appearance of a subset of words in mission statements, such as collaboration and an emphasis on the social implications of engineering applications, is significantly associated with higher than average enrollments of women among the faculty and student body in engineering. Statistically significant, but modest, correlations support the assumption that an endorsement of the value awarded to teaching (code = pedagogy) and collaboration (code = partnerships) in a mission statement is associated with a greater representation of women among the faculty and study body. The same assumption did not prove to be statistically significant for other interests attributed to women, such as an interest in programs where the social implications of research are emphasized (code = service) or where a concern for student development or interdisciplinarity is of sufficient priority to be recognized in a mission statement. Additional analysis not reported here also refuted the supposition that these kinds of codes were used significantly more frequently in colleges with a mix of programs most known for attracting women, such as biomedical engineering. It is possible that gender differences in attitudes about engineering may not be as pronounced as they once were.</p>
<p>The most significant parallels between the values/goals endorsed in mission statements of colleges of engineering and measures of the representation of women among the study body and faculty is in the qualitative code “diversity.” This is not one of the EC 2000 outcomes. The authors applied this code when explicit reference was made in the mission statement to the inclusion of diverse concepts, persons, ideas, cultures, feelings, or opinions or making engineering accessible to both men and women. References to diversity occurred in 27% (<italic>n</italic> = 13) of the 48 mission statements. It was significantly correlated with all three measures of the representation of women (proportion of female graduates, <italic>r</italic> = .417, <italic>p</italic>≤.003; number of female graduates, <italic>r</italic> = .444, <italic>p</italic>≤.002; proportion of female faculty, <italic>r</italic> = .306, <italic>p</italic>≤.03).</p>
<p>Examples of explicit references to diversity occurred in the mission statements from the Whiting School of Engineering at Johns Hopkins University and colleges of engineering at Georgia Tech and Tennessee State University. Each of these used slightly different language to refer to diversity. References were not necessarily in the context of racial or ethnic diversity, and gender was mentioned only rarely. The statement from Johns Hopkins refers to diversity in the broadest sense in that it refers to the “importance of diversity, an entrepreneurial spirit, and a love of learning.” Georgia Tech’s statement is somewhat narrower in the reference to diversity in terms of its student body and faculty. Its mission statement declares that the college of engineering strives to “provide a comprehensive education to a diverse student body led by a diverse world-class faculty.” The language in Tennessee State University’s mission statement is the most explicit in referring to diversity in terms of race. It states that its college of engineering “serves a diverse population of students of all races.” Further analysis of different types of references to diversity appearing within mission statements of colleges of engineering would be a logical follow-up to this study but is hampered given the brevity of most statements.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Results are consistent with previous analyses of mission statements in that following the finding of a common core of basic shared purposes (e.g., teaching/scholarship, service/outreach), there was considerable diversity in the values endorsed in the mission statements of colleges/schools of engineering. Despite the fact that most statements were at most only a few paragraphs long, 19 variables emerged during the inductive analyses that were referenced in at least five mission statements. The breadth of constructs reflected in the codes counter the charge that mission statements are bland or homogenous in nature and portray institutions in an aspirational, rather than realistic, way. The diversity of codes identified during the inductive phases of the analysis supports the argument that such statements distinguish colleges of engineering.</p>
<p>Although the diversity code was found significantly more often in the mission statements of colleges of engineering with larger than average enrollments of women in engineering, it was not necessarily a code that was found frequently. References to diversity appeared in less than one-third of the mission statements. Correlation coefficients provide a measure of association, but do not permit the imputation of causality. The article has been framed as if mission statements play some role in creating an impression of the institution for potential students and faculty. An alternative hypothesis might explain the results just as well. That is that the presence of a sufficient number of women in some settings meant that their voices played a role in crafting a mission statement that included values, interests, and outcomes associated with a more diverse student body and faculty.</p>
<p>A dilemma in consideration of any analysis of mission statements is the very real-world question of who exactly reads them and if we can assume they have any influence whatsoever on people’s choice. As much as we would like to think that a careful weighing of information about the institutions they consider, real-world experience provides ample evidence that prospective students chose an institution for a myriad of reasons, many of which are highly personal and idiosyncratic. It is likely that prospective faculty members are more careful readers of mission statements than are students trolling the market for the best, most affordable, and/or most convenient place to pursue their interests.</p>

<sec id="section11-1558689812458976" sec-type="conclusions">
<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>There are direct implications for practice from the research results reported in this article. The research suggests, but does not prove, that incorporating language about diversity can advance recruiting efforts designed to promote greater diversity in the engineering workforce. It is hoped that those responsible for writing the accreditation standards will consider incorporating explicit language about diversity in the engineering criteria. This language does not have to be restricted to explicit references to gender or race but can be as broad as an expression of support for diverse ideas and viewpoints. These were found to be associated with a greater than average representation of women among the student body and among faculty. Statements that express that teaching is valued were also related to a greater representation of women in engineering.</p>
<p>There are multiple ways that mixed methods can further be applied to advance the application of content analysis to mission statements through data transformation. The creation of a scaled measure of the diversity variable with a range of values including zero would provide a measure of the emphasis given to it in a mission statement and offer the opportunity for the use of more advanced statistical procedures. Scaled measure of multiple variables appearing in mission statements would make it possible to use exploratory factor analysis to develop profiles of clusters of institutions that share similar values and priorities.</p>
<p>The research reported in this article advances methodological understanding by demonstrating how a mixed methods research design can be applied to a content analysis of mission statements. A mixed methods approach to the analysis of mission statements offers several advantages. These include the ability not merely to test for the presence of a predefined cluster of words but also for the detection of a set of ideas or themes that may reflect new or unanticipated trends among a sector of higher education. Combining both qualitative and quantitative approaches makes it possible to consider elements of the context by exploring the link between institutional characteristics and variables identified in the qualitative phases of the study.</p>
<p>The importance of the diversity variable would not have emerged in this study without the use of mixed methods and an exploratory phase. The variable emerged during the initial, qualitative phase of the project that involved open coding of mission statements without a predefined set of constructs. The use of a form of mixing, data transformation, in a later phase of the analysis made it possible to determine the significance of the variable by isolating it as the single variable of 19 that is most strongly related to the measures of the representation of women. Results from the mixing of the qualitative and quantitative data now opens the door to many new ideas about ways to further explore references to diversity in mission statements that would not have been possible if a strictly deductive or quantitative approach had been used.</p>
