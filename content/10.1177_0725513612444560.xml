<p>Britain’s August riots were, so to speak, an explosion bound sooner or later to happen … Just like a minefield: one knows that some of the explosives will, true to their nature, sooner or later explode, but one doesn’t know where and when. In the case of a social minefield, however, an explosion is likely to spread instantaneously, thanks to contemporary technology transmitting information in the ‘real time’ and prompting the ‘copy-cat’ effect. This particular social minefield was created by the combination of consumerism with rising inequality. This was not a rebellion or an uprising of famished and impoverished people or an oppressed ethnic or religious minority, but a mutiny of defective and disqualified consumers, people offended and humiliated by the display of riches to which they had been denied access. We have all been coerced and seduced to view shopping as the recipe for a good life and the principal solution to all life’s problems – but then a large part of the population has been prevented from using that recipe. The city riots in Britain are best understood as a revolt of frustrated consumers. </p>
<p>Whatever else those youngsters may say when pressed to explain why they are angry (mostly repeating the explanations they heard on TV and read in the papers …) the fact is that when looting and burning shops they did not attempt to ‘change society’ – replace the present order with another, more humane and more hospitable to decent and dignified life; they did not rebel against consumerism – but made a (misguided and doomed) attempt to join, if only for a fleeting moment, the ranks of consumers from which they have been excluded. Their mutiny was an un-planned, un-integrated, spontaneous explosion of accumulated frustration that can be only explained in terms of ‘because of’, not in terms of ‘in order to’; I doubt whether the question of ‘what for’ played any role in that orgy of destruction.</p>
<p>Just like the reaction of governments to the depression caused by credit collapse (that is, re-financing the banks in order to bring them ‘back to normal’: to the self-same activity that was the prime cause of the collapse and the depression!), thus far the reaction of the British Government to the mutiny of the humiliated is bound to deepen the humiliation that caused their rebellion – while leaving untouched the sources of their humiliation, namely the rampant consumerism combined with rising inequality. The hard-line, high-handed measures taken by the Government will most probably terminate this explosion here and now, but will do nothing to defuse the minefield that caused it and pre-empt further outbursts. Social problems are never solved by imposition of curfew – they are only left to rot and fester. The reaction of the British Government was a misguided attempt at a one-off, instant solution to a long-term affliction of society. To really tackle that kind of affliction would require nothing short of a serious reform of the ways society works, and a genuine cultural revolution – something that Edgar Morin suggested on his recent visit to São Paulo.</p>
<p>While successive British governments stopped building ‘council estates’ a long time ago, they left the spatial distribution of population, complete with its troubles and problems, entirely to the market forces. Condensations of dis-privileged and deprived people in certain areas of the city, not much differently from the case of the favelas, is not guided by social policies but by the prices of housing, while being aided and abetted by the tendency of the better-off sections of urban dwellers to lock themselves up, away from the city troubles, in the so-called ‘gated communities’. Segregation and polarization in the cities is today the result of a free and politically uncontrolled play of market forces; if the state policy makes its contribution, then only in the form of the governmental refusal to be bothered with the responsibility for human welfare and its decision to ‘contract it out’ to private capital. </p>
<p>I failed to spot any evidence of a desire for social change in these riots. Romanticizing the humble life of self-denial has been always an ideology of the well-off and comfortable; as far as the collateral casualties of their comforts are concerned, however, they crave to imitate them (an irrational dream, which can be only acted upon by irrational means!), not to replace their life-style with one of self-restraint, temperance and moderation. As pointed out by Neal Lawson, the acute observer of the present moods, ‘what some have unhelpfully labeled a “feral underclass” is simply the mirror image of the now feral elite’ – a distorted and distorting mirror, to be sure, but mirror all the same.</p>
<p>In other places and times, people took to the streets. And public squares. First on Prague’s Václavské náměstí, well back in 1989, and right after in one after the other capital of Soviet bloc countries. Then, famously, on the main Kiev city square. In all those places and some others as well, new habits started to be tested: no longer a march, a demo, from a gathering point to the destination. Rather, a permanent occupation of sorts, or a siege lasting as long as the demands are unmet.</p>
<p>What has been tried and tested has recently turned into a norm. People tend to settle in public squares with the clear intention to stay there for quite a while – for as long as it takes to achieve or be granted what they wish. They take tents and sleeping bags with them, to show their determination. Some others come and go – but regularly: every day or evening, or once a week. What do they do once on the square? They listen to speeches, applaud or boo, carry billboards or banners, shout or sing. They wish something to change. In each case, that ‘something’ is different. No one knows for sure whether it means the same for all those around. For many, its meaning is anything but crystal clear. But whatever that ‘something’ is, they savour the change already occurring: staying on the Rothschild or Tahrir square day and night, surrounded by crowds evidently tuned-in to the same wavelength of emotions, is such a change, already happening and enjoyed. Rehearsed verbally on Facebook and Twitter, now finally experienced in flesh. And without losing the traits that made it so endearing when practised on the web: the ability to enjoy the present without mortgaging the future, rights without obligations.</p>
<p>The breathtakingly intoxicating experience of togetherness; perhaps, who knows, solidarity. That change, already occurring, means: no longer alone. And it has taken so little effort to accomplish it – little more than pushing in a ‘d’ in the place of the ‘t’ in that nasty word ‘solitary’. Solidarity on demand, and as long lasting (and not a minute longer) as the demand endures. Solidarity not that much in sharing the cause chosen, as solidarity in having a cause; I and you and all the rest of us (‘us’, that is, people on the square) having purposes, and life having a meaning.</p>
<p>Not all of the people taking to the streets enter the square and stay there. The experience of ‘all of us in it’ may be, and in London, Birmingham, Manchester or Bristol was for a little while, more like a flash in an overheated pan than a pilgrimage. No pretence of a cause. No time for solidarity. No longing for a meaning – fun will do nicely, thank you very much. Joy to be consumed on the spot. Fulfilment now. Instantaneous satisfaction. Is not that what the life of consumers is about? The four teenagers who looted in neighbourhoods across London told <italic>Sky News</italic> it was like a ‘shopping spree’. Speaking on condition of anonymity, the group admitted that they stole iPads, Blackberry tablets, games consoles, laptops, clothes, trainers and even nappies and clothes for their children (<italic>Sky News</italic>, 12 August 2012). Indeed, a shopping spree. The only difference from other shopping sprees was the absence of cash and credit cards: a shopping spree made to the measure of people who have neither.</p>
<p>One of the foremost metaphors for a crowd (both ‘moving crowd’ and ‘stationary’) is, according to Elias Canetti, fire. And no wonder: fires warm us – just as the cosiness of belonging; sometimes, however, they get too hot for comfort, burst into flames with no warning, run out of control and burn – as crowds all too often do. Fuels one can use to keep fire alive differ in both those capacities. All fuels are inflammable, but some, when ignited, smoulder quietly and glow; some others, however, may explode when touched by a single spark.</p>
<p>To return from the fire metaphor to what it stands for – the crowds flowing through the streets into the city square: some of them come prone to explosion, some others fit for protracted yet quiet smouldering. True, both need a spark to be kindled or ignited; what follows the ignition, however, is not determined by the spark, but by the properties of combustibles – even if different kinds of sparks may attract different kinds of crowds. With the advent of the portable means of instant mass communication, sparks will go on flying – but it is not the electronic devices, however smart, that determine the incidence and nature of social explosions. Just how much people responsible for massive production and accumulation of explosives (most prominently, of the rampant, blatant, dehumanizing social inequality and massive production of disqualified consumers in the midst of the society of consumers) understand or wish to understand what moves and guides society entrusted to their care testifies to David Cameron’s idea of switching off social websites in order to save shops from burning and looting.</p>
<p>‘There are multiple and different reasons for these explosions, but to the extent they might have a common denominator I think it can be found in one of the slogans of Israel’s middle-class uprising: “We are fighting for an accessible future.” Across the world, a lot of middle- and lower-middle-class people now feel that the “future” is out of their grasp, and they are letting their leaders know it’, Thomas Friedman suggests. ‘We are increasingly taking easy credit, routine work and government jobs and entitlements away from the middle class – at a time when it takes more skill to get and hold a decent job, at a time when citizens have more access to media to organize, protest and challenge authority and at a time when this same merger of globalization and IT is creating huge wages for people with global skills (or for those who learn to play the system and get access to money, monopolies or government contracts by being close to those in power) – thus widening income gaps and fuelling resentments even more’ – so he sums up his diagnosis and his recommendations. He may be right.</p>
<p>Clearly, the world as we knew it, or thought that we knew it, is going out of joint. Accelerating daily, and in real time getting day by day shorter. The old certainties have disappeared. The old remedies don’t work. The old and trusty drawing boards lay idle or keep turning out, as in a fit of somnambulist trance, the endless copies of old blueprints. Hopes seem to find shelter nowhere but in the tents pitched on public squares.</p>
<p>One is tempted to say: social inventions or re-inventions (as the newly invented/discovered possibility of restoring to the city square the ancient role of the agora on which rules and rulers were made and unmade) tend to spread ‘as forest fire’. One would say that, if not for the fact that globalization has finally invalidated that time-honoured metaphor. Forest fires proceed by <italic>spreading</italic>. Today’s social inventions progress by <italic>leaping</italic>.</p>
<p>In order to explain what I have in mind, let me recall one of the less hyped aspects of the recent, though already half-forgotten, experience of the ‘Arab Spring’. What we could and should learn from that experience is that geographical distances matter no longer. Distances are no longer obstacles, and their sizes no longer determine the distribution of probabilities. Nor do the neighbourhoods and physical proximity – this is why the ‘domino effect’ metaphor, implying a close proximity, indeed a contiguity of cause and effect, loses much, perhaps even most of its accuracy. Stimuli travel independently of their causes: causes may be local, the reach of their inspirations is global; causes may be global, their impacts are shaped and targeted locally. Entangled in the world-wide-web, copycat patterns fly in an extraterritorial space almost randomly – without scheduled itineraries and encountering few if any barriers or checkpoints – but they come down, invariably, on locally built landing strips. You can never be sure in advance on which strip they will land, by which one of innumerable control towers they will be spotted, intercepted and guided to the local airfield, and how many crash landings they will suffer and where. What renders the time spent on predicting wasted, and the prognoses unreliable, is the fact that the landing strips and control towers share the habits of the floating patterns – they are constructed ad hoc, with catching but one selected trophy in mind, hunting after one single quarry, and tend to fall down the moment the mission has been accomplished. Who is that ‘Al-Chahid’ (‘Martyr’ in Arabic) who single-handedly summoned the crowds to transform Tahrir Square for a few days into a (temporary, ad hoc) agora? No one heard about her or him before (read: s/he was not there before), and no one recognized the man/woman on the square beyond the nickname (read: s/he was not there) when the crowds answered the call. The point is, though, that this hardly matters. </p>
<p>The distinctions between far-away and close-by, or here and there, have been all but made null and void once transferred to cyberspace and subjected to the online or on-air logic; if not yet in the notoriously inert, lagging and sluggish imagination, then in their pragmatic potency. This is a condition at which <italic>glocalization</italic>, the process of stripping locality of its importance while simultaneously adding to its significance, aimed from its very start. The time has come to admit that it has arrived there: or, rather, that it has brought us (pushed or pulled us) there.</p>
<p>Stripping the place of its <italic>importance</italic> means that no place can any longer consider its own plight and potency, fullness or void, dramas played in and spectators they attract, as its private matters. Places may (and do) propose, but it is now the turn of the unknown/uncontrolled/intractable/unpredictable/forces roaming in the ‘space of flows’ to dispose. Initiatives are as before local, but their consequences are now global, staying stubbornly beyond the predicting/planning/steering powers of the initiative’s birthplace, or any other place for that matter. Once launched, they – just as the notorious ‘intelligent missiles’ – are fully and truly on their own. They are also ‘hostages to fate’ – though the fate to which they are nowadays hostages is composed and perpetually re-composed of the ongoing rivalry between locally laid out and hastily paved landing strips for the ready-made copycat patterns. The extant map or extant rankings of the established airports are here of no importance. And similarly of no importance would be the extant composition of the global air-traffic authority, were such an institution in existence – which it is not – of which the pretenders to such a role learn currently the hard way.</p>
<p>‘Every time the administration uttered something, its words were immediately overtaken by events on the ground’, said Robert Malley, Middle East and North Africa program director for the International Crisis Group. ‘And in a matter of days, every assumption about the United States’ relationship with Egypt was upended’ – so informed at the time the <italic>New York Times</italic>. And according to Mark Mardell, the BBC’s North American editor, ‘US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton has telephoned the new vice-president and intelligence chief of two decades, Omar Suleiman, to tell him immediately to seize the opportunity for a transition to a more democratic society. That transition must start now. She said that the violence was shocking and told him that they must investigate the violence and hold those responsible accountable’. A few hours later, leaders of the countries believed to be the most important places of Europe – Merkel, Sarkozy, Cameron, Zapatero and Berlusconi – in an uncharacteristically unanimous declaration repeated Hillary Clinton’s appeal/demand. They all said what they did roughly at the same time when Al-Jazeera cameras caught a demonstrator carrying a placard ‘Obama, shut up!’… The <italic>significance</italic> of the place, rising in opposition to its importance, is precisely in the ability of the place to accommodate the carrying of such placards and of people to carry them. Hands too short to meddle with things in global space are just long enough (or at least seem to be long enough) to embrace the locality and press it close to one’s breast, while (hopefully) kicking off the intruders and false pretenders.</p>
<p>One day after Hillary Clinton’s announcement, the <italic>New York Times </italic>informed us about the full re-casting of American foreign policy: ‘The Obama administration seemed determined Wednesday to put as much daylight as possible between Mr. Obama and Mr. Mubarak, once considered an unshakable American supporter in a tumultuous region’. Well, that global power would hardly ever make such an acrobatic volte-face were it not the distant locality deciding to make use of its newly found significance. As Shawki al-Qadi, an opposition lawmaker in Yemen, suggested, it was not that the people were afraid of their governments that surrendered their powers to the ‘global forces’ in exchange for being free of their obligations to their own people. As he put it: ‘It is the opposite. Governments and their security forces are afraid of the people now. The new generation, the generation of the Internet, is fearless. They want their full rights, and they want life, a dignified life.’ The knowledge that the governments in the form in which they have been squeezed by the ‘global forces’ are not the protection against instability but instability’s principal cause has been forced into the heads of the self-appointed ‘world leaders’ by the spectacular display of glocalization’s illogical logic in action.</p>
<p>‘Glocalization’ is a name given to a marital cohabitation that has been obliged, despite all that sound and fury known only too well to the majority of wedded couples, to negotiate a bearable <italic>modus co-vivendi</italic> – as a separation, let alone a divorce, is neither a realistic nor a desirable option. Glocalization is a name for a hate-love relationship, mixing attraction with repulsion: love that lusts proximity, mixed with hate that yearns for distance. Such relationship would have perhaps collapsed under the burden of its own incongruity, if not for the pincers-like duo of inevitabilities: if cut off from the global supply routes the place would lack the stuff of which autonomous identities, and contraptions keeping them alive, are nowadays made; and if not for the locally improvised and serviced airfields, global forces would have nowhere to land, re-staff, replenish and refuel. They are inevitabilities that are doomed to cohabitation. For better or worse. Till death do them part.</p>
