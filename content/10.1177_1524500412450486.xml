<abstract>
<p>Social marketing is a proven private sector strategy to provide health-related products, including contraceptives. Pharmacies offer affordable, convenient, and rapid delivery of over-the-counter contraceptives directly to the consumer, providing wider availability and accessibility to family planning (FP) in sub-Saharan Africa. Pilot projects tested the feasibility of including CycleBeads<sup>®</sup>, the visual tool that supports the use of the Standard Days Method<sup>®</sup>, into Population Services International (PSI) social marketing programs. The purpose of this article is to review evidence to provide guidance for social marketing CycleBeads in pharmacies in sub-Saharan Africa. Literature on contraceptive provision through pharmacies in comparison to clinics was summarized from developing and developed country contexts, highlighting salient and relevant lessons for the African context in regard to pharmacists’ knowledge and perceptions of FP, clients’ perceptions of pharmacists’ FP knowledge and FP service delivery in pharmacies, and the impact of pharmacy access on contraceptive use. Descriptive data from PSI social marketing initiatives in several African countries, and commercial marketing information were reviewed. Evidence from CycleBeads sales suggests that there is demand for the product and it is affordable in comparison to oral contraceptives. In addition, there were high levels of correct use by women who purchased CycleBeads in pharmacies, suggesting that CycleBeads are an appropriate product for social marketing. Until awareness of and demand for the method increases, social marketing of CycleBeads requires continued subsidy to maintain viability. Training to update pharmacists’ knowledge and increase capacity to provide basic information, positioning of the method, and low profit margins for pharmacies present challenges.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Social marketing has become an integral part of family planning (FP) and reproductive health programs aimed to increase access to contraceptives (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1524500412450486">Meekers &amp; Rahaim, 2005</xref>). Traditionally, social marketing programs have focused on condoms and oral contraceptives (OCs) and have resulted in some improvements in health-seeking behaviors associated with FP. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1524500412450486">Green, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1524500412450486">Meekers, Agha, &amp; Klein, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1524500412450486">Migallos &amp; Araneta, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1524500412450486">Van Rossem &amp; Meekers, 2007</xref>) More recently, FP social marketing programs by organizations such as Population Services International (PSI) have provided wider access to intrauterine devices (IUDs) and implants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1524500412450486">PSI, 2011a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1524500412450486">2011b</xref>). CycleBeads<sup>®</sup>, the mnemonic visual tool used with the Standard Days Method<sup>®</sup> (SDM; see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1524500412450486">Figure 1</xref>), offers the opportunity to expand the number and type of FP products offered through a number of social marketing channels (see for an explanation of CycleBeads and a sample of the package insert that accompanies the product).</p>

<p>This article assesses the suitability of CycleBeads as a socially marketed FP product in pharmacies in sub-Saharan Africa. We provide background about social marketing contraceptives as well as the benefits and drawbacks of providing contraceptives through pharmacies versus clinic-based service delivery points based on existing literature. We present data on demand, affordability, and correct use in regard to CycleBeads from several pilot social marketing projects in African countries. We also assess the potential for CycleBeads to become a part of social marketing programs in sub-Saharan Africa through pharmacies, considering system- and client-level factors, as well as pricing, promotion, and positioning of the product.</p>

<title>Background</title>
<sec id="section3-1524500412450486">
<title>Social Marketing of Contraceptives in Developing Countries</title>
<p>The private sector provides a large portion of FP and reproductive health services in developing countries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1524500412450486">Peters, Mirchandani, &amp; Hansen, 2004</xref>). As one of the main private sector strategies for expanding the reach of health services, social marketing is an approach proven to be effective in attaining voluntary behavior change and increasing access to health products (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1524500412450486">Armand, 2003</xref>; N. M. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1524500412450486">Shah, Brieger, &amp; Peters, 2011</xref>). The tenets of social marketing are based on exchange theory, where individuals, groups, or organizations have resources they want to exchange for perceived benefits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1524500412450486">Kotler &amp; Zaltman, 1971</xref>). Social marketing focuses on voluntary exchange of resources. Building upon social marketing theory and its application of marketing concepts, in the 1970s, early contraceptive social marketing programs in Columbia, Thailand, and Pakistan sought to increase limited profits derived from commercial sales programs through sales of socially marketed contraceptives (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1524500412450486">Andreasen, 1988</xref>). Since that time, social marketing, a main private sector strategy for improving reproductive health, has become a critical part of FP and HIV prevention programs in over 60 countries worldwide, accounting for 10% of all contraceptive use (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1524500412450486">Meekers &amp; Rahaim, 2005</xref>). A systematic review of studies of private sector strategies in developing countries revealed that 4 of the 11 studies examining the effectiveness of various social marketing approaches had rigorous study designs and comparison groups (N. M. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1524500412450486">Shah et al., 2011</xref>). All four studies reported positive results in over-the-counter social marketing of Sexually Transmitted Infection (STI) treatment kits, promotion of condom use, adolescent reproductive health in a youth-targeted program, and an assessment of the effectiveness of a contraceptive social marketing strategy versus a community-based distribution program in Uganda, Mozambique, Cameroon, and Colombia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1524500412450486">Agha, Karlyn, &amp; Meekers, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1524500412450486">Jacobs et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1524500412450486">Van Rossem &amp; Meekers, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1524500412450486">Vernon, Ojeda, &amp; Townsend, 1988</xref>). Over the past two decades (1985–2005), while the numbers of couples using modern contraception have increased twofold, couples served by social marketing programs have increased ninefold (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1524500412450486">Harvey, 2008</xref>). This dramatic increase in social marketing programs has been attributed to migration of populations from rural to urban areas, easily reached by such programs, better communications /advertising to target specific audiences, and generation of sales income for social marketing programs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1524500412450486">Harvey, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>In less developed countries, especially throughout sub-Saharan Africa, where weak commercial systems or limited commercial presence exist, achievements in FP service delivery can be attributed, in large part, to social marketing programs implemented by international networks such as PSI, Marie Stopes International and the International Planned Parenthood Federation alongside local social marketing organizations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1524500412450486">Armand, 2003</xref>). Nongovernmental organization (NGO)-based social marketing programs implement the NGO social marketing model or “distribution model” that focuses primarily on maximizing access to contraceptives (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1524500412450486">Armand, 2003</xref>). This model is most commonly applied in sub-Saharan Africa, where contraceptives and other health products are often expensive and not well distributed. NGOs provide affordably priced, donated, and/or subsidized products, which are sold at prices that allow for partial recovery of marketing and distribution costs, to popular retail outlets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1524500412450486">Armand, 2003</xref>). NGOs partner with promoters and sales people, who call upon retailers, in distribution points, such as pharmacies and other retail outlets.</p>
<p>In order to plan and implement social marketing programs, social marketing organizations apply core commercial marketing principles of the marketing mix, known as the four “Ps”: product, price, place, and promotion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1524500412450486">Andreasen, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1524500412450486">Grier &amp; Bryant, 2005</xref>).</p>

<p>NGOs often take full responsibility for the product’s brand name and packaging, price, distribution, and promotion of the FP product, so that through attractive packaging, lower prices, and promotional campaigns that resonates with the target audience, contraceptives can be provided at convenient retail outlets, such as pharmacies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1524500412450486">Armand, 2003</xref>). This approach has helped increase contraceptive use, such as condoms, in underserved groups, and is potentially an avenue for other contraceptive methods, such as the SDM, to be well placed in outlets, such as pharmacies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1524500412450486">Harvey, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1524500412450486">Van Rossem &amp; Meekers, 2000</xref>).</p>

<title>Benefits of pharmacies as service delivery points for contraceptives</title>
<p>Pharmacies can offer rapid delivery of over-the-counter FP products and provide an entry point for contraceptive provision (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1524500412450486">Liambila, Obare, &amp; Keesbury, 2010</xref>). Recent studies evaluating the feasibility of offering emergency contraceptives (ECs) through pharmacies found that over-the-counter access to FP is affordable, confidential, and convenient, according to perceptions of some FP clients in developed countries, and several African contexts, in South Africa, Kenya, and Uganda (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1524500412450486">Foster et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1524500412450486">Larsson, Eurenius, Westerling, &amp; Tyden, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1524500412450486">Liambila et al., 2010</xref>). Given that pharmacies serve as a resource for reproductive health information, such as HIV prevention and treatment of sexually transmitted infections, they may be an ideal venue for disseminating information to a large proportion of current and new users of FP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1524500412450486">Keesbury, Morgan, &amp; Owino, 2011</xref>). In Kenya, pharmacies equipped with weekly updates, key messages on fliers and information, education, and communication materials were more likely to give additional information on ECs than clinics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1524500412450486">Liambila et al., 2010</xref>). In South Africa, data revealed that one third of the pharmacists offered educational materials on prevention of HIV and STIs, with the majority providing HIV and STI counseling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1524500412450486">Blanchard, Harrison, &amp; Sello, 2005</xref>). Most pharmacists (four of the five) stated their willingness to display promotional materials on contraceptives. Yet, few pharmacists expressed an interest in counseling clients at pharmacies and antenatal clinics and felt such efforts would not be an effective way to disseminate information to potential clients. This suggests point of sale materials should provide consumers with sufficient information to ensure correct understanding of how to use an FP method correctly.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1524500412450486">
<title>Pharmacists’ FP knowledge and perceptions in relation to pharmacy versus clinic access to contraception</title>
<p>Level of technical knowledge and supportive attitudes toward FP by pharmacists increased the likelihood of stocking and selling the method. Well-informed pharmacists tend to carry the FP product and discuss it with potential clients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1524500412450486">Becker, Garcia, &amp; Ellertson, 2004</xref>). Yet, pharmacists who do not receive contraceptive training and education may unknowingly provide misinformation about an FP method to clients. In addition, pharmacy workers often view themselves as sales persons rather than health providers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1524500412450486">Becker et al., 2004</xref>). Therefore, reluctance or hesitancy to provide contraceptives may be due to lack of adequate training or knowledge, limitations in time or capacity to counsel, and/or traditional views on who should receive contraceptives, as many may not feel comfortable providing advice and/or counseling on FP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1524500412450486">Becker et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1524500412450486">Ehrle &amp; Sarker, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1524500412450486">Langer et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1524500412450486">Muia et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1524500412450486">Tripathi, Rathore, &amp; Sachdeva, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1524500412450486">Yam et al., 2007</xref>). Pharmacists can fill knowledge gaps through leaflets and counseling if given appropriate point of sales materials to disseminate to clients. A study in Kenya demonstrated that pharmacists participating in a PSI social marketing program in pharmacies were more likely to provide reproductive health information through fliers and information/education/communication (IEC), when given nonformalized training updates, known as “detailing,” on how EC works, associated side effects, basic counseling on FP methods and referral services, in comparison to clinics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1524500412450486">Liambila et al., 2010</xref>).</p>

<title>Client-Level Perceptions of Pharmacists/Pharmacy Services in Comparison to Clinic Services</title>
<p>Clients’ views vary on whether pharmacies are suitable contraceptive outlets in developed and developing country contexts. The client–pharmacist interaction can be influenced by a number of factors. Some women felt greater privacy and time savings in comparison with clinics, as clients in Kenya preferred quick delivery, eliminating screening by providers with “no questions asked” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1524500412450486">Liambila et al., 2010</xref>). However, others did not feel they could engage in a conversation about the method, expressed fear of seeing someone they knew, or embarrassment regarding the line of persons behind them waiting to see the pharmacist (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1524500412450486">Aneblom, Larsson, von Essen, &amp; Tyden, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1524500412450486">Hobbs et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1524500412450486">Potter, White, Hopkins, Amastae, &amp; Grossman, 2010</xref>). In Mexico, women requested access to counseling services and were referred to health providers if they had questions, which may indicate a need for more information received through pharmacies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1524500412450486">Langer et al., 1999</xref>). Data from Kenya reveal that most women felt they could pose questions to pharmacists (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1524500412450486">Keesbury et al., 2011</xref>). In addition, the majority (70%) of women felt the amount of FP information given at the pharmacy was adequate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1524500412450486">Keesbury et al., 2011</xref>), while one quarter felt the information provided was “too little.” These data suggest that clients’ level of comfort with pharmacists may not be an issue in sub-Saharan Africa in comparison to other settings.</p>
<p>A comparison between clinic versus pharmacy access to contraception at the U.S. Mexico Border showed that clinic users stated both trust of information provided from clinics and an appreciation of other health services as reasons for preferring clinic services for FP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1524500412450486">Potter et al., 2010</xref>). However, pharmacy users cited cost and not having to go to the clinic for a prescription as important advantages. Clinic users stated inconvenience and inadequate supply of pills as disadvantages, while pharmacy users disliked the cost, inconvenience, limited pill packs, and brands associated with clinic visits. The majority of clinic and pharmacy users (70–75%) expressed satisfaction with the level of care, regardless of perceptions regarding problems associated with both service delivery point (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1524500412450486">Potter et al., 2010</xref>). Although similar data are not available for the African context, client-level perceptions of trust, cost, convenience, and supply, in regard to pharmacists and FP services provided in pharmacies, resonate with such populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1524500412450486">Keesbury et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1524500412450486">Liambila et al., 2010</xref>).</p>

<title>Impact of Pharmacy Provision of Contraceptives on Use</title>
<p>In a nationally representative survey examining provision of OCs in Kuwait, one fourth of women initiated FP use without consulting a doctor and half bought OCs from pharmacies (M. A. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1524500412450486">Shah, Shah, Al-Rahmani, Behbehani, &amp; Radovanovic, 2001</xref>). Women who purchased OCs from pharmacies were significantly less likely to consult a physician. Yet, compliance and continuation were not found to be different between those who consulted a physician and those who did not (M. A. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1524500412450486">Shah et al., 2001</xref>). Despite aforementioned weaknesses in some pharmacists’ knowledge of contraceptives or ability to screen for side effects, a study carried out in Mexico indicated no significant differences in counseling on contraindications for OC use between pharmacies and clinics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1524500412450486">Yeatman, Potter, &amp; Grossman, 2006</xref>). Clients were able to assess whether they met the eligibility criteria for using a particular contraceptive when they received clear guidance from pharmacists and when clients perceived package inserts were easy to understand (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1524500412450486">Gainer et al., 2003</xref>).</p>

<sec id="section9-1524500412450486">
<title>Background of the SDM</title>
<p>Researchers at Georgetown University’s Institute for Reproductive Health (IRH) developed the SDM, a simple fertility awareness-based method of FP, using an existing World Health Organization data set to identify the combination of days that provided an optimal balance between the length of the identified fertile period and its potential for helping users avoid unplanned pregnancy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1524500412450486">Arevalo, Sinai, &amp; Jennings, 1999</xref>). The formula that achieved this balance identified Days 8–19 of the menstrual cycle as the fertile window for women with most menstrual cycles between 26 and 32 days long. The SDM was tested in a multisite efficacy trial, which found a first-year pregnancy rate of 4.8 per 100 woman-years of correct use (95% confidence interval [2.33, 7.11]; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1524500412450486">Arevalo, Jennings, &amp; Sinai, 2002</xref>). This rate is comparable to other user-directed methods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1524500412450486">Hatcher, Trussell, &amp; Stewart, 2004</xref>). Subsequent studies showed that that traditional method or new FP users are likely to adopt SDM, that women choose it primarily because of its lack of side effects, that men were interested in participating in method use by abstaining or using condoms during fertile days and helping wives track fertile days, and that community-based health workers are able to offer the method with sufficient quality (Gribble, Lundgren, Velasquez, &amp; Anastasi, 2008).</p>
<p>Between 2004 and 2009, PSI introduced CycleBeads through its social marketing programs in six African countries: Benin, Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), Madagascar, Mali, Nigeria, and Rwanda. PSI purchased the product from the manufacturer with funds from the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), which receives a special negotiated price, and with Dutch Government funds through the Strategic Alliance with International NonGovernmental Organizations. CycleBeads distribution built upon existing supply chains of wholesale-, retail-, and community-based sales agents in order to make the product widely available. Training, targeted distribution, and promotion costs of social marketing CycleBeads along with other PSI FP products were also covered by donor funding. Formative research was carried out in each country to guide marketing, communications, and message development for the product. PSI affiliates in Africa designed and implemented household surveys on FP, which integrated questions on CycleBeads to assess general knowledge and attitudes, and PSI community-level agents conducted door-to-door in-depth discussions with community members to inform on preferences for promoting and distributing CycleBeads. PSI held meetings with key community leaders to assess country-specific strategies for introducing CycleBeads in their respective countries. PSI trained pharmacy staff on SDM in PSI-affiliated pharmacies, and mystery clients were used to assess the quality of services provided by pharmacists. In collaboration with IRH, CycleBeads social marketing materials and job aids were pretested through focus group discussions with women of reproductive age to ensure understanding of presented concepts and cultural acceptability of CycleBeads packaging. Local prices for CycleBeads were based on willingness to pay for this product in comparison to other FP products on the market as well as the purchasing power of the target audience and the potential market demand.</p>

<title>Method</title>
<p>To assess the potential for CycleBeads social marketing in low-resource countries, data from the following sources were reviewed.</p>
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item>
<p>Over a 12-month period, IRH conducted a study comparing correct use of CycleBeads by women who had purchased them from pharmacies and those who had received them from clinics in Benin and DRC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1524500412450486">Institute for Reproductive Health, 2008</xref>). A convenience sample of clinics and pharmacies that were part of an established network of PSI-affiliate organizations, Association Beninoise pour le Marketing Social (ABMS) in Benin and Association Santé Familial (ASF) in DRC (all ASF-affiliated pharmacies and clinics—Kinshasa only) were selected to participate in the study, due to cost and feasibility of data collection. ABMS and ASF distributed CycleBeads through trained providers in clinics, and they trained pharmacists in three areas of Benin (Cotonou, Parakou, and Djougou) and Congo (Kinshasa, Bukavu, and Lumumbashi). Following counseling by health providers who offered SDM with other FP methods or a brief explanation of basic points of CycleBeads use by pharmacists, clients who chose SDM as their FP method were asked to participate in the study. In Benin, pharmacists received a 1-day training in SDM/CycleBeads, while clinical providers received 3 days of training. In the DRC, both pharmacists and clinic-based providers received a 1-day training. We compared the amount of information provided to SDM acceptors by pharmacists and clinic staff. This study used the simulated client methodology to compare the amount and quality of information provided to new SDM users by pharmacy and clinic staff. Simulated clients were assigned to one of the two profiles. The first profile was that of a potential user who fulfilled the requirements for effective use of SDM, for example, reported that her menstrual periods usually came about 1 month apart and that she and her partner would be able to abstain or use condoms on fertile days. The second profile was a woman who did not fulfill these requirements.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Current consumer CycleBeads prices were documented and compared to consumer prices of OCs, and CycleBeads sales data were documented for pilot social marketing initiatives in DRC, Madagascar, Mali, and Nigeria from January 2008 to December 2009.</p>

<p>We carried out a desk review of reports prepared by Abt Associates to examine considerations for engaging the private sector to socially market CycleBeads.</p>

<title>Can Women Use SDM With CycleBeads Correctly When it is Obtained From a Pharmacy or Similar Distribution Point?</title>
<p>Training providers to counsel clients on the correct use of SDM has been a critical feature of introducing SDM in FP programs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1524500412450486">Leon et al., 2006</xref>). It was important to assess how much information pharmacy staff provided to customers and whether this information was sufficient to enable them to decide whether CycleBeads were appropriate for them and, if so, how to correctly use the product.</p>
<p>As shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1524500412450486">Table 1</xref>, fewer pharmacy than clinic staff gave spontaneous information about the method to simulated clients playing the role of a woman who fulfilled the requirements to use the method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1524500412450486">Institute for Reproductive Health, 2008</xref>). Pharmacy staff were also less likely to help determine the simulated client’s cycle length or to mention the importance of abstaining or using condoms on fertile days. However, in both countries, pharmacists were about as likely as clinicians to show the client the CycleBeads instructional insert.</p>

<p>Given the lack of information offered by pharmacy staff, it was important to understand whether women who purchased CycleBeads at pharmacies could use them correctly. A survey of CycleBeads users who received the product through pharmacies and clinics showed that although clinicians provide more information than pharmacists, women who obtained the method from pharmacists (<italic>N</italic> = 55 women) and clinicians (<italic>N</italic> = 157 women) demonstrated equally high levels of compliance with SDM instructions, and almost all women (138 of the 157 from the clinic, 51 of the 55 from the pharmacy) had the rubber ring on the correct bead (i.e., inspection of CycleBeads by a provider/pharmacist following four menstrual cycles of CycleBeads use; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1524500412450486">Institute for Reproductive Health, 2008</xref>). Women who purchased CycleBeads in pharmacies were able to determine their eligibility to use the method. Very few had unprotected intercourse on fertile days (22 of the 157 from the clinic and 4 of the 55 from the pharmacy). These data suggest that correct use of CycleBeads distributed through social marketing channels may be dependent on the inserts packaged with the product, an issue which requires further exploration.</p>
<sec id="section13-1524500412450486">
<title>Is there sufficient demand for CycleBeads through social marketing?</title>
<p>Demand for and sales of CycleBeads rose over the course of 3 years (2008–2010) in pilot projects in Mali (the first 2 years), Madagascar, and DRC where promotional and training activities were conducted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1524500412450486">Figure 4</xref>).

<p>These data indicate the potential demand for social marketing CycleBeads in sub-Saharan Africa where contraceptive products are subsidized by donors.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section15-1524500412450486">
<title>What Key Issues Should be Considered in Sub-Saharan Africa?</title>
<p>Recognizing that donor funding would be required to subsidize CycleBeads in sub-Saharan Africa, we reviewed a report prepared by Abt Associates which assessed private sector market issues for CycleBeads (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1524500412450486">Armand, 2008</xref>). Key findings which may be relevant for the Africa context included the following:</p>
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item>
<p>Because the method may be confused with traditional methods, educating consumers and other key stakeholders about the method—as a scientifically tested FP method—is critical in establishing the credibility of the method.</p>

<p>The current positioning of CycleBeads as a low-cost, non-resupply method may translate into lack of sufficient revenue for retailers.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Data from small-scale social marketing efforts in several African countries indicate client demand, affordable pricing in comparison to OCs, and correct use of SDM, when the method is provided in pharmacies without health provider assistance. Studies of correct use, pricing and sales have largely been conducted in low-income African countries, where continued subsidy of the product is required for its sustainability, as most programs (89.7%) are managed by international NGOs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1524500412450486">Meekers &amp; Rahaim, 2005</xref>). In terms of sustainability, limited opportunities for commercial partnership exist as few social marketing programs are managed through this mechanism (2.6%) in Africa. Therefore, programs will have difficulty becoming self-sustaining in the absence of donor assistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1524500412450486">Meekers &amp; Rahaim, 2005</xref>) </p>
<p>Training and detailing pharmacists with educational and promotional activities on CycleBeads would be an important first step in offering this product through pharmacies in sub-Saharan Africa. Pharmacists were less likely to screen clients for cycle length and convey the importance of abstaining or using a condom during fertile days than clinicians. Yet, pharmacists and clinic-based providers were equally likely to show clients the instructional insert. We did not have information on whether training was sufficient or if there were other barriers, such as limited time of pharmacists, perceived capacity to counsel or comfort level with advising clients, or client-level perceptions noted in other studies, which would have aided in interpretation of our findings. Equipping pharmacists with an understanding of the method may influence their willingness to stock and provide the method and display educational materials, given inadequate knowledge and/or training has been consistently documented in previous investigations of over-the-counter access to contraceptives. Yet, CycleBeads may not be a substantial source of revenue for retailers, as the SDM is not a method that requires resupply. CycleBeads could be positioned as a “service” product that pharmacists will routinely carry as a service to customers, similar to thermometers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1524500412450486">Armand, 2008</xref>). In the long run, CycleBeads would require pricing that favorably compares to other contraceptive products sold in pharmacies. This may be feasible, given that CycleBeads does not require a high initial cash outlay or frequent resupply (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1524500412450486">Armand, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>Our data indicate that the current price of CycleBeads is less than OCs, taking into account the frequency of purchasing OCs versus the one-time purchase of CycleBeads. Therefore, a one-time purchase of CycleBeads could provide an affordable option to African couples not currently served by FP programs, who use traditional methods, have problems with resupply of other methods, or prefer to access their FP method outside the public health care delivery system. Apart from community- and clinic-based counseling, CycleBeads can be offered successfully through social marketing programs that provide information through product inserts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1524500412450486">Gribble et al., 2008</xref>). In this study, women were able to screen for their own eligibility, regardless of whether they obtained CycleBeads at the clinic or pharmacy. No difference in levels of compliance, correct use, and reported unprotected sex was found. A self-screening checklist, accurate in detecting contraindications for OCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1524500412450486">Gainer et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1524500412450486">Grossman et al., 2011</xref>), could be developed for use in pharmacies for SDM. Pamphlets and flowcharts displayed in pharmacies could aid women in identifying when they can or cannot use SDM. The ease of use of the method combined with the ability of segments of the population to learn the method on their own, without the need of a health provider is favorable for distribution in pharmacies.</p>
<p>Because it is likely that pharmacists will not have time to counsel potential users on SDM, educational campaigns that pharmacists at point of purchase are needed to ensure a high level of knowledge about SDM, so women who desire to use the method have access to basic information about the method. Creating awareness of the availability of CycleBeads in pharmacies is a critical factor in successful social marketing of this product. Mass media campaigns through pharmacy networks could stimulate demand. Community health workers and volunteers could play a role in motivating and/or referring women to pharmacies.</p>

<sec id="section17-1524500412450486">
<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Pharmacies play a critical role as sources of contraceptives in sub-Saharan Africa, as quick delivery, affordability, and convenience can impact uptake of FP methods. Training and detailing can equip pharmacists with the sufficient knowledge, comfort level, and ability to provide basic FP information and supplies, increasing access to FP. While there are a number of challenges to marketing CycleBeads in sub-Saharan Africa, the ability of clients to self-screen for eligibility, the capacity of pharmacists to provide the method at a quality comparable to clinical providers, as well as demand for and affordable pricing provide the potential for social marketing this knowledge-based method.</p>
