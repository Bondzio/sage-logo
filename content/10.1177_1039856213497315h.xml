<p>I have considered Mental Health to be a primary area of interest to me since well before beginning my medical degree. At an undergraduate level, however, it is not for some time that we are given the chance to be placed on a psychiatric ward, and the majority of what we are taught about psychiatry in the first few years is theoretical. It was with real excitement, then, that I awaited my first inpatient Mental Health attachment at the beginning of this year. While I was given the chance to shadow some amazing teams, what I heard practitioners discussing coupled with what I read in the literature led me to believe that my 8 weeks of placement barely scratched the surface in terms of the potential directions that this exciting speciality can lead.</p>
<p>I was, shortly after, accepted to attend the RANZCP Congress. This opportunity could not have come at a more pertinent time for me, having just had my interest and tentative excitement about the speciality re-iterated by my first ward-based experiences and conversations with those already in the field. The incentives for students to attend had been described to me as I applied, informing me that upon acceptance, I would have the opportunity to observe presentations by clinical practitioners and researchers alike regarding the most recent trials and studies in psychiatry, not to mention valuable appraisals of the new DSM. After trawling through the literature thus far on my own, reading about the multitude of drug and imaging studies that have together helped to shape the therapeutic guidelines that I have been taught and observed being put into practice, the notion of hearing those who themselves undertake the research speak was both daunting an exciting.</p>
<p>The reality of the Congress, from an undergraduate’s perspective, turned out to be far less daunting than expected, for all the right reasons. While I was, of course, perpetually aware of being one of the most junior candidates in the room, each member of the College who took the time to speak with me was welcoming, encouraging and informative. Even some of the most accomplished members of the College who I had heard speak throughout the week were more than obliging when I approached them with questions, and everybody I met, both between panels and at the Congress’s social events, had nothing but encouraging words to give to me – the collegial atmosphere stands out in my mind even now as I recall the proceedings of the week.</p>
<p>Most exciting to me was the recurrent theme between panels of the progressive nature of psychiatry itself, as a science. I was fascinated by the papers presented on the budding areas of neuropsychiatry, and the prospect of potentially becoming a part of such dynamic and evolving field is a real driving force for me – something that attending the Congress certainly re-enforced.</p>
<p>I hope that students do continue to be invited to attend the Congress in years to come – it is first and foremost a unique opportunity to be immersed in exciting and topical research and learn a lot from those with the most knowledge, but also a great chance to meet some inspirational people who, for me, helped to set into concrete the work I need to do to begin the next steps in my career.</p>
