<abstract>
<p>This article argues that a performance of transgender is integral to the reproduction of New Zealand’s ‘national identity’. It suggests that because mediated ‘New Zealandness’ relies simultaneously on its exclusive self-conception as masculinity, and a requisite female adjunct to cast the resultant homosociality in heterosexual terms, New Zealand ‘femaleness’ is primarily recognizable as a misperformed masculinity. The gender binary that functions in the service of national identity is not male/female but masculinity as the gendered, and the transgendered, body. In order to demonstrate this, this article uses Judith Butler’s account of melancholic heterosexuality to examine the ‘Southern Man’ campaign devised to market Speight’s beer.</p>

<sec id="sec1-1363460712436482"><title>The transgendered Kiwi</title>
<p>On 1 February 1992, the New Zealand television audience witnessed its first, and arguably, best-known beer advertisement.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1363460712436482">1</xref></sup> Known in advertising circles as ‘Perfect Girl’, the advertisement was from the ‘Southern Man’ campaign devised to market Speight’s beer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1363460712436482">Perfect Girl, 2006</xref>). Set primarily in the central South Island High Country, this highly successful series of print, outdoor and television advertisements deliberately emphasized the divide between a nostalgically imagined rural South Island, and the urbanized threat of the North, and Auckland (New Zealand’s largest city) in particular. It was part of a move by the brewer, Lion Nathan, to utilize regional identity in an attempt to capture a wider share of the beer market in the face of changing patterns of alcohol consumption (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1363460712436482">Campbell et al., 1999</xref>: 175–177; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1363460712436482">Law, 1997</xref>: 23–24).</p>
<p>Like much beer advertising, the Southern Man campaign connects the consumption of a particular brand of beer to a legitimized performance of maleness. It is centred on two unnamed archetypes of New Zealand masculinity: a weatherworn old ‘bloke’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1363460712436482">2</xref></sup> of few words, and his younger, equally taciturn, counterpart. These characters embody a paradigm of ‘New Zealand masculinity’ whose reproduction through a ‘powerful legend of pioneering manhood’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1363460712436482">Phillips, 1996</xref>: 3) is well documented (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1363460712436482">Bannister, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1363460712436482">Law et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1363460712436482">Phillips, 1996</xref>). That legend draws on an account of New Zealand history that privileges white or ‘pakeha’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-1363460712436482">3</xref></sup> experience, and narrates the material practices of colonisation primarily as the hardships of colonial settlement. In its performance of masculinity, the Southern Man campaign is part of what Matthew Bannister describes as New Zealand’s historical identification of itself with ‘a model of tough, rural, “pioneering” white masculinity whose presence is naturalized by association with the landscape and a “frontier” model of pragmatic, physical industry’ (2005: 2).</p>
<p>In addition to beer advertising, these myths are replayed and reconstituted in cultural sites such as sport (particularly rugby union), literature, films, advertising, and other media texts, with each articulation citing the authority of the previous articulation to naturalize both the identity as such, and the chain of citation being mobilized. Kai Jensen’s discussion of the masculinist project of early New Zealand literature demonstrates how this works. Jensen argues that writers such as Frank Sargeson<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-1363460712436482">4</xref></sup> may have ‘actively shaped a “tradition” about New Zealand manhood, which was then picked up, amplified and broadcast by popular writers’, and suggests that while such representations might not be an accurate reflection of New Zealand society, they ‘might predict how that society would eventually understand itself’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1363460712436482">Jensen, 1996</xref>: 17–18). The chain of representation and citation that constitutes New Zealand masculinity functions performatively, in the terms theorized by Judith Butler, in that these repetitions are ‘at once a reenactment and reexperiencing of a set of meanings already socially established’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1363460712436482">Butler, 1990</xref>: 140), where the cultural knowledge being (re)produced gives these performances their ‘binding and conferring power’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1363460712436482">Butler, 1993</xref>: 225).</p>
<p>Bannister’s assertion that New Zealand identifies itself with a particular model of masculinity, and Jensen’s suggestion that the New Zealand manhood produced by its early writers might become the way in which New Zealand understands itself, both highlight the extent to which the attributes reproduced in culture as paradigmatic of New Zealand masculinity are simultaneously constituted as paradigmatic of ‘New Zealandness’ as such. From the foundational national literature canon enacted as a deliberate performance of localized masculinity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1363460712436482">Jensen, 1996</xref>), to the Prime Ministerial eulogy at the funeral of Sir Edmund Hillary, the country’s most celebrated citizen and its most famous mountaineer,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-1363460712436482">5</xref></sup> the ‘national character’ is repeatedly imagined in the tough, resourceful understated terms through which the Kiwi bloke is performatively reproduced. As Law, Campbell and Schick argue:
<disp-quote>
<p>There is no equivalent feminine myth, not even a term, to partner the ‘Kiwi bloke’. Rural standbys like ‘sheila’ simply don’t carry the same connotations of entitlement or legitimate authority. While people like Sir Edmund Hillary and Sir Peter Blake are embraced as representative of the national character, notable women from New Zealand … are more likely to be seen as resolutely idiosyncratic. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1363460712436482">Law et al., 1999</xref>: 14)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>This absence of a femaleness recognizable as a representation of the national character is hardly surprising when one considers how ‘discourses of masculine homosociality, male autonomy and independence from the “feminizing” influences of domesticity … have been central to the construction of Pakeha cultural identity’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1363460712436482">Bannister, 2005</xref>: 2). In his discussion of the impetus behind <italic>A Man’s Country? Images of the Pakeha Male</italic> (perhaps the most influential account of the production of New Zealand’s pakeha masculinity), historian Jock Phillips recounts a moment of recognition that his production as a New Zealand man had taken place in notably all-male social contexts. Referring to his experience of gender-mixed socializing in the USA, Phillips recalls his realisation that this was:
<disp-quote>
<p>totally antithetical to my previous experience in New Zealand, where I seemed to have been continually in exclusively male communities and where I’d developed a whole pattern of language, swearing and a kind of joking ribaldry. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1363460712436482">Schick and Dolan, 1999</xref>: 47)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>It is not that women simply fail to appear in mediations of New Zealandness, their active exclusion has been central to the constitutive repetition of the masculinity that underpins it.</p>
<p>Privileged among the New Zealand social contexts that Phillips describes is the historically male-dominated environment of the pub, and the culture of beer drinking in general. As a number of cultural histories demonstrate, the version of masculinity that developed in relation to New Zealand’s pubs was one that ‘reinforced a certain form of “mateship” among men and excluded and subordinated women’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1363460712436482">Campbell et al., 1999</xref>: 168). The normative link between drinking and masculinity has an enduring resonance in New Zealand culture (as it does in many others), and beer drinking continues to mark what Campbell, Law and Honeyfield describe as ‘a legal and symbolic boundary between boyhood and manhood’ (1999: 166–167) even as patterns of production and consumption change. Beer drinking is intimately connected to the legitimized performance of masculinity, and within that context the citational strategies of beer advertising carry a particularly heavy performative weight.</p>
<p>This article argues that the Southern Man campaign is an example of how this functions, and of the contradictions that a ‘national character’ predicated on homosociality engenders. The campaign cites foundational myths of pioneering masculinities to authorize the drinking of Speight’s beer as a performative act of Kiwi masculinity. Yet the masculine signifying economy it deploys for this purpose also plays out the paradoxes of a homosocial context in which the successful performance of masculinity is repeatedly measured in the active repudiation of women, but is simultaneously dependent upon legitimation through heterosexuality. As queer theorists Judith Butler and Eve Kosofsky Sedgwick argue, the relationship between masculinity and heterosexuality in heteronormative culture is underpinned by the anxious reconstitution of the demarcating boundary between gay and straight. Sedgwick describes this as the ‘chronic, now endemic crisis of homo/heterosexual definition’ and argues that ‘an understanding of virtually any aspect of modern Western culture must be not merely incomplete, but damaged in its central substance’ if it does not take into account how that crisis plays out to homophobic and/or anti-feminist effect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1363460712436482">Sedgwick, 1990</xref>: 1).</p>
<p>Using the Speight’s campaign, the following discussion argues that the production and reproduction of New Zealand masculinity, and by extension New Zealandness as such, is underpinned by the crisis of homo/heterosexual definition that <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1363460712436482">Sedgwick describes (1990: 1)</xref>. It utilizes Judith Butler’s account of ‘heterosexual melancholia’ to demonstrate that the reliance within ‘New Zealand identity’ of its exclusive self-conception as masculinity necessitates a female adjunct to cast the resultant homosociality in heterosexual terms. Yet, because New Zealandness is articulated within a masculine signifying economy, there is no femaleness equally recognizable as a performance of national identity. Thus, I argue that at the intersection of heteronormative anxiety and the homosociality integral to New Zealand identity, there emerges a New Zealandness embodied as female that simultaneously misperforms the imperatives of femininity, and the imperatives of masculinity. The gender binary that functions in the service of national identity is not male/female but masculinity as the gendered and the transgendered body. This ‘transgendered Kiwi’ is a homosociality recast as the normative binary of masculinity and femininity.</p>
<sec id="sec2-1363460712436482"><title>The Southern Man</title>
<p>‘Perfect Girl’ begins with the two central characters of the Southern Man campaign resting by a lake after a hard day’s sheep mustering in the High Country. The older man states matter of factly: ‘[I] Hear you’ve been seeing a city girl.’ The younger man pulls out a photo of a blonde woman in a pink dress, and acknowledges that she wants him to move up to Auckland. In response to the question: ‘What’s the attraction up there?’ he replies: ‘A place in the harbour, a 500-SL Mercedes, an eighty-foot yacht, and her old man’s got a box at Eden Park’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-1363460712436482">6</xref></sup> Alas, however, she ‘doesn’t drink Speight’s’, a failing that is greeted by the old man with the observation: ‘She’s a hard road finding the perfect woman, boy.’ The younger man replies ‘Still, no hurry, aye.’ His implied rejection of his otherwise perfect girlfriend, and his satisfaction with his life in the South, are affirmed by his companion with a relieved, ‘Good on ya, mate’, the refrain that ends each advertisement in the campaign.</p>
<p>The list of Auckland-based attractions that the girlfriend has situates the narrative tension of the text firmly within the socioeconomic context in which it was produced. In the late 1980s beer drinking in New Zealand was declining, and a decline in the sales of locally brewed beer was particularly marked (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1363460712436482">Law, 1997</xref>). A range of social trends and economic shifts produced these changing patterns of consumption, but of particular importance was an increase in the consumption of wine and more ‘sophisticated’ international beers occasioned, in part, by the rise in the 1980s of a moneyed urban ‘yuppie’ culture, and the economic deregulation of the beer industry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1363460712436482">Campbell et al., 1999</xref>: 175). A key part of the brewing companies’ response was to re-establish the traditional values associated with beer drinking through the reinvention of regionally branded beers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1363460712436482">Campbell et al., 1999</xref>: 176).</p>
<p>This strategy is clearly evident in ‘Perfect Girl’ with its deliberate emphasis on the divide between a nostalgically imagined rural South Island, and an Auckland represented through the trappings of material wealth. The cultural logic of the separation between the North and South Islands is readily recognizable to a New Zealand audience, and the evocative use of place in the Southern Man campaign is critical to the tropes of masculinity being deployed. The High Country, and the rural South in general, holds a complex and privileged place in the narratives of authenticity on which notions of pakeha masculinity depend. Geographically more isolated, more extreme in its weather patterns, and routinely imagined as more connected to the way New Zealand ‘used to be’, the South Island is often positioned in New Zealand media as a destination ‘back beyond the effete suburbanization of New Zealand manhood’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1363460712436482">Wallace, 2004</xref>: 81 n). The ‘Southern Man’ whose archetype anchors the campaign embodies the idealized masculinity of New Zealand’s mediated myth-making: tough, resourceful men of few words who are most at home on the land, and fiercely loyal to the bonds of mateship.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-1363460712436482">7</xref></sup></p>
<p>Those bonds are simultaneously the bonds of class, or rather of what Bannister describes as the ‘“blokey” egalitarianism’ that connects homosocial mateship to the persistent ideology of New Zealand as a classless society (2005: 19–20). The ‘economically marginal space’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1363460712436482">Law, 1997</xref>: 25) that the central characters of the Speight’s campaign occupy is as masculinized as the High Country itself, and draws upon the same ‘masculine strength of character and audacity’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1363460712436482">Law, 1997</xref>: 25) as the Southern Man’s geographic location. The commodities and cultures of middle- and upper-class Auckland are conflated in ‘Perfect Girl’ with the attractions of femininity, and their repudiation is a central part of the masculine brand values being attached to Speight’s beer. This narrative trope, in which the creeping forces of the wealthy urban classes threaten the pioneering and masculinized way of life and the homosocial bonds that sustain it, is repeated throughout the campaign. The ‘Good on ya, mate’ that ends each advertisement is usually in response to the successful resistance of urban influence, and the refrain is critical in connecting the repudiating action performed to a performance recognizable as authentically male. It is the interpellative vernacular of the Kiwi bloke, at once welcoming the ‘mate’ addressed into the circle of homosociality, while simultaneously setting the terms of recognition that this belonging entails.</p>
<p>Historian Jock Phillips identifies a fear that ‘the material luxuries of urban life were making men soft and effeminate’ as being attached to New Zealand men as early as the late 1800s (1996: 98), and this conflation of class and demasculinisation is made even more explicit in ‘Nightmare’, (n.d.) one of the last advertisements in the campaign. The advertisement begins with the two familiar characters in a pub, but their speech is unexpectedly inflected with the tones of the upper classes, and their conversation is marked by the concerns of wealth. They enquire after each other’s wives, there is talk of tennis lessons, ‘posh’ horse-racing meetings and stock markets, and the barmaid mixes margaritas in a cocktail shaker instead of serving Speight’s. Most disturbingly, the older man approvingly enquires as to whether his mate is wearing a new hat, to which the response is ‘Susan chose it for me. I think it works, don’t you?’ This is followed by a cut to the two men sleeping rough under the stars as the old man wakes from the upper-class nightmare we have just seen. The exchange that follows is far more familiar:
<disp-quote>
<p>Young man: You right?</p>
<p>Old man: That’s not a new hat is it boy?</p>
<p>Young man: Nup.</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>The old man’s voiceover expresses his appreciation of his rightfully restored place in the ‘eternally spiralling cosmos’, and the natural world is properly restored with the requisite ‘Good on ya, mate.’</p>
<p>As the moment that compels his waking, the moment of absolute horror in the old man’s nightmare is a moment of homosocial looking that is disavowed and certainly disallowed in the interactions between men (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1363460712436482">Brady, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1363460712436482">Pronger, 1999</xref>). As Tim Edwards argues, the concerns of fashion destabilize heteronormative masculinity because ‘the process of encouraging men to look at other men as consumers of style, fashion and visual display’ blurs the distinctions between hetero and homo by offering straight men a relation of looking historically only available to gay men (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1363460712436482">Edwards, 1997</xref>: 116). According to Edwards, these ‘homosexual jitters’ read ‘“Hey, that’s a great suit, where did you get that?” as dangerously close to “Hey, you look great in that suit, do you want a date?’” (1997: 117).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-1363460712436482">8</xref></sup> In the dreamscape recesses of his subconscious, an archetype of idealized New Zealand masculinity notices a change in his mate’s appearance. The tentativeness of the old man’s enquiry when he wakes suggests precisely those homosexual jitters, along with his own awareness of the murky borders of homosocial desire; he checks whether his mate has bought a new hat, thereby voicing his anxiety that he may, indeed, have noticed. He is reassured by the monosyllabic gruffness of his mate’s response, and his own ‘Good on ya, mate’ is both a positive acknowledgement of the younger man’s failure to care about how he looks in their intimate all-male space, and a self-reassurance that the boundaries between homo and hetero are firmly back in place.</p>
<p>Yet a parody of ‘Perfect Girl’ uploaded to YouTube suggests that the heterosexual sanctity of that environment may not be as firmly preserved as the Speight’s advertisements, and the heteronormative tropes of masculinity on which they rely, might suggest. Entitled ‘<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1363460712436482">Brokeback Speights’, (2006)</xref> the clip overdubs the images of the first Southern Man advertisement with dialogue that reinscribes the encounter between the two men as a queer one. Whereas the original opens with the old man stating: ‘Hear you’ve been seeing a city girl’, in ‘Brokeback Speights’ this becomes: ‘Hear you’ve been seeing a younger cowboy.’ The younger man replies: ‘He’s a tranny, wants me to go up to Auckland with him’ and a different picture of the object of the young man’s affections is accordingly edited in. There is still ‘a place in the harbour’ on offer, but the other attractions now include a blonde wig and a bondage club. Like the woman in the original, however, the tranny ‘doesn’t drink Speight’s’, and the ‘hard road finding the perfect boy’ is acknowledged with the same ‘Still, no hurry aye’, and affirmed with the familiar ‘Good on ya, mate.’ As the allusion to the film <italic>Brokeback Mountain</italic> (released 2005) in the title suggests, this queer rewriting reinscribes the two men’s relationship as a sexual one. The old man’s initial enquiry about the ‘younger cowboy’ is suffused with the anxiety of a jealous lover, and when the camera lingers on the younger man as he says ‘Still, no hurry aye’, the shot now has an undertone of sexual tension.</p>
<p>This parodic appropriation could be read as a similar (if, perhaps, less sophisticated) strategy to that undertaken by Eve Sedgwick in <italic>Between Men: English Literature and Male Homosocial Desire.</italic> There Sedgwick subjects 19th-century English literature to what transgender theorist Jay Prosser describes as ‘deliberate yet wonderfully subtle overreadings that [bring] to the surface its sexual subtexts’ (2006: 260). What is crucial in Prosser’s description is his recognition that the queer rereadings that Sedgwick employs are only possible because of the homosexual subtext that the literature she examines contains. Sedgwick frames her analysis with the observation that the term ‘homosocial’ is used to refer to bonds between people of the same sex while simultaneously distinguishing those bonds from those that are homosexual, and notes that the range of all-male relationships to which it can refer may include those ‘characterized by intense homophobia, fear and hatred of homosexuality’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1363460712436482">Sedgwick, 1985</xref>: 1). Sedgwick counters this usage with the contention that homosocial and homosexual co-exist in a continuum of male desire, the knowledge of which may destabilize the heteronormative assumptions that give meaning to the relations between men. It is not that all men are homosexual but that the demarcation of certain relations of desire between men <italic>as</italic> homosexual<italic>,</italic> and others as not, is a false binary that serves heteronormative ends. The ‘crisis of homo/heterosexual definition’ that Sedgwick points to in <italic>Epistemology of the Closet</italic> is a crisis around the discursive management of the knowledge that this binary is repeatedly contradicted in culture, and that those contradictions threaten to reveal the extent to which hetero and homo ‘actually subsist in a more unsettled and dynamic tacit relation’ (1990: 10). To suggest, that either Sedgwick or ‘Brokeback Speights’ activates a <italic>sub</italic>text might thus not be entirely accurate. Rather what those queer readings point to are the ways in which texts constitutive of normative masculinity are simultaneously and automatically read as sites at which homosexual desire is an impossibility, even, or <italic>especially,</italic> when men’s desire for the close company of other men is clearly being played out.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec3-1363460712436482"><title>Homosociality and the perfect girl</title>
<p>Both Sedgwick and Judith Butler point to those sites at which the distinction between homosexuality and heterosexuality is most obviously contradicted as the same sites at which the knowledge of that contradiction is most energetically disavowed. In <italic>The Psychic Life of Power</italic>, Butler highlights the prohibition on gays in the American military as one such example:
<disp-quote>
<p>And it is, we might conjecture, precisely the fear of setting homosexuality loose from this circuit of renunciation that so terrifies the guardians of masculinity in the U.S. military. What would masculinity ‘be’ without this aggressive circuit of renunciation from which it is wrought? Gays in the military threaten to undo masculinity only because this masculinity is made of repudiated homosexuality. (1997: 143)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>For Butler, gender identity is inextricable from the ‘heterosexual matrix’ that she argues naturalizes the coherence of sex, gender and desire (1990: 151 n6). Normative masculinity cannot be thought outside of compulsory heterosexuality. But the relationship between normative masculinity and repudiated homosexuality is a relationship of disavowal that masks the constitutive relationship <italic>between</italic> homosexuality and gender normativity. As Butler argues in <italic>Bodies That Matter,</italic> and restates via her example of gays in the military, what repudiation reveals is the possibility of an ‘identification <italic>with</italic> an abject homosexuality at the heart of heterosexual identification’ (1993: 111).</p>
<p>Butler arrives at this conclusion via an ongoing rereading of Freud that she begins in <italic>Gender Trouble,</italic> in which his narrative of gender identification articulated as the Oedipal crisis is considered alongside his account of the melancholic structure of mourning. She argues that in the logic of Freudian psychoanalysis the identification with the same-sex parent that marks the end of the Oedipal crisis, and thus the child’s transition into normative gender identity, may demonstrate a disavowed same-sex desire. According to Butler, the Freudian account of child development presumes, but never articulates, a prior taboo on homosexuality. Freud contends that all children begin as bisexual and direct desire toward both their parents. Yet Freud characterizes this bisexuality as the existence of masculine and feminine ‘dispositions’, and equates a masculine disposition (whatever the gender of the child) as desire for the mother, and a feminine disposition with desire for the father. Bisexuality, as Butler argues, is thus for Freud ‘<italic>the coincidence of two heterosexual desires within a single psyche’</italic> (1990: 61), without any explanation or ‘proof’ of why desire cannot be considered in homosexual terms.</p>
<p>In addressing Freud’s discounting of the possibility of homosexuality, Butler asks how he comes to distinguish between the ‘dispositions’ he connects to this heterosexualized bisexuality, and the ‘internalized identifications’ he associates with normative gender development. In order to describe the implications of what she means by this, Butler turns to Freud’s discussion of the relationship between identification and grief. In the essay ‘Mourning and Melancholia’, Freud contends that when a subject loses a love-object, the psyche grieves that loss in a state of mourning but ultimately resolves it by accepting the loss, and investing its libidinal energy in a new love-object. Melancholia, in contrast, refers to the state of a subject who cannot accept their loss and resolve their grief. Unable to let go of the lost object, the melancholic psyche seeks to preserve it through incorporating some aspect of it into its own ego. This process of introjection manifests itself in an identification with the lost love-object rather than a new object-cathexis.</p>
<p>In <italic>The Ego and the Id</italic> Freud revises his characterisation of melancholia as a pathological state of unresolved mourning. Instead, as Butler describes it, ‘the identification with lost loves characteristic of melancholia becomes the <italic>precondition</italic> for the work of mourning’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1363460712436482">Butler, 1990</xref>: 62). Butler examines the ramifications of this shift when considered alongside the heteronormativity that underpins the resolution of the Oedipal crisis, and in <italic>The Psychic Life of Power</italic> she asks whether there might be a way in which ‘<italic>gender</italic> identifications or, rather, the identifications that become central to the formation of gender, are produced through melancholic identification’ (1997: 134–135). Butler’s suggestion is that the identification with the same-sex parent that marks the end of the Oedipal crisis, and the corresponding assumption of (hetero)normative gender identity, might in fact be a melancholic identification with the same-sex parent as a lost love object. Because (homosexual) gender identification with the opposite sex is untenable, the masculinity that for the boy is marked by identification with the father, for example, is forever ‘haunted by the love it cannot grieve’ (1997: 138). Normative masculinity is marked by a disavowed identification with the feminine that is also the irresolvable grief of homosexual loss.</p>
<p>In <italic>Undoing Gender</italic> Butler summarizes the significance of heterosexual melancholia by explaining that in drawing attention to the relationship between homosexual attachment and the heterosexualized consolidation of gender norms, she is seeking to demonstrate ‘how a prohibition on certain forms of love becomes installed as an ontological truth about the subject: the “am” of “I am a man” encodes the prohibition “I may not love a man” … ’(2004: 199). Thus the performative announcement of sex always simultaneously cites and reconstitutes a repudiation of homosexuality. This is the force of prohibition, the repression of a prior (if ontologically suspect) ‘truth’ about that gendered subject. Yet, because in <italic>Gender Trouble</italic> Butler is reading Freud through Foucault (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1363460712436482">Butler, 1990: 72</xref>), the prohibition is generative. ‘I may not love a man’ produces ‘I am a man’ (rather than the other way round). Hence her assertion in relation to the military that ‘masculinity is made of repudiated homosexuality’ (1997: 143). It is the unspoken and ungrievable taboo on homosexuality that produces gender identity, rather than the normative resolution of naturalized heterosexual desire. Heteronormativity produces gender identity but it produces gender as an identification with a same-sex parent who is simultaneously disavowed as a lost love-object. In short, normative gender identity is unresolved homosexual grief.</p>
<p>Read through this framework, the queer appropriation of ‘Perfect Girl’ in ‘Brokeback Speights’ is unnecessary, even as it simultaneously makes perfect sense. Given the age difference between the two characters, and ways in which the campaign includes ‘the wisdom of older men being passed on to younger ones’ as part of its performance of masculinity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1363460712436482">Law, 1997</xref>: 25), a father/son identification is a relatively easy reading to make. The younger man’s refusal of a new object-cathexis can therefore also be read as a desire to preserve the melancholic identification that marks his relationship with the older man. There is little difference, therefore, between ‘Perfect Girl’ and its parody, except that ‘Brokeback Speights’ makes explicit what is already available in a reading of the original advertisement through the logic of melancholia. With that in mind, another question presents itself: what happens if we extend that logic to the repudiated love-object also represented in ‘Perfect Girl’? Does her transformation into a ‘tranny’ in ‘Brokeback Speights’ similarly reveal a reading already available in the original text?</p>
<p>As I argued earlier, beer advertising repeatedly connects the consumption of a particular brand of beer to a legitimized performance of maleness. It positions beer drinking, and drinking the ‘right’ brand of beer, as among the most paradigmatic of performative acts of masculinity. Because of the cultural mythology that it draws on, and the tropes of masculinity that it deploys, the Southern Man campaign is an example of precisely this kind of beer advertising. Yet, in ‘Perfect Girl’, the younger man assesses the attributes of his seemingly perfect girlfriend, and draws attention to the only one that seems to count: this otherwise perfect woman doesn’t drink Speight’s beer, the activity that is being unequivocally connected in the advertisement to an authorized performance of masculinity. In the performative logic of the text, this perfectly feminine girl, with her pink dress and her blonde hair, is rejected precisely for the very coherence of her gender. In short, this woman is not quite <italic>man</italic> enough for a real Southern Man.</p>

<sec id="sec4-1363460712436482"><title>The transgendered Kiwi</title>
<p>In the essay ‘Queer, here: Sexuality and space’, Lee Wallace refers to an unspoken but shared New Zealand knowledge that ‘transgenderism and the homosexuality which it frequently screens … has something crucial to say about the formation of national identity’ (2004: 68). She discusses a number of moments in which evocations of transgenderism emerge within more familiar articulations of gender in New Zealand’s cultural landscape. This transgenderism is performed as anomalous to the ‘New Zealandness’ whose limits are simultaneously being marked. Yet, as Wallace notes, the ease with which such anomalies are rehabilitated into the socio-cultural fabric of mediated New Zealand life suggests that these nominally queer moments are integral to, rather than at odds with, the constitutive repetition of what is routinely identified as the national character.</p>
<p>The example Wallace cites of Georgina Beyer neatly encapsulates the paradox of repudiation and representation that she explores. In 1995, Beyer – a transsexual former sex-worker – was elected to the mayoralty of the rural township of Carterton. In 1999 she defeated the sitting conservative candidate to become the district’s representative in government, and the world’s first openly transsexual member of parliament. Perhaps most remarkable about these unexpected relationships of representation is the ease with which they came to be rendered rather unremarkable (Beyer was quietly re-elected to both positions), except perhaps in their status as a source of pride at being previously unimagined ‘world firsts’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1363460712436482">Wallace, 2004</xref>: 68). That a transsexual might be elected and re-elected as representative of New Zealand’s citizenship is certainly surprising. That her representative function would be in the service of New Zealand’s rural ‘heartland’, whose mythic status as the inaugurating authority of ‘New Zealandness’ is central to the country’s cultural imaginary, is, at first glance, astonishing.</p>
<p>At the same time, however, Peter Limbrick’s assertion that this ‘transsexual diva politician from New Zealand’ is someone the USA ‘could only dream of having’, points to the particularities of place as productive of queer intersections with identity unimaginable in another cultural context (2008: 190). Beyer’s elections resonate with what Wallace describes as an ‘inarticulate acceptance’ of how queerness and transgenderism function at/as the representative and constitutive sites of New Zealand identity (2004: 68). The country’s ‘long national tradition of implying that there is a queer underside to everything and saying nothing more about it’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1363460712436482">Wallace, 2004</xref>: 67–68) marries the understated Kiwi of national myth-making to the gender disturbances that he (and I use the gendered pronoun deliberately) might normatively be expected to have the most to speak about. Thus, the line between what is queerly at odds with, and what functions as, New Zealandness is repeatedly transgressed in some unspoken but shared national contract of disavowal.</p>
<p>As an epigraph to his discussion of the San Francisco premiere of <italic>Georgie Girl</italic>, a documentary about Beyer, Limbrick quotes an unnamed farmer and voter who announces: ‘I’m going to vote for that Georgina Beyer because she’s a go-getter and she’s a good chap’ (cited in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1363460712436482">Limbrick, 2008</xref>: 184). The conflation of the male and female in a sentence that should function as a contradiction resonates with articulations of queer. Eve Sedgwick’s inclusion of ‘lesbians who sleep with men’ in a list of what queer might refer to (1993: 8) similarly makes non-sense, and is imagined as political in its incommensurability. The latter is articulated to disrupt; the farmer’s statement, in contrast, positions the unfamiliar within a nostalgic idiom (‘a good chap’) that ensures that what doesn’t actually make sense feels and sounds altogether unremarkable. This ‘paradoxically expressed nonchalance’, as Limbrick describes it, neatly encapsulates the extent to which Beyer’s political career complicates ‘urban oriented theories of gender and sexuality’ (187–188) that figure the rural as always already repressive.</p>
<p>In a discussion of the Stewart Main film, <italic>50 Ways of Saying Fabulous</italic> (released 2005), Limbrick suggests that the queer childhood depicted in the text animates ‘a space that exists in the cultural imaginary of New Zealand as a barren, isolated landscape of settler masculinities like those pictured in Speight’s “Southern Man” beer advertisements’ (2008: 187–188). My suggestion here is that such animations are managed by the ‘queerness’ that constructs that cultural imaginary in precisely those Speight’s-like terms. Just as ‘Brokeback Speights’ animates what is already present in ‘Perfect Girl’, perhaps the queer childhood is possible because of the contradictions that structure those settler masculinities. Yet, as Sedgwick argues, revealing the contradictions of homosocial desire does not necessarily destabilize their normative effects (1990: 11). New Zealand culture is full of oddly queer moments yet those moments, oddly, seem not always to do the work of queer.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-1363460712436482">9</xref></sup></p>
<p>The reading of ‘Perfect Girl’ as evidencing a transgender figure as the object of normative masculine desire suggests that the Speight’s campaign might occupy similarly ambiguous ground. It demonstrates a connection between the inarticulate acceptance of constitutive queerness that Wallace describes, and the homosociality that is integral to the performative reproduction of New Zealand’s pakeha masculinity. The homosocial contexts privileged in the myths of New Zealand manhood threaten to simultaneously undermine the heterosexual limits of its normative reproduction by revealing a disavowed connection between the masculine identification they engender, and homosexual desire. Within the Southern Man campaign such threats are mitigated by a performance of embodied femaleness that offers a reassurance of heterosexuality within a masculine signifying economy. If women are to be admitted into the homosocial space that is the performance of nationalist mythologies, they can only do so if they fail to fully take up the position of the feminine, and as a consequence do not disturb the networks of male desire. Femaleness recognizable as New Zealandness can function only as a misperformed masculinity that underpins, rather than disturbs, masculine homosociality.</p>
<p>This is underlined by Sharon, the barmaid who appears in ‘The Deerstalker’s Ball’ (2007) and ‘Nightmare’, (n.d.) and the only female character in the Southern Man campaign. Conventionally feminine in appearance, with long blonde hair, Sharon was introduced, in part, to qualify the masculinity of the previous advertisements, possibly in response to research that indicated that plenty of women were in fact drinking Speight’s beer (Jane Cherrington, 2008, personal communication). Given the primary target audience, however, such an inclusion could not undermine the carefully signified masculinity of the brand. The other characters’ appreciation of Sharon thus only takes place on resolutely homosocial terms.</p>
<p>When we are first introduced to Sharon in ‘The Deerstalker’s Ball’, it is through a seemingly heteronormative performance of femininity. She has two tickets to the Deerstalker’s Ball, and flirtatiously offers them to the younger of the Southern Man pair, with the clearly signalled intention that she would be going with him. Yet, seemingly unaware of her romantic designs, he takes the tickets and takes his mate to the ball instead. Within the repudiating norms of New Zealand masculinity, it is perfectly acceptable to drink beer (especially free beer) with your mates, and to sometimes reject a woman’s advances in order to do so. At the same time, however, the young man fails to recognize that he is being addressed as a heterosexual male subject, and he never ‘sees’ the romantic encounter he is being offered. If the young man is indeed a ‘real’ man (and the premise of the entire campaign is to underline that this is precisely what he is) then Sharon’s inability to compel recognition of a heteronormative moment of desire could be argued to position her as inauthentically female. She does not signify as the object of desire, and the gendered authority of her address may well be undone by her inability to count as a coherently gendered subject. If, as ‘Nightmare’ demonstrates, the legitimate male subject cannot be the object of the male gaze, then the reverse might also be true. A body that cannot be recognized as the object cannot count as legitimately female. When a candidate for the perfect woman appears in the Southern Man campaign (and given that she pours Speight’s, we can assume that Sharon also drinks it) she can take up a place in the homosocial, but she still cannot replace the original love-object who the young man takes on a date to the ball.</p>
<p>Moreover, if Sharon’s femininity goes unrecognized, her ‘masculinity’, though necessarily incomplete, does not. She is described in ‘The Deerstalker’s Ball’, as a ‘good sport’, an expression of appreciation that in the understated vernacular of Kiwi mateship might equally be understood as a ‘top bloke’, or as a ‘good chap’ like Georgina Beyer. Her identification with masculinity is certainly apparent in ‘Nightmare’. There, like that of the two men, Sharon’s identity is threatened by the feminized trappings of class that circulate in the older man’s subconscious. She is inexpertly mixing fancy cocktails rather than pouring beer, and appears as out of place as the two Southern Men in a context populated by ‘genuinely’ feminine women. She is neither authentically female, nor authentically male, but embodies instead a misperformance of gender that serves to uphold, rather than disturb, the gendered paradigm with which she cannot fully engage.</p>
<p>Of course there are other ways of reading Sharon, and of reading her repudiation by the younger man. But, like Sedgwick’s ‘overreading’ of English literature, queer readings can reveal the ways in which disavowal works to privilege particular frameworks of power. Alexander Doty makes a similar argument in <italic>Making Things Perfectly Queer,</italic> where he argues that queer readings can be dismissed as connotative or insubstantial as long as ‘we keep thinking within conventional heterocentrist paradigms, which always already have decided that expressions of queerness are <italic>sub</italic>-textual, <italic>sub</italic>-cultural, <italic>alternative</italic> readings’ rather than as evidence of the queerness already present in culture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1363460712436482">Doty, 1993</xref>: xii).</p>
<p>The politics of ‘reading’, and the difficulties of determining what parodic or ironic performances might effect, have a particular resonance in a New Zealand context increasingly cognisant of the ways in which performances of masculinity are mediated. Practices mythologized within, and as, New Zealand masculinity are increasingly deployed with a certain amount of knowingness. As Law, Campbell and Schick argue:
<disp-quote>
<p>Representations of ‘typical’ blokes pop up everywhere from serious literature to television advertisements, so that practices of ‘blokish’ masculinity in New Zealand now carry the weight of a certain self-consciousness. Can a Kiwi male still pull a black singlet over his head without a slight flicker of irony? (1999: 17)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>The Southern Man campaign has certainly been received in those terms, yet, as Law argues, the ‘dry, self-mocking sense of humour’ it engages might be precisely what enables it to reconstitute the mythologies it employs:
<disp-quote>
<p>The ironic humour is crucial, since it allows the ads to be enjoyed by male (and perhaps female) readers on two levels: they can identify with the heroic image of the Southern Man, but can protect themselves from ridicule and feminist challenges by implying that it is all a performance. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1363460712436482">Law, 1997</xref>: 24)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>In a slight revision of Law’s argument about the dual layers of reading enacted by the text’s ironic address, Campbell, Law and Honeyfield argue that the two levels on which males might read the Speight’s campaign (and other campaigns of the same era that use similar discursive mechanisms) are:
<disp-quote>
<p>As a representation of mythic masculine identity with historical depth, and consequently, great legitimacy; and as an ironic, nostalgic version of an admirable fiction (a belief that ‘real men don’t exist any more and I wouldn’t measure up if they did … society is changing, things will never be as they were in the past’). (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1363460712436482">Campbell et al., 1999</xref>: 182)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>What is particularly interesting here is that in both readings, masculinity is understood through a framework of authenticity. ‘Historical depth’, lends a mythic masculinity ‘great legitimacy’, but also irony is simultaneously read as nostalgia for what has been lost: <italic>real</italic> men don’t exist <italic>any more</italic>. Unlike the subversive performances of gender that <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1363460712436482">Butler suggests might reveal the performativity of gender itself (1990: 139)</xref>, here the ironic copy seemingly legitimizes an original, authentic source.</p>
<p>As the various discussions that have arisen in relation to Butler’s use of drag in <italic>Gender Trouble</italic> demonstrate, the line between irony and the reconstitution of norms is by no means clear. Both Butler and Sedgwick draw attention to the capacity of heteronormative culture to withstand and engender performances that draw attention to its array of contradictions. Butler cautions against imagining a destabilizing politics in all parody, and argues that:
<disp-quote>
<p>there must be a way to understand what makes certain kinds of parodic repetitions effectively disruptive, truly troubling, and which repetitions become domesticated and rearticulated as instruments of cultural hegemony. (1990: 139)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>While Butler gives no indication of what that ‘way to understand’ might be, anyone who has stood on the terraces at the Carisbrook rugby ground in New Zealand’s southernmost city and witnessed hundreds of young men passionately singing the chorus to the ‘Southern Man Song’ written for the Speight’s campaign<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-1363460712436482">10</xref></sup> might acknowledge that even a campaign (arguably) intended ironically still draws on, and reconstitutes, a persistent belief in <italic>some</italic> type of authentic masculinity. The ubiquity of the homophobia and the tactility of the homosociality that accompany such events make similar claims to the ongoing relevance of examining how the two might be connected in the performative production of normative heterosexuality.</p>
<p>The homosocial contexts that define New Zealand masculinity’s limits, and reproduce its rituals of belonging, are structured by an anxious reaffirmation of heterosexuality that utilizes the transgression of heteronormativity to underline its constraining imperatives. As Sedgwick argues, it is not that the boundaries of the homosocial are routinely compromised in the normative reproduction of gender relations that produces the ‘crisis’ she describes, but that such sites of transgression produce crisis through the management of information about them. Transgressions of the hetero/homo binary must thus be managed back to a performance that makes ‘sense’ in the terms of the heteronormative. The Speight’s campaign demonstrates that performances that can be described as ‘transgender’ are deployed in representations of pakeha New Zealand masculinity as precisely such a technique of management.</p>
<p>Lee Wallace argues that the intimate relationship between transgenderism and/as homosexuality, and what counts as ‘New Zealandness’ is a relationship that ‘all New Zealanders know about without being taught’ (2004: 68). This ‘half-truth so hardwired into the national consciousness’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1363460712436482">Wallace, 2004</xref>: 67) that it requires little explicit articulation when it appears is, I would argue, both the recognition of disavowal, and the inarticulate acknowledgment of the terms by which the disavowed relation of identification is to be managed. According to Wallace, the relation between nationality and sexuality that she describes works to ‘paste over’ more difficult distinctions in the discourses of nationhood (2004: 68). In the Speight’s campaign a performance of transgender is deployed to paste over the murky <italic>in</italic>distinction of homosociality that structures and performatively produces the sites of masculinity with which that nationhood is routinely conflated. A transgendered kiwi performs the distinction of heterosexuality in order to paste over the anxiety-ridden indistinction that marks the homosociality on which New Zealand masculinity depends.</p>

The ways in which an indigenous ‘Maori culture’ is utilized in the production of New Zealand identity is a significant absence in my discussion here, not least because the marking out of New Zealand masculinity is, in part, a marking out against a colonized native ‘other’ that simultaneously incorporates and ritualizes that other in new, and often highly problematic, ways. At the same time, the paradigm of masculinity that this article argues is privileged in New Zealand’s mediated imagining of itself to itself is one mediated through the colonizing lens of pakeha subjectivity.
