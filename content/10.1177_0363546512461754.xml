<sec id="section1-0363546512461754">
<title>Background:</title>
<p>In Major League Baseball (MLB), helmet hit-by-pitch (H-HBP) incidents are a leading cause of concussion. However, not all H-HBPs result in diagnosed concussion.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-0363546512461754">
<title>Purpose:</title>
<p>This study was designed to (1) quantify batter concussion risk as a function of H-HBP pitch velocity, time duration batter spent on the ground post–H-HBP, first responder assessment time duration, and number of days missed post–H-HBP and (2) estimate H-HBP impact locations on the helmet with respect to current National Operating Committee on Standards for Athletic Equipment (NOCSAE) helmet test standards and correlate impact locations with concussion diagnosis.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0363546512461754">
<title>Study Design:</title>
<p>Case-control study; Level of evidence, 3.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0363546512461754">
<title>Methods:</title>
<p>A retrospective case-control study of 18 MLB players with H-HBP incidents in the 2009 and 2010 seasons was undertaken. A database was compiled via quantitative and qualitative analysis using video coverage obtained from MLB. Quantitative factors included batter concussion diagnosis, pitch velocity, number of days missed post–H-HBP, time duration batter spent on the ground post–H-HBP, and first responder assessment time duration. The H-HBP impact location was among several qualitative factors developed via video analysis of each H-HBP from 4 raters.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0363546512461754">
<title>Results:</title>
<p>In our study, 9 players (50%) were diagnosed with concussion. Concussion diagnoses were more frequent for posterior versus anterior impacts. The majority of H-HBP impact locations were different from those in the current NOCSAE standard tests. First responders took an average of approximately 65 seconds (time to reach batter plus assessment time) to decide on batter removal/return to play. The 25% logistic regression concussion risk threshold for pitch velocity and days missed was 86.2 mph and 1.3 days, respectively. The number of days missed after H-HBP showed a significant correlation (<italic>P</italic> = .02) among concussed and nonconcussed batters.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0363546512461754">
<title>Conclusion:</title>
<p>In professional baseball H-HBP incidents, first responders should (1) be aware of pitch velocity in excess of 86 mph and (2) be provided ample time when assessing batters’ removal/return to play.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-0363546512461754">
<title>Clinical Relevance:</title>
<p>First responders should not rely solely on visual indicators such as batter reaction, holding head, or amount of time spent on the ground after H-HBP when assessing batters for concussion. Batting helmets in the MLB should maximize protection and mitigate impact dosage for H-HBP impact locations and velocity in addition to NOCSAE standard test locations and velocities.</p>

<body>
<p>In professional baseball in the United States, batters are at risk of sustaining a helmet hit-by-pitch (H-HBP) and concussion with every pitch faced. At the high school and collegiate level, concussion has been reported as 0.08 and 0.23 per 1000 athlete-exposures (A-E) during games, respectively.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0363546512461754">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0363546512461754">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0363546512461754">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0363546512461754">16</xref></sup> Although the exact concussion incidence and rate in Major League Baseball (MLB) remains unknown, approximately 51% of all concussions reported in high school and collegiate baseball players occur in H-HBP incidents.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0363546512461754">8</xref></sup> Although the incidence of concussion in baseball is low, compared with collegiate American football (3.02 per 1000 A-E) and women’s soccer (1.80 per 1000 A-E), the consequences of H-HBP can be dire.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0363546512461754">4</xref></sup> A number of professional baseball players have incurred concussion due to an H-HBP, but it is unclear how the circumstances differ between these players and others who experienced H-HBP impacts without concussion.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0363546512461754">7</xref></sup> At present, it is difficult to conclusively diagnose the presence/absence of concussion during the time allotted to MLB first responders following H-HBP incidents. Moreover, there are few reliable indicators to predict concussion severity and time required for symptom resolution.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0363546512461754">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0363546512461754">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0363546512461754">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0363546512461754">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0363546512461754">18</xref></sup> Finally, MLB helmets are designed based on NOCSAE (National Operating Committee on Standards for Athletic Equipment) 60-mph impact tests.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0363546512461754">17</xref></sup> However, MLB pitchers commonly throw pitches at velocity well in excess of 60 mph, and actual MLB H-HBP impact location is unknown.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0363546512461754">12</xref></sup>
</p>
<p>Hence, the aims of the current study were to (1) quantify batter concussion risk as a function of H-HBP pitch velocity, number of days missed post–H-HBP, time duration batter spent on the ground post–H-HBP, and first responder assessment time duration; (2) estimate H-HBP impact locations on the helmet with respect to current NOCSAE helmet test standards and correlate impact locations with concussion diagnosis; and (3) serve as a pilot study subject to cross-validation in a larger cohort.</p>

<title>Historical Context</title>
<p>Interest in baseball-to-head incidents stretches back more than 100 years (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0363546512461754">Figure 1</xref>). On September 14, 1909, Dayton Veterans second baseman Charles “Cupid” Pinkney died after a pitch struck the left side of his skull “just above and behind his left ear, fracturing his skull.”<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0363546512461754">5</xref></sup> On August 17, 1920, Cleveland Indians shortstop Ray “Chappie” Chapman became the second professional ballplayer to die after a pitch struck him on the left side of his skull, causing a “depressed fracture in Chapman’s head three and a half inches long … and … lacerated the brain not only on the left side of the head where the ball struck but also on the right side where the shock of the blow had forced the brain against the skull.”<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0363546512461754">1</xref></sup> Although both men went to bat without the aid of protective headgear, save their wool ball caps, it was Chapman’s death that has been credited with moving MLB toward widespread use of batting helmets.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0363546512461754">20</xref></sup> First, during spring training in 1921, the Cleveland Indians experimented with a leather head covering that was very similar to leather football helmets. This innovation was continued in 1941, when the Brooklyn Dodgers became the first team to use plastic batting helmets. By 1956, the National League made batting helmets mandatory, and in 1958, the American League followed suit. Although batting helmets mandated by MLB in the 1950s and in use today have been developed to combat catastrophic head injuries such as those befalling Charles Pinkney and Ray Chapman, modern clinical head injury concerns should also focus on concussion due to H-HBP.</p>

<caption><p>Ray “Chappie” Chapman (January 15, 1891, to August 17, 1920), a shortstop playing for the Cleveland Indians, remains the only Major League Baseball player in history killed from being hit by a pitch to the left side of his skull. Chapman’s death is generally credited with spurring advancements in batter head protection, leading to rule changes mandating batting helmets in the 1950s. Chapman is interred at Lakeview Cemetery in Cleveland, Ohio.</p></caption>

<title>Methods</title>
<p>A retrospective case-control study of H-HBP incidents (n = 18) in MLB seasons 2009 and 2010 was undertaken. This series of players represented a sample of athletes from a variety of MLB teams. Cases were identified through a rigorous online search of the MLB video and press release database looking at keywords including <italic>hit in head, head, helmet, beaning, beanball</italic>, and <italic>concussion</italic>. The Cleveland Clinic Institutional Review Board (IRB) granted permission to conduct the study. Video coverage at 30 frames per second of each incident was obtained via MLB and its website (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://MLB.com">http://MLB.com</ext-link>). At least 2 viewpoints were obtained for each H-HBP, and all videos obtained had contiguous display regardless of switching among different cameras in the video feed unless noted otherwise, noted as indeterminate in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0363546512461754">Table 1</xref>. A database was compiled of these incidents via quantitative and qualitative analysis. Quantitative factors included team physician concussion diagnosis (n = 18), pitch velocity (n = 18), number of days the batter missed post–H-HBP (n = 18), time duration batter spent on the ground post–H-HBP (n = 14), and first responder assessment time duration before removal/return-to-play decision finalized (n = 15). Pitcher and batter handedness were obtained from the videos. Days lost were obtained from espn.com. Diagnoses of concussion and information about any previous concussion history were obtained from the MLB website. In all cases, pitch velocity was indicated in the video clip, which was measured using PITCHf/x technology.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0363546512461754">21</xref></sup> Batter time to get up and responder assessment time were measured using a stopwatch. The first responder in all cases was the head team athletic trainer. Subsequent neurologic assessment and determination of concussion diagnosis were made by the team physician.</p>

<p>Specifically, the dichotomous concussion parameter (1 = yes, 0 = no) was plotted on the abscissa versus each continuous variable (pitch velocity, number of days missed, time spent on the ground, responder assessment time) on the ordinate.</p>
<p>Although H-HBP impact location was the primary qualitative factor collected, batter/pitcher preimpact responses and first responder visual cues were also qualitatively assessed via a “consensus” frame-by-frame photogrammetric video analysis of each H-HBP from 4 individuals blinded to the clinical outcome (A.A., A.B., B.P., and P.M.). The senior author has been a major league team physician for 20 years and currently serves on the MLB Medical Advisory Committee and the MLB Mild Traumatic Brain Injury (MTBI) Committee, with the other 3 authors being engineers trained in the photogrammetric study of still-frame images. Full details are provided in the Appendix (available online at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://ajs.sagepub.com/supplemental/">http://ajs.sagepub.com/supplemental/</ext-link>). Estimating the impact location versus potential ricochet (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0363546512461754">Figure 2</xref>) was a specific focus during qualitative analysis.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>Of 18 H-HBP batters analyzed, 9 were diagnosed with concussion (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0363546512461754">Table 1</xref>). None of the players had observed loss of consciousness or had a previous reported history of a concussion. Estimated helmet impact locations are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0363546512461754">Figure 3</xref> and contrasted with the selected locations for NOCSAE testing along the mid-portion of the helmet. Five of 8 concussed batters (red dots in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0363546512461754">Figure 3</xref>) sustained impacts to the occipital-temporal area. Of the 7 impacts with estimated location anterior to the auditory canal, 1 impact resulted in a concussion. When compared with the current NOCSAE test locations (yellow dots in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0363546512461754">Figure 3</xref>), 2 of the 18 (11%) MLB H-HBP estimated impact locations were within an approximate ball diameter as the current NOCSAE test sites. All batters were facing pitchers of the same handedness (eg, right vs right, left vs left). In 17 of 18 cases, a right-handed pitcher was facing a right-handed batter, and the pitch type was a fastball.</p>

<p>The results of the logistic regression on the quantitative data showed that only the number of days missed showed a significant correlation with concussion (<italic>P</italic> = .02), whereas pitch velocity (<italic>P</italic> = .61), batter time spent on the ground (<italic>P</italic> = .62), and first responder assessment time (<italic>P</italic> = .34) showed no significant correlation with logistic regression concussion risk (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0363546512461754">Figure 4</xref>). Pitch velocity, number of days missed, batter time spent on the ground, and first responder assessment time logistic regression curves were plotted. The respective values that correspond to the 25% concussion risk for pitch velocity were 86.2 mph and 1.3 days missed. The regression curves for batter time spent on the ground and first responder assessment time were of poor fit, and 25% risk was not computed for these parameters. Of note was that first responder assessment time averaged approximately 65 seconds before the removal/return-to-play decision was finalized.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>This is an initial and novel investigation that examines quantitative and qualitative predictors of concussion diagnosis in MLB batters hit in sustaining H-HBP. Impacts to the helmet in the occipital or temporal regions of the cranium accounted for the majority of concussions and were likely due to the batter reaction (to turn the head away from the ball, tuck the chin, and raise the front of the shoulder), which generally appeared to cause a more direct impact between the ball and the helmet. This finding may be consistent with previous studies showing that peak acceleration was highest on a headform with direct impacts.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0363546512461754">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0363546512461754">19</xref></sup> Hence, the posterior-inferior helmet region represents one area where structural reinforcement and modification of shell designs could be further optimized to increase head protection. This concept has been explored previously.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0363546512461754">10</xref></sup> Only 2 of the estimated impact locations were in the same area as current NOCSAE test locations, with all pitch velocities greatly exceeding the NOCSAE 60-mph test velocity (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0363546512461754">Table 1</xref>). Because qualitatively determined H-HBP impact locations as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0363546512461754">Figure 3</xref> were often (1) different than NOCSAE standard testing locations and (2) occurred at impacts averaging 91 mph, the MLB should consider using batting helmets certified under these real-world impact conditions. Impacts anterior to the auditory canal accounted for the majority of nonconcussed batters and may have permitted more of a glancing blow to the helmet as the ball struck the front curved helmet portion. According to the data presented here, current MLB batting helmet designs, in which the helmet padding appears to be preferentially placed adjacent to NOCSAE test location impact sites, may consider supplemental structural reinforcement to optimally mitigate impact energy and momentum in the various H-HBP impacts observed in our study.</p>
<p>The fact that every H-HBP incident (concussed and nonconcussed) involved batters facing pitchers with the same handedness was intriguing (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0363546512461754">Table 1</xref>). So although 40% of all plate appearances during the 2009 and 2010 seasons were right-handed batters facing right-handed pitchers (vs 31% for left handed–right handed, 20% for right handed–left handed, and 9% for left handed–left handed, respectively),<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0363546512461754">21</xref></sup> the right-versus-right matchups were responsible for 94% of H-HBP in our study. Although not measured in this study, the visual acuity and depth perception available to discern longitudinal and lateral pitch velocity may be decreased in same-handedness batters, possibly more so for right-handed batters facing right-handed pitchers. This finding should be explored more fully and quantified versus non–same-handedness batters in H-HBP incidents.</p>
<p>Of the quantitative parameters analyzed (pitch velocity, number of days missed, time spent on the ground, responder assessment time), only number of days missed showed a significant correlation among concussed and nonconcussed batters (<italic>P</italic> = .02). However, because the number of days missed is a retrospective parameter, this finding does not aid team physicians in diagnosing concussion post–H-HBP prospectively.</p>
<p>Even though not significant in our study, pitch velocity appears to hold value as a concussion predictor. To this end, the 25% concussion risk value for pitch velocity (86.2 mph) could be used as a beginning reference point for possible indication of concussion. This finding is consistent with a previous study that showed that maximum force, and likely concussion in our study, applied to the head is proportional to ball velocity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0363546512461754">3</xref></sup> Some major league pitchers throw a “slider” that can be clocked above 90 mph. Thus, the types of pitches that would most likely be associated with MTBI would include both types of fastballs (2-seam and 4-seam) and a slider. Curve balls and change-ups would not be expected to cause MTBI because of their lower velocity (below 90 mph).</p>
<p>The logistic regression results for batter time spent on the ground and first responder assessment time were inconclusive. Neither of these parameters yielded a good fit to the logistic model. Moreover, the first responder assessment time showed an interesting trend, with higher concussion risk related to lower assessment time. More data would be desirable to clarify these findings. At a minimum, first responders should not rely solely on visual cues, including batter time spent on the ground, when making removal/return-to-play decisions. The average responder assessment time of 65 seconds highlights the time pressure in baseball in making removal/return-to-play decisions, as any player who is removed from play and substituted is unable to return to the game.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0363546512461754">11</xref></sup> This is contrasted with sports such as hockey and American football, where the player can be temporarily substituted and removed from the game to be fully assessed by the team physician prior to making a return-to-play decision.</p>
<p>We found that 4 of 9 concussed players missed less than 3 days, whereas the other concussed players missed at least 16 days. At the time of the study, teams had the option of listing players as day-to-day (where teams would be missing a player from their roster) or listing them in the 15-day disabled list (players would not be able to return for 2 weeks). The MLB has since implemented a 7-day disabled list (DL) specifically for concussions, to prevent players from returning prematurely and give teams a full complement of players in one’s absence. For reasons mentioned previously, using number of days missed as a prospective concussion predictor was infeasible, although this metric may hold value for future retrospective studies and validation of the newly instituted 7-day disabled list in MLB discussed above. Of note, any player missing at least 7 days indicated approximately 100% concussion risk for any player H-HBP.</p>
<p>Limitations of the study include small sample size (n = 18) and qualitative nature of the video analysis. In addition, it is possible that we missed some H-HBP incidents since these incidents are not categorized definitively on the MLB website. Hence, the authors would like to emphasize the pilot nature of the study and that the data analysis should be taken as exploratory, subject to cross-validation in a larger cohort. The videos were not of adequate resolution or frame rate to allow quantitative analysis with known error rates and confidence limits. Hence, there was no known error rate for the impact locations depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0363546512461754">Figure 3</xref>. Other parameters, such as impact energy and momentum absorption, likely carry important implications for helmet design but could not be quantified in this study. Furthermore, all qualitative parameters were subjective based on each rater’s opinion. Moving forward, a focus on the limitation of the aforementioned subjectivity and a retrospective focus on impact dynamics and concussion will be critical. Finally, concussion diagnoses should be made using an objective clinical concussion test, such as SCAT2.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0363546512461754">15</xref></sup> Even a modified version of SCAT2 could be used by first responders if MLB considered providing a commercial break whenever the rare H-HBP instances occur. During the time period that the study was performed, no uniform guidelines existed in MLB regarding the assessment and management of concussed athletes. As such, each individual medical staff would have diagnosed and managed their respective athletes based on generally accepted standard of care protocols. These study data have since been shared with the MLB MTBI Committee (of which the senior author is a member), resulting in the creation of standardized protocols that are now used throughout the league. Moreover, and also in part as a result of our findings, MLB has implemented new guidelines that allow the athletic trainers as much time as they need to assess an athlete who may have experienced a concussion. With an average first responder assessment time of only approximately 65 seconds in our study, MLB could also consider providing additional time to conduct an objective clinical concussion test before deciding on removal/return to play. Future work should consider pairing such an on-field clinical concussion test with quantitative parameters such as pitch velocity, number of days missed, and time the batter spends on the ground. In addition, first responders could also consider similar measures for H-HBP in catchers and umpires, who have been shown to be at risk of concussion.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0363546512461754">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0363546512461754">19</xref></sup>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Based on our preliminary analysis of 18 MLB H-HBP incidents taken from the 2009 and 2010 seasons, 50% (9/18 incidents) resulted in a concussion diagnosis. First responders had an average of 65 seconds to make a decision regarding removal/return to play. Pitch velocity may hold value as a risk indicator (25% threshold for concussion at 86.2 mph) but was not significant in our study. Number of games missed was analyzed as a retrospective concussion risk indicator (25% threshold for concussion at 1.3 days missed) but was not significant.</p>
<p>In professional baseball H-HBP incidents, first responders should (1) be aware of pitch velocity greater than 86 mph and (2) be provided ample time when assessing batters’ removal/return to play. First responders should not rely solely on visual indicators such as batter reaction, holding head after H-HBP, or amount of time spent on the ground. Batting helmets in MLB should maximize protection and mitigate head impact dosage for H-HBP impact locations and impact velocity in addition to NOCSAE test locations and velocities. Future work should consider pairing an on-field clinical concussion test with quantitative parameters such as pitch velocity and time the batter spends on the ground to improve concussion diagnosis accuracy in H-HBP batters.</p>
