<abstract>
<p>In this article, a research team studied acts of leadership in order to explore the phenomenon. It is argued that leadership in organisations is a social process, which may be understood as a series of interaction processes where someone assumes leadership by taking and earning a right to lead. We conclude that the dynamics of processes leading to unstable or uncertain situations in organisations create a need for leadership and provide the context for leadership, and that acts of taking leadership are a function of a time-limited right to lead granted to those assuming leadership by those who choose to follow, and we imply that willpower may be an important vehicle in such acts. Finally, we argue that there is a tendency to oversell the very idea of leadership, as acts of leadership, when practised in accordance with its definitions, are far more rare, subtle and fragile than frequently suggested by popular theories and concepts.</p>

<sec id="sec1-1742715012447007" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title>
<p>Leadership is a label that, for a variety of more or less related issues, has received attention in a huge volume of empirical studies, theoretical work and popular writings. The field of leadership is leader-centred and organisational outcomes are frequently explained by attributing causality to leadership (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1742715012447007">Pfeffer, 1977</xref>). This has created an illusion that appointed leaders can ‘engineer’ the social environment in ways that enhance effective outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1742715012447007">Day et al., 2009</xref>). When leadership is thus conceptualised, the concept often addresses the nature of the leader, thus disregarding the context and process dynamics.</p>
<p>A body of contemporary writings challenges the grandiose aspects of leadership, as well as the taken-for-granted assumption that leaders should be put on the centre-stage. Leadership is, in these writings, understood as a process, and not only as a function of position (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1742715012447007">Gemmill and Oakley, 1992</xref>). Examples include <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1742715012447007">Holmberg and Tyrstrup (2010)</xref> who suggest studying sense-making processes in order to better understand leadership. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1742715012447007">Gronn (2009)</xref> examines spontaneous collaboration patterns, intuitive understandings that emerge and institutional arrangements supporting self-managed teams. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1742715012447007">Drath and colleagues (2008)</xref> discuss the outcome of leadership processes in the form of direction, alignment and commitment, whilst <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1742715012447007">Crevani and others (2010)</xref> claim that concepts of direction, co-orientation and action-spacing are central for leadership processes. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr82-1742715012447007">Wood (2005)</xref> recommends researching processes of becoming, whilst <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1742715012447007">Bolden and Gosling (2006)</xref> propose a more discursive approach to leadership. Also, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1742715012447007">O’Conner and Quinn (2004)</xref> suggest that leadership is drawn from – instead of added to – groups of people. A final example is relational leadership theory, which explores process perspectives by assuming that a social reality lies in the context of relationships, and advises researchers to address the question of what the relational dynamics are by which leadership is developed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-1742715012447007">Uhl-Bien, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>Leadership processes are characterised by social capital, interpersonal matters, relational aspects and social awareness (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1742715012447007">Day et al., 2009</xref>). Scholars distinguish leadership from managerial work by arguing that leadership somehow reflects an orientation to influence social interaction in order to achieve common objectives (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr83-1742715012447007">Yukl, 2006</xref>). To be defined as leadership acts, it is essential that the influence exhibited is acceptable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1742715012447007">Hosking, 1988</xref>). Leaders are thus those who make contributions to social order (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1742715012447007">Hosking, 1988</xref>), and leadership may take the form of a shared phenomenon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1742715012447007">Grint, 1997</xref>). Leaders, then, are identified, not by the fact of their appointment but by the effects of their acts. A nominated leader may therefore be one of several persons with possibilities to influence a group, and leadership is, consequently, understood as a series of interaction processes where people influence one another (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-1742715012447007">Smirich and Morgan, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1742715012447007">Parry and Bryman, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1742715012447007">Crevani et al., 2010</xref>). This dynamic is an inter-play between current activities, historical events, expectations for the future and the perceived need to exercise leadership. In such processes, event-driven situations, as opposed to intention-driven leadership, tend to influence the interaction between people (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1742715012447007">Holmberg and Tyrstrup, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>The aim of this article is to broaden the understanding of leadership processes and, on this basis, explore acts of leadership from leaders, appointed or not. We do this by investigating leadership in a study of 50 people, most of whom had a formal role. We explore how these leaders experienced leadership in various situations. The research questions we ask are these: if leadership is to influence social interaction in order to achieve common objectives, what then constitutes acts of leadership in order to achieve such influencing? And on what should those aspiring to assume leadership then concentrate in order to achieve this objective?</p>
<p>Three arguments will be expressed in this article. The first is that challenging, event-driven situations tend to create a need for leadership from possible followers, and provide the context for acts of taking or losing leadership. These appear to be everyday situations, but are characterised by degrees of instability and uncertainty. A second point, and perhaps our most important one, concerns how acts of leadership are a function of time-limited rights to lead granted to those assuming leadership by those who choose to follow. Those assuming leadership take power, and followers stay in role and continue to follow as long as their expectations of the appropriate leadership behaviour, and their own organisational needs, are met. This has to do with patterning of power in organisations and how dynamics of organisational life tilt resources in favour of those assuming leadership. Our third point is that although processes are a collective social phenomenon where leaders and followers influence one another, individual agency still matters. One such agency is the willpower of those participating in the social interaction, and willpower is an overlooked but important quality that plays a part in acts of leadership.</p>
<p>The article has several objectives. The first, and prime, objective is an empirical investigation of how leadership is experienced by practising leaders and others, in their everyday operations in organisations. We want to further comprehend the phenomenon as experienced by leaders themselves, and we do this by investigating leadership carried out by different people in different contexts. Our second objective concerns some of the commonly expressed views of leadership, and we aim to address assumptions taken for granted in scholarship, as well as in popular writings about leaders and leadership, and in the press.</p>
<p>The article is organised as follows. First, we present our arguments for regarding leadership as a process and thereby as acts that emerge as a result of interaction between people. Second, we present brief, descriptive cases drawn from our study of leadership in order to contextualise and exemplify our discussion; and third, we summarise our findings by proposing three hypotheses on how to comprehend acts of leadership. In the final section, the reader will find our conclusions.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec2-1742715012447007"><title>Reciprocal relationships between people</title>
<p>In processes of social interaction, individuals form groups and are also being formed by the groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1742715012447007">Burnes, 2004</xref>). The self is relational and organisational processes are the shifting identities confirmed by conversations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1742715012447007">Hegel, 1807</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1742715012447007">Elias, 1991</xref>). People communicate in order to couple their activities in the organisation with those around them to create meaning and to express identity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-1742715012447007">Stacey, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-1742715012447007">Reicher et al., 2005</xref>). In these attempts, people are constructing relationships (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-1742715012447007">Shaw, 2002</xref>). The character of these conversationally developed and developing relationships, and the events occurring within them, is sometimes of greater importance than the shared ideas to which they might (or might not) give rise, for it is from within the dynamically sustained context of these constructed realities that what is talked about gets its meaning. What is interesting, leadership-wise, is how people develop and sustain certain ways of relating to each other in their conversations, and then, from conversations, make sense of their surroundings and themselves. Leadership thus arises from dialogic events, and may take the form of a relational construction among people involved in the conversations.</p>
<p>The action of those assuming leadership is thus not split off from the nature of leadership. Those assuming leadership may, or may not, influence the on-going interactions of the present by dealing with fluctuating realities. Leadership therefore emerges in the interaction between people as acts of recognising and being recognised (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1742715012447007">Griffin, 2002</xref>), as well as in acts of gaining the necessary power, trust, credibility and respect needed to influence the processes of interaction. Leadership is hence a collective phenomenon, as well as individual influence processes by the people involved in the interaction. The leader may be embodied in an individual who assumes leadership but, more importantly, leadership is a phenomenon that emerges in interaction – and has no value without interaction. In organisations, people engage in social interaction in which they are continually choosing what to say and do next, so evoking responses from others. This interaction forms and is formed by individual selves and collective identities. Identities may then take the form of roles: sets of connected behaviours, rights and obligations as conceptualised by people in social situations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1742715012447007">Biddle, 1986</xref>). By unspoken consensus, certain behaviours are deemed ‘appropriate’ and others ‘inappropriate’, and roles are constantly negotiated between individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1742715012447007">Mead, 1934</xref>). What emerges, and is continually iterated, is thus a diversity of identities. Such identities are the leader and follower roles, and these are co-created by processes of social interaction.</p>
<p>The social interaction also contributes to the structuring of relationships. Organisations may be regarded as patterns of interaction between people that are iterated in the present (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1742715012447007">Griffin and Stacey, 2005</xref>). The important focus of attention is not on some abstract systemic whole but on what people are doing in their relationships with each other (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-1742715012447007">Stacey, 2003</xref>). According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1742715012447007">Hosking (1988)</xref>, organisations need to be regarded as a ‘verb’ and organising should be the recognised ‘unit’ of analysis – not ‘an organisation’. What is important is that organising is performed in interrelated social, cognitive and political processes: processes that reflect and affect differing values and interests; processes that reflect and create interdependence and inequalities of influence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1742715012447007">Hosking, 1988</xref>). This entails a view of leadership as constructions that emanate from the rich connections and interdependencies of organisations and their members (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1742715012447007">Hosking et al., 1995</xref>).</p>
<p>Collective and individual identities are socially constructed. The possibility of leadership depends on the existence of identities and, more specifically, shared identities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1742715012447007">Haslam et al., 2003</xref>). Those who assume leadership and those who choose to follow are actively involved in framing such identities, and they stay in role as long as the situation permits and as long as they find it beneficial to serve their interests or needs. People’s ability to assume leadership revolves around the ability to engage people in the process of turning social constructions into practical realities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-1742715012447007">Reicher et al., 2005</xref>). The balance between creating reality and being created is a matter of the development of interactions over time. Thus those who assume leadership are dependent upon each individual follower conceiving of him/her self both as an individual ‘me’ and a common ‘us’, and thereby accepting their interpretation of what that implies for action in a given context. The agency of those assuming leadership does not substitute for that of followers. Instead, both are active interpreters of the social world (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-1742715012447007">Reicher et al., 2005</xref>) and exert influence on one another.</p>
<p>Leadership is hence shaped by dynamic interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-1742715012447007">Sayles, 1964</xref>), and organisations may be regarded as elaborate webs of dynamic interactions between individual organisational members and the system to which they belong (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1742715012447007">Abell and Simons, 2000</xref>). Such interactions result in relationships. Relationships involve a connection or bond between one individual and another. In some cases, the interactions, and hence acts of leadership, produce these bonds, and in other cases they do not. When relationships do result, they may form strong or weak ties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1742715012447007">Granovetter, 1973</xref>) and become more positive or more negative in nature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-1742715012447007">Uhl-Bien and Maslyn, 2003</xref>). Moreover, they can be motivated by instrumental or affective drives. Once formed, they provide a context for behaviour – they establish expectations or norms that serve as guidelines for behaviour. However, they remain dynamic; if the guidelines are violated, the relationship is threatened and relationships can dissolve or re-form in positive or negative ways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr80-1742715012447007">Uhl-Bien et al., 2000</xref>). One reason for this social dynamic is explained by the patterning of power between people.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec3-1742715012447007"><title>The patterning of power in organisations</title>
<p>The concept of power as a capacity resting in a single individual is widely employed in political, sociological, organisational and leadership studies (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1742715012447007">French and Raven, 1959</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1742715012447007">Etzioni, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr84-1742715012447007">Yukl and Falbe, 1991</xref>), but power may also be understood not only as a capacity but also as a right to act. Both capacity and right must rest on the consent of those over whom power is exercised (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1742715012447007">Hindess, 1996</xref>), and both capacity and right must then be present in order for power to be seen as power. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1742715012447007">Elias (2000)</xref> suggests that power is not something anyone possesses but is a characteristic of human relating, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1742715012447007">Foucault (1983)</xref> argues that power is a structure of actions bearing on the actions of individuals who are free, and is a matter of procedures employed in an attempt to influence the actions of those who have a choice about how they might behave (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1742715012447007">Hindess, 1996</xref>). If power consists of the attempt to act on the actions of others, then power is an inescapable feature of human interaction and so, too, is resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1742715012447007">Foucault, 1983</xref>). Following this, power is a concept involving a capacity and right to act, resting on the consent of those over whom power is exercised, and power manifests itself in a relational manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-1742715012447007">Simmel, 1964</xref>).</p>
<p>Power appears as a dynamic process, an aspect of an on-going social structure, and may be understood as a dialectical process; oppositions work together and in tension with each other. Hence, power is the on-going patterns that paradoxically both form and at the time are formed by processes of social interaction between people (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1742715012447007">Griffin and Stacey, 2005</xref>). In order to form and stay in a relationship with others, one cannot do whatever one wants. People constrain and are being constrained by others and, of course, people also enable and are enabled by others. In processes of social interaction in organisations, power is the enabling-constraining relationship in which the power balance is tilted in favour of some and against others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-1742715012447007">Stacey, 2003</xref>). Acts of leadership emerge as a result of power tilts in favour of those assuming leadership, independently of whether or not the leader’s status is formally sanctioned by the organisation. This power tilt depends on capacity and consent to power. The tilt may include resources, information, meaning, knowledge, governing values, norms, or other process parameters governing the dynamics of power. Appointed leaders, then, may or may not exhibit influence on the on-going interactions in the present by dealing with fluctuating realities within changing structural, cultural and systemic frameworks. The act of leadership thus emerges as a result of the on-going processes, as opposed to being predefined within established frameworks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1742715012447007">Griffin, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1742715012447007">Karp and Helgø, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>Following the above, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1742715012447007">Barker (2001)</xref> argues that leadership is a function of individual wills and of individual needs, and the result of the dynamics of collective will organised to meet those various needs. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1742715012447007">Gemmill and Oakley (1992)</xref> claim, therefore, that leadership is a process of dynamic collaboration, where individuals and organisation members authorise themselves and others to interact in ways that experiment with new forms of intellectual and emotional meaning in social processes. Such processes are much broader than a relationship. A social relationship is based on role expectations, whereas social processes include relationships, but also ways that people have an effect upon each other in addition to relationships.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec4-1742715012447007"><title>Studying acts of leadership: methodology</title>
<p>This article is based on field studies in two organisations. One of the companies was a global oil and gas services contractor, henceforth referred to as OilCo. Interviews were carried out with leaders and project team members. We also attended formal meetings with the management team, as well as project meetings and other staff meetings. The other part of the study was conducted as part of a series of leadership development programmes with a major international furniture retailer, henceforth referred to as FurCo. Here we observed processes of leadership training with all the company’s middle and senior-middle managers, and also interviewed people. We also followed a change process in the customer support centre at FurCo, and participated in workshops and meetings. In addition to the two organisations mentioned, we talked to leaders in a number of other organisations. Altogether, the research team conducted 50 interviews, in addition to having informal talks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-1742715012447007">Skarpås et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1742715012447007">Brubak et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1742715012447007">Karp, 2010</xref>) over a two-year period. Most of the people interviewed had a formal position as leader, although we also talked to some employees and other people without legitimate authority.</p>
<p>Our research work is contained within a dialectic tradition, grounded on a Hegelian assumption that organisations exist in a pluralistic world of colliding events, forces, contradictory values, needs, wills or interests that compete with each other for dominance. In dialectic process theory, stability and change are explained by reference to the balance of power between opposing agents: struggles that maintain the status quo between oppositions produce order. Change and development occurs when these opposing values, forces, wills, needs or events gain sufficient power to confront and engage the status quo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr81-1742715012447007">Van de Ven and Poole, 1995</xref>). The events are influenced by process variables such as identities, relationships, needs and will; and leadership-wise, parameters such as power, authority, trust, credibility and respect thus become important.</p>
<p>The empirical work was fairly open. Acknowledging that leadership is a result of more than the contributing leaders, our study aimed to understand what constituted an act of leadership from the point of view of the leaders, as we were interested in how appointed leaders themselves – rather than the followers – perceived and assumed leadership. We wanted to find out how they dealt with their responsibility and how they coped with challenging, unplanned event-driven situations. We wanted to investigate how, and if, the leaders thought or felt they were exhibiting influence on others. We aimed to explore meaning rather than investigate reasoning in causal terms. Our departure was a focus on leadership, and we asked them to describe their experience of leadership and the corresponding interactions between them and other people. We focused on descriptive accounts of leadership situations, and the empirical material was produced in rather loosely structured conversations, in which people were asked to talk about situations where they thought and felt acts of leadership were displayed. Thus we took a phenomenological approach to our investigation, emphasising people’s conscious experience.</p>
<p>Initially we asked people to talk about leadership experiences in general and if there were particular situations in which they felt that leadership was important for the outcome. The subjects interviewed thus talked rather freely about what leadership meant for them, and to what extent and in what situations they, or others they know, were able to practise it. They obviously talked about their personal experiences, their thoughts and their feelings in given situations. No particular definitions of how to understand leadership were given. We followed the reasoning in the interviews, either as they continued to talk or as a response to a question in which they were asked to clarify or exemplify leadership situations. In some cases, we also asked direct questions regarding specific leadership situations; in other cases, interesting themes emerged as a result of the conversations. In the text below, we present parts of these conversations, mainly drawn from interviews with four persons. The four cases presented are not to illustrate good or bad leadership, but chosen because they were fairly typical of the empirical material gathered. They were selected because of that and to present some variation, bearing in mind that the point with qualitative studies is not statistical representation, but insightful examples.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec5-1742715012447007"><title>Cases of leadership</title>
<p>In our first case, we meet Simen, a former CEO of OilCo. At the age of 38, a fairly young age for an executive in the oil and gas industry, he took over the helm as project director for a multibillion dollar turnkey offshore contract. When he accepted the position, the project was in serious trouble: budgets were over-run and the schedule was delayed. The cooperation climate was poor; the client blamed the contractor for having made major mistakes and was preparing for liability claims. Simen had a dilemma in deciding whether or not to accept the position. Yes, he was driven by ambition, but in the end, according to him, it was loyalty that made him accept the job. But it was an extremely difficult job with a lot at stake, and many did not expect him to perform well. In his own words: ‘I was an underdog.’ The first thing he did was to bring on board people he trusted and mix them with the project team. He restructured the organisation, but the major obstacle he soon experienced was the need to confront some serious issues within his own team and with the customer. Simen says about his feelings at the time: ‘I felt I was tested, and that I needed to gain some respect and authority in order to do my job.’ He shares a story about a meeting at the very start of his period as project director, where he assembled the whole project team. He then chose to tell them everything about the challenges they faced, the tough times ahead, the expectations and demands he had, whilst at the same time giving them his unconditional support. One of the project team members reported after that meeting that she ‘saw something in Simen – something she could trust … some kind of a hope for a better future’. After a series of other encounters with his project team, the client, his boss and his chairman of the board, where he, in his view, faced opposition, frustration, anger, low motivation, low morale and insecurity, Simen eventually felt he gradually earned a right to lead. ‘I was eventually given a mandate,’ he says, ‘and it definitely happened in certain situations with specific people … Situations that in my own view tested me. Maybe it was only my feeling of insecurity that dropped, but eventually I felt I was given legitimacy to lead from the people around me …’</p>
<p>Our second typical leadership case is Signe-Lise. She was the administration and personnel director in a public services organisation. She was headhunted to this position and given a mandate to change and modernise a red-tape organisation. ‘I was ready and eager to go,’ she says, ‘may be a bit overambitious to start with.’ In her three years in the organisation she experienced opposition, corridor politics, power plays and the like, making her job altogether difficult. One of her toughest challenges was to deal with one of her own employees, whom she felt was disloyal: ‘I didn’t trust her,’ she says, ‘but even worse, I was afraid of her. And I think she felt my nervousness.’ The employee went behind her back. ‘I became anxious and suspicious,’ Signe-Lise reports. Also, other employees worked against her in several situations; on one occasion they collaborated in a 360-degree feedback survey in order to give Signe-Lise a low score. But she thinks what really made a difference was when she gave into opposition in her own department. ‘They talked behind my back and I am sure they felt my weakness and insecurity,’ Signe-Lise says, ‘and especially the women … Using all kinds of tricks to mock me.’ She felt she gradually lost her right to lead. The pressure was building up, and she realised that she was not given the authority she needed to perform in her job. Eventually, after a period of three years in the job, she accepted the consequences and left the organisation without having achieved what she had been determined to do.</p>
<p>Our third case is from FurCo. Roger was the head of the company’s customer support centre. When he was given the responsibility to lead this centre, the unit was in a bad shape. ‘It was not a career move,’ Roger says about his takeover, as the support centre was considered low status. At the time of his takeover, the department was struggling with a high turnover, cultural differences and poor deliveries to its customers. ‘I wanted to show myself in a good light and went home making all kinds of plans,’ Roger says. Having completed his homework, he eventually launched his plans for changing the centre’s performance, but nothing much happened and he felt that he quickly lost credibility and authority among his employees. ‘Nobody reacted when I said something,’ he says, ‘I had no, absolutely no, authority.’ He had to rethink his strategy and re-launched a change process with the help of external consultants. In one of workshops in the middle of the change process, Roger had a tough encounter with one of his leaders, who criticised the change process, the methods and, ultimately, Roger’s leadership style. ‘I was really uncertain how to deal with the situation, but became pissed off. For the first time, I ventilated some steam there and then … It was probably not the best thing to do … But also for the first time I took a firm stand in front of my leadership team.’ He confronted the opposition. ‘It was not an elegant move, and I felt bad right after,’ Roger says. The situation became tense, but the workshop facilitators stepped in, and the situation moved on. When the workshop finished and everybody had gone home for the day, Roger called his leader in order to rectify the situation, but nothing good came out of the call, and the leader quit his job a few days later. ‘I felt bad about this … But a strange thing happened. I felt most of the other team members gathered around me, and looked to me with respect … I gained some authority and power,’ Roger says.</p>
<p>Our final leadership case involves Toril. She was, as a young leader, the head of public health and social services in a Norwegian community. A former and well-regarded politician led the community. He was known for his direct leadership style, and was a demanding and tough leader. One morning an incident involving her boss was reported to Toril. A user had unexpectedly shown up at his office and complained about the quality of the services provided by the community. The community leader had taken action right away and he vented his anger on one of Toril’s employees. In Toril’s view this was totally unacceptable, but ‘I had some serious difficulties in confronting him … After all, this was a man known for his tough style and I was a young and relatively inexperienced leader.’ But eventually she called him and asked for a meeting: ‘I felt my heart beat wildly, and I was dead nervous,’ Toril says. The community had all kinds of values and statements about good leadership behaviour, encouraging leaders to speak up if something was wrong. However, this was the glorified party speech. Taking leadership upwards was not a common thing to do; people should do as they were told. When her boss came over, they had a difficult meeting in which Toril chose to confront him. After Toril had finished speaking, her boss just said, ‘Wait!’ and then he left the room. Toril sat back, wondering what had just happened. But after a while he returned and said that he had apologised to the person he had yelled at that morning. And the community chairman applauded Toril for having had the guts to confront him face-to-face; she was one of the first who had done so. ‘That day I learned an important lesson,’ Toril says: ‘I learned that a value that matters to me made some kind of a difference in an important situation … And my boss gave me the confirmation and support I needed, and I developed my leadership around these lines thereafter.’</p>

<sec id="sec6-1742715012447007"><title>Analysing acts of leadership</title>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-1742715012447007">Rost (1991)</xref> states that there is a difference between what researchers have defined as leadership and what most people experience as leadership. In our study, we found that the leadership people mostly experience everyday is the trivial aspects of what leaders do, which sometimes influence the interaction between people. It is not the big visions, the strategising, the change initiatives, the hairy goals or the big decisions that define everyday acts of leadership. Nor is it transformational leadership with individualised consideration, intellectual stimulation, inspirational motivation and idealised influence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1742715012447007">Bass and Riggio, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1742715012447007">Alvesson and Sveningsson (2003a)</xref> argue that rather than certain acts being significant in themselves, it is their being done by leaders that give them some kind of value beyond their everyday significance. This was the case in our study. In many cases, it was not the conduct of any act in itself, nor the qualities displayed by those assuming leadership, but the fact that they actually acted that influenced the situation and the people involved. They did not necessarily ‘do the right things’ as leaders are supposed to do (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1742715012447007">Bennis, 1989</xref>), but they did something: When a leadership act was apparent, it was often an act that was conducted in a problem-oriented, difficult or challenging situation. And when they acted, the leaders displayed qualities that were their own – they were not pretending to be somebody they were not (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1742715012447007">Karp, 2010</xref>). Obviously, leadership was practised in times of ease, but we frequently found that leadership was apparent in times of challenge or uncertainty. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1742715012447007">Holmberg and Tyrstrup (2010)</xref> discuss a similar finding from their work with leaders in a telecom organisation. It was the need for leaders to take impromptu action, to act in the here and now in what the researchers label ‘a problem-oriented situation’ and at least to identify the next step in the process, which constituted leadership.</p>
<p>There are some noteworthy, and typical, commonalities in the experiences shared by the leaders we interviewed. Many of them told that their paths to leadership were seldom a function of deliberate use of interventions, planning, motivational practices or other established leadership techniques (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1742715012447007">Karp, 2010</xref>). When they reflected back on their careers, they found that their leadership was often the result of event-driven, unplanned incidents where they incidentally or intentionally took leadership – they felt that they there and then earned a right to somehow influence the on-going social interaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1742715012447007">Karp and Johannessen, 2010</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1742715012447007">Mintzberg (2011)</xref> states that most leaders respond more than they initiate. This was certainly the case in our research. The leaders did their everyday mundane work – things that some researchers would label management, and then suddenly a situation emerged – a situation where they felt they needed to take leadership, because they thought it was expected of them. The process dynamics changed, some kind of situational variables or resources were tilted in favour of or against the leader, and leadership was in some instances taken, sometimes lost.</p>
<p>These incidents seemed to be minor, but they appeared to be events in leaders’ careers where some kind of solid or fragile relational bonds were created between those earning the right to lead and their followers/peers/superiors – possibly defining for the relationship and for the leaders themselves. Typically, the situation was event-driven, and leaders responded, deliberately or accidentally, to a situation calling for leadership; people involved in the situation experienced a need for leadership. Simen, the OilCo CEO, says that he created bonds with his project team and his customers. According to his and other leaders’ own accounts, these leaders felt that these bonds gave them some kind of a right to lead. It may be a right in the form of a strengthened social contract, but it may also be a subjective feeling, something impacting a leader’s self-confidence and/or self-esteem.</p>
<p>Some researchers refer to such experiences as <italic>threshold situations</italic> – situations that confront people with experiences that require them to redirect their field of attention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-1742715012447007">Scharmer, 2007</xref>). One example is Toril, the community director. She says that her experience gave her an insight into principles and values important to her in her role as a leader, and she learned that though she was nervous before the encounter with her boss, she was still able to argue her case when she was tested. In their book <italic>Geeks and Geezers</italic> (2002), Bennis and Thomas described a similar phenomenon. They call such events <italic>crucibles</italic> – experiences that test people. Other researchers who have studied similar phenomena have labelled such incidents <italic>critical episodes</italic>, <italic>trigger events</italic>, <italic>tipping points</italic>, <italic>defining moments</italic>, <italic>moments that matter</italic> or <italic>moments of truth</italic> (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1742715012447007">Badaracco, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1742715012447007">Avolio and Luthans, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-1742715012447007">Toor and Ofori, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1742715012447007">Karp, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>In many cases, however, the situation did not live up to threshold characteristics. It was not dramatic, strategic, or a crisis, although the situation itself may be classified as unstable or uncertain – not necessarily due to external events, but often due to such internal factors as uncertainty about direction, roles, responsibilities, goals, priorities, communicated messages, disagreements, unclear conversations or other unfinished business. Power, roles, responsibilities and structures were in play, or not clarified. Organising processes are processes in which order is negotiated, both within and between groups and individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1742715012447007">Hosking, 1988</xref>), and in many of the cases we studied, this negotiation of order had not been completed.</p>
<p>Studying 62 managers in a Swedish telecom company, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1742715012447007">Holmberg and Tyrstrup (2010)</xref> found that the most typical everyday leadership situation experienced by leaders was a situation the researchers labelled ‘well then – what now?’ This was a problem-oriented situation where leaders were not certain how they got there, where they stood, or what the situation meant. It was hard for them to assess how the situation fitted with previous intentions, to tell what had been completed, to understand what was going on, or to figure out what was still to be accomplished. Also, people were constantly at the leader’s throat asking for directions, and pressure was building. One event gave rise to another, according to a logic that was anything but obvious.</p>
<p>Returning to our study, we found that common characteristics of situations where leadership was taken were instability and/or uncertainty. In these situations, it was not the significance of the leadership act in itself, but the fact that it was done by somebody perceived as a formal or informal leader that gave it a symbolic, emotional and/or inspirational value beyond its everyday significance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1742715012447007">Alvesson and Sveningsson, 2003a</xref>). In these event-driven situations, it appeared to be an incremental shift in the social construction of identity and relationships, as well as in the power balance between those assuming leadership and those who had chosen to follow. Some argue that this is because people’s social structures are threatened in such situations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1742715012447007">Andersson, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1742715012447007">Moxnes, 2007</xref>). People’s needs to sustain a basic sense of self, to manipulate the environment in order to achieve goals, or to form cooperative relationships with others were violated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-1742715012447007">Sheldon, 2004</xref>). The context could be a specific initiative or a regular operational situation. Someone emerged in the moment, displayed acts that could be labelled leadership, and the individuals in the organisation moved on as the exigency of the moment dissipated. Such incidents were, or were not, instrumental for collective success, but they were in many cases important for the individual assuming leadership.</p>
<p>Our research indicates that such incidents can be many and minor in significance, or few and conclusive. Simen experienced several such major incidents during his project, whilst Toril was challenged in a situation closer to everyday operations. Their acts of leadership emerged when conditions of instability existed in their organisations. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-1742715012447007">Stacey (2003)</xref> argues that such conditions of instability materialise at times when the influx of information is high, when the achievement of solidifying a diverse workforce is exigent, when people disagree, when opposition and resistance exist, and when heightened human connectivity is the norm. This was certainly the case when Roger, the head of customer support at FurCo, first lost, and then took, leadership in situations with opposition and disagreements. Such instability and/or uncertainty are boundary conditions prototypical for many organisational environments characterised by knowledge-intensive institutions exposed to a maelstrom of changing markets, technologies, customers, products and competitors.</p>
<p>In everyday conditions, it is the trivial aspects that characterise leadership, but organisations are not static systems and are not likely to remain stable for long periods of time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1742715012447007">Barker, 2001</xref>). Power, roles, responsibilities and resources are in play, and structural and cultural boundary conditions flux. In conditions of temporary or permanent instability, people in organisations thus frequently experience moments when leadership is taken or lost (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1742715012447007">Karp, 2010</xref>). In the cases presented, leaders took or lost leadership according to their own standards. Such incidents occur instantaneously and without forewarning. They could involve many people or simply relate to an interaction between two people. They could take the form of a crisis resulting from external events such as downturns, layoffs, hostile takeovers, bankruptcies and the like, or simply materialise during a regular meeting or a contact between two people when the atmosphere was unstable, uncertain or tense, even if there was no crisis or change initiative going on.</p>

<sec id="sec7-1742715012447007" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title>
<p>The empirical material of this study is, of course, related to particular organisational contexts, situations and persons. We need obviously to consider boundary conditions when studying social phenomena and in particular when addressing leadership (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1742715012447007">Bryman et al., 1996</xref>). Also, the observations are made in a Scandinavian context, and within cultural and organisational frameworks applicable to these countries (although some of the organisations in the study may be characterised as global); by this is meant societies where equality and humanity are dominant societal values, as well as having an environment with economies shaped by knowledge intensity and a high pace of change – in sum, entailing that leadership to a larger degree must somehow be taken in organisations.</p>
<p>To the extent that leadership is about influencing processes, it makes sense to allow space for considerable variation among situations, processes, kinds of people, and societal and organisational contexts in terms of how leadership should be understood. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr83-1742715012447007">Yukl (2006)</xref> notes that the numerous definitions of leadership appear to have little in common other than involving an influence process. And, as argued by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1742715012447007">Alvesson and Sveningsson (2003b)</xref>, there is certainly no shortage of candidates for exercising influence processes in organisations: organisational cultures and structures, systems, procedures, rules, management control systems, authorities and other institutions, as well as customers, suppliers and the like.</p>
<p>There are many situations where leadership’s implicit assumptions about asymmetrical relationships and a core agent from which leadership flows are misleading. The leader’s role, embodying responsibilities for financial, legal and human resources and results, is too often confused with acts of leadership. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1742715012447007">Alvesson and Sveningsson (2003b)</xref> therefore suggest that the idea leadership in any straightforward and clear sense is perhaps a rare bird – it is a disappearing act, according to these researchers. The concept of leadership is routinely ‘constructed’ by leaders, subordinates, researchers and others, but it is a loose construction. It is, however, a necessary construction, psychologically as well as formally. That influence processes take place in organisations is not controversial; the question is in what form, by whom and when.</p>
<p>Of course, all research leads to results that reflect the methods – and in the present case, we acknowledge the possibility that the responses given by a limited number of respondents, primarily being leaders themselves, indicate people’s shortcomings in explaining and remembering complex social phenomena. It may be argued that many acts can be seen as leadership, as well as not leadership, depending on the observer and his or her implicit definition of leadership. Common approaches to leadership research, where subjects produce indications of leadership for, say, questionnaire studies, make obviously strong statements that leadership in its traditional forms exists in organisations. More subtle interpretative work in which nuances emerge and alternatives are opened up sometimes, at least, reveal other findings than mainstream understandings of leadership.</p>
<p>In this research work, such findings support the concept that acts of leadership emerge as a result of processes of social interaction in organisations. These acts of leadership are rare and subtle, and seldom come as a result of planned interventions, motivational techniques, transformational behaviour or other means articulated by popular leadership theories. Instead, they tend to be a result of event-driven situations where those assuming leadership, whether formal leaders or others, earn a fragile and temporary right to lead others for a limited time period. It seems that this right is granted in circumstances where people feel conditions are unstable, uncertain or challenging, and they are in need of leadership to resolve important issues or problems. When this happens, when someone assumes leadership, they seem to need willpower to deal with that uncertainty, opposition and resistance in the situation at hand.</p>
<p>We will proceed with our discussion by proposing the following hypotheses regarding such possible acts of taking leadership in organisations:<disp-quote>
<p>Hypothesis 1: event-driven situations, which may be regarded as unstable or uncertain, create a need for leadership (from followers) and provide the context for emergent acts of taking or losing leadership.</p>
<p>Hypothesis 2: acts of leadership are primarily a function of time-limited rights to lead granted to those assuming leadership by those who choose to follow.</p>
<p>Hypothesis 3: willpower may provide an important vehicle in acts of taking or losing leadership, and it is the strength of willpower of those involved that determines the outcome of the situation.</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>These hypotheses are further outlined and discussed below.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec8-1742715012447007"><title>Hypothesis 1: unstable situations create a need for leadership</title>
<p>Event-driven situations where leadership is called for frequently unfold in organisations, and they are characterised by whether or not individuals give a time-limited consent to lead to those assuming leadership. This is a connection between the follower/peer/superior and those given legitimacy as a leader, covering more than formal dyadic arrangements. Roger, in our study, testified that bonds developed in his team, giving him and his team the energy and legitimacy they needed to fight through difficult situations.</p>
<p>Similar ideas have been promoted by theories of authentic leadership. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1742715012447007">Avolio and Gardner (2005)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1742715012447007">Luthans and Avolio (2003)</xref>, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1742715012447007">May and colleagues (2003)</xref> posited that events that stimulate growth promote leadership. Such triggers may be positive or negative and can vary in terms of moral and emotional intensity. These situations often also cause internal struggles in which individuals strive to retain a sense of self and of order, to reduce the anxieties associated with instability, disorder and unpredictability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1742715012447007">Karp, 2010</xref>). In such situations, people want to believe that someone, somewhere, is willing to take responsibility. There is then a temporary power shift in favour of those assuming leadership, as they personalise or role model important aspects of what it means to be a member of the organisation.</p>
<p>The impact of ‘leading by example’ as another source of influence is frequently cited in the popular press, often in the form of authentic leadership (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1742715012447007">George, 2003</xref>), as well as in the literature of social cognitive theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1742715012447007">Bandura, 1997</xref>), ethics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-1742715012447007">Trevino et al., 2000</xref>) and neo-charismatic theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1742715012447007">House and Aditya, 1997</xref>). Among core behaviours leaders seek to model or exemplify are confidence, high moral standards, commitment and self-sacrifice, which may influence followers to emulate their behaviours and actions (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1742715012447007">Bass, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1742715012447007">Luthans and Avolio, 2003</xref>). Returning to our case studies, Simen says that he ‘role modelled the commitment and self-sacrifice needed in the project organisation to get on with the difficult tasks ahead’.</p>
<p>In certain situations, those assuming leadership may also facilitate exchanges of trust, credibility and/or respect. This phenomenon may partly be explained by attribution theory: the ways in which people attribute the behaviour of others or themselves to something else (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1742715012447007">Heider, 1958</xref>). Each member of an organisation holds an implicit theory of the leadership role, including appropriate behaviour, the cause of those assuming leadership’s behaviours and external constraints to leadership. When someone’s behaviour matches another individual’s implicit theory of leadership, then they may be given a time-limited consent to lead in the situation at hand. This was the case with Toril; her behaviour in a difficult meeting with her superior struck a chord in him, and they somehow connected there and then. This is because movements in the power balance alter people’s experience of challenge-response and enabling-constraining, which may be seen as the movement of the identity in the leader–follower relationship. Identity is created through power (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1742715012447007">Holmgren, 2006</xref>), and the patterning of power is the on-going iterations of identity in a group of people. This dynamics of power is a property those assuming leadership may influence and tilt in their favour by actively engaging in the social interaction, but not control: it is a property that must be earned.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec9-1742715012447007"><title>Hypothesis 2: those assuming leadership have to earn a right to lead</title>
<p>The study of leadership is the study of the processes in which social order is negotiated and practised so as to protect and promote the values and interests in which it is grounded, according to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1742715012447007">Hosking (1988). Gemmill and Oakley (1992)</xref> argue that when members of a group are faced with uncertainty and ambiguity regarding direction, they often report experiencing feelings of anxiety, helplessness, discomfort, disappointment, hostility and fear of failure. Frightened by these emerging emotions and impulses, which are ordinarily held in check by absorption into the prevailing organisational system, they project them onto the leadership role. By projecting their anxiety onto someone, followers perceive themselves as freed from the anxiety and responsibility of taking the initiative, seeking autonomy, taking risks, or expressing their own fears and feelings of frustration. It is therefore of significance that leaders make people on whom the leader focuses attention feel visible, respected and important (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1742715012447007">Alvesson and Sveningsson, 2003a</xref>).</p>
<p>In our research work, we interviewed several of OilCo’s project team members, and they reported feelings of anxiety, as well as a wish to be seen and to feel important to the project. Also, Roger’s leadership team in FurCo said they experienced frustrations and insecurities on several occasions in their change process, and they were looking for leadership from Roger in order to progress in their work. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1742715012447007">Barker (2001)</xref> argues that people are more motivated to modify their self-interest and follow someone’s leadership if their needs are served. In certain situations, those who assume leadership may satisfy people’s needs for autonomy, self-preservation, relational matters, order and/or progress. Leader–member exchange theory supports such argumentation. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1742715012447007">Graen and Cashman (1975)</xref> suggested that exchange relationships form under certain conditions on the basis of personal compatibility and dependability. In addition to an exchange of labour, competence, rewards and other formal matters, the exchange of credibility, respect and trust are important.</p>
<p>Event-driven situations where leadership is taken or lost are temporary incidents in organisations, lasting only a few seconds, but are moments that are co-experienced by those who take the lead and those who choose to follow. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-1742715012447007">Stern (2004)</xref> has studied similar moments – short events that make up people’s experience − a psychological process unit he labels <italic>present moments</italic>. He argues that such incidents often include strong encounters between people, and that much happens, even though the period of time is short. What are interesting are those moments when two or more people make a spiritual, mental or emotional contact – an inter-subjective contact, according to Stern. Two or more people, the one who assumes the lead and the person or people who choose to follow, may see and feel roughly the same mental landscape for a short period of time. This means that there is an inter-subjective consciousness in operation: two or more people co-create an inter-subjective experience in a shared moment lasting a few seconds, meaning that the phenomenal consciousness of one overlaps and partially includes the phenomenal consciousness of the other (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-1742715012447007">Stern, 2004</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec10-1742715012447007"><title>Hypothesis 3: willpower is governing for acts of leadership</title>
<p>In situations where leadership is taken, it may be tempting to search for the perfect actions by a rational leader providing direction or meaning, as proposed by some (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1742715012447007">Drath et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1742715012447007">Crevani et al., 2010</xref>). Of course there is a rational element to the actions of those assuming leadership, but in situations where leadership is taken or lost, acts of leadership appear to be more emblematic of psychological strength (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1742715012447007">Kenny and Zaccaro, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1742715012447007">Arvey et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1742715012447007">Karp, 2010</xref>). In our study, in the cases where acts of leaders influenced the situations, the ability to assume leadership was not predicted by transformational abilities, visions, knowledge, intelligence or capabilities for setting direction. If at all related to individual qualities, it appeared to be the ability to deal with resistance and opposition that seemed crucial in the situations unfolding. Leadership then happened within a context of competition and conflict, as argued by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1742715012447007">Burns (1978)</xref>. ‘The ultimate measure of a man is not where he stands in moments of comfort, but where he stands at times of challenge and controversy,’ Martin Luther <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1742715012447007">King Jr. said in one of his sermons (1963)</xref>.</p>
<p>Our study suggests that the psychological strength of those assuming leadership was tested in various situations, in addition to their ability to serve followers’ needs in specific situations. ‘To study the laws of history, we must completely change the subject of our observation; must leave aside kings, ministers, and generals, and study the common and infinitesimally small elements by which the masses are moved,’ said <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-1742715012447007">Tolstoy (1952: 470)</xref>. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1742715012447007">Barker (2001)</xref> hence argues that the infinitesimally small elements by which the masses are moved in organisations are their individual wills, values, needs and a sense of purpose or direction. One such individual will is obviously the willpower of those taking charge in a situation, those eventually assuming leadership – a will that for many leaders is triggered by a desire for power, for control, to organise, to gain acceptance, to prove oneself or to take risks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-1742715012447007">Reiss, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1742715012447007">Binney et al., 2005</xref>). Willpower has certainly a collective dimension, but it is the willpower (and interests) of those taking charge outmatching the willpower (and interests) of others that seems to govern outcomes in leadership situations. It is individual agency within a collective dimension. Followers continually choose to what degree they want to follow, and if they still are willing to grant consent to those in the lead. They remain in role as long as their expectations of the leadership role, or they situational needs, are met, or until new event-driven situations calling for new leadership emerge.</p>
<p>From our empirical material, we know that top leaders like the OilCo CEO Simen and the community director Toril possess a strong willpower, and they appear to be confident in their abilities to use that willpower to their advantage. Their willpower motivates them, and they think it makes some kind of a difference to the outcome of challenging situations. They know they have the stamina needed to follow through and resolve difficult matters. ‘Those aspiring to leadership must have a will to power,’ Simen stated in one of the interviews. The will to power is a vital concept in the philosophy of the German philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche (1887). The will to power describes what Nietzsche believed to be the main driving force in a human being: the striving to reach the highest possible construction of one’s self. Will is the function by which people direct and sustain their attention, imagination and actions toward an objective or intention. The ‘directing’ is not a forced effort; it is the active decision of a person to attend to one phenomenon and not a different one: in this case acts of taking leadership. The decision is enacted via the selection of a thought, image, feeling, energy or action; this selection directs a person’s attention. The ‘sustaining’ is a commitment to the original direction. It may therefore be argued that the will is the primary expression of people’s state of being, the source of their initiatives.</p>
<p>According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1742715012447007">Holton (2003)</xref>, willpower is thus a capability a person actively employs in circumstances where it feels as though it is a struggle, in other words where one has to resist one’s own inclinations. Hence, those assuming leadership may use willpower to direct their attention away from a desire not to act, in order to form, retain or execute an intention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1742715012447007">Henden, 2008</xref>). On a fundamental level, such intention is expressed in acts of leadership. On other levels, such intentions may include the satisfaction of the leader’s needs for power, control, position and the like. On higher order levels, it may include his or her fulfilment of purpose, hopes, dreams, visions or ambitions.</p>
<p>In situations requiring leadership, those assuming leadership overcome their desires by fighting or redirecting their attention. These may be desires to leave (or not to enter) a challenging situation, or not to act when needed. Toril experienced such desires as she was very nervous before the meeting with her boss, but she overcame her inclination to back out of a difficult conversation with her boss. Willpower is thus the capability that governs one’s internal struggle against one’s own desires not to take charge – leading ultimately to acts of leadership in processes of social interaction, in other words that someone takes leadership in a situation where leadership may be needed.</p>

<sec id="sec11-1742715012447007" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title>
<p>The discussion in this article has sought to demonstrate that leadership is predominately a process. Our study shows that leadership may be understood as a series of interaction processes, and is not only a function of the person in charge, but a result of the dynamic interaction of individual and collective wills mobilised to meet various needs. The dynamics of power and event-driven situations entail people being willing to authorise someone to assume leadership in certain situations where leadership is required, meaning that leadership must somehow be taken and earned by those assuming the responsibility, whether a formal leader or another person. We argue that leadership is a process that includes energy transfer between people, and one such transfer is the willpower exhibited by those assuming leadership in situations where they are tested, tilting power and other resources in favour of themselves, and granting them a temporary right to lead others.</p>
<p>We still know far too little about leadership, and perspectives of leadership as a dynamic, social process is still a research topic in need of further scholarship, clear definitions and new concepts. The meta-question of the importance – even existence – of leadership in organisations is certainly an issue that will be further discussed. The strong ideological overtones around the very idea of leadership may, in our view, produce findings that are not always well founded. There are too many studies assuming and producing leadership theories and concepts through designs with inbuilt proofs of leadership, carried out by researchers ideologically, and also financially, committed to the idea. The leadership phenomenon is much more fragile than the ‘leadership industry’ and literature typically assumes. In our view, leadership may, as argued here, be understood as acts that leaders sometimes take or aspire to take, but it seems to be acts that are difficult to carry out in everyday organisational life – despite strong normative encouragement from educators, researchers, journalists, and senior or subordinate people in organisations. The empirical material presented here points to such acts of leadership, but these acts are far more rare, subtle and fragile than frequently suggested by popular theories. Obviously, the leadership acts are experienced by the persons involved in the situations where such acts were displayed, but these are subjective accounts of complex social phenomena: no ‘hard evidence’ exists. The research also suggests that the acts experienced highlight psychoanalytic insights; people tend to have a psychological and biological need for leadership in certain situations where they feel instability or uncertainty. The need to project one’s own uncertainties or frustrations onto others in order to ‘free’ themselves not only from stressful situations, but also from everyday operational incidents, also falls into this category.</p>
<p>It was not our aim in our study to propose normative, individual leadership qualities, but our findings indicate that acts of leadership seem to be more dependent upon the ability to deal with uncertainty, opposition and resistance than the mainstream focus on influencing, visioning and motivational efforts as drivers of leadership. Obviously, a leader’s mastery of difficult situations and people also plays a part, helping to develop the leader’s self-esteem, giving him/her the necessary self-confidence to undertake more challenging leadership tasks, thereby continuing his/her growth as a leader and human being. The implication for practising leaders is that they need to accept that they cannot rely on their title or position when it comes to acts of leadership. Leadership must be taken and earned, in particular in situations where people in organisations are in need of leadership. It is their ability to deal with resistance and opposition that seems crucial when leaders take leadership, and it is their psychological strength in the form of willpower that is tested in such situations.</p>
<p>Although the thoughts in this article are based on talks with many leaders, observations gathered in several meetings and leadership development programmes, as well as accepted theoretical findings from a wide source of research work, the argumentation is in need of further research. The discussions with leaders have been phenomenological, and other methods may be needed to further verify the findings. Added empirical research may therefore be required to verify the hypotheses presented.</p>
