<abstract>
<p>This study uses historical data from the 1965 Voting Rights Act (VRA) to examine the effect of strategic policy making on policy outcomes. Strategic policy making refers to the exploitation of future policy resources by an incumbent government when it anticipates the policy change by a future government. In the South, the segregationist governments immediately after the enactment of the VRA still stayed in office but anticipated the future policy change that would result from minority voters acquiring the right to franchise. This political context provides an ideal setting for testing the theory of strategic policy making. Through analysis of county panel data analysis from the 1960s, this study finds that segregationist governments with large budgets increased long-term debts, education spending, and highway spending significantly when compared with the rest of the country. This finding supports a version of strategic policy making, namely, strategic use of debts, and is consistent with anecdotal evidence indicating that resistance to school integration through the creation of all-white suburban schools is one of the primary motives for bond issues.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>This study uses the dynamic change in the voting population due to the Voting Rights Act (VRA) of 1965 as a source of exogenous variations and investigates the policy outputs of local governments in the United States during the 1960s to uncover the role of strategic policy making in fiscal deficits. Strategic policy making refers to the exploitation of future policy resources by an incumbent government when it anticipates a policy change by the future government. That is, the study posits that an incumbent government seeks to spend as much budgets as possible for its supporters while it is in a position to do so.</p>
<p>Past studies have shown that the VRA contributed to expansion of state and local governments. Prior to passage of this legislation, state and local governments in the South provided minimal public services (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1532440012451979">Key [1949] 1984</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1532440012451979">1</xref></sup> As a result of the VRA, this situation began to change in the late 1960s. The VRA also delegitimized any devices for vote denial, enfranchised poorer minority voters who preferred greater spending on redistributive policies, and thereby moved median policy to a fiscally liberal direction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1532440012451979">Husted and Kenny 1997</xref>). For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1532440012451979">Husted and Kenny (1997)</xref> report that state per capita welfare expenditures doubled between 1964 and 1976. More generally, the expansion of the franchise is considered one of the major factors in the growth of government (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1532440012451979">Abrams and Settle 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1532440012451979">Lott and Kenny 1999</xref>).</p>
<p>One important yet unremarked aspect of the VRA is that state and local governments in the South experienced a unique transitional phase that provides an ideal environment for studying strategic policy making. The passage of key legislation during the mid-1960s made Southern segregationist governments expect that future policy change was inevitable. To stay in power, they would need to incorporate the preferences of new minority voters. Otherwise, they would be forced to hand their offices to a new government that better represented an expanded voting population. In either case, segregationist governments were able to determine public policies anticipating that in the future these policies would change. Public policies made from such anticipation must necessarily be quite different from both preceding minimalistic policies and subsequent welfare-oriented policies.</p>
<p>In fact, this transitional period is one of the eras during which strategic policy making was most commonly observed. About a week after passage of the VRA, Congress of Racial Equality, a civil rights organization, filed a lawsuit that sought to block the sale of $6 million of school bonds in Monroe, Louisiana, unless the city proposed a plan for school desegregation. The central issue in the suit was that “the bond sales will be used to perpetuate alleged discriminatory segregationist practices” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1532440012451979">Allan 1965</xref>, p. F1). Moreover, voters in Jackson, Mississippi, passed a school bond issue in 1964. In Jackson, the passage of a school bond issue was quite rare at that time because the majority of voters were white, but the public schools were, and still are, mainly for blacks. In fact, it was not until 1991 that the city again passed a school bond issue. The reason the bond issue in 1964 passed was to build a new school “to provide an ‘escape hatch’ for white parents who planned to remove their children” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1532440012451979">Glaser 2002</xref>, p. 36).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1532440012451979">2</xref></sup></p>
<p>Through analysis of county panel data analysis from the transitional period, this study finds that local governments covered by Section 5 of the VRA with large per capita budgets increased long-term debts, education expenditures, and highway expenditures at higher rates than those in the rest of the United States. Consistent with one version of the formal theories of the strategic use of debts (SUD), these spending patterns indicate that governments with both strong strategic motivations and capacities to draft flexible budgets, issued more debts to tie the hands of future governments and spent the borrowed money to continue segregation practices.</p>
<p>The remainder of the article is organized as follows. In the following section, I provide some details on the VRA, and explain the desirability of the VRA as a subject to study strategic policy making. The third section introduces four theories that might explain the spending patterns during the transitional period and corresponding predictions. The fourth section describes the research design, the fifth section tests these theories, and the sixth section summarizes and draws conclusions.</p>

<title>The VRA of 1965</title>
<p>The VRA of 1965, enacted on August 6, 1965, was a groundbreaking law in the sense that it granted the federal government unilateral power to intervene in election administration of state and local governments. This made the VRA one of the most effective desegregation policies in the era (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1532440012451979">Davidson 1994</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-1532440012451979">3</xref></sup> One important feature of the VRA is that it banned literacy tests and put tough restrictions on poll taxes in state elections.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-1532440012451979">4</xref></sup> An abundance of studies shows that these institutional barriers suppressed minority voting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1532440012451979">Alt 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1532440012451979">Ashenfelter and Kelley 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1532440012451979">Filer, Kenny and Morton 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1532440012451979">Key [1949] 1984</xref>). Another important feature of the VRA is that it designated a state or county government as a covered jurisdiction if it implemented any discriminatory test or device, <italic>or</italic> if the voting registration rate or voting turnout in the presidential election of 1964 among the voting population was lower than 50%. The 1965 VRA designated the entire states of Alabama, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, South Carolina, and the Commonwealth of Virginia as well as 40 out of 100 counties in North Carolina as covered jurisdictions.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-1532440012451979">5</xref></sup> Once designated, covered jurisdictions need preclearance from the federal government for any change in rules that could affect public elections. Moreover, on the request of residents, federal officials can review the voter registration process and monitor the elections in covered jurisdictions. Thus, the VRA severely limited the ability of segregationist governments to discourage minority representation.</p>
<p>These features let segregationist governments anticipate the significant increase of the minority voting population following the enactment of the VRA. Indeed, black voter registration rates among VRA-covered states rose from 27.9% before the VRA to 54.7% after it passed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1532440012451979">Rosenberg 2008</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-1532440012451979">6</xref></sup> Then, it is reasonable to assume that segregationist governments expected that minority voters would start affecting policy making in the near future.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-1532440012451979">7</xref></sup></p>
<p>Compared with analyzing regime changes in mundane electoral cycles, focusing on the political context around the VRA has the following empirical advantages. First, it enables us to quantify a government’s strategic motivation in response to the future change in voting population. The VRA let Southern segregationist governments anticipate that they would lose some electoral competitiveness. Because historic governmental reluctance to enfranchise minorities indicates their difficulty in acquiring electoral support from minority voters, any policy changes observed immediately after the enactment of the VRA were intended not to acquire electoral support from new minority voters but to benefit the supporters of the segregationist governments. Putting it frankly, these governments would have behaved more nicely to minority voters if they had thought they could acquire minority votes after enfranchisement.</p>
<p>Second, the political context around the VRA offers a <italic>once-and-for-all</italic> change in voting population because the devices for vote denial are unlikely to be restored in the future. This context maximizes the possibility of detecting strategic policy making, which otherwise is, a secretive and latent process. Intuitively, the situation in which the current government loses the next election but retakes power in the future and the situation in which it never regains power once lost should provide different strategic incentives to any current government. The segregationist governments after VRA characterized by the latter situation are more likely to engage in predatory behavior because cooperation does not yield long-run benefits. This once-and-for-all situation also better fits the formal models on fiscal policy that rely on a finite-stage game (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1532440012451979">Persson and Svensson 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1532440012451979">Tabellini and Alesina 1990</xref>). However, empirical studies on fiscal policies typically analyze the former situation in which political parties constantly compete with each other to seize power (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1532440012451979">Alt and Lowry 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1532440012451979">Crain and Tollison 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1532440012451979">Franzese 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1532440012451979">Grilli et al. 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1532440012451979">Pettersson-Lidbom 2001</xref>). In such a situation, the governments in power may choose not to exploit the financial resources of future governments. This would allow the governments to avoid the prisoner’s dilemma scenario, in which the government in power exploits future resources until it goes bankruptcy. It would also prevent, should the government return to power, the need to pay back more debt principal than it originally issued. Thus, with the data for which regime changes are frequently observed, it can be hard to detect strategic policy making or to determine whether a null finding indicates nonexistence of strategic policy making or a problem in the research design.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-1532440012451979">8</xref></sup></p>

<title>Theories</title>
<p>Policy intention is one of the hardest things to quantify. Aggregated data do not contain any information about policy intention. Policy makers are also unlikely to reveal their true intents particularly when their policies are predatory or strategic, as was the case for the segregationist governments. However, the information about which governments prioritized what policies in which period illuminates the black box of policy making. This section presents four theoretical policymaking accounts of Southern governments during the transitional period immediately following passage of the VRA and corresponding predictions about how each policy output might <italic>change</italic> from the pre-VRA period.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-1532440012451979">9</xref></sup></p>
<p>The following discussion excludes the theory of fiscal illusion, which posits that a government overspends its budgets because it tends to evaluate marginal benefits from spending more than marginal costs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1532440012451979">Buchanan and Wagner 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1532440012451979">Mueller 2003</xref>). Various factors contribute to fiscal illusion, such as miscalculation of the future revenue stream and/or amortization plan, irrational discount on future marginal benefits, or lack of understanding about the importance of fiscal discipline. These accounts, however, require researchers to apply different behavioral principles to different actors a posteriori, which does not weather rigorous academic scrutiny (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1532440012451979">DeWolff 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1532440012451979">Tabellini and Alesina 1990</xref>).</p>
<sec id="section4-1532440012451979">
<title>No Strategic Policy Making</title>
<p>Let us first consider the situation in which strategic policy making was absent, that is, the expectation of the future change in the voting population did not affect the policy making of the segregationist governments. Then, the segregationist governments switched their segregation policy to a more liberal one without experiencing the transitional phase. This situation serves as a baseline with which other theoretical accounts are contrasted.</p>
<p>The primary goal for segregationist governments in the 1960s was to maintain racial homogeneity in their living environments. As indicated by the aforementioned anecdotes, one of their largest concerns was school integration. As indicated by <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1532440012451979">Figure 1</xref>, there was deep cleavage on this issue between whites and nonwhites in VRA-covered states. Light blue (or light gray) bars represent the proportion of white respondents in the 1964 American National Election Studies (Sapiro, Rosenstone, and the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1532440012451979">National Election Studies 2007</xref>) who thought the federal government should commit to the issues labeled in the center, namely, job security, school integration, and medical assistance. Dark blue (or dark gray) bars are the counterparts for black respondents. The policy preferences between whites and nonwhites differed for all policy areas. Above all, the preferences of those living in the VRA-covered states were strikingly different on the issue of school integration. This figure also indicates their strong abhorrence of redistributive policies, such as medical assistance and job security. Furthermore, relocation to the suburbs was considered a versatile solution to avoid facing these differences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1532440012451979">Oliver 2001</xref>). Backed by generous governmental support for home mortgage programs and tax deductions, developmental policies (e.g., investments in infrastructure, development of the Interstate Highway System) accelerated suburbanization in this period (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1532440012451979">Jackson 1987</xref>).</p>

<p>Thus, using <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1532440012451979">Peterson’s (1981)</xref> classic policy typology that distinguishes among developmental, redistributive, allocation, and education policy, the segregationist governments would have spent more on developmental and/or education policies than on redistributive policies during the transitional period. However, in terms of the <italic>change</italic> in expenditures, these spending items would have neither increased nor decreased since the pre-VRA period in the absence of strategic policy making.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1532440012451979">
<title>Strategic Policy Making</title>
<p>The theory of strategic policy making simply posits that a government spends the budget while it can on its preferred policies because it expects someone will repay any debts in the future.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-1532440012451979">10</xref></sup> Because such motivation does not arise if the current government remains in office or a future government has the same policy preferences, the strength of the strategic motivation is determined as the product of the likelihood of a regime change and the expected difference between the two governments in policy preferences. Previous studies showed that the heterogeneities in age, race and ethnicity, income, and partisanship within a jurisdiction contribute to the expected difference in policy preferences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1532440012451979">Alesina and Drazen 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1532440012451979">Heller 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1532440012451979">McCubbins 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1532440012451979">Persson and Tabellini 2000</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-1532440012451979">11</xref></sup></p>
<p>In this sense, the VRA provides the best context for studying strategic policy making because it drastically changed the socioeconomic and political profile of the voting population. After enactment of the VRA, the voting population, particularly in the Southern states, became poorer, racially more heterogeneous, and politically more liberal. If the theory of strategic policy making is true, the segregationist governments would anticipate policy change in the future and would be motivated to spend more on their preferred policies while they stayed in power, particularly in the policy areas that might not attract enough attention from the future government.</p>
<p>Thus, the segregationist governments with strategic motivation should have spent more on education and developmental policies in the transitional period than they did in the pre-VRA period. However, these same governments should not have changed the level of redistributive policies as they had been kept at a minimal level.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1532440012451979">
<title>Strategic Use of Debts (SUD)</title>
<p>The theory of SUD is a subset of strategic policy making motivated by the following concern. Although the theory of strategic policy making is intuitive and simple, it cannot explain why strategic interaction reaches equilibrium. If the current government spends the budget in the way it wants, the future government will also spend the budget on its preferred policy in retaliation. Furthermore, anticipating the response of the future government, the current government would borrow as much as possible thereby depleting future financial resources to prevent retaliation. Thus, strategic policy making is fraught with bankruptcy. However, this disequilibrium is rarely observed in real-world politics.</p>
<p>The necessity of exploring equilibrium conditions for strategic policy making motivated formal theorists to develop a series of studies on the SUD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1532440012451979">Aghion and Bolton 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1532440012451979">Alesina and Tabellini 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1532440012451979">DeWolff 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1532440012451979">Persson and Svensson 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1532440012451979">Persson and Tabellini 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1532440012451979">Tabellini and Alesina 1990</xref>). Despite wide variations in their settings and assumptions, theorists commonly suppose that two policy makers have different preferences over two types of goods and that the marginal utilities from these goods are diminishing. The latter assumption of the diminishing marginal utility<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-1532440012451979">12</xref></sup> plays a critical role in keeping strategic policy making in the equilibrium path because spending an entire budget on the government’s preferred policy does not maximize its long-term utility unless the policy preferences between two competing governments are completely opposite.</p>
<p>Each theory of SUD typically requires other important assumptions for its existence. To find such an assumption and interpret its empirical implication without distortion, I chose the formal theory that most closely fits the political context during the transitional period of the VRA, namely, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1532440012451979">Tabellini and Alesina (1990)</xref>.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-1532440012451979">13</xref></sup> Their model is a two-stage perfect information game between the current government and the future government, both of which represent the policy preferences of the median voter in each period. A critical feature of their theory is that although voters’ preferences do not change over time, the current government is motivated to borrow from the future government due to an exogenous shock to the voting population that occurs between two periods and the resulting difference in the median policy preferences. This description of the game closely resembles the political situation in the South during the 1960s, in which the segregationist governments, representing whites, expected a major increase in the minority voters due to the enactment of the VRA.</p>
<p>In their model, the key assumption that guarantees the formal existence of SUD is that <italic>a government represented by the median voter becomes less risk-averse as its consumption of public goods increases</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn14-1532440012451979">14</xref></sup> Just like the law of diminishing marginal utility, risk-aversion lets a government allocate its budget equally to different goods. Therefore, this assumption implies that as total per capita spending goes down, a government becomes more risk-averse, and as it becomes more risk-averse, it more equally allocates its budget to different goods.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn15-1532440012451979">15</xref></sup> That is, a small government tends to maintain an equal allocation of public goods. This is no more than a formal statement of typical policy making by a government facing a tight budget constraint. In fact, Tabellini, the first author of the article, gives the following intuitive account:
<disp-quote>
<p>[W]hen resources are scarce we all agree that there are some priorities, such as spending on health and defense, but when resources abound, we can afford to spend in different ways and choose a more divergent mix of public goods. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1532440012451979">Persson and Tabellini 2000</xref>, 354)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Knowing this property of the common utility function, the current government can effectively force a future government to allocate its budgets equally to all essential policies by creating deficits, thus forcing a future government to face tighter budget constraints and increasing its degree of risk-aversion.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn16-1532440012451979">16</xref></sup></p>
<p>An empirical implication of this assumption is that the size of the government has a positive multiplier effect on strategic policy making. The smaller the size of a government, the more difficult it becomes to implement strategic policy making because a small budget does not allow the current government to reflect its strategic motivation in policies. Thus, budget allocations of small governments are similar regardless of whether they have strategic motivations. However, a big government, which is less risk-averse, has the capacity to translate its strategic motivation into action. In sum, the theory of SUD proposes the same predications as strategic policy making, but adds that as government size becomes larger, the greater the differential effect of strategic policy making.</p>

<title>Early Median Voter Shift</title>
<p>Finally, let us consider the case in which a large majority of minorities had already been enfranchised by the time the policy outputs were recorded in the 1967 Census, and the median voter of this new voting population decided public policies. This could either be a result of rapid progress in minority voter registration or the Southern governments’ commitment to the policies preferred by minority voters in expectation of future support from them. Although the historical facts do not necessarily correspond with these accounts, they pose an important observational equivalence to consider because school integration might be also accompanied by the increase in education spending and long-term debts.</p>
<p>However, the key distinction between early median voter shift and strategic policy making is that the former was also accompanied by the increase in redistributive policies. New minority voters enfranchised by the 1965 VRA often needed more public assistance than did the existing voting population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1532440012451979">Besley and Case 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1532440012451979">Husted and Kenny 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1532440012451979">Lott and Kenny 1999</xref>). Thus, if new minority voters affected policy making during the transitional period, we should observe an increase in welfare expenditure as well as education expenditure and long-term debts.</p>

<p>The fourth column in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1532440012451979">Table 1</xref> summarizes the predictions of the four theories discussed above. If strategic policy making exists, we expect to observe increases in education and developmental policies as well as long-term debts. If only the subset of strategic policy making (i.e., SUD) is supported, these increases would be observed only among the governments with large budgets.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn17-1532440012451979">17</xref></sup> If welfare expenditures also increased, the result is likely to be caused by the early median voter shift.

<p>Finally, the fifth column in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1532440012451979">Table 1</xref> summarizes the policy change from the transitional to the posttransitional period. If strategic policy making did not occur during the transitional period, we would observe an increase in education expenditures among Southern governments during the posttransitional period, but not any change in developmental policy. In this instance, these governments should have switched from minimalistic segregation policies to more liberal ones, such as school integration, without experiencing the transitional phase. However, if the median voter shift occurred in the posttransitional period, the predictions for the early median voter shift apply to the change in policy outputs from the transitional period to the posttransitional period. That is, we would observe an increase in welfare expenditures and a decrease in developmental expenditures but would not observe any change in education expenditures because they had already been high during the transitional period to build an “escape hatch.” In addition, if early median voter shift was the case, no significant increase or decrease in policy outputs would be observed thereafter.</p>

<title>Research Design</title>
<sec id="section10-1532440012451979">
<title>Data</title>
<p>The main purpose of this study is to examine the effect of strategic policy making on policy outcomes. The counties in the United States from 1957 to 1972 serve this purpose quite well.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn18-1532440012451979">18</xref></sup> Because the primary function of local governments in the United States is to produce local public goods, and because bond issues are often subject to a referendum, their characteristics can be mapped in a single-dimensional policy space. Moreover, market mechanisms such as the capitalization of local public goods to home values (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1532440012451979">Fischel 2001</xref>) make local governments responsive to the policy preferences of the median voter.</p>
<p>County-level analysis has several other desirable features for empirical analysis. The sample size is large with little sampling bias.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn19-1532440012451979">19</xref></sup> The county borders do not change due to municipal incorporation and secession. Moreover, within any given county, the range of services is nearly the same. This last point is particularly important, because if governments provide a different range of services, a given amount of per capita budget may differently affect their levels of risk-aversion. Some counties experienced an untypically large demographic change. They were excluded from analysis because the changes in these counties do not precisely represent within-unit variations.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn20-1532440012451979">20</xref></sup> In addition, observations that have any missing values are excluded from the analysis. These processes drop the total number of observations per year from 3,111 to 2,784.</p>
<p>Data are collected from the following sources. Finance data were collected from the Census of Governments for 1957, 1962, 1967, and 1972. These censuses aggregate fiscal statistics for all local governments within a county, including municipalities, townships, school districts, and other special districts. That is, the statistics of one county present composite figures for several local governments.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn21-1532440012451979">21</xref></sup> Socioeconomic data are collected from County Data Books for 1962, 1967, 1972, and 1977 (Haines and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1532440012451979">ICPSR 2010</xref>), which contain the census data collected 5 years ago.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-1532440012451979">
<title>Timing</title>
<p>With a few reasonable assumptions, the timing of the census collection provides one of the best divisions to distinguish the pre-VRA, transitional, and posttransitional periods. Ideally, the division between the pre-VRA and transitional periods should be at the time when local governments had motivation for SUD, but this timing is unobservable and may vary by government. To establish a reasonable division, the following three assumptions are made according to the standard procedure of budgetary implementation:</p>
<list id="list1-1532440012451979" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>It takes one fiscal year for local governments to draft budget proposals, and they implement these proposals in the following fiscal year.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Segregationist governments had an expectation of change in the voting population no later than August 7, 1965, when the VRA was enacted.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Segregationist governments could reflect their strategic motivation in the following year’s budget proposal immediately after the enactment of the VRA.</p></list-item></list>
<p>Given these three assumptions, if part of the budget was drafted after August 7, 1965, for the purpose of this study it is considered to have been drafted during the transitional period. The timing for collecting financial data by the 1967 Census of Governments provides the ideal division for these three periods.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn22-1532440012451979">22</xref></sup> Specifically, the data minimize the possibility of an early median voter shift due to local elections after the VRA went into effect because this census reflects fiscal decisions for the period immediately following VRA enactment in 1965.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn23-1532440012451979">23</xref></sup> Financial data of the 1962 Census of Governments, the nearest preceding fiscal year available, are used as the data for the pre-VRA period. Finally, the data of the posttransitional period are collected from the 1972 Census of Governments.</p>
<p>Because policy outputs in the fiscal year of 1971 were recorded in the 1972 Census, if the budgets were drafted in the preceding year of policy implementation, the 1972 Census reflects the policy decisions in the end of the fiscal year 1970. Then, by the end of the fiscal year 1970, all governments experienced at least one election since the enactment of the VRA. Thus, the statistics of the 1972 Census reflect the policy preferences of the new voting populations.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-1532440012451979">
<title>Variables</title>
<p>The dependent variables are logged per capita expenditures on education, welfare, and highways, and logged per capita long-term debts outstanding. The first three variables make up the majority of the general expenditures of counties.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn24-1532440012451979">24</xref></sup> I consider welfare and highway expenditures as representative statistics of redistributive and developmental policies. The statistics of long-term debts are the aggregation of general obligation (GO) and revenue bonds, which make up 60% and 40% of the long-term debts of municipalities, respectively (1967 Census of Governments).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn25-1532440012451979">25</xref></sup> GO bonds are issued to capital investments from which direct collection of usage fees is difficult, and they are typically repaid by property taxes. Because the interest payments and the retirement of debt principal constrain future budgets, they would be the ideal dependent variable to test SUD. Revenue bonds can be issued for projects for which the financing is repaid by the projects themselves (e.g., tollways). The type of enterprises that can be financed by revenue bonds is limited. Thus, they have limited impact on a government’s future budget constraints and may not be as responsive as GO bonds to policy makers’ strategic motivation.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn26-1532440012451979">26</xref></sup> Short-term debts are mostly issued to make up an unforeseen revenue shortage and may not capture the dynamics of the regime change.</p>
<p>The key explanatory variables are the dummy variables that identify the segregationist governments and the proportion of the nonwhite population. These two variables contribute to the expected difference in policy preferences and the likelihood of regime change between the pre-VRA and the transitional periods, which determine the strength of strategic motivation. The dummy variable of the segregationist governments is coded “1” if the county was designated as a covered jurisdiction in the VRA. All counties in Alabama, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, South Carolina, and Virginia, as well as 40 out of 100 counties in North Carolina, were covered by the VRA, which identifies 501 counties out of 2,784 as VRA-covered counties. Given our lack of knowledge about how far the effect of the VRA spread, I also use an alternative coding for the segregationist governments according to historical definitions of the South. Specifically, the variable takes “1” if the county is a part of the 11 former Confederate States of America. The 7 states covered by Section 5, along with Florida, Texas, Arkansas, and Tennessee constitute the Confederate States of America, which identifies 992 counties out of 2,784 as Southern counties.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn27-1532440012451979">27</xref></sup></p>
<p>Control variables include county and year fixed effects as well as socioeconomic variables. Importantly, county fixed effects, account for all observed and unobserved 5-year time-invariant unit characteristics such as party structure, political culture, and any time-invariant county- and state-level confounding factors such as adoption of home rule or restrictions on rolling over the deficit. Year fixed effects control for national time trends. Furthermore, within-counties, time-varying socioeconomic trends are accounted for with the following control variables: median family income, unemployment rate, the ratio of urban population, the ratio of the elderly population, land area, population, and rate of population growth for 10 years. A similar set of control variables are found elsewhere (usually without unit fixed effects) in the empirical studies of local governments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1532440012451979">Berry 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1532440012451979">Oliver 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>Variables are transformed in several ways. First, all dependent variables are transformed into their natural logarithms because the same monetary increase in expenditures or debts can represent different policy preferences, depending on the size of the baseline budgets.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn28-1532440012451979">28</xref></sup> This transformation changes the way regression coefficients are interpreted from a monetary to a percentage basis. All pecuniary variables are adjusted with a gross domestic product (GDP) deflator and shown in prices of 2000. Control variables are linearly interpolated so that they represent the condition of the 1 year before policies were implemented. Due to limitation of space, descriptive statistics are presented in supplementary Appendix D.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section13-1532440012451979">
<title>Estimation Methods</title>
<p>Excepting the theory of SUD, the hypotheses are tested with difference in differences (DD) estimation. DD is one of the most standard methods for so-called “natural experiments” because it distinguishes causal association from contemporaneous correlation and treatment-specific change from global time trends (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1532440012451979">Imbens and Wooldridge 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1532440012451979">Meyer 1995</xref>). In this framework, the enforcement date of the VRA bounds the pre-VRA and transitional periods, and this division reflects whether policy makers could have an anticipation of the change in the voting population. With control variables, the DD is estimated as β in the following regression model:</p>

<p>where subscripts <italic>c</italic> denotes county and <italic>t</italic> denotes time, which is either 1962 or 1967 for the main analysis, and policy output<sub><italic>c,t</italic></sub> is one of the four dependent variables. The key explanatory variable is treatment<sub><italic>c</italic></sub> × VRA<sub><italic>t</italic></sub>, which is the interaction term between the treatment variable, treatment<sub><italic>c</italic></sub>, and the year dummy variable for the transitional period, VRA<sub><italic>t</italic></sub>.

This model tells us whether a segregationist government increased more spending after the VRA when it expected a future change in the voting population. Specifically, β represents how much more the percentage of per capita spending of the segregationist governments increased from the pre-VRA to the transitional period compared with their counterparts in the rest of the counties.</p>
<p>Although the theory of SUD tested in this study is only one version of the various theories of SUD, namely, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1532440012451979">Tabellini and Alesina (1990)</xref>, its equilibrium condition is rightly represented by the method of the triple differences. Their theory predicts that the government issues more debts when it expects greater differences in future policy preferences and has larger budgets that enable it to reflect its strategic intention in policies. Thus, the triple interaction term between the identifier of the transitional period, the identifier of segregationist governments, and the size of the budgets corresponds to equilibrium in their model. Formally, the triple difference estimator is defined as λ in the following regression model:</p>

<p>The first three columns use the two indicators of the segregationist governments, and the fourth column uses the proportion of the nonwhite population. In the top panel, these key explanatory variables have statistically significant and positive effects on logged per capita education expenditures in all models. Specifically, Model (3) shows that when the indicator of covered jurisdictions and that of the former Confederate states are both entered into the model, the latter maintained the statistical power. This indicates that the Southern counties, not only VRA-covered counties, increased education spending. Substantively, the Southern counties increased per capita education expenditures 5.9% plus or minus 2.6% more than the rest of the country from the pre-VRA to the transitional periods.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn32-1532440012451979">32</xref></sup> The estimated 5.9% increase in per capita education spending amounts to $28.9 per capita or approximately $1.1 million per county.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn33-1532440012451979">33</xref></sup> Between the 1962 and the 1967 Censuses, the average per capita education expenditures among Southern counties increased from $361 to $530, and $28.9 accounts for 17.1% of this increase.</p>
<p>However, the results in the other panels suggest that the increase in education spending did not necessarily exploit the future policy resources and are not sufficient to verify the theory of strategic policy making. In the second panel, none of the key explanatory variables shows any statistically significant effect on the change in per capita highway expenditures. Furthermore, in the third panel, only the coefficient of the dummy variable of the former Confederate states is even weakly statistically significant in Model (11). This indicates that only the counties in the peripheral South statistically significantly increased per capita long-term debts outstanding, which is inconsistent with the theory of strategic policy making because the governments in the deep South should have a stronger strategic motivation.</p>
<p>The early median voter shift is also unlikely to be the underlying mechanism. In the bottom panel, the proportion of the nonwhite population has a weak but statistically significant and positive effect. Thus, the overall findings in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1532440012451979">Table 2</xref> seem rather consistent with the explanation by the early median voter shift. However, the following analysis shows that the increase in welfare spending was caused by the actual policy shifts of the non-Southern counties where the nonwhite population was predominant, whereas the increase in the education expenditures was not.</p>
<p>In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1532440012451979">Figure 2</xref>, each dot represents an estimated coefficient of year 1967 × %nonwhite population with a different subsample. Each subsample includes only the counties for which the percentage of nonwhite population in 1967 is below the cutoff point in the horizontal axis.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn34-1532440012451979">34</xref></sup> In the upper panel, most of the coefficients on logged per capita education expenditures are statistically positively significant, and the size of coefficient does not diminish or even slightly increases after minority–majority counties are excluded from the sample. However, the coefficient on per capita welfare expenditures quickly becomes insignificant once several minority-predominant counties are excluded from the subsample. This indicates that large per capita welfare spending of these minority–majority counties makes the coefficient of Model (16) in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1532440012451979">Table 2</xref> significant.</p>

<p>In sum, no single theory explains the results in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1532440012451979">Table 2</xref>, and they are likely to result from the combination of multiple mechanisms. The statistically significant coefficients in the analysis of education expenditures and the upper panel of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1532440012451979">Figure 2</xref> indicate that the increase in education spending occurred in the Southern counties where white population were still dominant. However, the increase in education spending was not accompanied by an increase in highway expenditures or long-term debts, except for the peripheral South. Thus, the segregationist governments possibly increased education spending by using intergovernmental subsidies. Because the Civil Rights Act of 1964 stipulates the submission of an integration plan to receive federal subsidies, the segregationist governments might have chosen to spend the subsidies for school integration. However, the historical evidence shows that school integration did not start in the deep South during the transitional period, although it was already in progress in the peripheral South.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn35-1532440012451979">35</xref></sup> Perhaps the Southern counties might simply have been trying to catch up with the other counties in the quality of public education during the transitional period.</p>

<p>In the first panel, the triple interaction term is statistically positively significant only in Models (1) and (3). This indicates that only the counties that were covered by Section 5 of the VRA with a large budget issued more long-term debts per capita than their counterparts did. The statistically insignificant coefficient of the triple interaction term in Model (2) indicates that SUD was caused by factors shared among counties in the deep South, but not among counties in the peripheral South (e.g., the VRA-covered status that allowed the federal government’s unilateral intervention in their election procedures or their strong desire to perpetuate segregation).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn37-1532440012451979">37</xref></sup></p>
<p>The second and third panels show the same statistical patterns as the first panel. The triple interaction terms with the identifier of the VRA-covered counties in Models (5), (7), (9), and (11) have statistically significant and positive effects on education and highway expenditures. However, those with the identifier of the former Confederate states in Models (7) and (11) do not, when these two kinds of the triple interaction terms are both included in the estimation model. However, the last panel shows that none of the triple interaction terms has a statistically significant effect on welfare expenditures.</p>
<p>The findings in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1532440012451979">Table 3</xref> are quite consistent with predictions made by the theory of SUD. That is, the VRA-covered counties that anticipated a great change in future policy preferences and had large enough budgets to execute SUD issued extra bonds to perpetuate segregation through the construction of all-white schools in the suburbs while keeping the level of welfare minimal. This is indicated by the increase in education and highway expenditures and no change in the welfare expenditures. The VRA-covered counties were not only motivated to spend the budget on their preferred policies while in power but also to reduce future welfare spending by letting future governments face tighter budget constraints by overissuing local bonds.</p>
<p>Using the conservative coefficients estimated from an IV in Table A7 in supplementary Appendix F,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn38-1532440012451979">38</xref></sup> the VRA-covered counties for which the instrumented logged per capita total revenue in 1967 that was one standard deviation greater than the mean increased per capita long-term debts outstanding 20.8% more than did their counterparts (noncovered counties with one standard deviation greater logged per capita total revenue in 1967) from the pre-VRA to the transitional periods.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn39-1532440012451979">39</xref></sup> The estimated 20.8% effect of SUD amounted to $105 per capita or a $3.5 million increase in debts outstanding per county.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn40-1532440012451979">40</xref></sup> From the pre-VRA to the transitional periods, the estimated per capita long-term debts outstanding among the VRA-covered counties with one standard deviation greater instrumented logged per capita revenue increased from $430 to $589, and $105 accounts for about two-thirds of this increase. However, having one standard deviation greater logged per capita total revenue increased per capita long-term debts outstanding only by $5.8 per capita or $195,506 in the average covered county.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn41-1532440012451979">41</xref></sup></p>

<title>Robustness Checks</title>
<p>The statistical findings in the previous sections are also robust to different model specifications and are distinct from observational equivalences. The details are discussed in supplementary Appendix F, although I summarize the main points here. First, I reestimated the models in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1532440012451979">Table 3</xref> using an IV to address the potential endogeneity between the variable of government size (logged per capita total revenue in 1967) and the dependent variable (logged per capita long-term debts outstanding) and obtained consistent results. Second, the estimated effects are distinct from regional variations. The results do not change when Model (1) of <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1532440012451979">Table 2</xref> is estimated with nearest-neighbor matching (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1532440012451979">Abadie et al. 2004</xref>), and when Models (1), (5), (9), and (13) in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1532440012451979">Table 3</xref> are estimated with the regional time trend variables.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn42-1532440012451979">42</xref></sup> Third, the changes in policy outputs from the transitional to the posttransitional periods are consistent with the predictions. That is, a huge increase is observed in welfare spending from the transitional to the posttransitional periods, while highway spending decreased during the same period. This also supports the view that strategic actors had accurate expectations about how policies would change when the preferences of minority voters were reflected in public policies. Finally, there are no trend effects in the VRA-covered counties. I ran regressions similar to Models (1) to (4) in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1532440012451979">Table 3</xref>, using the two preceding census figures (i.e., 1957 and 1962) and changing the dependent variable to logged per capita total debts outstanding,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn43-1532440012451979">43</xref></sup> but the coefficients of the triple interaction terms are all statistically insignificant.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Previous studies have predominantly focused on how the actual change in the median voter affects policy outcomes. However, the mechanism by which anticipation of the change shapes public policies has not been well investigated. This study builds on the empirical implications of one version of the theory of SUD by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1532440012451979">Tabellini and Alesina (1990)</xref> and finds that VRA-covered counties with large budgets statistically significantly increased long-term debts, education spending, and highway spending during the transitional period more than did the rest of the country. That is, it takes both a strong motive and sufficient financial leeway for the governments to exercise SUD.</p>
<p>From these results, one can articulate this causal explanation. The most preferred strategy for the VRA-covered counties was to maintain white dominance in their jurisdictions through the vote denial of minorities. Because the VRA prohibited this strategy, segregationist governments inevitably anticipated that minority voters would start influencing the policy process, which meant that emphasis on policy priorities would shift from developmental to redistributive policies. This anticipated change caused serious anxiety about education policy where the deepest issue cleavage existed. The segregationist governments with enough financial capacity passed additional bond issues to build schools in the suburbs as “escape hatches,” expecting that the minority voters would pay the outstanding debts on taking office.</p>
<p>This study purposefully focused on the segregationist governments in the 1960s, but actual examples for SUD are abundant. Gentrification, selective relocation, large-scale real-estate development, the operation of a new large-scale manufacturing plant, natural disasters, and the mass influx of immigrants are all good examples to demonstrate SUD in action, although most of them are not suitable for empirical studies.</p>
<p>Finally, the implication of the study goes beyond the empirical support of SUD. This study presents rare empirical evidence of the segregationist governments’ efforts to limit policy <italic>outputs</italic>. I believe this is a meaningful addition to an abundance of previous studies on Southern politics that have confirmed the segregationist states’ efforts to limit the power of policy inputs for nonwhites, such as voter registration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1532440012451979">Alt 1994</xref>) or representation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1532440012451979">Davidson and Grofman 1994</xref>) . Furthermore, this study empirically demonstrates one of the causal mechanisms by which incumbent governments left a negative legacy for future generations.</p>

<p>The VRA was enacted as a 5-year temporary legislation, but this study assumes that government officials anticipated the VRA would not lapse in 5 years without substantial improvement of minority representation. In fact, the VRA was enacted through the bipartisan support of non-Southern members of Congress in 1965. The Supreme Court ruled that the VRA was constitutional (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1532440012451979"><italic>South Carolina v. Katzenbach</italic> 1966</xref>), and so the VRA was extended in 1970, 1975, 1982, and 2006.</p>

<p>Specifically, even after the passage of the 24th Amendment in 1964 banning poll taxes, some Southern states continued to implement the poll tax until the Supreme Court struck it down in 1966. To cope with their noncompliance, Section 10 of the VRA enabled the Attorney General to “institute,” or challenge, the use of poll taxes, thus effectively restricting its use.</p>

Specifically, several counties, such as Monterey County and Yuba County in California, which were added to the list of covered jurisdictions in March 1971, should not be classified as covered jurisdictions during the entire period of analysis because the Census in 1972 reflects the policy making earlier than March 1971.</p>

<p>Even if the median voter theorem does not hold, the future regime change is sufficient, but not necessary, for policy makers to have such an expectation because it does not require minority voters to have a majority status to let politicians reflect their policy preferences. In fact, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1532440012451979">C. Cameron, Epstein, and O’Halloran (1996)</xref> shows that in the South it takes about 40% black voting-age population for a black candidate to win in a House election with a half chance, and less than a 10% black voting-age population for a Democratic candidate (after realignment) to win with a half chance.</p>

<p>This empirical difficulty does not mean that once-and-for-all regime changes never occur in mundane political cycles. For example, if a party leader has an individual preference distinct from that of his or her party, he or she might perceive his or her incumbency as a once-and-for-all opportunity to carry out his or her policy goals, and may be motivated to commit strategic policy makings.</p>

<p>As modeled by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1532440012451979">Aghion and Bolton (1990)</xref>, governments have an option to renege on debts, but this option is often difficult to exercise in practice because the governments trying to renege cannot convince voters that responsibility is entirely the responsibility of the previous government.</p>

<p>Note that this condition only guarantees that the optimal level of borrowing in the first stage is positive.

<p>The budgets of the governments that have few political overtones, such as sewage management districts, only account for a small fraction of the total budgets.

<p>Here, issue of revenue bonds is assumed not to loosen budget constraints of the future government.

<p>These key explanatory variables receive a reasonable concern that the interaction term between these two would better capture an expected discontinuity of policy preferences. However, as presented in Table A3 in the supplementary appendix, this variable does not have a significant impact on policy outcomes due to multicollinearity. As discussed in supplementary Appendix C in detail, these two key explanatory variables represent the same idea, but their correlation coefficient is .673, which is almost the maximum possible value given the value assignments of these variables. Thus, entering this interaction term as well as its main effect variables suffers from strong multicollinearities.</p>
