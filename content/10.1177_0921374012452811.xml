<abstract>
<p>This exploratory essay approaches gendered aspects of anti-black violence through the experiences of black mothers whose children were the victims of homicide in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Commonly understood to primarily affect black men, urban violence in Brazil has less-visible effects on black women. Their struggles to survive encompass not only their own fights against poverty, discrimination, and race and gender discrimination, but it also entails the consequences of violent acts perpetrated or facilitated by the state upon black men in their families. However, these experiences are either invisibilized or not taken into consideration in traditional analyses of violence. How can black women’s experiences deepen the analysis of anti-black violence and enrich African diaspora studies? Do the violent deaths of their relatives contribute to black women’s radicalization and activism? What are the main components of their political struggles? This essay addresses these issues in the framework of African diaspora scholarship and black feminist theory.</p>

<p>This essay aims to carry out an ethnographic analysis of gendered aspects of anti-black genocide in the metropolitan region of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. It is based upon my interactions with black mothers whose children were the victims of lethal violence. Some of them have subsequently become anti-violence activists. I argue that, even though black men are more frequently the victims of violent premature deaths, black women suffer the long-term consequences of this violence, which affects them socially, economically, politically, and emotionally—the compound results of which often affect their health. How can black women’s experiences deepen the analysis of anti-black violence and enrich African diaspora studies? Do the violent deaths of their relatives contribute to black women’s radicalization and activism? What are the main components of their political struggles? Informed by black feminist scholarship, this research examines black women’s everyday encounters with violence in order to provide a gendered critique of genocide studies,which to this point have tended to focus on black men as victims of violence. The content of this exploratory essay derives from semi-structured interviews and participant observation conducted in 2010–12.</p>

<title>‘I became a living dead,’ or, the importance of gendering genocide</title>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>When I got home, I asked: Where is Thiago? My leg started to shake; I had a very bad feeling, but I was terrified to walk around the favela. At 4 a.m. came the news that he had been killed. He was shot three times in his chest, once in the eye and once in the mouth. That day never ended. He died, and I became a living dead. Everything changed in my life after that. I think I will never be who I was. It is too much pain. Too much pain.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Data show that homicide victimization in Brazil is highly dependent on race. The general trend in Brazil since 2002 is a decline in the absolute number of homicides among the white population and an increase within the black population. In 2002, the number of blacks who were murdered was 45.8 percent higher than that of whites. In 2005, that number increased to 77.8 percent higher; it ballooned to 127.6 percent higher in 2008 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0921374012452811">Waiselfisz, 2011</xref>). In some Brazilian states, such as Alagoas, Paraiba, and Amapa, the victimization rate is up to 11 times more in black men (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0921374012452811">Waiselfisz, 2011</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0921374012452811">2012b</xref>). These data show what the black population living in favelas and other poor neighborhoods in Brazil has known for a long time: the disproportionate killing of black bodies is so great that it is no longer possible to avoid its genocidal aspect.</p>
<p>Given that women are 20 percent less likely than men to be homicide victims (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0921374012452811">Peres, 2007</xref>: 132), what is the importance of studying black women’s experiences of violence, especially regarding male homicides? Why concentrate on black women as direct victims of the consequences of male homicides, instead of focusing on domestic violence, since the number of female victims of such violence has increased (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0921374012452811">Waiselfisz, 2012a</xref>) or on <italic>femicide</italic>, the killing of a woman (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0921374012452811">Romio, 2009</xref>)?</p>
<p>Theorizing in the US context, Vargas describes genocide as a multidimensional phenomenon that
<disp-quote>
<p>. . . is expressed in deadly physical violence, institutionalized discrimination by and in the police, courts, and legislatures; physical terror, economic and political marginalization, and militarization. These various facets highlight that, at the core of the Black genocidal process in the U.S., resides a set of dominant values and representations that dehumanizes Blacks, excludes them from the realm of the good society, and justifies their continued disrespect and death. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0921374012452811">2005</xref>: 269–70)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>According to Vargas, in the Brazilian context ‘the Black genocidal process’ also encompasses ‘high infant mortality, premature death, medical treatment deficiency, the lack of a competitive education and economic opportunities, and chronic depression’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0921374012452811">Vargas, 2010a</xref>: 50). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0921374012452811">Sonia Santos (2008)</xref> contributes to this argument by adding maternal mortality and the forced sterilization of black women as components of the phenomenon of black genocide. She suggests that ‘the failure of state policies to secure the existence of these women can be taken as an intentional action against them and their communities, which constitutes a form of genocide’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0921374012452811">2008</xref>: 380).</p>
<p>Vargas’s and Santos’s arguments suggest that both the direct discriminatory actions of the state and its failure in providing for the needs of the black population produce prejudice and contribute to genocide. In the context of violence in Brazil, though the state is not materially responsible for all of the anti-black violence that takes place, state practices have combined with patriarchal masculinity to facilitate the reproduction of male-on-male violence, which ultimately reinforces black women’s oppression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0921374012452811">Gordon, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0921374012452811">hooks, 2004</xref>). In this sense, I suggest that within the genocide continuum a black male’s death works as catalytic fuel for potentially deadly encounters between black women and the state. The effects of black male deaths are exhibited in women’s struggles for everyday survival—and in the fear, helplessness, guilt, and confusion of those who cry for justice and reparation through the channels of the judiciary, or who organize to prevent further deaths, or who try to make sense of their life after their loved ones’ death. Although we cannot prove the intentionality of this violence against black women and men, the results of the state‘s policing practices throughout the years have produced an array of physical, biological, and cultural forms of violence against black Brazilians (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0921374012452811">Vargas, 2010b</xref>).</p>
<p>A handful of scholarly works provide a sense of some of the consequences of genocidal state practices. In a study of the bodily and mental harm suffered by secondary victims of violence, scholars Glaucio Soares, Dayse Miranda, and Dorian Borges show that those who have suffered the violent death of a loved one continue to experience physical and mental pain three years after the fact (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0921374012452811">2006</xref>: 75). According to the authors, in cases of homicide, since the death was perpetrated by ‘someone with anger and with the intention to kill, the understanding and the comprehension of the death is very difficult, especially to parents’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0921374012452811">2006</xref>: 96). They also affirm that traumatic experiences with bodily and mental symptoms are distinct in men and women, with women being more likely to develop post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).</p>
<p>Activist and ethnographic work has given me the chance to hear from black women living in the metropolitan region of Rio de Janeiro their perspective on the violence that takes place in the area. In support of my argument on the potentially deadly encounters between black women and the state, I present Deize’s<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0921374012452811">2</xref></sup> encounter with violence. Deize is a black woman and mother of four children who lives in a favela in Rio de Janeiro. Her oldest son became involved in petty robbery and was caught and placed in a juvenile detention facility. While he was in this place, under the tutelage of the state, Deize was told by the police that her son had died after falling on the floor while trying to escape. But when Deize saw his body, the bruises she saw did not match up with the story she had received from the authorities. She instigated a private investigation into her son’s death, with the support of organizations working against police brutality, and found out that her son had been tortured and brutally murdered by six agents of the state’s security forces. Her investigation resulted in the incrimination of the agents, and the judicial process is still ongoing. Deize participate in activities against police brutality and became a reference of human rights in the favela where she lives.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0921374012452811">3</xref></sup> However, this activist and personal struggle has brought negative consequences for health and social life. She fights against depression, has developed high blood pressure and she herself and her family are constantly threatened by police officers.</p>
<p>Understanding black women’s experiences as victims of violence in Rio de Janeiro, and in their everyday struggles for survival, requires an examination of the web of oppressions that they face. For this purpose, black feminist methodology and epistemology is crucial, especially regarding intersectionality. The concept of intersectionality—the idea that it is necessary to consider the different forms of discrimination and oppression to which an individual is exposed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0921374012452811">AMNB, 2007</xref>: 17; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0921374012452811">Crenshaw, 2002</xref>)—is fundamental to the development of my theoretical approach in two ways.</p>
<p>First, intersectionality opens up the possibility of seeing and understanding that black women are different from each other. In the context of experiencing a violent death in the family, for example, some women have partners with whom they can share the pain of losing a son or daughter. Others are single mothers. One may have the economic resources to leave the neighborhood where her husband was killed; another has to take her two sons to live with her mother in another state while she tries to rebuild her life. Some are able to maintain emotional stability and strength, which, combined with knowledge of the judicial system, may lead them to pursue legal action against the perpetrators of the violence that has taken place in their lives. Many others became so emotionally and mentally destroyed that they cannot even talk about what has happened.</p>
<p>According to black feminist <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0921374012452811">Patricia Hill Collins (2000</xref>: 42), oppressions interrelate, creating a system that reflects the intersection of multiple forms of discrimination, ‘mak[ing] their [Black women’s] whole life situation and the focus of their political struggles unique’. That is, understanding the social position of black women is a heuristic device for identifying other spaces where systems of inequality come together. It means that factors such as occupation, sexual orientation, physical and mental condition, territory, class, and education, among others, make our lives distinct from each other, and these can interact, making each experience unique, and require specific solutions (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0921374012452811">Criola, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>Intersectional analysis refuses to privilege class over race, or race over gender. Working from this understanding, the present study asserts that class is lived through race and gender, and vice versa. This is essential in the Brazilian context, because it dismisses the constructed idea that class discrimination is the chief form of oppression. By taking into consideration intersectionality, it is possible to strengthen social movements in their struggles, and to denounce the oppression to which black women are exposed.</p>
<p>The second way that intersectionality is central to my theoretical framework is through its potential to contribute to the development of an understanding of the determinants of violence in Rio de Janeiro. It must be emphasized that the state’s process of choosing who lives and who dies—necropolitics<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0921374012452811">4</xref></sup>—is determined by race, but also by class, gender, geographic area, and social status. Sometimes certain factors are decisive, and sometimes others. Racism, due to its deep entrenchment in Brazilian culture, interacts with homophobia, classism, sexism, and gender bias to influence lives, the functioning of institutions and organizations like the police, and also relations between people, which increase the vulnerability of black women in Brazilian society.</p>
<p>Other bodies of literature that inform my theoretical framework are African diaspora scholarship and black feminist thought. In the black feminist view, theory and politics are dialectically linked. The struggle for justice and for the suppression of all forms of discrimination shaped, and continues to shape, these scholars’ views and identity. My interest in researching particular aspects of violence in Rio de Janeiro, which is not only intellectual, but also political, is in accordance with the Combahee River Statement, which declares that ‘[t]he inclusiveness of our politics makes us concerned with any situation that impinges upon the lives of women’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0921374012452811">Combahee River Collective, 1995</xref>: 239). The statement continues:
<disp-quote>
<p>In the process of consciousness-raising, actually life-sharing, we [Black feminists] began to recognize the commonality of our experiences and, from the sharing and growing consciousness, to build a politics that will change our lives and inevitably end our oppression. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0921374012452811">1995</xref>: 233)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In other words, connecting the histories of black women‘s lives and struggles, and showing that what may seem to be isolated experiences are in fact collective, can enhance or even create political leverage.</p>
<p>African diasporic experiences are always gendered, but according to scholar <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0921374012452811">James Clifford (1994</xref>: 313), ‘there is a tendency for theoretical accounts of diasporas and diaspora cultures to hide this fact . . . thus normalizing male experiences’. In that sense, making evident the experiences that black women have with violence in Afro-diasporic countries such Brazil shows the web of forces that shape the consciousness of the diaspora, thus expanding our current knowledge.</p>

<title>‘I fear for the life of my son,’ or, a hidden perspective in urban violence in Rio de Janeiro</title>
<p>It is common to hear from the mothers who participated in my research that they were at some point blamed for the violence that members of their families committed. These accusations can come from a police officer, from the neighbors, or even from another family member. If their children become involved in criminal activities, black women are frequently accused of failing to properly raise and educate them. Perpetuating the social structure that allows people to develop such reasoning, mainstream media in Brazil usually represent black women in stereotypical roles, and the daily display of black bodies performing stereotypical and racist characters helps to deny black humanity.</p>
<p>An example of this dynamic can be seen in the debate generated in 2010 around a newspaper report titled, ‘Dealer’s mother says she asked her son to surrender’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0921374012452811"><italic>O Globo</italic>, 10 July 2010</xref>). The article refers to an incident that occurred in August 2010 in the elite Rio de Janeiro neighborhood of São Conrado. Around 8am, ten men suspected of being connected to drug trafficking were passing through São Conrado on their way to Rocinha, the largest favela in Latin America, when the police intercepted them. The police opened fire on the group, and some of them ran into a famous luxury hotel. The suspects’ negotiation with the police lasted for over an hour. Some of the men were killed, and the majority were arrested. While the negotiation was under way, a reporter interviewed the mother of one of the suspects. She said, ‘I did not raise my son to do that. I asked him to surrender and he did not want to.’ This testimony generated several comments from anonymous readers which show the disparity between how black women see themselves and their communities, and how newspaper readers see them.</p>
<p>Negative images of black women and black communities were very recurrent in the 66 comments about the article in the newspaper. Stereotypes of black mothers and ascribing them culpability for violence in Rio de Janeiro is shown by the following quotations:
<disp-quote>
<p>The trafficker’s mother said her son was not raised for it. She needed to go to jail for negligence.</p>
<p>Had she kept her legs closed, she would not be having this sadness. I would not be feeling so angry.</p>
<p>Where was this mother until today? In front of the TV!</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Since the readers target the black population as responsible for the violence, sterilization and extermination are seen as solutions:
<disp-quote>
<p>Why not tubal ligation and vasectomy for those who cannot afford to raise a child? Not right to kill them??</p>
<p>She needs to thank God. The best for us would see she crying for him in his funeral.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In order to stem the violence, the first step is to erase the humanity of this population. A recurrent theme is the animalization of black people, which leads to the need for extermination:
<disp-quote>
<p>We have to kill this plague . . . it is not good to arrest them. When they leave prison, they will rob and kill and practice every kind of crime again . . . we have to kill these pests, these human excrement.</p>
<p>The most practical would be to sterilize these mice, so these worms that harass our life could not be born.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Criminalization of poverty and approaching the violence in Rio de Janeiro as if it were a civil war are also persistent themes. I argue that these perceptions lead to demands for public security that authorize the police to be harsher and more ‘efficacious’ when dealing with the poor and criminals, which should be read as extermination. The main targets of this practice are black people living in poor neighborhoods, which are seen as sites where police intervention is necessary. The Brazilian media super-valorize comments such as, ‘The civil war started and it will grow more and more!’ or, ‘We need the army to take care of this’, in order to give support to the government’s actions against the black population.</p>
<p>Black women’s invisible experiences as primary victims of the long-term consequences of urban violence in Rio de Janeiro unveil several fights black women need to face, which are hidden in the conventional analysis of violence. In recent years, some works have dedicated themselves to documenting the female experience with urban violence in Brazil (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0921374012452811">Araújo, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0921374012452811">Gay, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0921374012452811">Mães de Maio, n.d</xref>.; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0921374012452811">Soares et al., 2009</xref>). However, few works focus on the specificities of black women and their concerns about urban violence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0921374012452811">Reis, 2005</xref>). From the perspective of the black women who participated in my research, racism is crucial to the targeting of the victims of violence, even though not always verbalized.</p>
<p>The stories that Martha and Alda share are two examples of this. They are two sisters whose love, friendship and solidarity provide the strength they need to face the pain caused by the murders of their children. As they say, they are ‘the proof that lightning can strike twice in the same place’. Martha’s son was 18 when he was killed in 2000 in an ambush by debtors of the drug house he used to work for. Martha has never recovered his body:
<disp-quote>
<p>I fought hard for my son. He had no examples [leading to] this kind of life. I do not understand why he got into this. I took him out and he came back. Every time I left home for work, he escaped to that place, until the day he was no longer at home. I panicked when I heard of his death and panicked even more when I did not find his body. I’ve been looking for him everywhere. I went every place where there is a cemetery or a mortuary. I opened drawer by drawer [at the morgue] looking for my son. I always have the hope that one day he will arrive. If we do not see the body, right? The hope remains.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Alda says that she knows the exact point when the changes started in her life. ‘It was on the day that I suspected the involvement of my son in criminality’:
<disp-quote>
<p>My life changed a lot. I was worried; I could not sleep at night. This went on for a long time. I was going crazy. Every time I heard gunshots fired—I did not care, it could be any time of the day—I would enter the slum searching for him. The guys said that my son was working as a security guard. Have you ever seen that! My skinny son? Security? Mothers go through a lot of suffering out there, you know? Only we know what that pain is.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>After much persuasion, and escapes to the countryside of Rio de Janeiro trying to extract her son from his problems, Alda was able to take her son out of the drug business. He had been working at a supermarket for five years when he was murdered:
<disp-quote>
<p>My son was sleeping at home, took a shower and left. Soon the news arrived: ‘Your son is dead!’ What? How is that possible? How can this happen, people? My heart is still tight, and it will never go away. It is one thing that stands forever.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Martha and Alda say that, as mothers of young people who were involved in violent crime, mourning is something they were denied. Their sons’ deaths are being taken for granted, as inevitable occurences. Therefore, they are criticized for going through moments of depression or indignation in response to the deaths of their children. ‘He was involved [with drugs]. Okay, is that why I am not allowed to suffer? They look at me in the neighborhood, I know they blame me. I hear comments,’ says Martha. ‘Whether he was involved or not,’ Alda says, ‘he was my son. I fought for him. What family wants to have their child involved with drugs?’</p>
<p>Marilene is a black woman who became an activist after her daughter’s disappearance in 1990. Her daughter and 10 others were spending the weekend at a farm when six hooded men, allegedly police officers, kidnapped them. Because this occurred in the Baixada Fluminense region,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0921374012452811">5</xref></sup> which had a reputation for being an area where ‘extermination squads’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0921374012452811">6</xref></sup> are active, the case was immediately assumed to be connected to those groups. The kidnapped youth, because they were all black, were painted as criminals. The bodies were never found, and no one was ever arrested. Marilene overcame considerable obstacles to raise her daughter, Rosana, only to lose her at the age of 18:
<disp-quote>
<p>I was sure that Rosana would be the mother of my grandchildren. Unfortunately she did not have time for it. Because someone was found with the ability and right to do so. As a single black mother, I faced off against all of society. My mom thought I would not be able to raise my daughter by myself. I did not opt for abortion, and then someone comes and takes that daughter’s life away 18 years later. I did not face the world for this!</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>A major site of black women’s struggles to protect their offspring is the private (home) level. Insistent advising and counseling becomes the main expression of motherhood when their sons and daughters reach adolescence. Through the stories that several black women shared with me, I identified three recurrent threads of advice that these mothers give to their children, which serve as rules black youth need follow in order to avoid problems on the streets. They are: 1) to fear both the police and drug dealers; 2) to carry proper identification; and 3) to be properly dressed.</p>
<p>The first rule indicates that stereotypes, such as the presumption that black youth are always the main agents of violence and crime, result in actions that provoke the immediate elimination of the black youth. Because of this, Dona De advises, ‘They need to fear both the police and the drug trafficking. One recruits them to enjoy criminality, and the other, if the guy is black, will shoot first, and then they will ask who he was.’ The second rule explains the necessity for black youth to carry proper identification with them at all times. Maria clarifies, ‘A student ID or documents from work, those are not necessarily a safe pass, as they were in the past, but nowadays it can be at least, <italic>at least</italic>, a way to find my son [if he’s hurt or arrested]. Every time my son leaves the house I ask if he is taking an ID with him’ (original emphasis). The stress and the repetition of ‘at least’ in Maria’s words reinforce not only the precarious and dangerous situation black youth face in Rio de Janeiro, but also the fear black mothers feel as parents of the potential victims of murder and kidnapping. Finally, the third rule indicates that, if blackness informs the <italic>modus operandi</italic> of the police in its interactions with the black population, black youth can avoid ill treatment from the police by valorizing blackness through ‘dressing properly’. Dona Hilda explains this rule:
<disp-quote>
<p>[The youth] need to avoid calling the attention of the police by [instead] dressing in accordance with the ‘normal,’ ‘the acceptable.’ Unfortunately our children cannot simply wear what they want.

<p>Based on these narratives, I argue that an analysis of the Brazilian reality that embraces the black people’s perspective needs to have three axes: 1) a critical understanding of the dilemmas of modernization and development in Brazil through an intersectional analysis of class, gender, age, and race; 2) a consideration of the historical role of the state in implementing policies that have disproportionately affected black people and poor communities, and which have concentrated violence and trauma in those communities; and 3) an inclusion of the Afro-diasporic perspective within this analysis.</p>
<p>The ideology of modernization and development in Brazil has not included the black population as an organic beneficiary of the process. On the contrary, black people have been seen as a hurdle on Brazil’s path to modernity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0921374012452811">Holanda, 1956</xref>). As a consequence of Brazilian racial ideology, which categorizes black people as inferior, naturally dangerous, and inclined to crime (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0921374012452811">Rodrigues, 1938</xref>), this population and its dwelling places have always been seen as sites of intervention and control. Furthermore, their neighborhoods, historically quilombos, cortiços, and now favelas, have continuously been qualified as harmful to society, and as such have been targets for the state’s security apparatus. According to geographer <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0921374012452811">Andrelino Campos (2005)</xref>, the quilombos were transmuted into <italic>favelas</italic>, and the production of these spaces as criminalized areas is due to the stigmatization of their residents, the majority of whom are blacks.</p>
<p>In this sense, the creation of the royal guard in 1809 marks the first institutionalization of the continued presence of the military in black people’s lives in Brazil. This force was created to protect the colonial Portuguese royal court from the masses of black slaves who occupied Rio de Janeiro at the time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0921374012452811">Batista, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0921374012452811">PMERJ, n.d</xref>.). According to historian <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0921374012452811">Thomas Holloway (1993</xref>: 282), ‘an important reason for establishing the police was to supplement the coercive discipline slave owners traditionally supplied, given the difficulties of maintaining vigilance over slaves in an increasingly complex and impersonal urban environment’. The state, through the police, worked to maintain the economic interests of the elite. Toward that end, brutal methods of punishment were applied. Holloway states that, ‘in Rio de Janeiro, physical injury continued to be part of an arsenal of techniques used to keep the behavior of the population within bounds and to instill fear’ (282). This violence ranged from forced marching with a heavy pack to beating suspects on the street until their skin began to peel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0921374012452811">Holloway, 1993</xref>: 67).</p>
<p>In modern Rio de Janeiro, the legacy of the royal guard continues to affect the descendants of those enslaved Africans. Renewed and more advanced terror techniques are now employed, such as live television broadcasts of the police shooting young black people from helicopters, as seen during the police occupation of the <italic>Complexo do Alemão</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0921374012452811">Bastos, 2010</xref>). As in other mega-cities like São Paulo, the municipal state authorities in Rio have made use of ‘necropower’ to control the population and to produce segregated black urban spaces (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0921374012452811">Amparo Alves, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0921374012452811">Rocha, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0921374012452811">Vargas, 2003</xref>). This reality of anti-black modernization and violence can be better understood if we take a larger frame of interpretation into consideration.</p>
<p>The incorporation of a theoretical approach to racial formation<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0921374012452811">7</xref></sup> is crucial if we are to challenge the ways that violence has traditionally been studied in Brazil. Currently, urban violence scholarship in Brazil has minimized Afro-Brazilians’ everyday encounters with violence by giving preference to a Marxist class-based analysis. This analysis insists upon explaining violence and social inequalities from a perspective that undermines racial hierarchies and state racial terror (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0921374012452811">Caldeira, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0921374012452811">Ramos, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0921374012452811">Zaluar, 1994</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0921374012452811">1999</xref>). By privileging class as the organizing principle of urban violence, most literature on violence has silenced the role played by space, gender, class, age, and race in the production of violent death in the urban setting. Racial formation theory, however, allows us to pursue a more integrated analysis of violence and social inequality in Brazil through a counter-hegemonic understanding of the role of race and racism, in order to challenge the dominant discourse of Brazilian racial democracy.</p>

<title>‘I have nothing to lose’, or, black women’s reactions to urban violence</title>

<p>In Rio de Janeiro, black women are connected to violence in many different ways. They are blamed by the elites and by the government for ‘giving birth to delinquents’, their bodies are controlled by the government, the police, and drug dealers. They are involved in petty crime and forced by men to hide weapons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0921374012452811">Amnesty International, 2008</xref>). However, black women’s victimization needs to be addressed alongside their resilience and agency. They are immersed in a web of forces that shape their consciousness and impel their activism. Diaspora theorist <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0921374012452811">Ruth Simms Hamilton (1995)</xref> gives testament to this agency:
<disp-quote>
<p>. . . [w]hile there is little doubt that people of African descent have been objects of oppressive social, political, and economic structures, the complete picture requires an understanding of this population as subjects of their history . . . Thus Black people are not mere products of the interaction between these conditions, but products of the interaction between these conditions and experiences and efforts to develop their own sense of what they are and what they want to be, to deal with life in particular ways and to live life as they transform life. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0921374012452811">1995</xref>: 403)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>This passage, from Hamilton’s <italic>Conceptualizing the African Diaspora</italic>, is central to my theorization of black women’s experiences with violence. It allows me to understand that the suffering that comes from oppression impels them to react. Oppressions inform their political action as agents of their own history. As Hamilton affirms, ‘people are reactors and creators of their own mechanism of survival’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0921374012452811">1995</xref>: 403). In a context of suffering, longing, and also activism, black women find in their leadership and political practice a space for action and reaction at home, in their families, in the community, and in the public arena.</p>
<p>The courage and strength exhibited by many mothers whose children have been murdered, especially those whose children were victims of violence committed by the state, is remarkable. Advised by representatives of social movements and human rights organizations, many women strive to condemn the perpetrators of the violence committed against their families. The Brazilian judiciary system, however, is one of the major roadblocks the families have to face. In my fieldwork research, I have been able to accompany families in trials for crimes that involve lethal violence, particularly those committed by the police.</p>
<p>Dealing with Brazil’s judicial system is a contrast to the life of the favelas. Black women who seek justice for crimes perpetrated against their family members must face off with the state in a giant building downtown, where people talk in specialized, incomprehensible jargon. In order to even reach this point, however, the women who participated in my research first mobilize networks of support that will help them agitate for their cases to be heard. When the trial begins, they use social networks and email lists to invite people to attend the proceedings. Then, every day throughout the trial, they give public talks in front of the court building and show pictures, posters and banners publicizing their cases. Finally, they mobilize the support of other mothers who are facing the same situation.</p>
<p>At the beginning of 2012, the first hearing was held in the case of the six agents who were accused of torturing Deize’s son. A ceremony was carried out in front of the court building in order to draw public attention to the abuses committed by state’s agents and demand justice in the case. For more than four hours, Deize talked about her son, her condition as a black women living in a favela, and how her life has changed since her son was murdered:
<disp-quote>
<p>The process of fighting for justice for my son is as painful as the pain of childbirth, except that today, the contractions will diminish only when this trial is over and I successfully say everything I know. I have no fear of retaliation or death for my fight. My greatest good, my son, they already took.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Before entering the court, Deize asked me and other collaborators who were there if we would stay until the end. For those who could stay she gave a t-shirt. On the front were pictures of her son, overlapping the flags of Rio and Brazil. On the back was a quote from Deize: ‘I lost my son, but not the will to fight.’ By distributing t-shirts emblazoned with her own words, she not only made her suffering visible, but she instilled herself and her strength in each person who was there, including myself. At the end of the court proceedings, Deize received congratulations from family members, activists, and friends. She put her hands on the image of her son printed on her t-shirt, and said, ‘I was strong for you, my son.’</p>

<title>‘It is good not feeling alone’, or, conclusion and reflections on research to/with black women</title>
<p>In summary, when black women are heard, different aspects of urban violence are addressed. Despite the horror, loss, and trauma present in their lives, their stories remind us of their agency, organization, and endurance. By exploring aspects of black women’s experiences of violence, specifically homicide, I suggest that the deaths of black males work as catalytic fuel in the experience of genocide in black women’s lives. Directing attention to their experience is important to African diaspora politics and theory.</p>
<p>Black feminist methodology reinforces that, as the most discriminated-against group, black women need to be at the center of any investigation. By studying violence, I admit that I occasionally found it difficult to ask questions that might make my collaborators cry or remember harmful and hurtful moments. At the same time, I witnessed their strength and willingness to talk about these topics. In the words of one of the women, the interview process helped her ‘to understand and alleviates day by day what happened’. Brazilian black feminism (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0921374012452811">Basthi, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0921374012452811">Carneiro and Santos, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0921374012452811">Werneck, 2001</xref>) reminds us that suffering is part of the process of developing the black woman’s consciousness. Therefore, in the same moment that I was suffering with them while hearing the stories, I was being empowered by my collaborators’ experiences, which makes me responsible for seeking change alongside them.</p>
<p>The use of life stories in my research highlights black women’s memories of their experiences with racism, sexism, and violence, and their participation in social movements. I understand interviewing and documenting life stories as a dialogical process, which empowers both ‘researcher’ and ‘subject’ in a process of ‘learn and teach’. It has been rewarding to hear from many women that their participation in my research is a source of strength for them. As Orchid said, ‘I never had the opportunity to think more and to analyze what happened in my life. It was a good opportunity. To talk about this was good to me. It is good not feeling alone. Very good.’</p>
<p>As a result of this experience, I argue that black women can be empowered through interviews to better understand their experiences, which can be beneficial to their struggles. In addition, I have found that the experience of participating in a focus group can be very empowering. For my collaborators, these groups were safe spaces to share all the anxiety and suffering they were harboring as a result of the deaths of their loved ones. In the focus group setting, they were able to share words of support, affection, and care for each other. The opportunity to share their suffering and strategies of survival with women who have the same background can help them in the process of healing and resilience.</p>
<p>Finally, conducting research is also a tool for building solidarity. The invitations I received to participate in events organized by my collaborators, and to visit their homes in the favela, are good examples of the movement-building potential of collaborative research. Because I introduced myself not only as a researcher, but also as an activist, it was possible to build a bridge between my work and their activism.</p>

The authors attempt to chart a middle course between two extremes.

The other extreme is a view that trivializes the category of race, arguing that, since it is a social construction, race will disappear if we simply ignore it.</p></fn>
