<p>The aim of Hanchao Lu’s book is not to provide a complete and exhaustive account of the Republic of China based on rigorous historical study, nor does Lu claim that it is. <italic>The Birth of a Republic</italic> centres primarily on the historical rendition of photographic documents produced by Francis Stafford, a professional photographer originally from Colorado, who lived in China from 1909 to 1915. As a senior photographer for the Commercial Press, Stafford took numerous pictures of key moments before, during, and after the Revolution. ‘Given the fact that the uprising in Wuchang was hasty and largely unplanned’, Lu emphasizes, ‘his photographs of the uprising could well be the only such collection that has survived to this day’ (pp. 7–8).</p>
<p>Stafford’s camera documents a nation undergoing a vertiginous rate of change. The Manchu court was making a final effort to cling onto survival by implementing a series of reforms that aimed to modernize its economy and military at the turn of the 20th century. However, the feudal Qing Empire, semi-colonized by European powers, failed even in sustaining its people’s basic livelihood. Stafford’s camera captures those faces stricken by extreme poverty – the rural refugees; urban beggars; and children on sale for adoption, slavery and prostitution. However, one can see that among the underprivileged majority a storm of revolution was brewing. Rebels were fanning revolutionary flame up and down the country. Some of them were captured, tortured, and decapitated, but more of them rose to insurgence.</p>
<p>In representing the battles between the Imperial Army and the Revolutionary Army, Stafford’s realist photos are not for the faint-hearted. Images of the Wuchang Uprising bring viewers to the horrific killing grounds and compel readers to witness the ghastly details of combat, Manchu cruelty, and the panoramic view of the destructive nature of the war. At the same time, Stafford’s camera captures the political chaos and conspiracies of post-Revolution China. As he travelled, his camera panned from the heartland of the Revolution in Wuchang to other tension-charged places such as Shanghai, Kunshan, Nanjing, and Beijing. In the fourth and the fifth chapters of the book, a soft news perspective is detectable. Stafford adopts a tourist narrative in recording the world at a moment when the socio-cultural landscape started to shift drastically. Such a vista included men having their pigtails cut off; women entering the labour force; children going to coeducational schools; and imperial <italic>Yamen</italic> (official residences) being deserted by their former occupants who were forced to leave. His camera is a device recording what is emerging and what is disappearing.</p>
<p>Hanchao Lu’s accompanying narration reveals the intricacies and contradictions of pre- and post-Revolution politics in China. Lu draws on his extensive historical and cultural knowledge of China, and the result is an accessible and lucid account of the drastic political changes following the Revolution. Lu’s narrative is not just concerned with the powerful, but also the domestic Chinese experience of the Revolution and its aftermath, bringing to the surface tensions regarding the acceptance of Republican ideals in China. These include the tensions between the politically naïve revolutionaries and those clinging onto the imperial legacy, such as the feudal warlord Yuan Shikai. The chapters illustrate how deeply the Republican ideal divided China. The Revolution itself raised other issues, such as how the outcome of the Revolution could be preserved; how the domestic battle against suppression would be fought; and most importantly, what the eventual move away from feudalism would entail for the future of the Republic in Chinese society. In so doing, Lu addresses socio-cultural changes concerning the battle for the hearts and minds of the Chinese people.</p>
<p><italic>The Birth of a Republic</italic> demonstrates how closely the work of photography is parallel to, and connected with, that of history. Without Francis Stafford’s photographic documents as a window onto the conflicts and social changes, a slice of time and space in Chinese history would be lost forever. The primacy of the photographic document provides readers with the authenticity of the visual, while the sociological interpretation of these images renders a sophisticated understanding of the social condition beyond what was captured via the lens. As an historian of East Asia who specializes in China’s socioeconomic history, Hanchao Lu is meticulous in blending his sociological narration with the visual in a seemingly effortless manner. With this in mind, <italic>The Birth of a Republic</italic> is an invaluable book for both a scholarly and general audience interested in Chinese history and politics as it offers a unique account of the Chinese domestic experience of embracing Republican ideals and how this experience altered Chinese societal and political values, both immediately and in the long term.</p>
