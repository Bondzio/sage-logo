<p>Women have played a hugely important role in the politics of Manipur, which is clearly the most conflict-affected state in the North-east today. The author’s study is therefore to be warmly welcomed. She deals with women’s contributions in the areas of socio-economic and political development in Manipur. It looks into the impact of processes such as modernisation, industrialisation, globalisation and science and technology in the context of women’s movements in the state. It also examines the issues of marginalisation of women, their values, rights, liberties, education and other related activities of women in the state in the national and global context drawing liberally on various official and non-official reports from the government and non-government agencies including the UN reports. Bimola Devi, in her Foreword, notes that women’s organisation as ‘pressure groups’ is a comparatively recent field of study. In Manipur, the history of women’s groups though not organised formally have acted as ‘pressure groups’ for a long time stretching back into the monarchical past. She explains their origin in the ‘Lallup’ system, by which every male member of the family had to work in the palace 10 days out of 40 and join the king in his frequent military campaigns. This made women familiar with the social, economic and political affairs of the state, which had an impact on their families. They became aware that womenfolk could act as a collective force to correct even wrong-doings in administrative and political affairs.</p>
<p>The author has examined the working and role of women’s organisations in different communities of the state such as the Meiteis, the Nagas, the Kukis and Meitei Pangals (Muslims) especially during the period after the state’s integration with India in 1949. The book is divided into six chapters. In the first chapter the author stresses the importance of women’s associations as ‘pressure groups’ in the socio-economic and political context of Manipur today. The increasing discontents of the women and the general public in a variety of areas in social life are articulated through ‘pressure groups’ and their activities, which the author views as a positive feature of democracy. These make democracy in an underdeveloped society more functional. This chapter also explains the objectives and methodology of the study, reviews the literature and highlights its importance. The second chapter is a theoretical discourse on the meaning and role of ‘pressure groups’ in society. Such ‘pressure groups’ arise in a democratic society with particular interests, aims and aspirations to exercise pressure to advance their interests. They are thus relevant and important in a democracy. The third chapter deals with women’s organisations and ‘pressure groups’ especially in Manipur. In spite of gender inequality and patriarchy, Manipuri women are contributing to social change in the state. The author deals with the First Nupi Lal (‘first women’s war’) of 1904 and the second Nupi Lal (‘second women’s war’) of 1939–40. The first Nupi Lal 1904 was a protest by women against the ruling of Political Agent Maxwell that the Meitei men should rebuild colonial bungalows destroyed by arson. The activism of the Meitei women forced Maxwell to rescind his order and reach a compromise. Protests about the control of the rice harvest began in the 1920s. These culminated in the ‘second Nupi Lal’.</p>
<p>The agitation began in 1939 at the huge market of over 6,000 women in the capital Imphal. The British officials were never successful in imposing order on the market. Manipuri women were seen by the British as very independent and prone to take direct action to get their way.</p>
<p>The Second Nupilal of 1939–40 was a watershed in Manipur’s politics. It began as a mass protest against the economic exploitation of the rice supply by Marwari traders, who were aided and abetted by a corrupt king. It developed into a catalyst for the movement for democratic reform, providing a popular platform underpinning the political activism of the elites which overthrew the feudal regime. It witnessed the emergence of Hijam Irabot Singh, the radical social reformer. The ‘second women’s war’ succeeded in opening up to public debate issues which had previously been the concern only of the small emergent political elite, the incompetence, nepotism and corruption of the rule of Maharajah Chura Chand and the need for constitutional reforms. The British had noted the high social and economic status of women in Meitei society. Despite the dominance of Hinduism in the plains, Meitei women suffered none of the humiliating oppression of their sisters elsewhere. Women controlled the food supplies and the market and were a dominant economic force. From early British days they had shown themselves organised enough to take mass action.</p>
<p>Chapter IV deals with women’s organisations and movements after Manipur’s integration with India in 1949. After 1950, women started working within the framework of formal organisational structures and sometimes with other frontal organisations. In the 1980s, the law and order situation became critical in Manipur. Heavy combing operations against militants made for civic unrest on a wide scale. After a militant attack on a CRPF camp in Patsoi Khunnou bazaar, there was a combing operation, which resulted in harassment of innocent citizens. Women were raped and one woman who was hiding in the paddy store with her child was killed. All the people in the area including women were made to stand in the sun for long without food. Women’s activism came to the fore and they started guarding the locality from the armed forces of the state. Such activist women have come to be known as ‘Meira paibis’ (‘women torchbearers’). This is a movement which still continues taking up social issues. The author notes the ripple effect of peripheral social movements. She notes women’s naked protest in front of the Assam Rifles headquarters in protest against the soldiers’ rape and murder of Thangjam Manorama Devi in 2004. She also notes the indefinite fast demanding the repeal of the Armed Forces (Special Powers) Act, 1958 (AFSPA) undertaken by Irom Sharmila Chanu who has drawn worldwide attention.</p>
<p>In Chapter V, the author begins by noting that while the formal structures of power consisting of the judiciary, executive and legislative have failed to empower women, the third structure of power consisting of unofficial ‘pressure groups’ are coming into their own. Democratic liberalisation too, she boldly asserts, has not led to any liberation for women because of the ‘dominant patriarchal philosophy, the archaic traditions of the past, the obsolete middle class morals, false consciousness of liberation and the tight noose of modernism, fusionism and consumerism’. So far not more than three women have been elected to the state legislative assembly in Manipur all of them wives of top politicians! On the other hand one witnesses the active role of women in informal organisations such as the ‘Meira Paibis’. Democratic decentralisation in the form of elected Panchayati Raj Institutions (PRIs), as a result of which more than a million women have entered local politics, may be a way forward. But district councils under the Sixth Schedule of the Constitution in the hill areas of Manipur have not yet come into existence and the states of Nagaland, Mizoram and Meghalaya, remain out of the purview of the 73rd amendment of the Constitution.</p>
<p>The author movingly states that though much has been written about women’s contributions, such writings have actually failed to deepen our understanding of the needs and deprivations of women. Women’s movements therefore have to save women from further marginalisation and provide empowerment for women’s achievement of self-respect, equity and equality.</p>
<p>The final chapter calls for the political empowerment of women to pass appropriate legislations for enhancing women’s participation. After reading this brilliant work one is left in admiration of the author’s courage clarity and commitment to the cause of women’s welfare and development. The book is not just an academic treatise but an activist document coming out of the turmoil that affects Manipur today. One is compelled to wish best of luck for the author in her future endeavours both academic and activist so that the brave women of Manipur are able to enjoy their rightful position in society. The book is very well produced with an attractive cover page.</p>
