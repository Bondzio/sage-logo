<sec id="sec1-0265691411428783a"><title>Henrice Altink and Sharif Gemie, eds, <italic>At the Border: Margins and Peripheries in Modern France</italic>, University of Wales Press: Cardiff, 2008; xvi + 199 pp.; 9780708320761, £85.00 (hbk)</title>
<p>This edited volume is a collection of papers presented at a conference with the same title, held at the University of Glamorgan in 2002. While its title suggests that the conceptual links between the border, margin and periphery might receive some further elaboration, the recurring argument running through several chapters is actually one of the necessary distinction between external and internal borders, between state borders and various kinds of immaterial, invisible boundaries.</p>
<p>In the Introduction, the editors provide a brief survey of the field of border studies, followed by an overview of the development of the notion of the border in Europe, from the Roman Empire to medieval and early modern Europe to the age of nationalism, and, finally, the postmodern era. In the discussion of the development of the field of various disciplines, the prominent and innovative contribution of anthropology is duly recognized. The editors also convincingly argue (against Donnan and Wilson who are among the leading representatives of the anthropology of borders) in favour of studying state borders together with other kinds of frontiers and boundaries, material and symbolic, visible and invisible, less and more metaphoric. The evaluation of the contribution to the field by historians, geographers, political scientists and sociologists is equally balanced.</p>
<p>The contributors to the volume, however, are virtually all historians and French studies scholars. In contrast to the editors, they seem uninformed about, or indifferent to, developments in border studies more generally. Some contributions fail to engage at all with the topic of the volume while a few only pay lip service to it. The second section of the volume (out of three), entitled ‘Between the Centre and the Margin: The French Regions’ and consisting of three chapters, comes closest to the overall theme. These chapters deal with topics such as traces and reminders of a former French-German border in Lorraine (by Didier Francfort) or the remembrance practices of Spanish exiles in the Southwest of France (Scott Soo). The last chapter in the section (by Laure Teulières) on boundaries between (mostly Spanish and Italian) immigrants and locals in the Midi of the 1920s contains a particularly sophisticated approach to the topic of invisible borders. It is also the only one in the volume that pays attention to the context of regionalism (Occitanian in this case).</p>
<p>Another two sections hardly make a contribution to border studies. The third section (‘The Margins Within’) presents chapters by Cathérine Levy, Dawn Marley and Judith Broadbridge, and Owen Heathcote, dealing with various aspects of social marginalization and discrimination of Maghrebian communities in France, as well as with representations of (self-)oppression in French gay literature. Each of these chapters may represent a valuable contribution to other scholarly fields. They do not, however, deal in any substance with social boundaries or ‘border crossing’ (sexual transgressism) and do not try to connect them to a more general thinking about borders. They thus lend little support to the editors’ claim that ‘literal’ borders’ should be studied together with ‘metaphoric’ ones. Contrary to the third section, the first section (‘France’s Geographic Borders’) focuses on the French state and its position in the process of Europeanization and globalization, but also on the making of the French–German border (chapters by Alistair Cole, François Roth and Marianne Durand).</p>
<p>Studying borderlands implies studying the borderland on both sides. This perspective remains virtually unexplored in this volume in which the only subject shared by all contributors – specialists on France – seems to be ‘France’. While this ‘France’ remains unquestioned from an ‘across the border’ perspective, its unity is nevertheless problematized throughout the volume. Asserting the eternal unity of France and the naturalness of its borders, the French republicanist discourse has always repudiated the idea of internal boundaries. It is by opposing this idea of a unity, enclosed within a naturalized state border, that the bulk of contributors emphasize the importance of considering all these internal – invisible, cultural, symbolic, social – borders and boundaries. One can only regret that the contributors (with the obvious exemption of the editors) did not make an effort to distinguish conceptually between these notions that are anything but synonymous. Ironically (since most contributors are French scholars), there is a rich and theoretically sophisticated tradition of studying cultural frontiers not only in French ethnology and human geography, but also in historiography. It is true that the approach of culture a-realization (with ethnocartography as its ‘by-product’), which has produced the most complex and sophisticated concept of cultural frontiers so far, is marginalized in today’s Anglophone anthropology. But this tradition creatively survives in France. (A recent achievement in the field is Christian Bromberger and Alain Morel, eds., <italic>Limites floues, frontières vives: Des variations culturelles en France et en Europe</italic>, Paris, 2001.) Ignoring this valuable scholarship, which has revealed a great deal about French regional diversity, means underestimating the importance of regional variability. How can one study French internal frontiers without considering regional variety and the regional imagination of cultural or invisible boundaries? The volume clearly reveals an effort towards envisaging France from the perspective of border studies, but it leaves us asking for more.</p>
