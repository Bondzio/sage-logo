<p>Behind the recent discussions within Marxist IR theory concerning political multiplicity and uneven and combined development lies the larger, still unresolved, question of Marxism’s relation to Realism. Marxism in IR has never sufficiently recognized the seriousness of the challenge that the Realist conceptions of the intrinsic nature of the political and, therefore, of the international present to any Marxist ambition of human freedom. A review of the major approaches within IR Marxism shows that the question of the political remains a theoretical blind spot. Hence, they cannot convincingly grasp geopolitics and the international without falling prey to Realist essentializing. This theoretical deficit within IR Marxism is traceable back to the ambivalence of Marx’s own thinking concerning revolutionary social change. If it is to escape the Realist fate, Marxism in IR must engage with the central categories of political thought to produce a critical theory of the political.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The recent <italic>Cambridge Review of International Affairs</italic> (CRIA) debates<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1354066111416021">1</xref></sup> among Marxist scholars concerning the relationship between capitalism and the states system — the so-called many states problem — and the theoretical status of the rubric ‘uneven and combined development’ represent, in important respects, the frustrated end point of Marxism’s protracted and oblique entry into the discipline of International Relations. For what is ultimately at issue in these controversies, and remains unresolved, is the nature of the relationship between Marxist thinking and Realism, the core theory of the discipline. Behind the various contributions, the question remains: how can theory that draws on Marx actually grasp geopolitics, and beyond that the problematic of ‘the international’, without succumbing to Realist essentializing?<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1354066111416021">2</xref></sup> This article attempts to situate the current impasse in Marxist IR theory and to identify the conceptual problem that underlies it. It argues that while the <italic>CRIA</italic> debates have served to focus the issue of Marxism’s relation to Realism, no resolution has been reached because the seriousness of the challenge presented by Realist thought to Marxism has not been clearly acknowledged and, crucially, because Marxist thinking has failed to develop any adequate critical theory of the political, a long-standing deficiency that remains profoundly debilitating for Marxist theory in IR. The first part of the article briefly sketches the peculiar trajectory of Marxism in IR that has led to the <italic>CRIA</italic> debates; the second section sets out the particular problem that Realism poses for Marxist thought; in this light, the third section then examines the major theoretical tendencies of IR Marxism to show that the absence of a developed theorization of the political leads to an incapacity to meet the challenge presented by Realism; and the final section argues that the continuing shortcoming of Marxist theory concerning the political can be traced back to the ambiguities of Marx’s own thought. If the argument developed here is correct, it implies the necessity of a different research interest from that currently dominant within Marxist IR, and the article concludes by proposing such an alternative: a sustained critical engagement with the central categories of political theory.</p>

<title>Marxism and IR</title>
<p>The intrinsic globalizing dynamics of capital, identified by Marx as early as the <italic>Communist Manifesto</italic>, lent to Marxist thought, from the beginning, a perspective beyond that of the single society, a view of the whole, and led to socialist and communist political agitation and activity being self-consciously ‘international’ in their intentions even in the 19th century. As such, ‘Marxist thought on international relations pre-dates its [i.e. IR’s] formal establishment as an institutionalized field of study’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1354066111416021">Teschke, 2008</xref>: 163). The founders of historical materialism wrote extensively on contemporaneous world events, but their interest was largely one of analysing the tendency of those developments in order to assess the possibilities of revolutionary political action. International relations presented a practical problem rather than a theoretical one: the contradiction between the national and the international was registered empirically but not penetrated by theory.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-1354066111416021">3</xref></sup> This deficiency was not corrected in the Classical Marxist theories of imperialism developed in the early 20th century. Certainly, as the 19th-century expectation of socialist revolution in Western Europe was confounded and capitalist development reached further into the periphery and the non-capitalist world, imperialism theory, in comparison with the international thought of Marx and Engels, constituted a sustained attempt to link theoretically the dynamics of international politics to the changing structure of capital accumulation — the theorization of imperialism as part of the dynamic of monopoly capitalism. Further, the Marxist theories of imperialism, in expectation of the imminence of revolution, pioneered analysis of events in terms of epoch and conjuncture, a mode of thought that, even long after the impetus of Marxism as a political movement was exhausted, has continued to be enormously influential in Marxist thought, eliding, in the specifically IR context, with conventional historiography and historical sociology. But, while imperialism theory had a consciously international context, still the orthodox tradition of Marxism at no stage posed the existence of political multiplicity and, correlatively, the delimited form of the political as themselves worthy of, or demanding, theoretical reflection.</p>
<p>This deficiency continues to hobble Marxism in IR. With the vertiginous onset of globalization at the beginning of the 1990s, followed by the turn to a self-declaredly militarized foreign policy by the leading capitalist power and the eruption of the world financial crisis in 2007–8, the continued relevance of the traditions of Marxist thought after the polarizations of the Cold War and its eclipse as radical theory in the 1980s has sometimes been enthusiastically proclaimed:<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-1354066111416021">4</xref></sup> the <italic>Communist Manifesto</italic> hailed as announcing globalization <italic>avant la lettre</italic> and the foreign policy stance of the Bush administration evidencing, once again, the perennial necessity of imperialist rivalry to the dynamics of capitalism. However, Marxism’s engagement with other theoretical positions in IR during the same period revealed that the matter was more complex than a straightforward reaffirmation of traditional Marxist categories might suggest. The Marxist critique of globalization was to the effect that, far from announcing a new dawn of global integration, overcoming inter-state rivalry through the networks of civil society, promoting human rights and liberal governance, the phenomenon was best explicated as the latest round of the intrinsically expansionary dynamics of the capitalist accumulation process, with all the unevenness and contradictions that that necessarily entailed, and that, conjuncturally, the precipitate end of the Cold War unleashed in the early 1990s forces of capitalist integration on a global scale that had been accumulating for at least 20 years.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-1354066111416021">5</xref></sup> To a significant extent, the Marxist account was aligned with the narrower Realist critique of liberal internationalism in the 1990s, which doubted whether the new era had surpassed inter-state rivalry, that is, had radically transformed the nature of international politics.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-1354066111416021">6</xref></sup> At the turn of the millennium, the stridently aggressive foreign policy posture of the Bush administration provoked on the Marxist left a revival of the old theories of imperialism (never absent from the mainstream of Marxist discourse but here given a shot in the arm), updated to apply to the new global situation but recognizably indebted to the Classical Marxist legacy. However, where the critique of globalization had indicated common ground with Realism and its ‘sometimes splendid demolitions of liberal ideology’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1354066111416021">Callinicos and Rosenberg, 2008</xref>: 96), the arguments of the thinkers of the so-called New Imperialism reveal the cost of any such accommodation. For, where Lenin and the other early 20th-century thinkers of imperialism had needed geopolitical conflict as an integral part of the theory because competition between the major capitalist powers provided the opportunity, the space, for revolution in the semi-periphery (hence the opposition to Karl Kautsky’s theory of ultra-imperialism), a century later the inevitability of geopolitical rivalry had been definitively subsumed to the Realist tradition in international thought. If the economic reductionism of the old Leninism could not be maintained, what was to be the status of geopolitics within any updated concept of imperialism? This issue has coalesced with the investigation within Marxist historical sociology of the specifically international dimension of the process of capitalist development, the importance within the expansionary dynamic of capitalism of the fractured, multiple nature of global political space, to form the question, as posed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1354066111416021">Alex Callinicos (2007)</xref>: ‘Does capitalism need the state system?’</p>
<p>Cleaving to the theory of imperialism yet desiring to avoid its hard economism, Callinicos proposes<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-1354066111416021">7</xref></sup> a conception of ‘capitalist imperialism as constituted by the intersection of, respectively, capitalist and territorial logics of power and economic and geopolitical competition’ (Callinicos and Rosenberg, 2007: 539); in this way, the states system, geopolitics, is to be incorporated non-deductively into the broader theory of capital, as an independent determination to be introduced as one moves from Marx’s abstract theorization by degrees closer to reality. The relation between the two logics is apparently to be conceived of as contradictory and dialectical rather than functionally one-sided.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-1354066111416021">8</xref></sup> ‘One implication of this’, as Callinicos admits, ‘is that there is, necessarily, a realist moment in any Marxist analysis of international relations and conjunctures’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1354066111416021">2007</xref>: 542). At a simple analytical level this is, perhaps, reasonable enough: geopolitical considerations do indeed form part of international politics and ought therefore to find a place within any causal account. Beyond that, however, all the important questions remain unanswered. For Callinicos purports simultaneously to incorporate geopolitics into a theory of capitalism and to leave it as an autonomous element. Gonzalo Pozo-Martin is quick to see the problem: ‘if the territorial logic of competition is autonomous, does it follow that we must relinquish an attempt to explain its determinations from the perspective of historical materialism?’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1354066111416021">2007</xref>: 554).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-1354066111416021">9</xref></sup> Allowing a ‘Realist moment’ immediately reopens the painful theoretical gap that Callinicos was otherwise trying to close, for it leaves the ‘territorial logic’, geopolitics, as itself something simply posited and underived: the theory of capital is supposed to explain why there is a capitalist logic of competition, but what is to explain why there is a territorial logic? In truth, the New Imperialism has done little to remedy the deficiencies of the older theory regarding the relation between capitalism and the states system. Where the earlier theory, along with its economic reductionism, ‘took the nation state as a social relation in its plural manifestations — the states system — as given, failing to problematize, much less theorize, the fact that nation states were “relevant units” in the world economy’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1354066111416021">Teschke, 2008</xref>: 169), the new one, in flight from economism, replaces this failure with a hypostasization of the territorial logic that the states system is said to articulate. The New Imperialism, like the old, simply assumes the political, <italic>qua</italic> territoriality — the very problem that Realism poses to Marxist theory. Nonetheless, the debate over the New Imperialism has served to suggest the specific tension between Marxism and Realism: Pozo-Martin’s doubt about Callinicos’s Realist moment, about whether Marxism can in any way afford an accommodation with Realism senses without developing the fact that Realism, pre-eminent theory of the geopolitical, presents a problem for Marxist thought, one that is more far-reaching than the latter has been willing to admit.</p>

<title>The challenge of Realism</title>
<p>What is it that underlies the meditations on the intransigence of international conflict in Realist thought? As Justin Rosenberg, whose views on the depth of Realism have changed over the years, observes with regard to the relative philosophical resources of liberalism and Realism in IR, ‘in International Theory, I think it would be truer to say that it is liberalism which is intrinsically shallow, and Realism which, for all its problems, is connected to a circumstance of profound significance’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1354066111416021">Callinicos and Rosenberg, 2008</xref>: 96). That circumstance is the fact of ‘inter-societal coexistence’, the ‘political fragmentation’ of humanity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1354066111416021">Callinicos and Rosenberg, 2008</xref>: 96). This kernel of Realist thought is set out axiomatically by Robert Gilpin.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-1354066111416021">10</xref></sup> Three assumptions underlie the Realist view of political life:<disp-quote>
<p>The first is the essentially conflictual nature of international affairs.… The second … is that the essence of social reality is the group … in a world of scarce resources and conflict over the distribution of those resources, human beings confront one another ultimately as members of groups, and not as isolated individuals. <italic>Homo sapiens</italic> is a tribal species, and loyalty to the tribe for most of us ranks above all loyalties other than that of the family. In the modern world, we have given the name ‘nation-state’ to these competing tribes and the name ‘nationalism’ to this form of loyalty. True, the name, size, and organization of the competing groups into which our species subdivides itself do alter over time — tribes, city-states, kingdoms, empires, and nation-states — due to economic, demographic and technological changes. Regrettably, however, the essential nature of intergroup conflict does not. The third assumption that I believe characterizes realist thinking is the primacy in all political life of power and security in human motivation. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1354066111416021">Gilpin, 1986</xref>: 304–305)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Realism in IR is based upon a strong claim about the nature of political existence: that mankind, as πολιτικον ζωον, has always been divided into, or organized itself into, communities, of one sort or another, that are inherently limited and particularistic, creating group identities — insiders and outsiders, friends and enemies, countrymen and foreigners. Whatever the multitude of economic, cultural and other interactions between societies, of incalculable number in the present but doubtless existent in some measure as far back as ethnology and archaeology can trace, the boundary, what in the course of development hardened into the political boundary, has not been effaced. The inside, the space of politics, may be the arena in which the pursuit of the good life is made possible, but the character of its constitution is such that externally it always remains within the state of nature, the domain of sheer survival. What Realism thus perceives with unequalled clarity is that the form of the political simultaneously creates internal unity and external division. So, as the Realists can easily concede, the configurations of the political, the modes of organization of the inner space, may undergo immense historical change, from at least the ancient <italic>polis</italic> through to the modern nation-state, as do, with it, the dynamics of international relations in particular eras, but the <italic>condition</italic> of the international, the global political being of humanity, does not change, remaining always fractured and prone to conflict. It is from this circumstance of fragmentation, of multiple particularist political communities, with borders (whether formally defined or not) creating divisions of inside and outside, always interacting but always potentially hostile, that Realism deduces the inevitable periodic recurrence of war and derives the invariant abstraction of geopolitics.</p>
<p>The implications of the circumstance of inter-societal coexistence for Marxist theorizing, especially in IR, are substantial, and have been most extensively, if idiosyncratically, set out in a too little noted article by R.N. Berki from 1971. Berki opens with the assertion that ‘the very existence of international relations poses a serious, and perhaps intractable, <italic>problem</italic> for Marxism’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1354066111416021">1971</xref>: 80; emphasis in original) because ‘international relations presuppose the horizontal division of mankind into nations or states, and since Marxian thought postulates the absolute unity of mankind as its ideal, problems relating to horizontal group diversity are much more centrally relevant to the Marxian doctrine than it is usually thought’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-1354066111416021">11</xref></sup> In a summary overview, Berki observes that, in ‘conventional Marxism’, ‘classes …, and not nations or states, are the basic units of history, and the struggle between classes, instead of interstate conflict, occupies the center of attention’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1354066111416021">1971</xref>: 81). In this view, the state, an apparatus of political domination, is a product of class conflict, organized to maintain the system of exploitation internally, and externally to facilitate the overseas expansion of the bourgeois class. Competition for markets among a globally self-divided bourgeoisie generates recurrent (though not constant) inter-state war. Correspondingly, the proletariat, having a unity of interest in overthrowing bourgeois society, is essentially a nationless class. However, Berki then turns to Waltz’s <italic>Man, the State and War</italic> to expose a problem with this line of thinking. In his explication of the second image, Waltz had surveyed the development of socialist and Marxist thinking on international issues up to the outbreak of World War I and drawn the conclusion that the argument that peace can be achieved through the internal perfection of states is faulty. Berki comments, ‘Waltz’s question is legitimate: “Is it capitalism or states that must be destroyed in order to get peace, or must both be abolished?” The distinction between these two phases, or tasks, is certainly warranted in point of theory’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1354066111416021">1971</xref>: 84). Elaborating, he observes that:<disp-quote>
<p>The problem … is whether the disappearance of the ‘state’ after the overthrow of capitalism refers only to its internal character as an agency maintaining oppression and exploitation of one class by another … or also to its external function, which can be defined as organizing and promoting the interests of a group of people distinguished by their permanent occupation of a certain geographical area. It does not matter, of course, whether now one calls it ‘state’, ‘nation’, or ‘community’, or the ‘administration of things’ … as long as what is meant is a plurality of these units. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1354066111416021">1971</xref>: 84)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Berki notes that Marx and Engels, in their practical political thinking, were sometimes enthusiastic in their support of national independence and separateness (as, for example, in relation to Ireland and Poland) and he traces the historical phases (or traumas) in the 20th century through which Marxist theorists and political figures professing an adherence to Marxism gradually not only came to terms with political diversity, the separateness of nations, but embraced it, so that ‘the tendency is to afford more and more implicit recognition to the ideal of a non-antagonistic world community consisting of separate national units’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1354066111416021">1971</xref>: 92). Such an accommodation with political realism, with the seeming givenness of national diversities, might appear simply to be a normal development as the doctrine grapples with recalcitrant reality. However, Berki goes further and asks: ‘can Marxism afford this compromise? Does it make any sense in terms of Marxian thought, to talk about non-antagonistic diversity? Can Marxism at all entertain the idea of liberated but separate nations living peacefully side by side, without thereby losing its coherence?’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1354066111416021">1971</xref>: 86). It is not necessary to concur with all aspects of Berki’s reading of Marx’s early works to see the force of the argument, which is that it is not possible to reconcile Marx’s idea of a condition of universal human freedom with nations, understood not simply as the modern nation-state but, more broadly, as particularist political communities that form divisions of inside and outside, and claim a right over a territorial area and the resources contained therein. For it inevitably produces a disabling fragmentation of any possible universalism, when each ‘nation’ claims exclusive possession of an area of territory. In such circumstances, it is difficult to know what non-antagonistic diversity might mean in a developed world of all-round interconnection because ‘the point is that nations <italic>cannot help but be</italic> self-regarding, as long as their position is that of owners of property in a wider community characterized by economic interdependence’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1354066111416021">Berki, 1971</xref>: 103; emphasis in original).</p>
<p>Berki’s account suggests the difficulty that Waltz’s second image argument, if correct, poses for Marxism: that the particularist, inside/outside character of political communities means that they are always unreconciled, at least potentially antagonistic, that among those communities internal politics may be hierarchic and ordered in a great variety of ways, but international politics is always essentially anarchic. It is here that the real and continuing power of Realism lies, as Justin Rosenberg has recently argued at some length. Piqued by Alex Callinicos’s dismissal of Realism as impoverished in comparison with the richness of the tradition of liberal thought (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1354066111416021">Callinicos and Rosenberg, 2008</xref>: 83), Rosenberg, in a sense <italic>malgré lui-même</italic>, rises to a defence of the profundity of Realism in its grasp of the seemingly intractable dilemmas of international coexistence. While ‘the substantive political analyses of neo-Realist writers [are] disablingly thin’, the relationship between Realism and liberalism ‘is somehow more complex — and more paradoxical — than any simple contrast of “rich” and “thin” implies’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1354066111416021">Rosenberg, 2008</xref>: 96). The status of Realism within IR arises from the fact that ‘there is a real sense in which liberalism (and actually most Marxist thought) is not, and does not possess, an international theory’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1354066111416021">Rosenberg, 2008</xref>: 96); that is, it is only Realism that has attended with the necessary seriousness to the central premise of International Relations as a discipline: geopolitical fragmentation, and its consequences. From this fact of fragmentation Realism derives its normative resources and its ethical stance: ‘an ontological critique of easy, self-serving universalisms; a highly developed moral and practical sense of the tension between ends and means; and a genuinely tragic appreciation of the anarchically inscribed conflict of particularist (national) and common (international) interests’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1354066111416021">Rosenberg, 2008</xref>: 97). Problems of political life that, however problematically, are in some degree resolved in the inner space of domestic political community, are reopened in the international domain: internally ‘legitimate’ violence appearing externally as threatening military potential and the instability endemic to managing the relations of sovereign entities in an anarchic field unmediated by superordinate authority. What Realism grasps is that these problems of the ‘ethical irrationality’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1354066111416021">Rosenberg, 2008</xref>: 98) of the world assume their most intractable form in international relations because there is no higher level at which they can be resolved: the nature of the political is such that the rationality and order of the delimited political space continually issue in the irrationality and disorder of the international. Realism’s insistent emphasis on anarchy, the balance of power and the tragic, fallen nature of international politics simply says, again and again, that at the level of the whole, the totality, humanity is unaware of itself and not in control of its own social existence — that there is not and never has been a global social subject. The political, the modality of human self-determination, remains, at the level of the international, perennial unfreedom. ‘This fatality … is the deeper issue to which Realism is connected’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1354066111416021">Rosenberg, 2008</xref>: 98).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-1354066111416021">12</xref></sup></p>

<title>Marxism and the political</title>
<p>It is from its conception of the essential nature of the political that Realism develops its bleak vision of the unchanging, anarchic character of international politics, and the question of the political, the problem of its form, must be the ground on which any radical challenge to Realism takes place. If the ultimate ambition of Marxist thought is freedom, liberation from ‘the muck of ages’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1354066111416021">Marx and Engels, 1968</xref>: 87), how have the major strands of Marxism within IR approached the problem presented by Realism?<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-1354066111416021">13</xref></sup> What conceptions of the political are operative in their work?<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn14-1354066111416021">14</xref></sup></p>

<title>Neo-Gramscian theory</title>
<p>Neo-Gramscian theory has been centrally concerned to crack open Realism’s ‘billiard ball’ conception of the ‘national territorial totality’ and demonstrate how the state, and by extension the states system, is a site of contestation for a range of conflicting social forces of production. The singular, homogeneous state is replaced by the idea of a ‘state–society complex’ and thereby the internal structure and development of states through various class alliances and modernization programmes can be traced, using the Gramscian conceptual terminology of ‘historic blocs’, ‘passive revolution’, ‘hegemony’ and so forth. However, it is recognized that the singular state–society complex exists within a plurality of states: ‘complexes of production relations, classes, and historic blocs do not exist in isolated national compartments. They are linked to a world order that bears directly on them, as well as influencing them through their national states’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1354066111416021">Cox, 1987</xref>: 6–7). The novelty of the neo-Gramscian approach is the extension of the Gramscian concepts to the international sphere, especially the concept of hegemony, by which, in the original Gramscian context, a dominant class co-opts subaltern classes to its project of national development and maintains their support more by consent than coercion, and, in its new international sense, the dominant class of the leading state, through alliances with like-minded classes or class fractions in other states, constructs a particular world order. The focus of much neo-Gramscian theorizing is the periods of transition between historical world orders — how one breaks down and a new one is constructed — with a view to determining whether the present constitutes a historical moment of transition and, if so, what the possibilities are for a broadly anti-capitalist or anti-imperialist hegemonic project. Accordingly, much of Cox’s major work (1987) is taken up with, effectively, a narrative of the constitution and dissolution of first British 19th-century, and then American 20th-century, hegemonies.</p>
<p>The problematic of the states system has been attended to from a neo-Gramscian perspective by Mark Rupert. Central to the argument is a reading of the concept of ‘alienation’ as found in Marx’s early writings. Under capitalist relations of production, by which the worker is freed from personal relations of domination but is also divorced from direct access to the means of production, alienation works on multiple levels: the worker is alienated from the product of his own labour, which under the regime of private property belongs to the capitalist; he is alienated from his own life-activity, the process of self-objectification through labour, because his labour is always for an (antagonistic) other; and ‘estranged labour involves the alienation of human beings from one another, and of the individual from the species’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1354066111416021">Rupert, 1993</xref>: 71). These multiple alienations are said to generate, at the general societal level, the separation of economics and politics, and the abstraction of the purely political state characteristic of capitalist societies; thus, ‘the very existence of the kind of states portrayed by neo-realist theory presupposes relations of alienation in which “politics” assumes an identity distinct from “economics” and attains its own institutional form of expression’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1354066111416021">Rupert, 1993</xref>: 84). The result of this bringing together of Marx’s early writings and IR theory is that ‘international politics may then be critically understood as a kind of second-order alienation. That is, international politics concerns itself with the mutual estrangement of political communities which are themselves constructed within relations of alienation’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1354066111416021">Rupert, 1993</xref>: 84).</p>
<p>To the extent that Rupert’s approach limits itself to a theorization of the constitution and nature of capitalist geopolitics, it cannot fully go behind its target, neo-Realism, because the Realist claim about the multiplicity of political communities extends well beyond the capitalist epoch: to explain the nature of one historical form of geopolitics is not to explain geopolitics itself. Further, to speak of the separation of economics and politics simply assumes the validity of the two determinations rather than making them the object of critique. But more widely, Rupert’s argument exposes the question of the applicability of Gramsci’s concepts to the study of IR. The solution Rupert poses to the problem of international alienation is a political practice that ‘overturns the hegemony of state-based conceptions of politics … mediates between various “national” groups whose political practices had been contained within such conceptions, and enables their active participation in the construction of a global political community’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1354066111416021">1993</xref>: 87). This appears to envisage a political strategy that self-consciously aims to transcend national boundaries. By contrast, Robert Cox in his seminal article introducing the Gramscian conceptual apparatus into IR insisted that an anti-capitalist hegemonic strategy must be based at the national level: ‘A significant structural change in world order is, accordingly, likely to be traceable to some fundamental change in social relations and in the national political orders which correspond to national structures of social relations’ and so, consequently, ‘the national context remains the only place where an historic bloc can be founded, although world-economy and world-political conditions materially influence the prospects for such an enterprise’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1354066111416021">Cox, 1983</xref>: 173–174).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn15-1354066111416021">15</xref></sup> What Cox’s stipulation reflects is that Gramsci’s theoretical thinking about political praxis was centred on the national context and thereby assumed the political. As Randall Germain and Michael Kenny put it: ‘Throughout the <italic>Prison Notebooks</italic> [Gramsci] is clear that socialists have to embed their arguments within the soil of national political and popular cultures; hence the power of his understanding of the concept of the “national-popular”’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1354066111416021">1998</xref>: 12). In discussing the extension of the concept ‘historic bloc’ from the national to the international sphere, Stephen Gill and David Law contend that ‘the concept of an international historic bloc means much more than an alliance of capitalist interests across national boundaries. It implies that elements of more than one class were involved, its basis was more organic and rooted in material and normative structures of society’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1354066111416021">1993</xref>: 97). But can such concepts be smoothly transferred ‘across national boundaries’ from the domestic to the international? Germain and Kenny argue that Gramsci’s understanding of the state–civil society complex was predicated on the national context and that ‘to speak of a specifically <italic>Gramscian</italic> reading of civil society divorced from its necessary relationship to the state is therefore to obscure the way in which the relationship of the two <italic>analytical</italic> categories comprises for Gramsci a single <italic>social</italic> entity’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1354066111416021">1998</xref>: 13; emphasis in original). In the international domain, despite all talk of a developing ‘international state’, no such state structure exists; rather, ‘national states remain the only political authorities capable of taking public decisions and acting with governmental authority in world politics today’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1354066111416021">Germain and Kenny, 1998</xref>: 14). This surely makes problematic the use of Gramscian concepts in the discussion and analysis of ‘international civil society’ and global social forces. For the use of such concepts, which are specifically predicated on the national context and thus presuppose the particular characteristics of political community and the national–international distinction central to Realist thinking,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn16-1354066111416021">16</xref></sup> for analysis of international relations serves largely to obscure, rather than grasp and explicate, the problematic of the multiplicity of particularist political units that Realists insist upon. To this extent, neo-Gramscianism in IR replicates rather than explores the familiar national–international contradiction.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn17-1354066111416021">17</xref></sup></p>

<title>Political Marxism</title>
<p>The work of Political Marxists in IR in many respects served to focus the problem of the international and its relation to the development of capitalism. Marx and Engels, Benno Teschke observes, did not ‘develop an integrated theory that incorporates the historical efficacy of international relations into their conception of the overall course of world history’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1354066111416021">2006</xref>: 332) and ‘this relative absence of the geopolitical has left a problematic legacy within Marxism’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1354066111416021">2006</xref>: 330–331). A result of the increasing interest of Marxists in the question of how international relations and capitalism are to be understood together is, as Hannes Lacher suggests, that the main issue to be studied has developed: where the theorists of classical imperialism were concerned to explain the changing behaviour of states whose existence was assumed, ‘the question that has emerged as central in recent years is how the existence of an interstate system in the capitalist epoch can be explained in the first place’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1354066111416021">2002</xref>: 148). Surveying the Marxist IR literature that took inspiration from the so-called State Debate of the 1970s within Marxism, Lacher suggests that while that approach can explain the necessity of the state (in the singular) to capitalist society, it cannot answer the question posed by Fred Halliday (cited in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1354066111416021">Lacher, 2002</xref>: 151): ‘why, if there is a world economy in which class interests operate transnationally, there is a need for states at all. What, in other words, is the specificity and effectivity of distinct states within a single economic totality?’ The emergence of the modern form of political multiplicity, the capitalist international, is therefore a central focus of the thinking of Political Marxists in IR. The theoretical apparatus deployed is derived from Robert Brenner, his purported reconstruction of Marx as a ‘theory of social property relations’. In Teschke’s view, ‘the constitution, operation, and transformation of geopolitical orders are predicated on the changing identities of their constitutive units. Social property relations, mediating the relations between the major classes, primarily define the <italic>constitution</italic> and identity of these political units’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1354066111416021">2003</xref>: 7; emphasis in original). In this framework, ‘class conflict remains the <italic>primum mobile</italic> of history’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1354066111416021">Teschke, 2003</xref>: 56): a dominant class of exploiters extracts surplus from a subordinate class of producers, and analysis focuses on tracing the outcomes of the various class strategies of reproduction pursued and on the struggles between classes over property in the output of the production process. In line with this approach, Teschke calls for a conceptual shift from the orthodox Marxist problematic of ‘relations of production’ to a revised problematic of ‘relations of exploitation’, especially in regard to pre-capitalist societies (in this instance, feudal Europe), because ‘a focus on the logic of exploitation overcomes the danger of conceiving the pre-capitalist “state” and “economy” as two separate institutional spheres and foregrounds the class-mediated nexus between political force and economic appropriation’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1354066111416021">2003</xref>: 56). This is because, schematically, in pre-capitalist societies, the economic and the political were organically connected: the producers had direct access to the means of production and therefore the ruling class’s reproduction was secured through direct domination, relations of lordship, what Brenner calls ‘political accumulation’; whereas, in capitalist society, where the worker is freed both from direct relations of domination and direct access to the means of production, the economic and the political are separated, a regime of absolute private property comes into being, the purely political state is abstracted from civil society, and individual capitalists and workers are compelled to pursue ‘economic’ strategies of reproduction through the market (the capitalists having the advantage of ownership of the means of production).</p>
<p>But Brenner’s theoretical construction is wholly inadequate to the depth of the problem of the political. Examining Brenner’s conception of social conflict, Simon Bromley observes that on Brenner’s account of the pre-capitalist world of settled agriculture, ‘political power “was made possible by the self-organization of exploiters (lords) precisely so as to mobilize and monopolize the means of force”, such that “the structures of property rights behind unequal appropriation have been <italic>about</italic> — have been constituted in order to make possible — the economic reproduction of some collectivities at the expense or exclusion of others”’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1354066111416021">2010</xref>: 238; emphasis in original). This means that, as Brenner conceives it, ‘rule was always <italic>ipso facto</italic> a form of coercive domination over peasants and other subordinate groups’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1354066111416021">2010</xref>: 238), economic exploitation enforced by the threat or use of violence. Bromley is surely correct that this could only constitute an outer boundary of political life,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn18-1354066111416021">18</xref></sup> ‘rather than an adequate characterisation of the pre-industrial historical record’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1354066111416021">2010</xref>: 239), the reason being that political <italic>community</italic> cannot be explained in the terms of simple opposition between exploiters and exploited. He cites the Marxist anthropologist Maurice Godelier to the effect that ‘for relations of domination and exploitation to be formed and reproduced in a lasting fashion, they must be presented as an exchange, and as exchange of services’, and that ‘not all the services provided by those who were dominant were purely imaginary or illusory. Otherwise the movement which engendered estates, castes, classes and the state, when that emerged in certain class societies … would not have forged ahead’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1354066111416021">2010</xref>: 238). And Bromley also notes the argument of the Marxist historian John Haldon, who suggests that ‘a crucial element in the longer-term success of a state formation is a degree of acceptance of that state as normatively desirable, especially by elites, but even by the broader populace from which it draws its resources’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1354066111416021">2010</xref>: 238). The central point is that ‘politics is always about much more than class domination and exploitation’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1354066111416021">Bromley, 2010</xref>: 239).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn19-1354066111416021">19</xref></sup> Indeed, Bromley argues that it is the case that ‘at the root of all organised — that is, social — power there is an element of more or less conventional co-ordination. That is, there is an element of social co-operation in all organised forms of social power.… Some form of co-ordinated collective action lies at the basis of all enduring exercises of power, however limited the co-operating sub-group and however much domination is involved in its relationship with others’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1354066111416021">2010</xref>: 233). The crudity of Brenner’s conception leaves its mark on the work of the IR scholars who draw on him for theoretical inspiration. In Benno Teschke’s more than 300-page book on the origins of the modern states system, there is a mere one paragraph (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1354066111416021">2003</xref>: 31) that obliquely touches upon the issue of the political, only to pass over it immediately: a work devoted to debunking the ‘myth of 1648’ as the seminal moment in the co-genesis of capitalism and the modern form of political community, the nation-state, and that attempts instead to demonstrate the absolutist (and, it is asserted, non-capitalist) origins of the latter, contains no substantive theoretical discussion of the concept and meaning of the political. For all its emphasis on ‘attentiveness to historical specificity and the agency of historically situated actors’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1354066111416021">Teschke, 2008</xref>: 184) and rejection of structuralist rigidity, the historical sociology of Political Marxism retains a rather simplistic version of the traditional Marxist mono causal reading of history, class conflict (rebranded as ‘struggles over social property relations’ or ‘strategies of reproduction’), and as a result much else falls outside its reach.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn20-1354066111416021">20</xref></sup> While class conflict, strategies of reproduction and contestation over property rights may in part explain, at some level, the dynamics of social formations, processes of change over time and thereby the characteristics of particular eras of international relations, they surely do not grasp what is involved in the constitution of political community; rather, they tacitly presuppose the existence of a structured social space in which those conflicts take place, and thus cannot reach as far back as to explain what the political <italic>is</italic>, and therewith what the international is. The ironic truth is that the Political Marxists have no theory of the political.</p>

<title>Uneven and combined development</title>
<p>In his recent work, Justin Rosenberg has arguably gone further than any other Marxist IR theorist in trying to explicate just what lies behind Realism’s dominance of the discipline, attempting to develop ‘an alternative theoretical framework — one which has the same intuitive simplicity as the balance of power, but which enables us finally to recover the lost history of international relations, breaking with the old theory which has shown us only an empty, meaningless struggle for power’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1354066111416021">Rosenberg, 1996</xref>: 6).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn21-1354066111416021">21</xref></sup> To recover this history, he has been centrally concerned with elaborating Trotsky’s theory of ‘uneven and combined development’, how developmental processes are refracted through the varying configurations of different social formations, creating specific and frequently unstable hybrids of combined development. From the beginning, Rosenberg has been concerned to push Trotsky’s idea as far as possible, to generate a ‘<italic>general</italic> abstraction’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1354066111416021">2006</xref>: 319; emphasis in original) that would capture a fundamental characteristic of the historical process as a whole. This evolving theoretical perspective is designed to incorporate precisely the issue central to Realism, the multiplicity of political units. Thus, in the course of a critique of Rob Walker’s argument that ‘the international’, and its attendant dilemmas of inside and outside, is the product of the peculiarly modern resolution of the spatial dimension of politics by means of the concept of sovereignty, Rosenberg proposes a more far-reaching grounding of the ‘problematic of the international’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1354066111416021">2000</xref>: 65). Arguing that Walker’s reduction of the international to one of its distinct historical forms constitutes ‘an illicit collapsing of the general into the particular’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1354066111416021">2000</xref>: 73), Rosenberg, instead, drawing on Marx’s mooted procedure of concept formation in the 1857 ‘General Introduction’ in the <italic>Grundrisse</italic>, argues for a clear conceptual distinguishing of the two, and for a general abstraction of ‘the international’ (akin to a general abstraction of ‘production’ or ‘labour’). However, at this point, a discrepancy enters the argument. Rosenberg notes that the notion of the international rests on the anterior concept of political community, and therefore for a general abstraction of the international to be generated, this concept must first be explicated; so, ‘a successful general abstraction of “the international” presupposes a prior general abstraction of “the political”’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1354066111416021">2000</xref>: 77). But the general definition of ‘the political’ that is then given turns out already to presume what it is in fact supposed to define: ‘the political dimension of any social order comprises the means which it has developed (whatever they may be) for arriving at, and giving effect to, collectively binding decisions and rules’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1354066111416021">Rosenberg, 2000</xref>: 78). This is a definition of an aspect internal to political community (‘of any social order’), not of the political itself; it assumes the constituted political space rather than enquiring into how that space comes into being. Nor is there anything in this definition to suggest why political communities exist in the multiple. Indeed, in Rosenberg’s argument, that aspect is simply empirically derived — ‘given that no social order has ever yet been coextensive with humanity as a whole’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1354066111416021">2000</xref>: 79) and ‘we need only the empirical assumption itself: in the known field of human history, social orders have always <italic>co</italic>-existed’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1354066111416021">2000</xref>: 80; emphasis in original). Thus, at this central point in the argument, the explication of the key concept of Realist thinking is sidestepped.</p>
<p>The critique of Rob Walker stands at the beginning of Rosenberg’s investigation of uneven and combined development, and he has since unfolded the implications of the term in a series of articles. But the issue of the political remains problematic. In a recent contribution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1354066111416021">2010</xref>), Rosenberg attempts to derive political multiplicity from uneven and combined development via an appropriation of Barry Buzan and Richard Little’s account of the emergence of the political, and therewith the international, in the long pre-historical transition from hunter-gatherer groups to settled and ultimately state societies. Despite the evident significance of the historical account, it is clear that what is actually provided is a series of sociological factors, centred on the development of social hierarchy, and internal differentiation and complexification, which are then said to give rise, in a way that is unspecified, to something designated ‘the political’. There is a disjuncture in the argument, which can only be awkwardly leapt over, not properly bridged: what ‘the political’ actually <italic>is</italic>, what its conceptual specificity is, remains undetermined and obscure.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn22-1354066111416021">22</xref></sup> The causal sociological factors are of great importance, but they do not suffice of themselves to explicate the political. For that, it would be necessary to interrogate such categories as sovereignty, autonomy, law and juridical order, but it is doubtful whether historical sociology is capable of that register of conceptual inquiry.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn23-1354066111416021">23</xref></sup> As a result of this deficit, the reasons Rosenberg provides for the existence of political multiplicity can again only be functional rather than properly conceptual, contingent rather than intrinsic: ‘since the level of development of early states does not enable any one of them to engross the whole of the human world, their hardening inside/outside division necessarily congeals into finite entities’ and ‘because the causal range of social relations and interactions within which they congeal far outruns … the reach of any centralized political power, the existence of these early states is likely to stimulate reactive developments of social differentiation and proto-state formation beyond themselves, leading to the emergence of further “political” entities’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1354066111416021">2010</xref>: 185).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn24-1354066111416021">24</xref></sup> In the absence of a theorization of the concept of the political, this approach risks conceding too much to Realism. For all that Rosenberg’s account, importantly, shows the political and the international to be historically emergent, the causal, sociological manner of analysis, focused on processes of development, renders it incapable of grasping the political qualitatively. It thus remains caught in the Realist trap: for, if it is not possible to specify what something is, it is impossible to think what might be different from it. The investigation of the explanatory potential of the idea of uneven and combined development may well solve the problem of the Realist (especially neo-Realist) reification of geopolitics as a domain separable from the wider compass of ‘the social’, reconnecting the international to the domestic and thereby generating a more adequate analytic of social development <italic>per se</italic>, but it does so at the expense of effectively naturalizing the Realist concept of political community, its necessarily ‘closed’ nature and the potential for conflict produced thereby. The historical-sociological mode of the investigation of uneven and combined development can only ever ground Realism in social theory rather than surpass it critically. In truth, the Realist problematic squats at the root of the idea of uneven and combined development, rather than being exposed and explicated by it.</p>

<title>Revenge of the political</title>
<p>The concept of the political exists as something repressed within Marxist theorizing, something thought to be long since overcome that yet persists in making its presence painfully felt. None of the leading Marxist approaches extant within IR has sought to subject the political itself to theory.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn25-1354066111416021">25</xref></sup> Rather, it appears as an element that is simply given, immediate. The consequences can be read in the entanglement of Marxism, both as theory and practice, in the historical fate prescribed by Realism, the perdurable fragmentation and anarchy of international politics. This failure to inquire into the meaning and significance of the political is referable back to the ambivalence of Marx’s own theoretical practice. On the one hand, ‘Marx consigned the whole sphere of politics to ideology’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1354066111416021">Adorno, 2000</xref>: 143). There is a moment of world-historical freedom, not to be discarded, in this brusquely achieved rupture. The hardened surface of the social is broken through: no longer is society to be entranced and deluded, in its self-understanding, by forms of appearance: politics, law, religion and philosophy. Politics is not, any more than any of the others, to be hypostasized into something existing in-itself, something autonomous and self-sufficient, something ontological. Rather, it receives all its substance and contents from elsewhere, from the societally mediated process of the interaction of humans with nature:<disp-quote>
<p>In the whole conception of history up to the present this real basis of history has either been totally neglected or else considered as a minor matter quite irrelevant to the course of history. History must, therefore, always be written according to an extraneous standard; the real production of life seems to be primeval history, while the truly historical appears to be separated from ordinary life, something extra-superterrestrial. With this the relation of man to nature is excluded from history and hence the antithesis of nature and history is created. The exponents of this conception of history have consequently only been able to see in history the political actions of princes and States, religious and all sorts of theoretical struggles. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1354066111416021">Marx and Engels, 1968</xref>: 51)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Marx’s historical materialism, dedicated to the primacy of the economic as the mode of society’s self-reproduction, had in the mid-19th century, and continues to have, a decisively progressive aspect: the founders of historical materialism ‘wished for the revolution as one of the economic relationships in society as a whole, in the fundament of its self-preservation, not as the changing of the ground-rules of domination, its political form’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1354066111416021">Adorno, 2001</xref>: ‘Antagonism contingent?’). Only such a change in the basis of society’s existence could bring about the world-historical transformation that Marx and Engels hoped for, the break from pre-history. The failure of the revolution of 1848 surely impressed upon Marx the necessity of a better theoretical grasp of the essence of society: the decades-researched, never completed study of political economy seeks precisely to lay bare how it is that modern society actually reproduces itself, what form the interaction with nature takes in capitalist society, what it means that the object is a commodity. Yet, at the same time that the ideological appearance of politics is stripped away by devastating criticism, the political itself is left standing; the content of politics is revealed as arising out of the antagonistic nature of society’s mode of reproduction, the organization of the exploitation of nature, but the form of the political, the space in which politics takes place,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn26-1354066111416021">26</xref></sup> is not subjected to critique. If politics is seen through as appearance, it is nevertheless not explained how the societal process of the productive interaction with nature generates the distinctive form of the political that Realism insists upon — its delimitation and, on the global level, fractured, multiple existence. The critique of political economy can be considered a quasi-transcendental account of economics — What are the conditions of possibility for such a thing as an ‘economy’ to exist at all? — but no such radical questioning is brought to bear on the political element: it is not explained why economics is <italic>political</italic> economy. So the political itself remains obscure, unillumined by the light of critique, with the result that the relationship between the categories derived from the critique of the societal production process and the political existence of humans remains unarticulated. Paradigmatically, in the <italic>Communist Manifesto</italic> Marx and Engels write both that ‘the working men have no country’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1354066111416021">2002</xref>: 241) and that ‘the struggle of the proletariat with the bourgeoisie is at first a national struggle. The proletariat of each country must, of course, first of all settle matters with its own bourgeoisie’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1354066111416021">2002</xref>: 232). The proletariat both transcends the national context and yet is bound to it in a relationship that is never properly explicated. ‘Since the proletariat must first of all acquire political supremacy, must rise to be the leading class of the nation, must constitute itself <italic>the</italic> nation, it is, so far, itself national, though not in the bourgeois sense of the word’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1354066111416021">Marx and Engels, 2002</xref>: 241; emphasis in original). But in what sense of the word? The nation, the modern political community, remains in Marx’s thought the scene of the drama even despite the sublation of the class struggle. The form of the political is to be filled with a radically different content, but it is never made clear whether or how this revolutionary change of content itself changes the nature of the form.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn27-1354066111416021">27</xref></sup> Consequently, despite being roughly negated (at least as high politics), the political continually recurs throughout Marx’s oeuvre in a theoretically undigested way as marking out the space within which revolutionary activity is to take place, from the early critical works motivated by the experience of German backwardness in relation to Britain and France, through the texts on the failure of revolutionary struggle in France, to the late <italic>Critique of the Gotha Programme</italic> and documents for the First International. The contradiction of internationalism and national revolution remains latent and unresolved, indeed unacknowledged.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn28-1354066111416021">28</xref></sup></p>
<p>This ambivalence towards the political, its simultaneous negation and retention, is preserved within the Marxist tradition right through to the various strands of Marxism within contemporary IR. The World-Systems theorists and Political Marxists, for instance, are at an extreme in their refusal to grant any theoretical substance to the specificity of the political, to how and why a bounded political space is created, and yet the political is continually and massively present within their work, at least at a brute empirical level — how could it not be, when their studies are entirely devoted to analysing the differential development of political communities within the growth of capitalism? The same is true generally of Marxism within IR: the political is always there (necessarily, given that so much of IR Marxism takes the form of historical-sociological studies) but almost invariably as an unacknowledged element, something regarded as unproblematic, something not worked through theoretically. Where Marxist historical sociology has broached the question of the political (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1354066111416021">Rosenberg, 2010</xref>), it has been unable to grasp it conceptually; and where, exceptionally, Marxism has attempted a conceptual treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1354066111416021">Bromley, 2010</xref>),<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn29-1354066111416021">29</xref></sup> it has effectively conceded to Realist political fragmentation: ‘In respect of political order … the Humean predicament is the human predicament’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1354066111416021">Bromley, 2010</xref>: 245). But, as a theory of freedom, Marxism cannot afford such a concession; for it is precisely the form of the political that Realism says creates the anarchic, unchanging and essentially conflictual arena of the international, and which forces each community into the fatality of the unending struggle for self-preservation that is the condition of international politics.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn30-1354066111416021">30</xref></sup> If this deficiency within Marxist thought concerning political form is traceable back to Marx’s own thinking, then the solution to the problem of the political is not to be straightforwardly found within the Marxian corpus. It is necessary, instead, for Marxism in IR to extend its reach beyond the prevailing interest in historical-sociological studies of processes of development and to engage critically with the tradition of political theory:<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn31-1354066111416021">31</xref></sup> above all, with such central categories as sovereignty and legal order. The model for such an engagement remains, nevertheless, the manner of Marx’s own approach to bourgeois political economy: he neither rejected the categories developed by classical political economy in favour of a ‘socialist’ alternative, nor did he simply accept them at face value. Rather, he interrogated them in such depth, exposing their social mediatedness, as to demonstrate that the political economists did not understand their own concepts. It is through this labour of conceptual investigation that Marx broke the naturalization of the categories of bourgeois society characteristic of political economy.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn32-1354066111416021">32</xref></sup> This, also, is the way to escape Realist essentializing in IR. Just as Marx’s theory of capital implies the question of how a society, indeed a world, of generalized exchange is possible, how it is that humans could totalize exchange such that every object becomes a commodity, an economic thing, so, in IR, the problem of the political demands investigation into how humans could make themselves ‘sovereign’, an autonomous source of law, and how the world could be transformed into political space. The premise of Marx’s theoretical investigations is that it is necessary to understand the being of capitalist society, what it actually is, if it is to be transcended: only through investigating the conditions of possibility of the society ruled by value does it become possible to think what might be beyond universal commodity exchange. Analogously, for Marxist thinking in IR, it is only through interrogating the fundamental categories of political thought, exposing what is involved in their constitution, that it might be possible to think beyond the delimited, particularist form of the political naturalized by Realism, and to escape entrapment in the fateful condition of the international.</p>

<p>Marx’s inaugural address to the International Working Men’s Association, from 1864, is paradig matic. It concludes with the rallying cry that the European ruling classes’ foreign policies<disp-quote>
<p>in pursuit of criminal designs, playing upon national prejudices, and squandering in piratical wars the people’s blood and treasure … have taught the working classes the duty to master themselves the mysteries of international politics; to watch the diplomatic acts of their respective governments; to counteract them, if necessary, by all means in their power; when unable to prevent, to combine in simultaneous denunciations, and to vindicate the simple laws of morals and justice, which ought to govern the relations of private individuals, as the rules paramount to the intercourse of nations.</p>

<p>Pozo-Martin is the only Marxist contributor to the 2007 <italic>CRIA</italic> debate to grasp the significance of the issue; the others ignore the difficulty and importance of the relation of Marxism to Realism and use the occasion rather to rehearse preferred theories of capitalist development set out at length elsewhere. In his contribution, John Hobson rightly observes that in some ways the debate constitutes a rerun of the ‘one logic or two?’ argument between World-Systems theorists and Weberian historical sociologists in the early 1980s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1354066111416021">Hobson, 2007</xref>). However, the significance of the issue goes further than he allows because it concerns more than simply the relative priority and interrelation of causal factors.</p></fn>

<p>Axiomatically because, as Rosenberg again observes, in IR, Realism itself, in fact, has no developed theory of the political (and thus no theory, in the emphatic sense, of the international): ‘This question of why “the international” exists in the first place — why there are multiple societies — seems not to have formed a prominent part of either realist or non-realist theory. Perhaps that is not surprising. Realism, after all, works by reasoning <italic>from</italic> this fact, not towards it’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1354066111416021">2008</xref>: 15; emphasis in original).</p></fn>

<p>Whether Marxian thought really does posit ‘the absolute unity of mankind as its ideal’ is moot; Marx both applauded capitalism’s tendency to do away with ‘the idiocy of rural life’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1354066111416021">Marx and Engels, 2002</xref>: 224), promoting the development of the forces of production and ‘the universal inter-dependence of nations’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1354066111416021">Marx and Engels, 2002</xref>: 223), and deplored the anarchy and false universality of the commodity economy. What an authentic or true universality would be remains a central question for any thinking indebted to Marx; to that extent Berki’s provocation retains its relevance.</p></fn>

<p>Neo-Realist theory, in particular, has attempted to turn Realism into a predictive, causal, social-scientific theory, with very spare results. Much of the Marxist critique has focused, to great effect, on showing that any adequate account of societal development must be able to encompass far more than the skeletal structure of neo-Realism can. However, it is the argument of this article that that is in any case not where the real power of Realism lies nor where the force of its challenge to Marxist thought is located. These exist rather in Realism’s perception of the irrationality of the political and the intractability of the condition of the international.</p></fn>

<p>For reasons of space, and because its self-definition as ‘Marxist theory’ is less firm than that of other theoretical trends, consideration of World-Systems theory has been omitted. In any case, the critique of the economic functionalism of Wallerstein’s thinking is long established (for the classic statement, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1354066111416021">Skocpol, 1977</xref>; for further observations from a specifically IR perspective, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1354066111416021">Bromley, 1991</xref>: 37–38; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1354066111416021">Teschke, 2008</xref>: 169–173). For similar reasons, transnational theory, as most forcefully represented by the work of William Robinson (for the major statement, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1354066111416021">Robinson, 2004</xref>), has also been set aside: the critique of its blindness to the specificity of the political is well established (for pertinent and representative comments, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1354066111416021">Block, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1354066111416021">McMichael, 2001</xref>) and does not require repetition.</p></fn>

But whatever the value of the neo-Gramscian approach for such accounts, it continues to assume the political and it thus remains unclear whether the Gramscian concepts are apt to address the more far-reaching question of the latter’s form. Taking up Morton’s own injunction concerning the historicization of Gramsci’s thought, it might be said that the specific problem Realism poses to Marxist thought in IR serves to reveal ‘what might be historically <italic>limited</italic> in a Gramscian way of thinking about alternative historical and contemporary circumstances’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1354066111416021">Morton, 2003</xref>: 139; emphasis in original).</p></fn>

<p>That is, the class antagonism does not in any way straightforwardly negate the coherence and unity of the political body. The inadequacy of Brenner’s thinking here reflects a deeper obtuseness to conceptual questions: analogously, in his ‘reconstruction’ of Marx, Brenner excises the entire substance of Marx’s theory of exchange; as a consequence, he can only see straightforward domination and exploitation where Marx’s analysis shows how capitalist society is the latest, and most ideologically subtle, form in which exchange is both equal and unequal.</p></fn>

<p>If it were accepted, Teschke’s and Lacher’s argument — that the nation-state, indeed particularist political community as such, is entirely extrinsic to the logic of capital and is rather a (curiously long-lasting) relic of the supposedly non-capitalist absolutist era — would a priori eliminate the possibility of theoretically grasping geopolitics and Realism from a perspective informed by the critique of capital. Where Teschke and Lacher, following the logic of Brenner’s conception of capital, take the extreme position, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1354066111416021">Ellen Wood (2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1354066111416021">2003)</xref> attempts to occupy a middle ground, arguing that capitalism needs and sustains the states system because of the practical and logistical difficulties of enforcing market relations across the geographical space of the globe. However, because she shares the Brennerite framework, this can only result in a ‘soft functionalism’ (Vivek Chibber’s phrase; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1354066111416021">2005</xref>: 157) in which the states system is asserted to be essential to capital, but for only contingent, practical reasons.</p></fn>

<p>The focus here is on Justin Rosenberg’s work because he has done by far the most to explore the theoretical possibilities of uneven and combined development. Recently others (for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1354066111416021">Matin, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1354066111416021">Shilliam, 2009</xref>) have sought to make use of, and inflect, this approach in the exploration of specific historical subjects, and there continues to be a debate about the legitimate range of the idea (see, for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1354066111416021">Allinson and Anievas, 2009</xref>). However, none of these contributions addresses the problem of the political and its status within the theory, and, as such, the observations made here concerning the major statement of this theoretical approach apply <italic>a fortiori</italic> to them.</p></fn>
<fn fn-type="other" id="fn22-1354066111416021">
<label>22</label>
<p>As if in admission that the concepts remain empty, mere terminological placeholders, ‘the political’ and ‘politics’ are placed in inverted commas almost throughout the article.</p></fn>
<fn fn-type="other" id="fn23-1354066111416021">
<label>23</label>
<p>Rosenberg’s earlier work, <italic>The Empire of Civil Society</italic>, contains an account, drawing on Ellen Wood, of sovereignty as ‘the social form of the state in a society where political power is divided between public and private spheres’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1354066111416021">1994</xref>: 129). This is an argument about the form of social power in capitalist society. What was said above about Mark Rupert’s neo-Gramscian argument applies here also, that to think about capitalist society in terms of the separation of the economic and the political presupposes the validity of those determinations and is limited to observing that in capitalist society the political element is precipitated out in a distinctive way. As such, the constituted political space is already assumed. Further, to say that sovereignty designates the modern ‘purely political’ state form leaves the substance of the term itself still obscure: no light is shed on what it means or how it is possible for humans to constitute themselves as ‘sovereign’ (nor could this approach address the question, for instance, of why the modern sovereign state form is sharply bounded).</p></fn>
<fn fn-type="other" id="fn24-1354066111416021">
<label>24</label>
<p>Here, at a crucial point, Rosenberg’s theoretical argument comes to rest on the happenstance of the merely empirical, in a way not dissimilar to the ‘soft functionalism’ of Ellen Wood: political multiplicity, it seems, comes into being and continues to exist because no single state is or has been powerful enough to conquer or subsume all the others. This, incidentally, is why uneven and combined development cannot be regarded as a solution to the many states problem, at least as the latter pertains to the capitalist world system. What the theory is designed to achieve is the integration of political multiplicity, the international, into accounts of societal development; however, because it has as yet no conceptual explanation of the boundedness and delimitation of the form of the political, nothing in the theory can account for why in a world of all-round integration there are multiple political entities. As with the other extant Marxist approaches, there is no intrinsic theoretical connection between the economic and the political.</p></fn>
<fn fn-type="other" id="fn25-1354066111416021">
<label>25</label>
<p>This is as true of the latest contribution, Alex Callinicos’s, as of all the preceding ones examined above. Callinicos recognizes the force of the question of why there are multiple political entities within a single global mode of production. His answer: ‘the centrifugal pulls generated by the inherently geographically uneven distribution of resources under capitalism play an irreducible role in keeping the state system plural’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1354066111416021">2007</xref>: 545). Once again, the specificity of the political is completely occluded and recourse is had to an economic reason without any explanation of why the unevenness of <italic>economic</italic> development should result in <italic>political</italic> multiplicity. After all, the USA, China, Brazil, indeed all countries, are highly unevenly developed economically, but they remain single political entities, a point also made by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1354066111416021">Neil Davidson (2010)</xref>, although his own solution to the many states problem — that capitalists want their own state in order to be protected from the ravages of competition on an open global market — is every bit as functionalist as Callinicos’s.</p></fn>
