            <p>Splenic artery aneurysm (SAA) is the most common (60%) of all visceral artery aneurysms. The majority of these cases are asymptomatic, but the presentation of their rupture can vary from abdominal/chest pain to cardiovascular collapse (Sadat U, Dar O, Walsh S, Varty K. Splenic artery aneurysms in pregnancy—a systematic review. <italic>Int J Surg</italic>. 2008;6(3):261-265.). Although rare, the mortality associated with the rupture is as high as 25% (De Vries JE, Schattenkerk ME, Malt RA. Complications of splenic artery aneurysm other than intraperitoneal rupture. <italic>Surgery</italic>. 1982;91(2):200-204; Caillouette JC, Merchant EB: Ruptured splenic artery aneurysm in pregnancy. Twelfth reported case with maternal and fetal survival. <italic>Am J Obstet Gynecol</italic> 1993;168(6 Pt 1):1810-1811) and increases to 75% among pregnant women with a concomitant fetal mortality of 95% (O’Grady JP, Day EJ, Toole AL, et al. Splenic artery aneurysm rupture in pregnancy. A review and case report. <italic>Obstet Gynecol</italic>. 1977; 50(5):627-630). Because of such high maternal and fetal mortality prompt management of SAAs is of utmost importance. We are presenting a case of a 35-year-old woman with a missed ruptured SAA who after an emergent cesarean section went into profound shock and was unable to be resuscitated. This case illustrates the importance of considering the diagnosis of SAA rupture in hemodynamically unstable peripartum females.</p>

      <p>A 35-year-old Hispanic G4P3 woman with 34½ week intrauterine twin pregnancy, presented to emergency department (ED) complaining of feeling tired and “dehydrated.” A day earlier, she was seen in ED for low back and left upper quadrant abdominal pain, managed with intravenous magnesium for a possible preterm labor and discharged home. The patient presented to ED a day later and the initial evaluation at that time showed an ill-appearing woman, with jaundiced sclera and dry mucosa. She was tachycardic, had clear lungs, and a gravid uterus. The patient had irregular contractions with apparent fetal distress. For this, she underwent an emergent cesarean section with delivery of 2 healthy babies and a subsequent atonic uterus that responded to medical management, including uterine massage and oxitocic therapy.<sup>
            <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0885066612444257">1</xref>
         </sup>
      </p>
      <p>Seven hours later, she developed tachycardia, hypotension, and respiratory distress and was transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU). Two large bore intravenous (IV) were placed, she was given fluid boluses and placed on oxygen mask. Her abdomen was benign except for mild suprapubic tenderness. She did not have any rashes. She had minimal vaginal bleeding with no signs of intrauterine hemorrhage. Laboratory workup showed anemia (hemoglobin 10.7 g/dL), leukocytosis (white blood cell, 17 500 cells/mm<sup>3</sup>) with a left shift (bands 5%), elevated liver enzymes (aspartate aminotransferase 262 U/L and alanine transaminase 456 U/L), and signs of disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), namely bleeding at the IV sites with elevated prothrombin time and partial thromboplastin time and low platelets. Shortly after the transfer to ICU, she developed respiratory failure, requiring endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation. Aggressive resuscitation measures continued.<sup>
            <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0885066612444257">2</xref>
         </sup> An ultrasound of the liver and pelvis showed diffuse increased echogenicity of the liver parenchyma, with moderate amount of free fluid in Morison's pouch and the pelvic cavity. Due to worsening hypotension and signs of shock, several 500 mL boluses of normal saline were given without response. A central line was placed; she was started on vasopressors in addition to continued fluid resuscitation and broad-spectrum antibiotics, as well as packed red blood cells (PRBC) for a presumptive hypovolemic shock. Despite all these measures, while considering a need for exploratory laparotomy, she experienced pulseless electrical activity (PEA)/asystole arrests 3 times, was resuscitated each time using advanced cardiac life support (ACLS) protocols, but remained hemodynamically unstable and comatose throughout the rest of her hospital stay. On hospital day 3, she was declared brain dead. The autopsy showed massive blood loss due to a ruptured splenic artery aneurysm.</p>

         <title>Discussion</title>
         <p>Splenic artery aneurysm (SAA) was first reported in pregnancy in 1869.<sup>
               <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0885066612444257">3</xref>
            </sup> The true prevalence of SAA in pregnancy or women of childbearing age is unknown. Sixty-five percent of SAA occurs in women and 50% of them rupture during pregnancy.<sup>
               <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0885066612444257">4</xref>
            </sup> Two thirds of SAA rupture in third trimester, typically in the last 2 weeks of pregnancy.<sup>
               <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0885066612444257">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0885066612444257">5</xref>
            </sup>
         </p>
         <p>Despite the female predominance and well-recognized association with pregnancy, the etiology of splenic artery aneurysms remains unclear. In nonpregnant patient population factors such as atherosclerosis, congenital defects, vasculitidis, trauma, and fibromuscular dysplasia have all been implicated.<sup>
               <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0885066612444257">6</xref>

            </sup> Whereas in pregnancy, it is assumed that hormonal influences of estrogen, progesterone, and relaxin on the arterial wall play a significant role. The first 2 hormones presumably result in histological alteration of the arterial wall, mainly medial degeneration, leading to aneurysmal dilatation,<sup>
               <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0885066612444257">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0885066612444257">10</xref>
            </sup> while relaxin may augment the effect of these hormones by further enhancing the elasticity of splenic artery.<sup>
               <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0885066612444257">11</xref>
            </sup> Additionally, the size of the uterus causing higher pressures within the splenic artery may explain the increased chances of rupture during third trimester. The frequency of rupture increases with pregnancy, portal hypertension, and increasing size of the aneurysm.<sup>
               <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0885066612444257">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0885066612444257">12</xref>
            </sup>
         </p>
         <p>The majority of all rupture cases are sudden, causing immediate circulatory collapse, and 25% of the cases will undergo a 2-stage rupture process. It is characterized by containment of initial rupture within the lesser sac by either omentum and/or blood clots that block foramen of Winslow. This is followed by free rupture into greater sac hours or days later when the tension within the lesser sac increases. The second rupture is usually life threatening with profound hemodynamic collapse.<sup>
               <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0885066612444257">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0885066612444257">11</xref>
            </sup>
         </p>
         <p>While SAA itself is mostly asymptomatic, the rupture presents with sharp abdominal pain, either in the epigastrium or more often localized in the left hypochondrial area with associated pain in the tip of the left shoulder (Kehr sign). There may be associated nausea, vomiting, and sudden collapse. Abdominal tenderness and signs of shock are the most suggestive features. There have been reported cases of ruptured SAA in pregnancy presenting with left-sided chest pain, breathlessness, low oxygen saturation, and electrocardiographic changes indicative of massive pulmonary embolus<sup>
               <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0885066612444257">13</xref>
            </sup> or sudden cardiopulmonary arrest<sup>
               <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0885066612444257">14</xref>

               <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0885066612444257">15</xref>
            </sup> Therefore, high degree of suspicion is required when making the diagnosis in pregnancy with confirmation usually made at the time of laparotomy. Clinically, the differential diagnosis is extensive and includes uterine rupture, placental abruption, severe preeclampsia, hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, low platelet count syndrome (HELLP syndrome), amniotic fluid embolism, thromboembolism, ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm, pancreatic pathology, cholecystitis, appendicitis, or any perforated abdominal viscera.<sup>
               <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0885066612444257">16</xref>
            </sup> Our patient underwent cesarean section, which rendered some of these diagnoses nonapplicable.</p>
         <p>The radiological investigations should not delay the immediate resuscitation and control of the hemorrhage by emergency surgery. Ultrasonography is preferable in pregnancy because it is noninvasive.<sup>
               <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0885066612444257">10</xref>
            </sup> In emergency cases, it usually reveals the presence of free fluid in abdomen and the diagnosis is again confirmed at laparotomy. Computerized tomography and magnetic resonance imaging are useful in improving 3-dimensional evaluation of the splenic artery; however, safety of the fetus has to be given due consideration.<sup>
               <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0885066612444257">17</xref>
            </sup> Digital subtraction angiography is the gold standard for the diagnosis of SAA, but in pregnancy, it is usually employed when concomitant radiological intervention like coil embolization or endoluminal stent deployment is to be performed.<sup>
               <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0885066612444257">18</xref>
            </sup> No reports were found in literature, where these treatment modalities were used in ruptured SAA in pregnancy. In cases of ruptured SAA, the main principle guiding therapy must be that the maternal resuscitation is the priority and resuscitating the mother will resuscitate the fetus.<sup>
               <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0885066612444257">19</xref>
            </sup>
         </p>
         <p>There is no consensus with regard to management of asymptomatic cases.<sup>
               <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0885066612444257">17</xref>
            </sup> A general consensus holds that women anticipating pregnancy who develop SAA should be treated electively.<sup>
               <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0885066612444257">9</xref>
            </sup> In symptomatic cases, immediate treatment is warranted by open, laparoscopic, or as embolization of the aneurysm.<sup>
               <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0885066612444257">20</xref>
            </sup> However, in cases of rupture, the aim is immediate resuscitation and cessation of bleeding, usually through cesarian section and laparotomy.<sup>
               <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0885066612444257">3</xref>
            </sup> In other words, in cases of suspected ruptured, SAA proceed directly to laparotomy.</p>
         <p>In our case, the patient most likely had a “2-stage rupture” as she presented with low back and left upper quadrant pain 1 day prior to this hospitalization. Furthermore, no bleeding was seen in the peritoneal cavity at the time of the cesarean section. The gravid uterus most likely was tamponading the bleeding aneurysm. As a result, she was able to deliver healthy twins. But shortly after delivery as the tamponading effect of the uterus was eliminated, the second stage of the rupture commenced with subsequent development of hemorrhagic shock, DIC, and cardiopulmonary arrest. The combination of hypotension, hypoperfusion, and several arrests most likely lead to brain death. Approximately 2 L of blood and large blood clots were found in the intraperitoneal cavity on autopsy.</p>
         <p>Postpartum hemorrhage (PPH) is one of the top 5 causes of maternal mortality in developed and developing countries. The incidence of PPH is 40% after vaginal delivery and 30% after cesarean section.<sup>
               <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0885066612444257">21</xref>
            </sup> The PPH is defined as a hemorrhage from the birth canal in excess of 500 mL during the first 24 hours after birth. If the bleeding is massive or rapid, hypovolemic shock may ensue. It will present as tachycardia, hypotension, and altered level of consciousness. Since there was no blood loss noticed from the birth canal in our patient, PPH was ruled out, but the patient continued to experience the signs of hypovolemic shock. The cause of the hypovolemic shock, as we found later from autopsy, was due to an internal hemorrhage from a ruptured SAA, in which the extravasated blood remained in the body.</p>
         <p>Any hemorrhagic shock, be it from PPH or internal hemorrhage, requires same resuscitation measures. First and foremost—control the source of bleeding as soon as possible and fluid replacement, which is aimed toward normalization of hemodynamic parameters. Crystalloid solutions and blood transfusions are the mainstay of treatment of hemorrhagic shock. But in unstable or unresponsive hemorrhagic shock, surgical treatment is mandatory as soon as possible to control the source of bleeding.<sup>

         <title>Conclusion</title>
         <p>Although spontaneous rupture of SAA is uncommon, good maternal–fetal outcome can only be achieved with early diagnosis and prompt treatment. Hence, a high degree of suspicion is required to make a diagnosis of SAA rupture in peripartum females presenting with sudden cardiovascular collapse with or without DIC or sharp abdominal pain. Immediate aggressive resuscitation and prompt surgical interventions to stop the bleeding are essential for the survival of both the mother and fetus.</p>
         <p>Our case represents an uncommon case of a life-threatening condition that can affect both the mother and her unborn child. Since it is uncommon, it is easily overlooked until it is too late, as it was in our case. At least in our case, the babies survived. This case will help the practitioners in the ICUs to include it in their differential diagnoses and subsequently address it before the irreversible damage has taken place to either the mother or the fetus or both. Our hope is that this case will raise awareness and therefore help save more mothers and their babies.</p>
