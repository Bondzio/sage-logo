<abstract>
<p>Our aim in this article is to demonstrate that corporate technical activity and corporate political activity can overlap substantially or intertwine in ways quite difficult to tease apart analytically. Theories of corporate political activity must therefore be modified to include technical standardization as potentially part of such activity. The article proposes a conceptual framework for studying such situations and argues for the existence of a “political standardizer,” defined as a company that works for or through technical standardization as a political strategy. Such a firm pursues political objectives in its technical standardization practices. The article illustrates this argument with a case study of the toy producer LEGO<sup>®</sup>. The case study provides support for existence of a political standardizer and illustrates concretely how technical and political activities are combined by a particular company.</p>

<body>
<p>If a large European firm regularly puts a representative on a plane to Brussels and other European capitals to negotiate under the auspices of the European Committee for Standardization (CEN), it is generally taken to be engaged in technical activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0007650309332311">Hawkins, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0007650309332311">Pelkmans, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0007650309332311">Swann, 2000</xref>). Had the same firm’s representative instead been sent to the European Commission, it would just as naturally be taken to be engaged in corporate political activity. This distinction makes sense because European technical standardization efforts and EU policy-making efforts bring about markedly different results: the former produces voluntary European technical standards, whereas the latter produces binding legislation. A visit to CEN, then, is a corporate technical activity, whereas a visit to the European Commission is a corporate political activity.</p>
<p>Firm representatives do, however, go to Brussels both to negotiate technical standards through CEN and to affect EU policy through the European Commission. In addition, firms coordinate these two sets of activities to get the best possible result. To the extent that firms do so, it does not make sense to distinguish between them. Reading the current literature on corporate political activity (CPA), however, one is more or less forced to distinguish always between technical and political activities for lack of a suitable concept to bring them together. Important aspects of CPA, then, might be ignored simply because we have not developed a conceptual framework to understand such practices.</p>
<p>Our aim in this article is to show that corporate technical activity is sometimes indistinguishable from corporate political activity and to propose a conceptual framework for studying such situations. Using a case study of the Danish toy producer LEGO<sup>®</sup> as an example, we want to argue for the existence of a political standardizer. Such a firm pursues political objectives in its technical standardization practices and our theories of corporate political activity must therefore be modified to include technical standardization as part of such activity.</p>
<p>By “political standardizer” we mean an actor that takes part in technical standardization to influence government policy in ways favorable to the firm. Such an actor purposely seeks points of contact between technical standardization and government policy. Unlike more familiar forms of lobbying, this combination of technical and political activity is not necessarily done with the aim of blocking government policy, that is, avoiding regulation. Rather, technical standards are deliberately developed to anticipate the demands of policy-makers in the hope of shaping policy to support rather than constrain the flexibility and uniformity of technical standardization. The political standardizer pursues a strategy that involves collective action by those active in technical standardization. It also pursues its own interest, of course; but to establish and maintain the coupling of technical standards and law, it needs to express itself in terms of collective interest and activity.</p>
<p>We are not the first to draw attention to the need for further development of the conceptual frameworks for the study of CPA. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0007650309332311">Baysinger (1984)</xref> argued for a wider view on CPA; some 20 years later, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0007650309332311">Hillman, Keim, and Schuler (2004)</xref> noted that the gap between CPA research and CPA practice had widened as CPA research had not kept pace with the forms of CPA that are prevalent in practice (p. 838). In listing directions for future research, they propose to include nongovernmental institutions among the types of CPA to be studied and how venue selection can be part of a firm’s CPA strategies (p. 852).</p>
<p>We suggest that CPA research should take a greater interest in the couplings of government regulation with technical standards and, more generally, the coupling of government regulation with business self-regulation. Our conceptual framework focuses on government regulation to systematize the ways in which government regulation couples with technical standardization. We focus on government regulation because the coupling with technical standards is always a two-way coupling, and this very coupling constitutes certain conditions for employing technical standardization activities as corporate political activity.</p>
<p>We distinguish between three forms of reference within government regulation to technical standardization classified according to the specificity of the reference. We call the most general and unspecified reference “state of the art” because this expression also commonly implies technical standards when used in government regulation. A more specified and binding reference we term <italic>standard made law</italic> to capture the situation where references in government regulation makes technical standards legally binding. Finally, a specified and suggestive reference, that we term <italic>technical standards as concretization of law</italic>. In this latter situation the reference of government regulation does not make the technical standards binding; rather, the reference serves the purpose of making the general requirements of the government regulation more concrete by suggesting specific ways in which to fulfill the requirements.</p>
<p>In short, we argue that technical standardization is central to a broadened view on CPA, and our conceptual framework specifies how such a broadened view can be applied in concrete studies. We argue that the political standardizer engages in coalition building across different venues, including nongovernmental arenas, often with the aim of actively promoting government regulation, which is coordinated with standardization activities. Our argument is thus that the concept of the political standardizer might capture a form of CPA that is prevalent in practice. Hence the concept may contribute to narrow the gap between CPA research and CPA practice and should be included more systematically in future CPA studies.</p>
<p>In the next section, we review the literature on corporate technical activity with a specific view to technical standardization in general and couplings of government regulation with technical standardization more specifically. We then present our conceptual framework and flesh it out by analyzing the case of LEGO. Following a brief discussion, we then offer some conclusions.</p>
<sec id="section1-0007650309332311">
<title>Corporate Political Activity and Technical Standardization</title>
<p>Technical standardization holds only a marginal position in the literature on CPA. Although it has won the attention of political scientists (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0007650309332311">Frankel &amp; Højbjerg, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0007650309332311">Higgins &amp; Hallström, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0007650309332311">Nölke &amp; Perry, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0007650309332311">Porter, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0007650309332311">Schepel, 2005</xref>), technical standardization is not generally seen as a corporate political activity in the disciplinary sense. This is probably because technical standardization is taken to be a classic example of business self-regulation, and self-regulation in general is a marginal concern in the CPA literature. Influential reviews of the CPA literature, in any case, barely touch on self-regulation and are silent on the issue of technical standardization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0007650309332311">Baysinger, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0007650309332311">Getz, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0007650309332311">Hillman et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0007650309332311">Shaffer, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0007650309332311">Vogel, 1996</xref>). That said, there are clear indications that self-regulation is emerging as a theme in the literature on corporate political activities and the time seems to have come to develop a conceptual framework for the analysis of technical standardization as a corporate political activity.</p>
<p>Doing so will demand that we bring together three bodies of literature. The CPA literature must be brought into contact with the literature on technical standardization and the literature on the coupling of government regulation with technical standards. None of these literatures analyze how firms may utilize the coupling of government regulation with technical standardization in their corporate political activities, but each has something to contribute to such an analysis.</p>
<sec id="section2-0007650309332311">
<title>The CPA Literature</title>
<p>The CPA literature more or less ignores technical standardization. Technical standardization is regarded a technical activity and, though it may be an important activity of firms, it is not seen as a concern that relates directly to government regulation. On that basis, it is not regarded as a corporate political activity. There are, of course, good reasons to keep government regulation clearly in view, but there are at least three considerations that invite us to make technical standardization an object of analysis as well.</p>
<p>First, studies of corporate political activity already take an interest in how business seeks to influence government regulation by means of indirect relations. Some firms, for example, fund and inform interest groups (Political Action Committees[PACs]) that are external to the firm in order for this interest group to lobby for political intervention that will favor the firm. As technical standardization is often coupled with government regulation, it may offer a way for firms to pursue indirect political activity. Hence the existing interest in how firms employ indirect influence to “use power of government in order to achieve own parochial interests” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0007650309332311">Baysinger, 1984</xref>, p. 249) can easily be expanded to include technical standardization.</p>
<p>Second, this body of literature is concerned with how firms deploy collective action as part of their political activity, for example, pursued in business associations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0007650309332311">Knill, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0007650309332311">Wilts, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0007650309332311">Wilts &amp; Meyer, 2005</xref>). Technical standardization is here relevant as a collective activity of firms. Technical standards are developed by working groups, and typically more firms take part in the work. Hence technical standardization can be regarded as a collective action of firms with the specific characteristic that it produces technical rules.</p>
<p>Third, the CPA literature seems to be increasingly concerned with the question of how self-regulation is deployed as a part of a firm’s political activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0007650309332311">Kolk &amp; Pinkse, 2007</xref>). Typically, self-regulation is pointed out as an alternative to government regulation or, more specifically, as a means to avoiding government intervention. Such self-regulation may concern only the specific firm in question, or it may concern an industry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0007650309332311">Haufler, 2001</xref>). Because technical standardization is a long-standing historical example of business self-regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0007650309332311">Voelzkow, 1996</xref>), it is an obvious place to look for self-regulatory elements of corporate political activity. Furthermore, when it is noted that industry “self-regulation also shades into ‘co-regulation’ at times, when the policies and programs are developed in cooperation with governments” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0007650309332311">Haufler, 2001</xref>), attention is aimed directly at the couplings of various forms of regulation. What is missing, however, is a conceptual framework to study such couplings.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0007650309332311">
<title>Technical Standardization Literature</title>
<p>The literature on technical standardization observes the increasing importance of technical standardization but does not systematically deal with the opportunities for firms to utilize coupling with government regulation for CPA purposes. Rather, research tends to focus on the “power of technical standards” on their own; there is a tendency to argue that technical standards are political because they matter, that is, that they influence what actions are taken and what actions are not taken. But the coupling with government regulation itself thereby becomes secondary, and the focus on corporate technical activity as an instrument to influence government regulation is hardly touched upon.</p>
<p>The power of technical standardization bodies may, from this point of view, be derived from the capacity of technical standards to influence trade and competition by translating technological advances into technical specifications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0007650309332311">Mattli &amp; Büthe, 2003</xref>). An alternative view is that technical standardization organizations are simply driven by a technical or epistemic rationality, functionally separated from the social rationalities of political institutions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0007650309332311">Haas, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0007650309332311">Loya &amp; Boli, 1999</xref>).</p>
<p>From a broad economic perspective, the issue of standardization has been approached both in terms of its positive macroeconomic effects as well as its effects on business strategy and management. In relation to the former, market efficiency, international trade, and innovation have been important themes (see, for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0007650309332311">Blind, 2004</xref>), whereas strategies of firms to protect their product specifications and win “standards wars” has occupied the latter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0007650309332311">Funk, 2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0007650309332311">Grindley, 1995</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0007650309332311">Shapiro &amp; Varian, 1999</xref>). Taking this issue even further, some have focused on power in technical standardization processes, that is, who will gain influence on what part of the process and, not least, how this influence is made invisible in the finalized technical standard (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0007650309332311">Backhouse, Hsu, &amp; Silva, 2006</xref>). These issues, we emphasize, are not concerned with conditions for business to influence government regulation.</p>
<p>Recently, however, there has been an increasing interest in discussing the political aspects of technical standardization. For example, the Journal of European Public Policy devoted a special issue in 2001 to the political and economic aspects of international institutional standards. Although the coupling of government regulation and technical standardization thereby comes into focus, attention is not directed toward the opportunities that this coupling constitutes for corporate political activity. Instead, the macro-political effects of, for example, negative externalities at the societal level of technical standardization is viewed as a problem for the political systems, that is, a problem political systems are responsible for solving. The next logical step in this literature is to try to understand how business strategies in the area of technical standardization are linked with political aspects of technical standardization.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0007650309332311">
<title>The Coupling of Government Regulation With Technical Standards</title>
<p>The literature on the coupling of government regulation with technical standards discusses the coupling from a regulative point of view, typically from the disciplines of law or political science. Although technical standardization as corporate political activity is the flip side of the coin, it is not a perspective discussed in this literature. Corporate political activity in technical standardization figures as something that is possible but which should be prohibited, limited, or domesticated.</p>
<p>The long-standing legal discussion on ways in which legislation may legitimately refer to technical standards (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0007650309332311">Röhling, 1972</xref>) has gained new impetus with the rise of European technical standardization. The so-called new approach to technical harmonization and standards (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0007650309332311">Commission, 1985a</xref>) commonly takes center stage, and it has developed into a wide-reaching policy, systematically using the coupling with European technical standardization as a means to render framework legislation concrete.</p>
<p>This body of literature points out that the separation of politics and technology–perhaps the defining element of the new approach–has proved to be difficult at best. Hence the coupling of government regulation and technical standardization is held to imply that European standardization organizations are making de facto political decisions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0007650309332311">Schepel, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0007650309332311">Wallach, 2002</xref>). There are more responses to this diagnosis. One is that this situation should be met by measures supporting the self-regulation of technical standardization bodies. In this vein, some authors point to the need to invent deliberative mechanisms for “publicly responsible self-regulation” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0007650309332311">Joerges, Vos, &amp; Schepel, 1999</xref>, p. 27). Others instead point at the need for stricter control of competencies delegated to the technical standardization bodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0007650309332311">Egan, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0007650309332311">Egan, 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>This literature offers concepts on forms of coupling of government regulation with technical standardization. It does not develop these concepts into a framework for systematic analysis of the political standardizer, however.</p>
<p>To summarize, some of the literature reviewed focuses on how firms relate to government but does not pay attention to the coupling of government regulation with technical standards (the CPA literature); some of this literature analyzes firm strategies in the area of technical standardization, but does not systematically analyze how such strategies relate to the coupling of government regulation with technical standards (the literature on technical standardization); and some of this literature scrutinizes the coupling of government regulation with technical standards and assumes that such couplings allow for specific types of firm influence, but neither studies nor conceptualizes the possibilities for firm influence that are created by such couplings (the literature on the coupling of government regulation with technical standards). What we offer is a conceptual framework that brings these three bodies of literatures together and allows us to study some of the questions otherwise often implicit in these literatures.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0007650309332311">
<title>Conceptual Framework</title>
<p>Although “there is no standard way of defining standards” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0007650309332311">Krislov, 1997</xref>, p. 7), standard commonly refers to “something established by authority, custom, or general consent as a model or example” (<italic>The Merriam-Webster Dictionary &amp; Thesaurus</italic>). Hence we may talk of both political standards, market standards and technical standards. It is the latter category which interests us specifically in this article; to discuss it in detail, however, we must first briefly touch on other kinds of standards.</p>
<p>A market standard is voluntary. It is a standard you follow because you want to. Such standards are often referred to as de facto standards, and they need not be, but are often formalized. Political standards, by contrast, are binding. These are standards you follow because you have to. They are issued as binding regulation by government or governmental authorities. It is here we find the dominating focus of the CPA literature.</p>
<p>Technical standards are intriguing because, although they sometimes tend toward each of these extreme situations, they constitute a category of their own. Technical standards are voluntary and an outcome of industry self-regulation, and in this sense they are comparable to market standards. But technical standards do not emerge spontaneously, as one may expect market standards to do; by contrast, they are adopted in formalized democratic procedures, organized by the respective technical standardization body. They are thus comparable to political standards; after all, technical standardization is a classic example of industry self-regulation. Technical standards are always formalized: you can buy documents at your local standardization branch, which describe the standard for, for example, toy safety. They are elaborated by technical standardization bodies and are typically the intellectual property of the technical standardization body in question. Strictly speaking, technical standardization bodies do not make technical standards themselves; they orchestrate the work of volunteers. It is open for everyone to volunteer for this work; typically, the work of making technical standards is carried out by private firms, which also finance it.</p>
<p>Government regulations often refer to technical standards. This takes different forms and has different effects. Drawing on the legal literature on technical standards, we want to suggest a distinction between three forms of reference. This conceptual framework allows us to focus on different forms of coregulation and thereby offer a supplement to the focus on government regulation that is oftentimes at the forefront in the CPA literature.</p>
<p>We distinguish three ways that legal regulation may refer to technical standards, namely, state of the art, standard made law, and concretization, each defined by the specificity of the reference. The general and unspecified reference we term <italic>state of the art</italic>. The defining mark of this form of reference is that the government regulation, explicitly and sometimes even implicitly, refers to the limits of the technically possible. This form of reference is general and unspecified in the sense that technical standards are either not mentioned at all in the regulation, or in the sense that technical standards are referred to, yet no specific technical standard is mentioned. Although the reference is unspecified and general, it may have consequences and be made specific on particular occasions, for example, when a court has to rule on whether a collapsing new building is state of the art. Here specific technical standards on construction are likely to inform the court’s ruling. Technical standardization bodies do also commonly work to meet the expectation that technical standards define or reflect the state of the art. As an example, CEN and CENELEC (the counterpart to CEN in the area of electrotechnical standardization) state in their Internal Regulations that the “the European Standard shall . . . take full account of the state of the art” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0007650309332311">CEN/CENELEC, 1991</xref>, p. 107). Although we prefer to keep state of the art as a single category for the purpose of this article, it is worth noticing that this kind of reference is often of such a general nature that it has given rise to several discussions and distinctions with the aim of making it more precise. One example of this is the distinction found within the elaborate German legal and technical discourse that distinguishes between Stand des Wissens (state of knowledge), which denotes state of the art as a technical limit at a specific point in time, and <italic>Stand der Technik</italic> (state of technology),which denotes a state of the art solution that is also economically feasible.</p>
<p><italic>Standard made law</italic>, by contrast, is a reference of a regulation to one or more specific technical standards. This form of reference is also specific in respect to the consequence of the reference: the government regulation stipulates that specific technical standards are to be complied with. Although this reference is specific, this form of reference still covers different degrees of precision. Some references may be to a specific version of a technical standard, whereas other references may be sliding in the sense that the reference is to the technical standard in its most recently updated version.</p>
<p><italic>Concretization</italic> is a reference in government regulation that does not make the technical standard binding. By contrast, the reference suggests the technical standard as one possible way (among others) in which one may comply with the requirements of the regulation. We term this form of reference concretization because, in a business perspective, it serves to concretize the implications of the general requirements of the regulation. The concretization offers an authorized “translation” of the legal requirements into a technical language. This form of referencing is common in the case of framework regulation. The government regulation stipulates the general criteria for, for example, construction products in one piece of framework law, and the reference to technical standards makes it concrete what the general criteria may imply in regard to windows, doors, tiles, bricks, and so on. As in the case of the standard made law, concretization may also take the form of a fixed or a sliding reference.</p>
<p>Technical standardization bodies are well aware of the references of government regulation to technical standards, and both often have preferences as to the form of references and have agreements with the respective government, setting up terms of cooperation (e.g., 1996; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0007650309332311">European Commission, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0007650309332311">ISO IEC Information Centre, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>This conceptual framework allows us to discern different conditions for a firm taking part in technical standardization to influence government policy in ways favorable to the firm. If we talk of state of the art referencing, then the interest of firms may be to have influence on what at any given time may be held to be state of the art, and whether state of the art, for example, is taken to imply the economically feasible or rather what technically is possible. If we talk of standard made law, then firms may use their efforts in technical standardization as leverage for changing the content of a government regulation. If, for example, the government regulation refers to a specific, dated version of a technical standard as the way to fulfill the legal requirements, then an updated version of the technical standard may support firm efforts at updating the reference also, simply by the fact that the reference is to an outdated technical standard. Finally, if we talk of concretization, then firms may use their efforts in technical standardization to influence the technical interpretation of the regulation and hence possibly also the legal interpretation. If you trade in windows, it may be of great importance to you that your claim of conformity with the general criteria of the government regulation is not easily challenged, and also that this claim does not require you to alter your product.</p>
<p>The conceptual framework does not allow us to hypothesize as to what form of reference is preferred by industry. All three have certain advantages and certain drawbacks. In the case of state of the art referencing, industry has the advantage of being relatively unrestricted in regard to what technical standards are developed; the self-regulation is simply to comply with legal requirements in general. Another advantage is that this sort of coupling may be used by firms to fend off government regulation, for example, by claiming that it is not necessary as technical standards on the issue are already published. The disadvantage may be, however, that there is no government reference to ensure that the technical standard is actually adopted by firms.</p>
<p>In the case of standard made law, advantages may include the support of a technical standard by government regulation. A disadvantage, in case of a fixed reference, may be that the flexibility of technical standardization is inhibited, and hence that technical standards are “in force,” which do not reflect state of the art, at least not until the reference is updated. In the case of a sliding reference, the disadvantage may be one of legitimacy: many observers may claim that it is illegitimate that technical standardization de facto determines the content of a government regulation, without the approval of the government in question. On the other hand, it is a benefit that the sliding reference may de facto delegate legislative competences to technical standardization bodies.</p>
<p>In the case of concretization, the advantage may be that business self-regulation is supported by government regulation, whereas the flexibility of technical standardization remains essentially unrestricted. A disadvantage may be that political focus on the technical standardization may increase the span of interests to be looked after in the technical standardization process, creating a potential crowding-out effect. In other words, it may prove more difficult to negotiate a compromise and it may take significantly longer to reach a result.</p>
<p>These specific considerations about the opportunities for the political standardizer are important because they indicate more general conditions of interplay between regulation and self-regulation. A political standardizer such as LEGO may take part in technical standardization for years, even for decades, and use that position when seeking influence on government policy in ways favorable to the firm. Technical standards in an area may be used as an argument that government regulation is unnecessary: the industry may use a body of technical regulation to substantiate this claim. Technical standards in an area may also be used to shape government regulation: the industry has already adopted technical standards and government regulation should be in line with them. Finally, technical standards in an area may be used as an argument for a specific form of regulation, for example, as an argument for framework regulation rather than detailed regulation. In this final case, self-regulation and government regulation may be pursued simultaneously. It demonstrates that regulation and self-regulation need not be a trade off, and our conceptual framework more generally points out that there are possible advantages for industry in pursuing such simultaneity of regulation and self-regulation.</p>
<p>Our conceptual framework, so far, has focused on couplings establishing conditions for firms acting as political standardizers. The next step is to flesh out more specific expectations as to how firms are to use such conditions. What strategies are to be expected, and is any one form of coupling favored over others? With these questions in mind, the next section focuses on the case of LEGO as political standardizer and proceed, based on the case material, with a discussion of the conceptual framework.</p>

<title>Toy Safety in Europe–An Explorative Case Study</title>
<p>During the second half of the 20th century, the LEGO Company has grown to become one of the 10 largest toy producers in world, measured in terms of sales (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0007650309332311">LEGO Group, 2007</xref>, p. 8) and this with a product line that since the 1960s has built almost exclusively on plastic bricks. The following case study of LEGO pursues a historical approach. We focus on the issue of toy safety in Europe in the two decades from 1970 to 1990. This specific period in time is chosen because the EU directive on toy safety was initiated and adopted during these decades.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0007650309332311">1</xref></sup></p>
<p>In the case study we analyze the EU documents on toy safety on one hand and the LEGO Company’s attempts to influence the toy safety environment on the other. In the case study, we focus on the issue of coupling of directive and technical standards; we do not analyze specific content issues, for example, of how to measure transmission of dangerous substances. In short, our focus is on the political standardizer, not on the politics pursued by a political standardizer.</p>
<p>Toy safety emerged simultaneously with the concept of consumer protection. In 1974, the European Commission, in a program on consumer protection, stated that this “concept . . . is comparatively recent” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0007650309332311">Commission, 1974</xref>, p. 3). Toy safety was a prioritized area in this program. Among the objectives of a community consumer policy was “to secure for the consumer . . . the satisfaction of his [<italic>sic</italic>] real needs at the best prices, particularly by . . . encouraging standards of quality which lead to reasonable durability of goods” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0007650309332311">Commission, 1974</xref>, p. 5). This encouraging of standards of quality was to be pursued in collaboration with international organizations such as CEN and other technical standardization organizations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0007650309332311">Commission, 1974</xref>, p. 20).</p>
<p>The Council of Ministers (representing the EC member state governments) adopted the program (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0007650309332311">Council, 1975</xref>), and in the following years the Commission elaborated a proposal for a directive on toy safety. In 1980, the Commission adopted its first proposal for a Council directive on toy safety. The majority of the proposal consisted of appendices that spell out technical requirements. The consultative Economic and Social Committee (ESC) remarked in its response that these technical specifications draw heavily on the technical standards made by CEN. Although the ESC found that the Commission proposal improved the CEN standards, it also asked for coherence between the sets of specifications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0007650309332311">Economic and Social Council, 1981</xref>).</p>
<p>The technical standards in question were not quoted directly in the directive proposal. However, the ESC seems to have set a tone here. In June 1983, the Commission adopted a second and amended proposal for a directive on toy safety (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0007650309332311">Commission, 1983c</xref>). A framework directive that refers to specific other proposed directives was proposed; this framework, again, states the technical specifications. These technical specification were, according to the proposal, to be specified by referencing European technical standards—although with the reservation that the technical standards were to be amended if they were not in keeping with the requirements of the directive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0007650309332311">Commission, 1983a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0007650309332311">1983b</xref>). This change from a nonreferenced borrowing of the language of technical standards in the first proposal to an explicit reference in the second proposal was welcomed by the ESC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0007650309332311">Economic and Social Council, 1984</xref>).</p>
<p>The early 1980s were years of significant change in European integration, a change widely described as a transition from Euro-sclerosis to Euro-optimism. In the context of toy safety, four changes were specifically relevant. In 1983, the Council adopted a directive that formally established cooperation with both European technical standardization organizations and with the respective standardization organizations of the member states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0007650309332311">Council, 1983</xref>). Then, in 1985, this cooperation was further expanded by formalizing, to some extent, a method of harmonization in which the Community adopted framework legislation to be rendered concrete by the European technical standardization bodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0007650309332311">Commission, 1985a</xref>). Later that year, the European Council (representing heads of EC member states) in Milan approved the Commission White Paper on the completion of the internal market (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0007650309332311">Commission, 1985b</xref>). This white paper listed almost 300 measures that were to be adopted to complete the internal market, one of which was the directive on toy safety. Finally, in 1986, the Treaties were amended with the consequence that many measures, such as the toys safety directive, only required qualified majority in Council to be adopted (as opposed to unanimity, which was formerly the rule).</p>
<p>On this background, the Commission made a third proposal for a Council directive on toy safety (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0007650309332311">Commission, 1986</xref>), this time based on the new approach. The directive formulated the essential requirements, and European technical standards were to render these essential requirements concrete. In 1988, the toy safety directive was adopted by the Council as the first new approach directive. Later that same year, three CEN standards were harmonized by the Commission.</p>
<p>After this account of the toy safety directive, we shift attention to LEGO and European technical standardization. In 1971, CEN established the technical committee TC 52 “Safety in toys.” Although LEGO did not take participate, the firm reported that as soon as it became aware that TC 52 was established it applied to become an observer. In addition, LEGO executives felt that consumer protection in general and toy safety more specifically were becoming an issue. As an example, LEGO was criticized for using cadmium pigments for coloring bricks. The firm did not agree with the assertions that cadmium pigments made LEGO bricks unsafe, arguing that the pigments migrated to children playing with bricks only to a very low degree. However, to support this point of view, common norms on the issue would be an advantage.</p>
<p>LEGO engaged itself in European technical standardization also because it expected that technical standards would be referred to in the laws of several countries. Hence
<disp-quote>
<p>it is of crucial importance that LEGO surveys this development sharply, so that once the law becomes a reality, the [production] programme has already been adapted as necessary. . . . it is beyond doubt that many firms, when this time arrives, will meet great difficulties in fulfilling the new, sharper requirements which will be made to toys. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0007650309332311">LEGO Group, 1973</xref>, p. 4)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>On one hand, this line of reasoning follows a strictly business orientation: the first firms to adapt to future market conditions have first mover advantages. But it is also a political line of reasoning: legislative requirements will, to some extent, be formed by the technical requirements made in technical standards. Implicitly, LEGO here argues that in the emerging area of toy safety, European technical standardization is an efficient way to influence legislation of several European states.</p>
<p>A further reason for LEGO to take part in technical standardization was to avoid a variety of national legislations that, for the firm, were difficult to survey. This wish for uniformity led LEGO to implement additional measures. One was to take an initiative to establish toy safety as an item in the International Organization for Standardization, also known as ISO. Once ISO established such a technical committee, LEGO chaired it. Another was to support a Council directive, harmonizing toy safety measures of the member states.</p>
<p>In 1973, Denmark became a member of the Community and was systematically consulted by the Commission on new initiatives. LEGO, being a Danish company, was in turn consulted by the Danish central administration and was also invited to meetings with the Commission as a part of the Danish representation.</p>
<p>After a few years as observing member, LEGO became a full participating member of TC52, and by the early 1980s LEGO chaired the technical committee and made Danish Standards its secretariat. As LEGO concluded, “this has indirectly secured for us a degree of Danish control over work in both the European standards organisation (CEN) and the international organisation (ISO)” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0007650309332311">LEGO Group, 1982</xref>). In conjunction with the relationship established with the Commission, LEGO seems to be established as a central actor. Concluding on the developments of legal standards as well as technical standards, LEGO concludes that it “has participated actively in preparation of virtually all current toy standards” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0007650309332311">LEGO Group, 1981</xref>, p. 28).</p>
<p>LEGO supported that the toy safety directive became a new approach directive, that is, a directive that was to be concretized by European technical standards. Having the chair in the CEN/TC 52, the firm did what it could to speed up the work on European technical standards on toy safety. In this work, members of the Commission took part, both to ensure that the requirements of the (not yet adopted) directive were complied with and to assist in interpreting the proposed directive.</p>
<p>In 1988, the EC directive on toy safety was adopted, and in 1990, it was entered into force (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0007650309332311">LEGO Group, 1989</xref>). Already during 1988 the first three European technical standards on toy safety were harmonized, that is, approved by the Commission as authorized ways in which the general criteria of the framework directive can be complied with.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>This case study, then, provides an example of a political standardizer. What specific politics is pursued by this standardizer, what successes, failures, and effects are achieved is subject for further research.</p>
<p>Drawing on our conceptual framework, it seems that in the mid-1970s, the state of the art reference was prevalent in the Commission program. In the first directive proposal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0007650309332311">1980</xref>), references to technical standards are absent; the directive is to stand on its own as a legal standard. The fact that the content of the proposed directive, however, is nevertheless similar to the European technical standards in the area is raised as an issue. In the second proposed directive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0007650309332311">1983</xref>), direct reference is made to technical standards.</p>
<p>Thereby the referenced standards are made into law. Finally, the directive, as adopted by the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0007650309332311">Council (1988)</xref> refers to technical standards to render the framework concrete. Hence it seems that all three forms of reference spelled out in our conceptual framework can be discerned in this history.</p>
<p>State of the art referencing, it seems, is problematic in the sense that uncertainty arises when it is unknown what technical standards are referred to in legislation. Concretization is preferred, as this sort of referencing explicates what technical standards may be used to fulfill the requirements of the government regulation. Standards made law appears problematic as it takes away flexibility from technical standardization. Again concretization is preferred as it ensures government support of self-regulation. Coregulation may be the word.</p>
<p>It may be surprising to some that LEGO prefers concretization over standard made law. After all, standard made law has the advantage that decisions shaped by the business self-regulation become binding. It does, however, also provide less flexibility: concretization allows firms to find alternative ways to fulfill the legal requirements. And the case seems to suggest that the directive is in any case informed by the technical standards. The fact that Commission officials are present at the meetings of TC 52 suggests that it is not self-evident how the essential requirements of the directive may be rendered concrete. Concretization is a matter of interpretation, and the presence of the Commission in the process of interpretation is to safeguard the political acceptability. This presence of the Commission institutionalizes the political standardizer, it seems; institutional rules imply that a firm representative going to Brussels to take part in a meeting of TC 52 also gets a chance to debate with the Commission. The simultaneity of EU legislation process and European technical standardization hence seems to suggest that technical standardization is not simply a possible support for implementation of new approach directives; much more, new approach directives rely on being rendered concrete by help of technical standards, and this concretization of the framework does not take place once the framework is adopted, but rather during the initiation and the legislation process in the formal EU political system.</p>
<p>Toys can never be safe in the strict sense of the word; they always imply a risk of accidents. This risk of accidents has led LEGO to approach the problem in terms of issue management. Toy safety is taken to be a latent and widely salient issue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0007650309332311">Bonardi &amp; Keim, 2005</xref>). Cases have occurred and will occur again in which a child is killed in an accident involving toys and technical standardization here emerges as part of a strategy for handling latent salient issues. Common norms–that is, common technical standards–deliver an external frame of justification if an accident should occur. In this sense, technical standards for toy safety are not only a means to prevent accidents from occurring but also a means to prevent, if an accident should occur that it becomes an issue that is widely salient. In effect it is a strategy of justifying issues before they become widely salient.</p>
<p>LEGO is a demander of regulation. The case demonstrates that the main issue for LEGO is not one of how to avoid regulation but much more what form of regulation should be demanded. Furthermore, it seems wrong to observe this as a choice between government regulation and avoidance of regulation. What is at stake, rather, is a desired form of coregulation. And we may assume that LEGO, as a political standardizer, has also worked to ensure not only what specific toy safety requirements are set in a particular government regulation but also to ensure that the division of work in the coregulation arrangement was made in a way that is favorable to the interest of LEGO.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0007650309332311">Barry (2002)</xref> suggested that we distinguish between politics and the political. Politics is, in line with the CPA literature, what concerns decisions made by formal political institutions. By contrast, the political is simply that which is contested. Drawing on this distinction, Barry notes that it is often the role of politics to turn contested issues into noncontested ones. It seems that the political standardizer may also be engaged in politics in the sense of turning contested issues into noncontested ones. Furthermore, the political standardizer may also take part in struggles of where and how this turning of contested issues into noncontested ones is to take place. This allows the political standardizer to take part in struggles of whether and to what degree this turning contested issues into noncontested ones is to take place in a formal political institution or in technical standardization bodies. The political standardizer also does this when, for example, it takes part in struggles about delimitation of political decision making from technical standardization and what form referencing should take.</p>
<p>Such delimination struggles concern the forum in which decisions are to take place. In this perspective, it is interesting to contrast the account given above with the following: In the Safety of Toys case, Europeans managed the ISO toy committee but preferred to conduct most of the technical work, mandated by a [EU] Safety of Toys Directive, in the CEN [European Committee for Standardisation] toy committee from which non-Europeans were excluded. In the mid-1990s, [the U.S.-based] ANSI [American National Standards Institute] protested this exclusion and argued that the standardization work should be brought back to ISO, given the global interest in toy safety. When Europeans resisted this demand, ANSI proceeded to compile a list of non-European countries with significant toy manufacturing and dispatched officials to meet with the leaders of toy associations and national standards bodies in these countries and to encourage them to become members in the ISO toy committee. These efforts paid off; many non-European countries became active committee members and sided with the Americans when the toy committee met in Miami in 1996 and approved a new ISO global standard as a committee item, superseding the draft international standard developed by CEN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0007650309332311">Mattli &amp; Büthe, 2003</xref>, p. 30).</p>
<p>Mattli and Büthe’s analysis, viewed in conjunction with our analysis given above, seems to suggest that there is no stable institutional locus for regulation of toy safety. Toy safety is in focus in government regulation (of the EU, the United States, Germany, etc.) and also in focus in self-regulation (of CEN, ISO, ANSI, etc.), and this has allowed for struggles over where toy safety is to be defined and when. It seems that LEGO has pursued a double strategy. On one hand, LEGO has pushed for international technical standardization in toy safety. On the other hand, LEGO has favored decisions that keep the technical standardization work in Europe, at least for a while, and to develop European technical standards first, thereby trying to make European initiatives the basis for subsequent international efforts.</p>

<sec id="section8-0007650309332311">
<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>By political standardizer we mean an actor that takes part in technical standardization to influence government policy in ways favorable to the firm. Our aim in introducing this concept into the CPA literature is to contribute to narrowing the gap between CPA research and CPA practice. We chose LEGO as an example, but it is certainly not the only firm in which corporate technical activities and corporate political activities are sometimes hard to distinguish. The concept of the political standardizer therefore opens an important area of future research: how prevalent are political standardizers and how do their combined activities affect whole markets and economies? Also, what institutional preconditions foster effective political standardizers?</p>
<p>A political standardizer purposely seeks points of contact between technical standardization and government regulation. Unlike more familiar forms of lobbying, this combining of political and technical activity is not necessarily carried out with the aim of blocking government policy, that is, avoiding regulation. Rather, technical standards are deliberately developed to anticipate the demands of policy-makers in the hope of shaping policy to support rather than constrain the flexibility and uniformity of technical standardization. Here the concept of the political standardizer invites research in c007-regulation more generally. When more parties regulate in a certain area, such as toy safety, CPA research is confronted with the question of whether one of the regulating parties unambiguously dominates the other part or whether the parties in certain respects are on an equal footing.</p>
<p>The toy safety case suggests that the EU and the technical standardizers are on an equal footing in the sense that the legal requirements are open for interpretation. Indeed, one cannot simply dismiss the possibility that technical regulation in certain respects dominates political regulation. After all, once the toy safety directive was adopted, it was concretized by technical standards that were adopted before the directive. The new approach of the EU is often presented in ways that dismiss this question of domination. In formal presentations, EU regulation is assumed unambiguously to dominate the technical regulation of CEN in the sense that the framework directive decides the legal requirements that the voluntary technical standards are to respect. Such presentations of the new approach do not take into account that political activity and technical activity can overlap substantially or intertwine in ways quite difficult to tease apart analytically.</p>
<p>When the two activities overlap substantially, corporate political activity will be carried out without necessarily being called “politics.” CPA research must be on the lookout for politics by other names. If corporate technical activity can be a corporate political activity, then we should expect that other forms of activity, such as corporate branding, corporate social responsibility, and corporate issues management can sometimes also be corporate political activities. To firms pursuing corporate political activity, acknowledging politics by other names may prove to be advantageous. Our advice to such firms would be to look beyond the departments that are usually regarded as politically relevant, such as the corporate affairs department, and take, for example, certain engineering departments into account as well.</p>
<p>Engineering departments may be central actors in corporate technical activity, and may not immediately appear to the firm as “CPA relevant” as the name of the department and the external contacts of the department are not political by name. CPA research is already moving in the direction of paying more attention to CPA that is not overtly political. CPA research does so when focusing on indirect forms of CPA, for example, when paying attention to nongovernmental institutions and to issues management. Indirect forms of influence on government regulation are already suggested as a direction for future research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0007650309332311">Hillman et al., 2004</xref>). We take this suggestion one step further by drawing attention to coregulation. Coregulation is about indirect forms of influence also. But more generally, coregulation is about government regulation and regulation by nongovernment bodies working together. This cooperation leads us beyond indirect forms of influence on government regulation in so far as it also provides us a focus on firms’ direct influence on self-regulation.</p>
<p>The conceptual framework presented invites further studies of the political standardizer and other indirect strategies in corporate political activity. Technical standardization may, after all, be described as a specific form of business self-regulation. As such, it is not one of a kind. Examples of business self-regulation may include, for example, regulation of the internet and best practices set up by business associations. The extent to which self-regulation is coupled with government regulation may vary, but the couplings established can in any case be studied with the conceptual framework we have presented.</p>

<p>Government regulation is here European Community law. This is to say that the EU is here taken to be a government in a broader sense as it makes binding decisions. In the case description, we seek to avoid the word regulation as in regard to the EU it denotes a specific form of European Community law, for example, to be distinguished from directives. However, in the sense we deploy the term regulation, both EU regulations and directives are covered.</p>
