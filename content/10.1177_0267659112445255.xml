<p>Intraoperative Echocardiography is an essential tool in the perioperative management of patients undergoing cardiac and vascular surgery or those with major trauma. Echocardiographic assessment in the operating theatre can be a challenge even for the most experienced practitioner. The practical difficulties, addressed in this excellent guide to procedural imaging, are aimed not at the expert echocardiographer but the clinician wishing to use it in the peri-operative setting.</p>
<p>All but one of the contributing authors are anaesthetists and the other is an echocardiography expert. The editor of this book, the internationally renowned Professor Catherine Otto, is herself an expert in echocardiography and author of multiple texts in this field.</p>
<p>The information is presented as a concise, bulleted text accompanied by numerous illustrations, tables and flow charts. The book includes technical details, common pitfalls and clinical interpretation and is divided into 12 chapters including aortic, mitral, tricuspid, pulmonic and prosthetic heart valves, the aorta and cardiac masses. Each chapter is a very manageable 20 – 30 pages. The key points are clearly identified making it a memorable teaching tool. It is not meant to be a comprehensive reference textbook and is portable and concise.</p>
<p>One of the many attributes of this book is the scientific language which is clear and flows naturally. All tables, diagrams and boxes with key points are precise, up-to-date and clinically relevant. The echocardiographic images used are of the highest quality, clearly illustrating clinical scenarios discussed in the text. The management algorithms are both logical and well presented. The book comes with a link to web based video case examples. The whole text may be accessed electronically – particularly useful in the theatre setting.</p>
<p>By taking the reader through the examination step by step the risks of missing a particular view are minimized. There is an extremely helpful section on insertion and positioning of a variety of devices, including devices for closure of intracardiac shunts, cannulas for cardiopulmonary bypass, ventricular assist devices and etc.</p>
<p>It was a pleasure to have the opportunity to review this book and I would highly recommend it not only to cardiac surgeons and cardiac anaesthetists, but also to echocardiographers. This is a wonderful overview of the vast pathology and diagnostic and therapeutic dilemmas encountered in the management of the adult cardiac surgical patient.</p>
