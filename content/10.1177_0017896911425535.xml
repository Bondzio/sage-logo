<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Childhood overweight and obesity is an international public health problem.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0017896911425535">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0017896911425535"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0017896911425535">3</xref></sup> The prevalence of overweight and obesity in American children aged six to 11 years is 18 per cent.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0017896911425535">2</xref></sup> Furthermore, this is worse in two-to-five-year-old disadvantaged American populations. For example, the prevalence of overweight and obesity among disadvantaged north central two-to-five-year-olds enrolled in federally funded health programs ranges from 25 per cent to 35 per cent<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0017896911425535">4</xref></sup> (p.1458). Although the Healthy People 2020 reaffirmed the 2010 objective of reducing the proportion of children and adolescents who are overweight or obese,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0017896911425535">5</xref></sup> the Institute of Medicine (IOM) report on <italic>Progress in Preventing Childhood Obesity</italic> indicates that preventive efforts on this public health problem remain fragmented and are on a small scale.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0017896911425535">6</xref></sup> Successful strategies to reduce obesity in other countries have focused on changing social norms to promote healthful eating and physical activity and the key prevention opportunity rests from birth.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0017896911425535">6</xref></sup> Interventions aimed at behavioural and lifestyle changes such as nutritional intake are provided by the State Expanded Food and Nutrition Education Programs (EFNEP). However, it has been reported that as few as 5 per cent of disadvantaged families eligible for EFNEP receive it due to limited staff within state extension offices<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0017896911425535">7</xref></sup>. Current financial challenges to these entities will create further barriers to providing this type of education. Therefore, it is necessary to investigate an alternative method for providing nutritional education associated with infant feeding practices to those populations whose childhood obesity rates are consistently increasing.</p>
<p>The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that solid foods should be introduced to infants between four and six months of age.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0017896911425535">8</xref></sup> However, factors such as lack of infant cue recognition, infant behaviour and the power of family and friends can influence disadvantaged mothers, making them more likely to introduce solids earlier than recommended <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0017896911425535">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0017896911425535"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0017896911425535">11</xref></sup>. Interventions aimed at reducing childhood obesity should be targeted to disadvantaged mothers of newborn children as introduction of solid food before four months of age has been identified as a significant risk factor for childhood obesity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0017896911425535">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0017896911425535"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0017896911425535"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0017896911425535">12</xref></sup></p>
<p>Intervention programs aimed at nutritional education for disadvantaged mothers are usually delivered by face-to-face sessions in the mother’s residence. However, arranging a home visit and successfully finding the mother at home can be both challenging and costly, contributing to the low number of families reached.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0017896911425535">7</xref></sup> This overall lack of evidence-based knowledge regarding sound infant feeding practices may cause mothers to look to other sources of information related to infant feeding; namely, family and friends who may reinforce lifestyle and behaviour risk factors associated with overweight and obesity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0017896911425535">13</xref></sup> Most often a mother will seek advice from her mother but other interpersonal sources can be extended to family members, friends, church or work associates.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0017896911425535">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0017896911425535">14</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0017896911425535"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0017896911425535">16</xref></sup> Prevention efforts to delay the early introduction of solid foods before four to six months can prove invaluable in the prevention of childhood obesity when the education intervention can reach disadvantaged mothers of newborn children.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0017896911425535">9</xref></sup></p>
<p>Questions have been raised regarding the use of computer and internet technologies with disadvantaged populations because digital media or internet surfing requires access, cognitive knowledge and skill to actively search for health information.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0017896911425535">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0017896911425535">16</xref></sup> However, it has been noted that disadvantaged populations may not be challenged by the internet as a recent research reported that women preferred website over print and game modalities, and the use of website resulted in greater knowledge outcomes than with print and games.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0017896911425535">7</xref></sup> Interactive multimedia delivery of food safety for the Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) program has been shown to be successful and the participants reported that they would like to learn more about interactive media<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0017896911425535">17</xref></sup>. However, research must determine if a self-directed computer supported lesson can be delivered at home. The aim of this study is to identify paraprofessionals’ perceptions regarding the feasibility of delivering a self-directed computer-supported nutrition educational intervention to disadvantaged mothers of infants in their homes.</p>

<title>Methods</title>
<p>A qualitative focus group design was conducted to ascertain paraprofessionals’ perceptions regarding a self-directed computer-supported nutrition educational intervention to disadvantaged mothers of infants, to allow for exploration of social experiences during the first week in June 2009. A semi-structured interview guide (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0017896911425535">Table 1</xref>) was used as a guide to explore subjective attitudes and beliefs.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0017896911425535">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0017896911425535">19</xref></sup> The study was reviewed and approved by Michigan State University Institutional Review Board (IRB). Informed written consent for voluntary participation and audio taping was obtained prior to each focus group interview. Each focus group lasted approximately 90 minutes and the participants were given a small gift bag as a token of appreciation for their time.</p>

<p>Focus group participants (<italic>n</italic> = 16) were from three Expanded Food and Nutrition Programs (EFNEP) in a Midwestern state in the United States. Most participants were paraprofessionals (<italic>n</italic> = 14); one was an MSUE supervisor and one was a data collector from a nutrition education research project with disadvantaged families. All paraprofessionals were female (mean age = 52 years; range 30–69 years) who had been educating young children and mothers for several years (range 1.5 years to 24 years). Race and ethnicity were self-identified. A majority of the paraprofessionals had at least some college education (<italic>n</italic> = 11) and provided one-on-one lessons in the client’s residence (<italic>n</italic> = 15).</p>
<p>Transcription of paraprofessionals’ audio taped comments was done verbatim by an outside transcriptionist who had the aid of the recorder’s anecdotal notes to maintain accuracy and clarity. NVivo8 qualitative data analysis software was used to manage the focus group transcript data.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0017896911425535">20</xref></sup> Two research assistants rated the response data independently. Codes were reviewed collaboratively by the primary investigator and two research assistants; 100 per cent agreement was obtained by consensus to retain the identified code structuring themes.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>Three major themes emerged from the content analysis of the data: (1) paraprofessionals’ perceptions of personal connections with learners, (2) paraprofessionals’ perceptions of lesson plans; and (3) paraprofessionals’ perception of self-directed lessons.</p>
<sec id="section10-0017896911425535">
<title>Paraprofessionals’ perceptions of personal connections with learners</title>
<p>Paraprofessionals’ perceptions of personal connections were defined as references to building personal relationships with learners during delivery of lessons and curricula. Most of the paraprofessionals believed that their learners accepted messages on nutritional educational lessons because of the ‘trust’ built from a ‘relationship’ they had with the educator. The paraprofessionals described that learners often needed to make a choice between the advice the paraprofessional gave and the advice they had received from family and friends.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>…sometimes you can get that connection with them, and you can kind of talk to them. I don’t talk to them like ‘I know more than you’, or ‘I’m going teach you this’. You have to be at their level. You need to give them the opportunity to make that choice themselves. They can make that decision and ask you questions.</p>
<p>Time with the mom is as important as anything you have to say.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Paraprofessionals reported that this personal connection gave their educational messages more ‘authority or believability’ with this population of learners. Paraprofessionals mentioned there is a certain amount of ‘suspicion’ conveyed by this population. The paraprofessionals talked about the challenges they faced from the influence of many learners’ family members.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Depending on that person and that connection… if I’ve already felt close to them, or felt like they appreciated what I had to tell them… if they felt comfortable with me because they know ‘she’s not going to try and hurt me’ or ‘she’s not going to go back and tell somebody on me, or, get my baby taken away’.</p>
<p>And also they’re suspicious. That grandmother is suspicious.</p>
<p>They get a lot of advice from their mother or from a sister, or a cousin, or aunt.</p>
<p>We have to walk very carefully and not to be disrespectful of their mother.</p>
<p>One thing, I try to find a nice way to say it. I might say, ‘well, it seems like you’re asking me; because you’re questioning the advice you’re getting from somewhere else. So I’ll tell you what I know, or what I think, and then you really just have to do what you’re most comfortable with’.</p>
<p>But I don’t push. I say to them: I bring the information, I want to share with [you].</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Paraprofessionals discussed that it usually took time to build a trusting relationship and confidence with a learner.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>It usually takes two to three visits.</p>
<p>… they feel confident and safe… I know some moms really enjoy having that. When I go out for a home visit they might say: ‘oh, I’m happy to see you’; you know they want that visit. Then other moms act like, ‘oh here she is again’. When you have that first kind of connection and confidence then you’re able to tell them, ‘I think you might want to look at this’, or, can tell them what you think they’re not doing right, but in a gentle way, especially if you have that confidence.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-0017896911425535">
<title>Paraprofessionals’ perceptions of lesson plans</title>
<p>Paraprofessionals’ perceptions of lesson plans were defined as the way the curriculum is presented to the learner population by the paraprofessional. Paraprofessionals primarily provide handouts during their lesson and used food preparation or other hands-on activities throughout the lessons to help learners stay focused on the lesson.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Not like a long… you know story. You just want to have bullet points.</p>
<p>Ten-minute activities that they can do and see and it illustrates [the information being taught], I think that is huge.</p>
<p>But if you could do an activity to demonstrate the handout, it’s an entirely different thing. I took some formula with me in little cups. And… I asked moms if they want to taste it. I had one mom taste it and, she was just like, ugh! I explained this is what you’re giving the baby.</p>
<p>You have to see it to believe it.</p>
<p>Delivery that works best with our population that you can do with any age is modelling whatever behaviour you’re talking about.</p>
<p>And maybe bring a toy, or bring a, whatever, that pertains to (what you are teaching).</p>
<p>Hands-on and that icebreaker kind of thing, and movin’ around, and some kind of game thing is going to keep their attention.</p>
<p>It needs to be entertaining, or I mean, I don’t know, have good information but not be just boring.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Other strategies used by the paraprofessionals to engage this population of learners to participate in lessons were incentives.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>I had a lot of moms coming for the first time and I really think it’s because they knew they would get a gift.</p>
<p>Their name could go in a drawing, to get something that the next time you would go out, or you would send it or whatever, so they would have an opportunity to maybe get something.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-0017896911425535">
<title>Paraprofessionals’ perceptions of self-directed lessons</title>
<p>Paraprofessionals’ perceptions of self-directed lessons were defined as participation and compliance with delivery methods, lessons and curriculum delivered without face-to-face interaction with the educator.</p>
<p>Paraprofessionals believed there were many competing demands when they went to visit mothers in their homes and were concerned they would still exist with self-directed computer-supported lessons.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Television is on all the time (several people agree)… a distraction.</p>
<p>I think I have been to three houses where the TVs weren’t on [from a paraprofessional who had been working with EFNEP for more than three years].</p>
<p>Because I have families with kids that are very hyper I’m taking their mother’s attention. So what I used to do is bring colour books.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The internet was one of the ways paraprofessionals suggested to deliver self-directed lessons. Paraprofessionals shared varied experiences regarding their learner population and their use of certain technology.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>She has her computer beside the dining room. And she says, she does not know how to turn it on.</p>
<p>No, mine wouldn’t [go onto the internet).</p>
<p>Some of them, if they had internet service [go onto the internet]. I mean the way their phones come and go, financially I can’t imagine their computer things would be consistent.</p>
<p>If they can pay for it (internet service); it depends. I mean sometimes they have it, and then… you know, if they are having phone trouble, they don’t. But a lot of people have computers. A lot of our families have computers.</p>
<p>Everyone has a DVD player.</p>
<p>I would say half or less have internet service at home, or easily accessible.</p>
<p>I think the internet would be good if they all had it. If they all had it, they would do it no problem. Especially if it was something they were already using like Facebook, or YouTube. But, it’s just the ones that don’t [have internet], won’t put the effort into going somewhere to do it.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>This study provides an insight regarding the feasibility of in-home delivery of self-directed computer-supported lessons. Paraprofessionals’ generally agreed that early nutrition education of mothers on healthy feeding practices for their newborn children could be delivered via a computer-supported format. The paraprofessionals in this sample, albeit through experience, recognized the importance of adult learning principles such as: safety; sound relationships and respect for learners as decision-makers; ideas, feelings and action.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0017896911425535">21</xref></sup></p>
<p>Paraprofessionals recognized the need to respect learners as a decision-maker who had connectedness with external sources of influences such as their mothers, grandmothers, family and friends. In our study, normative influences and the use of family as information sources were identified as strong influences on feeding advice.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0017896911425535">10</xref></sup> This is supported by other research on disadvantaged mothers.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0017896911425535">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0017896911425535">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0017896911425535">22</xref></sup> Overcoming these strong influences and being accepted takes time. Paraprofessionals believe it takes more than two home visits to establish a relationship strong enough for mothers to listen and accept what they have to say. Interestingly, paraprofessionals hypothesized a self-directed lesson given to the mother may be shared with her sceptical mother/grandmother, potentially overcoming conflicting socially derived feeding practices. Paraprofessionals agree self-directed lessons could enhance the current face-to-face strategies used, allowing mothers to learn more content with fewer face-to-face visits. Since only 5 per cent of disadvantaged families eligible for EFNEP receive it due to limited staff within state extension offices, a blended program may offer EFNEP paraprofessionals an alternative way to reach more mother-infant dyads.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0017896911425535">7</xref></sup></p>
<p>The main teaching method used by paraprofessionals in this sample was hands-on learning or modelling since they believed new mothers ‘had to see it to believe it’. Engaging the learner in the information they are learning is another principle of adult learning.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0017896911425535">16</xref></sup> Both the interactive multimedia food safety program and increasing nutrition literacy studies support this principle as well.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0017896911425535">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0017896911425535">17</xref></sup> One paraprofessional wished she had the ability to model maternal feeding responsiveness to baby cues like ‘this one means she is hungry or this one means she is full’ and you would do this or that. Current literature hypothesized that maternal failure to recognize and act on such infant cues may contribute to obesity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0017896911425535">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0017896911425535">10</xref></sup></p>
<p>Some of the concerns verbalized by the paraprofessionals were of the competing demands they encountered with this population during face-to-face meetings. Paraprofessionals were concerned that distractions such as television viewing and childcare responsibilities would interfere with completion of the lessons if the paraprofessionals were not physically present supervising the lesson. Paraprofessionals pointed out that the possibility of receiving a ‘prize’ could be a powerful incentive and suggested entering the names of those mothers who successfully completed the self-directed computer-supported lesson into a draw for a chance to win something as simple as a gallon of detergent or diapers.</p>
<p>A second concern of the paraprofessionals was the characteristics of the proposed technology without considering the appropriateness to the target population.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0017896911425535">7</xref></sup> Paraprofessionals indicated their clients used cell phones and computers but due to economic fluctuations, they may not have consistent cell phone or internet access. Other paraprofessionals indicated clients have computers but do not necessarily know how to use them. It was the consensus of the paraprofessionals that there was a wide range of computer literacy within the target population they serviced. Interestingly, more than half of the paraprofessionals claimed they themselves do not use personal computers and would not feel comfortable troubleshooting issues and problems clients may encounter. Technology may pose challenges to researchers wishing to implement nutrition education lessons supported by computer methods related to the variable computer literacy in both the paraprofessional and the population of interest.</p>
<p>This study is limited by the experiences of the paraprofessionals who were interviewed. Other limitations include the generalizability of the findings to other paraprofessional experiences with disadvantaged populations, as this small sample of paraprofessionals was from three EFNEP offices in one US north central state. In addition, one focus group included the state extension office paraprofessional supervisor, which may have impeded the free flow of comments within that particular focus group.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section14-0017896911425535" sec-type="conclusions">
<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>This study supports the view that a preventive nutrition educational program, focusing on the reduction of childhood obesity though infant feeding practices, can be feasibly delivered using a combination of direct contact paraprofessional education and self-directed computer-supported lessons. Findings provided exemplars of various paraprofessional teaching strategies that can be used with this disadvantaged population of mothers. The self-directed computer-supported lesson has the potential of modelling behaviours and lifestyle patterns thought to reduce the risk of childhood obesity in an interactive format. Certainly, the wide range of computer literacy and other potential technological difficulties identified by paraprofessionals within this population is a challenge. Further research, through development of a culturally relevant interactive DVD or CD-ROM, targeting infant feeding practices is recommended.</p>
