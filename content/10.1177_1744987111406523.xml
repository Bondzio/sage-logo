<abstract>
<p>The aims of this pilot study were to describe registered nurses’ attitudes toward nurses with disabilities in the hospital nursing work force, explore factors contributing to these attitudes and explore the concept of disability climate in the hospital workplace.</p>
<p>The web-based 37-item Nurses’ Attitudes toward Nurses with Disabilities Scale (NANDS) was administered to a convenience sample of 131 registered nurses working in three urban tertiary care hospitals.</p>
<p>Respondents with experience caring for patients with disabilities indicated a significantly more positive perception of accessibility in the workplace and more positive attitudes toward the capability of nurses with disabilities than those without patient exposure. Respondents with higher levels of education indicated a higher level of Americans with Disabilities Act awareness. The disability climate was significantly more positive in outpatient clinics than in intensive care unit environments.</p>
<p>Nurses with physical and sensory disabilities may feel more welcomed in areas serving patients with lower acuities. Greater exposure to individuals with disabilities positively impacts attitudes toward this population. The NANDS may be useful to assist employers and nursing administrators in assessing and creating healthy, disability-friendly work environments that promote a positive disability climate and improve the work experience for nurses with disabilities.</p>

<sec id="sec1-1744987111406523" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title>
<p>Individuals with disabilities have been underrepresented in the nursing work force, although data to support this fact is difficult to obtain; anecdotal evidence, however, is widespread (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1744987111406523">Doe, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1744987111406523">Yox, 2003</xref>). Since the enactment of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) of 1990, all employers must provide reasonable accommodation for their employees with disabilities, including nurses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1744987111406523">ADA, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1744987111406523">U.S. Department of Labor, 2006</xref>). The ADA seeks to protect qualified individuals with disabilities in America from employment discrimination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1744987111406523">U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, 2000</xref>). This applies to all phases of employment, including the hiring process, interviewing, orientation and actual performance of the job. Despite this legal protection, societal attitudes continue to separate people with disabilities in the workplace, leading to workers’ underestimation of the capabilities of people with disabilities with whom they work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1744987111406523">Mackelprang and Salsgiver, 1999</xref>). This may be particularly true in the nursing profession because of the physical and sensory nature of nurses’ work, which often requires lifting patients, listening to heart and lung sounds, observing patient condition and behaviour, and palpating. Although there has been research on attitudes toward individuals with disabilities in a variety of settings, there has been no research on factors influencing the attitudes of nurses in the hospital workplace toward individuals with physical or sensory disabilities in the nursing work force.</p>
<p>The purpose of this study was to: (1) describe the attitudes of registered nurses toward nurses with disabilities in the hospital nursing work force; (2) explore factors contributing to these attitudes; and (3) explore the concept of disability climate in the hospital workplace.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec2-1744987111406523"><title>Design and methods</title>
<p>This study was a pilot test of the Nurses’ Attitudes toward Nurses with Disabilities Scale (NANDS) instrument, a tool developed as an outgrowth of a qualitative study of nurses with disabilities that is reported elsewhere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1744987111406523">Matt, 2008</xref>). The instrument was distributed using a web-based format. The study utilised a cross-sectional design. Variables investigated were perception of organisational climate and attitudes toward nurses with disabilities working in hospital settings. The aims of the study were: (1) to explore the relationships between the respondent’s age, level of experience with individuals with disabilities, specialty units, years of nursing experience, level of education and professional role and their responses to questions regarding attitudes toward nurses with disabilities in the hospital workplace; and (2) to examine the relationship between perceptions of climate and these attitudes.</p>
<sec id="sec3-1744987111406523"><title>Setting and sample</title>
<p>The survey was administered to a convenience sample of registered nurses working in three Puget Sound area tertiary care hospitals. Participants were recruited via flyers posted in break rooms on patient care units and email messages. Each of the three study sites employs approximately 1000 registered nurses. To be eligible, subjects had to be registered nurses, currently employed on a patient care unit of a hospital (either inpatient or outpatient) and have had at least six months experience in their current position.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="sec4-1744987111406523"><title>Theoretical and conceptual frameworks</title>
<p>Organisational climate literature identifies Lewinian field theory as its root (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1744987111406523">Denison, 1996</xref>). According to Lewin, ‘only by the concrete whole which comprises the object and the situation are the vectors which determine the dynamics of the event defined’ (as cited in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1744987111406523">Litwin, 1968</xref>: 43). Lewin’s model is illustrated by the equation, <italic>B </italic>= <italic>f</italic>(<italic>P</italic>, <italic>E</italic>), in which <italic>B</italic> is behaviour that is a function of an interaction between <italic>P</italic> (the person) and <italic>E</italic> (the person’s immediate psychological environment. Lewin described the concept of life space as the ‘totality of facts which determine the behavior of an individual at a certain moment, including the person and his environment which have to be considered as one’ (as cited in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1744987111406523">Litwin, 1968</xref>: 43–44).</p>
<p>The ecological model expands Lewin’s theoretical framework further to encompass the impact of various levels of a hospital organisation on the environment at the work unit level and was the basis for the conceptual model underlying this research. An in depth description of the model was previously published (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1744987111406523">Matt and Butterfield, 2006</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec5-1744987111406523"><title>The study instrument</title>
<p>The NANDS consists of two subscales: Organisational Climate and Feelings/Attitudes. The Organisational Climate subscale measures observations and perceptions related to disabilities in the respondent’s workplace, and includes 16 items rated on a six-point Likert-type scale, ranging from 1 (<italic>strongly disagree</italic>) to 6 (<italic>strongly agree</italic>). The Feelings/Attitudes subscale addresses respondents’ attitudes toward working with nurses who have physical or sensory disabilities on their work units and includes 21 items rated on the same scale. Four items were added to measure respondents’ personal and professional experience with individuals with disabilities on scales from 0 (<italic>no experience or contact</italic>) to 3 or 4 (<italic>high level of experience or contact</italic>). Items include response options ‘I don’t know’ and ‘I prefer not to answer’. In addition, data were collected on respondents’ disability status, type of disability, whether or not the disability has been disclosed to coworkers and/or supervisor, whether or not accommodation is needed, age, gender, years of nursing experience and area of nursing practice.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec6-1744987111406523"><title>Study procedures</title>
<p>The survey was pilot tested as a web-based survey on the University of Washington-supported Catalyst website. It was available on the website from 1 November 2007 to 31 January 2008 for two study sites and from 1 April 2008 to 31 May 2008 for the third site. Email recruitment messages were sent from hospital administration to nurse managers on patient care units for dissemination to registered nurse staff. In addition, flyers were posted in staff break rooms on hospital units. A second email message was sent one month into the recruitment effort. The survey included three screening questions that served to determine eligibility for the study and required a positive response to all three questions in order to proceed to the substantive questions. The survey itself took about 20 minutes to complete. Upon completion of the survey, each subject had the opportunity to follow a link to a separate website to register for a drawing for one of six Thinklabs Electronic Stethoscopes as an incentive for participating in the study.</p>
<sec id="sec7-1744987111406523"><title>Protection of human subjects</title>
<p>This study was approved by the University of Washington Human Subjects Division, the Benaroya Research Institute at Virginia Mason and all appropriate committees at participating facilities prior to subject recruitment. In addition, approval was obtained from the Seattle University Institutional Review Board prior to final data analysis.</p>

<sec id="sec9-1744987111406523"><title>Sample</title>
<p>Responses were received from 145 registered nurses: 131 met eligibility criteria. Sample characteristics are summarised in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1744987111406523">Table 1</xref>. Participants reflected the aging demographics of the nursing work force, with a mean age of 44 (range = 23–65). Years of experience in nursing were similarly high, with an average of 17 years (range = 8–39). As expected, since nursing remains a female-dominated profession, 98% of the respondents were female. Over three-quarters of the study respondents held a baccalaureate degree or higher, with 13 at the master’s level and three having attained a professional or doctoral degree. The majority of respondents were staff nurses (87%) as opposed to administrators or managers. About 14% self-identified as having some kind of disability. There was no statistically significant difference between the three sites on any of these characteristics (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1744987111406523">Table 1</xref>).

<p>Study respondents reported working in 29 different work units, representing critical care, emergency room, operating room (OR), post-surgical care, medical/surgical units and outpatient clinics. For data analysis, these were aggregated to intensive care unit (ICU), medical/surgical units, OR/post-surgical care units, outpatient clinic/short stay units, other (not elsewhere classified) and other (not identified by the respondent). Almost one quarter of the respondents work primarily in an ICU environment, over one third work in a medical/surgical setting, about 14% work in outpatient clinics or short stay units, and about 16% practice in an OR or post-surgical care unit. There were no statistically significant differences in distribution of work location between the three sites (Chi-square = 12.782; <italic>df</italic> = 10; <italic>p</italic> = 0.24).</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="sec10-1744987111406523"><title>Data analysis</title>
<p>Data were transferred from the website using Excel and analysed using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences 17.0 for Windows (SPSS) with the statistical significance set at 0.05 for all comparisons. Descriptive statistics were calculated for each item of the Organisational Climate and Feelings/Attitude subscales in order to establish overall response distributions. One-way analysis of variance and post hoc tests were used to explore differences between groups on disability climate and attitudes toward nurses with disabilities, as well as to explore whether significant differences existed between study sites with respect to personal characteristics of the samples.</p>

<sec id="sec11-1744987111406523"><title>Disability climate and nurses’ attitudes toward nurses with disabilities</title>
<p>The overall results of the survey by subscale are summarised in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1744987111406523">Tables 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1744987111406523">3</xref>. For the purposes of data analysis, ‘I don’t know’ was treated as a neutral value of 4, expanding the scale from a six-point to a seven-point Likert-type scale, and ‘I prefer not to answer’ was treated as a missing value, reflected in the <italic>n</italic> for each individual item. The factors identified in each of the two subscales are described below. Internal consistency among subscale factors was acceptable for five of the eight subscale factors, with non-accommodating, physical plant accessibility, and absolute barrier falling below generally acceptable measures (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-1744987111406523">Table 4</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1744987111406523">Netemeyer, Bearden and Sharma, 2003</xref>).

</table-wrap></p>
<sec id="sec12-1744987111406523"><title>Organisational Climate subscale</title>
<p>The Organisational Climate subscale was comprised of 14 items, making up four factors, which are described below (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1744987111406523">Table 2</xref>).</p>
<sec id="sec13-1744987111406523"><title>Social inclusion</title>
<p>The social inclusion component includes four items examining nurses’ perceptions of whether or not unit social activities are planned with an inclusive approach for nurses with disabilities and whether these individuals would feel comfortable participating in these events. The overall mean for this factor was 4.64 (range = 4.38–4.96), indicating a general perception that nurses with disabilities are included in unit social events and their needs are considered when social events are planned. The item with the highest mean score measured perceptions of whether or not nurses with disabilities would have a problem participating in unit social events (mean = 4.96), indicating a slightly stronger positive perception that nurses with disabilities would not have a problem participating in these events.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec14-1744987111406523"><title>Supportive climate</title>
<p>Four items were designed to focus on perceptions of how welcoming the unit is as a whole toward nurses with disabilities, whether the unit supervisor makes any attempt to educate staff about working with individuals with disabilities and whether there is a perception that unit nurses would be willing to accommodate nurses with disabilities to help them perform their jobs. The overall mean for this factor was 4.05 (range = 2.59–5.75), indicating a general perception that the unit and hospital overall present a neutral supportive climate for nurses with disabilities. The item with the lowest mean score measured nurses’ perceptions that the unit supervisor provides education about workers with disabilities. The item with the highest mean score assessed perceptions of general hospital accessibility.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec15-1744987111406523"><title>ADA Awareness</title>
<p>There were four items that looked at nurses’ awareness of ADA compliance and diversity in general in the hospital. The overall mean for this factor was 5.09 (range = 4.36–6.02), indicating a generally positive perception about compliance with the ADA; however, the two items specifically addressing the ADA included a high percentage of ‘I don’t know’ responses (39.7% and 42%, respectively), rated at a neutral 4 on the Likert scale, which potentially skewed results.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec16-1744987111406523"><title>Positive physical plant accessibility</title>
<p>Two items addressed perceptions of physical plant accessibility for wheelchair users on the unit. The overall mean for this factor was 4.02 (range = 3.78–4.26), indicating a neutral perception of accessibility in employee rest rooms and break rooms.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="sec17-1744987111406523"><title>Feelings/Attitudes subscale</title>
<p>The Feelings/Attitudes subscale was comprised of 15 items that looked at respondents’ attitudes toward nurses with disabilities working on their units. Within this subscale, four factors were identified, which are described below (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1744987111406523">Table 3</xref>). For data analysis, because the majority of the items in the subscale expressed negative attitudes, all items expressing positive attitudes were transformed into negative structures, resulting in ‘adds value’ becoming ‘detracts value’. The remaining six items did not sufficiently load on any factor and were thus eliminated.</p>
<sec id="sec18-1744987111406523"><title>Incapable/non-workable</title>
<p>The six items comprising this component expressed feelings that nurses with physical or sensory disabilities are incapable of performing adequately and that their integration on the hospital unit is non-workable. The overall mean was 3.42 (range = 2.63–4.23), reflecting a slightly negative level of agreement with these items, indicating a slightly positive feeling toward nurses with physical or sensory disabilities.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec19-1744987111406523"><title>Detracts value</title>
<p>These five items expressed feelings that nurses with disabilities add value to care of patients, the work experience for nurses without disabilities and the general work environment. For data analysis purposes, results were transformed to negative responses. The overall mean was 2.31 (range = 1.98–2.82), reflecting a moderate disagreement with the items, indicating a generally positive feeling about the contributions of nurses with physical or sensory disabilities to patient well-being and the hospital work environment.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec20-1744987111406523"><title>Absolute barrier</title>
<p>This component was comprised of only two items, expressing the feeling that physical or sensory disabilities are absolute barriers to working as nurses. The items specifically asked level of agreement with statements that individuals in wheelchairs and those who are deaf should not be nurses. Item means were 2.75 and 2.78, respectively (overall mean = 2.77), indicating a generally moderate disagreement with the statements, reflecting feelings that these nurses should and could be nurses.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec21-1744987111406523"><title>Non-accommodating</title>
<p>Two items comprised this component, expressing attitudes toward providing accommodation and assistance to nurses with disabilities to ensure their success in the workplace. Item means were 4.8 and 4.9, respectively, reflecting a strong willingness to take telephone orders for a nurse with a hearing problem and generally strong agreement that people with disabilities are responsible for their own success in the workplace. These results are almost exact opposites, with the latter attitude perhaps precluding assistance to a worker with a disability, leaving the individual to provide for his or her own success. The reason for this might be that the item was misunderstood and should be revised in a future survey.</p>
<p>Taken as a whole, the results suggest that respondents have generally positive attitudes toward nurses with disabilities, indicating a willingness to accommodate their disabilities and help them as needed, a feeling that they contribute positively to patients’ well-being and the general workplace environment and a feeling that they can be as successful as nurses without disabilities.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="sec22-1744987111406523"><title>Experience items</title>
<p>The survey included four items measuring respondents’ experience with individuals who have disabilities (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-1744987111406523">Table 5</xref>). Two of the items allowed more than one answer to be marked; thus, the highest level of experience marked was included in the analysis. This information was used to explore whether or not experience with individuals with disabilities impacts attitudes toward nurses with disabilities or perceptions of factors that might contribute to the disability climate. More than half of the respondents indicated that they either had a physical or sensory disability themselves or they had a close friend or family member with such a disability. The vast majority of respondents had cared for at least one patient with a physical or sensory disability, and over 75% had worked with a health care professional who had such a disability. Most respondents had some exposure to individuals with disabilities in grade school, high school or college.

<sec id="sec23-1744987111406523"><title>Comparison of perceptions of climate and attitudes</title>
<p>Further analysis explored the impact of various respondent characteristics on perceptions of organisational climate factors and feelings/attitudes toward nurses with disabilities in the hospital workplace. Characteristics explored included respondent’s age, disability status, level of education, years of nursing experience and practice area. Each characteristic was examined as a categorical variable; hence analysis of variance was used to identify differences (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table6-1744987111406523">Table 6</xref>). The results are described below.

<sec id="sec24-1744987111406523"><title>Age and years of nursing experience</title>
<p>There were no significant differences in perceptions of climate factors or attitudes based on age or years of nursing experience (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table6-1744987111406523">Table 6</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec25-1744987111406523"><title>Disability status and experience/exposure</title>
<p>Respondents answered two questions regarding disability status and experience/exposure, which were converted to four dichotomous variables: (1) whether or not they had a physical or sensory disability themselves; (2) whether or not they had experience working with a health care professional of any kind who had a physical or sensory disability; (3) whether or not they had patients with disabilities; and (4) if they had no exposure to individuals with disabilities in their professional lives. Analysis revealed several areas with significant differences based on the levels of exposure to individuals with disabilities (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table6-1744987111406523">Table 6</xref>). Respondents who had no experience with individuals with disabilities demonstrated significant differences in their responses to the social inclusion component (<italic>F</italic><sub>(24,105)</sub> = 1.687, <italic>p</italic> = 0.038). Respondents who had experience caring for patients with disabilities demonstrated significant differences in their responses to the supportive climate component (<italic>F</italic><sub>(31,97)</sub> = 5.264, <italic>p</italic> = 0.000), the physical plant accessibility component (<italic>F</italic><sub>(12,116)</sub> = 2.644, <italic>p</italic> = 0.004) and the incapable/non-workable component (<italic>F</italic><sub>(35,93)</sub> = 2.408, <italic>p</italic> = 0.000). The group with patient exposure showed a more positive perception of physical plant accessibility in the workplace than the group with no exposure at all. The group with patient exposure also showed a more positive attitude toward the capability of nurses with disabilities than those without any patient exposure. Furthermore, the group with patient exposure had significantly more positive responses to the absolute barrier component than the group with no exposure at all (<italic>F</italic><sub>(12,115)</sub> = 3.166, <italic>p</italic> = 0.001). It is important to note that these associations among these disability variables and outcomes do not control for other forms of exposure to disabilities, such as experiencing one’s own disability or experience with a peer who has a disability.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec26-1744987111406523"><title>Level of education</title>
<p>Respondents were classified according to whether they held an associate degree or diploma school certificate, a baccalaureate degree or a master’s degree or higher. Analysis revealed no significant differences in perceptions of climate factors or attitudes based on level of education, with the exception of the ADA awareness component (<italic>F</italic><sub>(19,111)</sub> = 1.844, <italic>p</italic> = 0.026); the higher the level of education, the more likely the respondent has some awareness of the ADA.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec27-1744987111406523"><title>Practice area</title>
<p>Respondents were asked to identify the unit on which they spend most of their current work time from a list of 63 possible units. Responses spanned only 24 of the options. These were consolidated into ICU, med/surg, OR, outpatient, other (not elsewhere classified) and other (not identified by the respondent).</p>
<p>Analysis of variance revealed significant differences in responses within three out of the four Organisational Climate subscale components based on practice area (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table6-1744987111406523">Table 6</xref>). On the total Organisational Climate subscale (<italic>F</italic><sub>(5,124)</sub> = 3.641, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05), the post hoc Scheffe test shows significant differences between ICU and outpatient/short stay (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05). Overall mean scores were higher for outpatient/short stay, suggesting that Organisational Climate is more positive in those units. Responses differed significantly with respect to social inclusion (<italic>F</italic><sub>(5,123)</sub> = 2.846, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05), primarily driven by the difference in means between the ICU (mean = 4.0431) and the outpatient units (mean = 5.4167). The post hoc Bonferroni test was significant for ICUs and outpatient units (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05). Practice area was also significantly related to supportive climate (<italic>F</italic><sub>(5,124)</sub> = 2.541, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05), but post hoc tests were not significant. There were no significant differences amongst practice areas with respect to ADA awareness (<italic>p</italic> &gt; 0.05). Practice areas significantly differed with respect to physical plant accessibility (<italic>F</italic><sub>(5,124)</sub> = 3.813, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05); both Scheffe and Bonferroni post hoc tests show significant differences between ICU and outpatient areas (<italic>p</italic> = 0.017; <italic>p</italic> = 0.003), scores suggesting that physical plant accessibility is more positively perceived in outpatient areas than in ICUs.</p>
<p>Practice areas significantly differed on the incapable/non-workable component of the attitudes subscale (<italic>F</italic><sub>(5,124)</sub> = 2.426, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05); however, post hoc tests did not show significance. There were no significant differences with respect to the remaining components of the subscale (<italic>p</italic> &gt; 0.05).</p>

<sec id="sec28-1744987111406523" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title>
<p>Research by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1744987111406523">Guillett et al. (2007)</xref> suggests that physical environment accessibility, peer support and awareness of disability and accommodation are important to encourage nurses with disabilities to get and keep nursing jobs. The results of this pilot study suggest that factors impacting disability climate are the individual nurse’s experience with disability (whether his or her own, a close friend or relative or a patient for whom he or she cared), his or her level of education and the nurse’s practice area. The more experience and the closer to the nurse it is, the more positively the individual perceives the disability climate. The higher the level of education, the more awareness the person has regarding the ADA. The lower the level of acuity on the unit, the more positive the nurse’s perception of the climate. Conversely, areas where patient care is at a higher level of acuity and work is more demanding, such as critical care units and the OR, are least welcoming to nurses with disabilities. These areas demonstrated the least positive disability climate perceptions. These results support the findings reported by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1744987111406523">Guillett et al. (2007)</xref>, which also found that less acute settings, such as postpartum units, nurseries and telephone triage, seemed to be most accommodating for nurses with disabilities, while settings in which nurses need to be able to lift, move quickly, have strength to restrain and/or subdue aggressive patients and prepare and administer drugs quickly, such as psychiatric settings, are the least welcoming environments for this population.</p>
<p>One of the aims of this study was to explore the relationship between specific characteristics of nurses and their attitudes toward nurses with disabilities. There were no significant differences in attitudes based on age, level of education or years of nursing experience, and, although practice area seemed to matter, post hoc tests did not bear that out. Previous research regarding these relationships is conflicting. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1744987111406523">Gozali (1971)</xref> found that attitude toward individuals with disabilities becomes more positive with increasing age until age 51, when the trend reverses and attitudes are less positive. In another study, older beginning rehabilitation counsellors were found to have less positive attitudes than younger ones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1744987111406523">Martin et al., 1982</xref>), and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1744987111406523">Antonak and Livneh (1988)</xref> reported that there was no relationship between age of respondents and attitudes toward individuals with disabilities, but that educational level is positively related to acceptance of individuals with physical disabilities. Results of this study suggest that only nurses who had experience caring for patients with disabilities felt that individuals with disabilities could be nurses and, furthermore, that nurses with disabilities were as capable as those without disabilities.</p>
<p>Several previous research studies have found a positive correlation between positive attitudes toward disability and contact with people with disabilities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1744987111406523">Lindgren and Oermann, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1744987111406523">Berry and Meyer, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1744987111406523">Hall and Minnes, 1999</xref>). People who are familiar with disabled people through prior close contact tend to hold more positive, accepting attitudes, whereas people with little or no prior contact tend to hold more negative, stereotypical attitudes toward people with disabilities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1744987111406523">Gething, n.d.</xref>). Other studies have also found that increased personal contact with disabled individuals, other than in medical settings, is associated with more favourable attitudes (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1744987111406523">Gosse and Sheppard, 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1744987111406523">Antonak and Livneh, 1988</xref>). However, it has been found that only a certain type of contact has a positive effect on attitudes: the contact must be one of an equal social status relationship, occurring under natural and voluntary conditions, facilitating viewing of the person with a disability as an individual rather than as a member of a group, and with both individuals in the relationship having the same goal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1744987111406523">Smart, 2001</xref>). This result conflicts with the findings of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1744987111406523">Antonak and Livneh (1988)</xref> related to medical settings.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec29-1744987111406523"><title>Limitations</title>
<p>This study has several important limitations. Firstly, the sample size was very small (131 respondents). According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1744987111406523">Stevens (2002)</xref> reasonable sample size for the purpose of a pilot study to establish initial psychometric properties of an instrument is 5–15 subjects per item, or in this case, a minimum of 145 subjects; however, other experts recommend as few as three subjects per item (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1744987111406523">Gorsuch, 1997</xref>). The small sample size precluded analysis based on respondents’ roles because there were an insufficient number of respondents to compare responses from managers, staff nurses and other categories of nurses. Moreover, there were insufficient numbers of nurses with disabilities to permit comparison of disability climate perceptions between nurses with and without disabilities.</p>
<p>Secondly, the response rate was difficult to calculate, since it is unknown whether nurse managers receiving the recruitment email messages from administrators. In future studies, recruitment efforts must be accomplished differently to maximise recruitment exposure and ensure a known pool size.</p>
<p>Thirdly, the study was conducted in three large, urban, tertiary care hospitals, two of which were university affiliated. These were convenience samples rather than randomly selected sites. Results cannot be generalised to other workplaces due to the characteristics of the study sites and the method of selecting them.</p>
<p>Fourthly, the NANDS instrument had several flaws, most importantly the response options, which included ‘I don’t know’ and ‘I prefer not to answer’. The frequency with which these options were chosen caused difficulties in data analysis. Furthermore, some of the items were found to be worded poorly and will be revised for future studies.</p>
<p>A fifth limitation is the possibility that respondents chose responses that they thought were socially desirable rather than those that truly reflected their perceptions and attitudes. It is hoped that, because the survey was confidential and anonymous, participants were honest in their responses.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec30-1744987111406523"><title>Conclusion and implications</title>
<p>The purpose of this study was to pilot test the NANDS instrument, which was designed to assess organisational disability climate and nurses’ attitudes toward nurses with disabilities in hospital workplaces. Overall, the instrument accomplished what was intended. Results supported previous research suggesting that nurses with physical and sensory disabilities may feel more welcomed in areas serving patients with lower acuities. Study results supported previous research suggesting that greater experience and exposure to individuals with disabilities positively impacts attitudes toward this population.</p>
<p>To increase employment and retention of nurses with disabilities, employers can assess disability climate in specific units to identify and target areas needing remedial attention. With the aging of the nursing work force, disabilities are becoming more prevalent. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1744987111406523">Guillett et al. (2007)</xref> suggested that the profession should realise and accept that disability is common and a ‘natural part of the human experience’ (p. 32). The NANDS instrument may be useful to assist employers and nursing administrators in creating healthy, disability-friendly work environments that promote a positive disability climate and improve the work experience for nurses with disabilities.</p>
<p>Is it possible to improve the disability climate in units with high patient acuity? Which disabilities are amenable to accommodation in these work settings? Would educational interventions increase acceptance? These are questions that need to be addressed in future research.</p>
<p>This was the first test of the NANDS instrument. It offers a way to evaluate the hospital disability climate and address the environment and attitudes that present challenges for nurses with disabilities. As the nursing profession confronts the issues contributing to the nursing shortage, the NANDS may be one tool that can help employers implement strategies to increase the likelihood that individuals with disabilities will be attracted to and remain in the nursing work force.</p>
