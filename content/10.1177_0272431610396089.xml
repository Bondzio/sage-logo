<abstract>
<p>This study examined how parents’ and children’s beliefs about peer victimization are related to children’s adjustment. A mediational model was proposed that addressed how adjustment is predicted by degree of victimization, as well as causal attributions of and coping responses to victimization. The participants were 100 fifth- or sixth-grade children and one of their parents (primarily mothers). Children’s ages ranged from 10 to12 years of age (<italic>M</italic> = 10 years and 10 months, <italic>SD</italic> = 6 months). Using procedures recommended by Kenny, Kashy, and Bolger, mediational models were examined using multiple regression analyses. Results for child ratings supported the hypothesis that the association between peer victimization and psychosocial maladjustment is mediated through characterological blame attributions; this pattern of association was evident within parent-report data as well. Coping responses were not significant mediators in the models that examined the predictors of maladjustment from perceived victimization, attributions, and coping responses.</p>

<p>Recent media attention linking rare, but sometimes fatal, school violence to a history of peer victimization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0272431610396089">Verlinden, Hersen, &amp; Thomas, 2000</xref>) has increased public concern about the risks associated with being a victim of peer victimization. More commonly, however, peer victimization is linked to a host of problems contributing to the overall quality of children’s daily lives including peer rejection, poorer academic performance, dislike and avoidance of school, higher levels of anxiety, depression and loneliness, along with lower self-esteem (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0272431610396089">Haynie et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0272431610396089">Kochenderfer-Ladd &amp; Wardrop, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0272431610396089">Olweus, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0272431610396089">Rigby, 2000</xref>). However, not all children who experience peer victimization suffer these negative consequences. Results of studies suggest that children’s coping responses and attributions in relation to peer victimization may influence subsequent psychosocial adjustment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0272431610396089">Graham &amp; Juvonen, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0272431610396089">Kochenderfer-Ladd &amp; Skinner, 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>The present study was designed to investigate the relationship between peer victimization, causal attributions, coping responses, and child adjustment (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0272431610396089">Figure 1</xref>). Much of the previous research in this area has focused on the relationship between middle-school-age children’s peer victimization experiences and attributions. However, there is evidence to suggest that for children as young as 8 years old, attributions are becoming significant predictors of coping behaviors. For example, several studies have found significant relationships between attribution of intent and subsequent aggressive behavior for early adolescent age children (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0272431610396089">Orobio de Castro, Veerman, Koops, Bosch, &amp; Monshouwer, 2002</xref> for a full review). Therefore, the current study investigated the relationship of these variables for early adolescent children. The attributions that were investigated include characterological self-blame (internal, stable), behavioral self-blame (internal, not stable), and peer-blame (external). The research focused on whether the relationship between perceived peer victimization and psychosocial adjustment is mediated through both attributions and coping responses (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0272431610396089">Figure 1</xref>). When studied separately, coping responses and attributions have been found to directly influence children’s psychosocial adjustment following peer victimization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0272431610396089">Graham &amp; Juvonen, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0272431610396089">Kochenderfer-Ladd &amp; Skinner, 2002</xref>; see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0272431610396089">Figure 1</xref>). However, it could be the case that causal attributions influence psychosocial adjustment indirectly through the influence on selection of coping responses (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0272431610396089">Figure 1</xref>). However, as attributions and coping responses are not typically investigated simultaneously, we do not know whether both these internal processes incrementally influence children’s adjustment and whether they mediate the influence of stress? Furthermore, will the observed relationships between perceived peer victimization and children’s adjustment be evident within parent-report data and across parent- and child-report data?</p>

<title>Peer Victimization, Attributions, and Psychosocial Adjustment</title>
<p>Previous studies using hypothetical vignettes depicting episodes of peer victimization have found that children who report experiencing higher levels of peer victimization are more likely to endorse characterological self-blame attributions than are children who report less peer victimization and that these attributions are linked to poorer psychosocial adjustment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0272431610396089">Graham, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0272431610396089">Graham, Bellmore, &amp; Mize, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0272431610396089">Graham &amp; Juvonen, 1998</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0272431610396089">2002</xref>). In addition, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0272431610396089">Prinstein, Cheah, and Guyer (2005)</xref>, using ambiguous hypothetical vignettes, found that victimized children made significantly more critical self-referent attributions (internal, stable, and negative attributions about their own character) than did nonvictimized children, and these attributions were significantly associated with maladaptive psychological adjustment, including, social anxiety, loneliness, low self-esteem, and higher levels of depressive symptoms. Furthermore, characterological self-blame has been found to partially mediate the relationship between peer victimization and psychosocial adjustment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0272431610396089">Graham &amp; Juvonen, 1998</xref>) and peer victimization and school adjustment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0272431610396089">Graham et al., 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>Together, these studies suggest that characterological self-blame is an important factor in how children adjust to peer victimization. Overall, children who report experiencing more frequent peer victimization are more likely to make characterological self-blaming attributions compared with those who make peer-blame or behavioral self-blame attributions, and characterological self-blame, in turn, appears to be linked to higher levels of anxiety, loneliness, and depressive symptoms along with lower feelings of self-worth. The hypothesis that attributions mediate the relationship between perceived victimization and internalizing problems has received the least attention to date; however, there is limited evidence that characterological self-blame partially mediates the relationship between peer victimization and child outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0272431610396089">Graham et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0272431610396089">Graham &amp; Juvonen, 1998</xref>). These tentative findings clearly warrant further investigation. Also, in the previous work, external attributions have been virtually ignored. Peer-blaming attributions, however, should at least in theory be more adaptive for children than behavioral and characterological self-blame. The possible mediation of peer victimization and adjustment through internal and external attributions is explored in the present study.</p>

<title>Peer Victimization, Coping Responses, and Adjustment</title>
<p>Research investigating the relationship between peer victimization and children’s coping strategies finds modest to moderate associations between the frequency of peer victimization and children’s greater use of emotion-focused coping responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0272431610396089">Andreou, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0272431610396089">Compas, Connor-Smith, Saltzman, Thomsen, &amp; Wadsworth, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0272431610396089">Skinner &amp; Zimmer-Gembeck, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0272431610396089">Smith, Shu, &amp; Madsen, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0272431610396089">Smith, Talamelli, Cowie, Naylor, &amp; Chauhan, 2004</xref>). However, there has been less research on the ways that different coping responses to peer victimization affect psychosocial adjustment. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0272431610396089">Kochenderfer-Ladd and Skinner (2002)</xref> investigated the relationship between children’s coping responses to peer victimization and their psychosocial adjustment and found that distancing, emotion-focused, and externalizing coping responses were modestly correlated with self-reported loneliness and teacher-rated anxious-depressed tendencies. Furthermore, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0272431610396089">Kochenderfer-Ladd and Skinner (2002)</xref> also found that approach coping responses moderated the relationship between victimization and psychological outcomes. They found that infrequently victimized children who reported using more approach coping strategies such as problem solving had lower levels of loneliness and fewer social problems than did more frequently victimized children. Furthermore, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0272431610396089">Kochenderfer-Ladd (2004)</xref> also found that seeking revenge was modestly related to higher levels of subsequent peer victimization, whereas conflict resolution was associated with lower levels of internalizing problems; however, these relationships were mediated through emotional responses. For example, the relationship between peer victimization and advice-seeking and conflict resolution was mediated through fear (i.e., reports of feeling afraid if they are victimized), and the relationship between revenge-seeking and subsequent peer victimization was mediated through anger and embarrassment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0272431610396089">Kochenderfer-Ladd, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>Due to limited research investigating the issue of whether coping responses mediate the relationship between peer victimization and children’s psychological adjustment, there is clearly a need for more research investigating these linkages. This is an important issue because it gets at the heart of the question of whether, and to what extent, intervening coping processes account for the individual variation in maladjustment following victimization. In addition, although we know that emotional responses may influence the responses children make to peer victimization, almost no studies have examined how other intervening psychological processes might influence the type of coping responses children use. For example, children’s beliefs about the cause of victimization (e.g., “there is something about me or my behavior that caused this vs. these kids are just mean to everyone?”) may influence the types of coping responses children make (e.g., “ignore them,” “seek help from a teacher,” or “cry”). However, research has typically investigated causal attributions and coping responses separately despite conceptual reasons to think that attributions may influence coping strategy selections and that both attributions and coping strategies together influence psychological adjustment to peer victimization.</p>
<p>Therefore, the present study sought to extend previous work by simultaneously assessing the roles of attributions and coping responses in children’s subsequent adjustment to peer victimization. To examine whether the associations among victimization, attributions, coping, and maladjustment also emerge from other informants’ data, parent-report assessments were also gathered. This additional source of assessment provides the opportunity to test whether similar patterns of associations emerge within parent ratings and to test whether associations hold up across independent child- and parent-report assessments. However, parents’ ratings of internal adjustment may not be as accurate as their ratings of external adjustment, as parents may not be aware of their children’s internal experiences. Even so, parent-report data shed light on the extent to which parents are aware of their children’s peer victimization experiences and what they see as consequences of victimization.</p>

<title>Goals and Predictions</title>
<p>The first goal of this study was to examine whether the relationship between peer victimization and children’s adjustment is mediated through attributions and coping responses. The second goal was to examine how attributions about peer victimization influence children’s coping responses. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0272431610396089">Figure 1</xref> presents a model that depicts the possible relationships among victimization, causal attributions, coping responses, and psychosocial adjustment. However, determining the direction of the relationship between these variables is complex. For example, peer victimization could lead children to be more depressed, lonelier, and more anxious; however, it is also possible that children with poorer psychosocial adjustment have smaller support systems and may be easier to victimize. In relation to coping and attributions, it could be the case that victimization causes children to make certain attributions and to choose certain coping responses; however, certain attributions and coping responses could make children more vulnerable to being victimized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0272431610396089">Graham &amp; Juvonen, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0272431610396089">Kochenderfer-Ladd &amp; Skinner, 2002</xref>). Even though it is difficult to establish directionality among these variables, the current study proposes a model and utilizes meditational techniques that could potentially help establish possible directional links. The basic idea of this model is that causal attributions and coping responses are both intervening psychological processes, with causal attributions likely influencing psychosocial adjustment directly and indirectly through influence on selection of coping responses. More specifically, characterological self-blame attributions may cause children to feel hopeless to change their situation, thus making them more likely to employ emotion-focused coping responses such as feeling sorry for yourself (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0272431610396089">Figure 1</xref>). Therefore, it was predicted that children who endorse more characterological self-blame beliefs will report higher levels of peer victimization, endorse more emotion-focused coping responses and fewer approach responses, and exhibit poorer psychosocial adjustment.</p>
<p>Less is known about the potential benefits or drawbacks of behavioral self-blaming and external peer-blaming attributions. However, children who make behavioral self-blaming attributions or external peer-blaming attributions may have some hope of improving their situation because they are not blaming the peer victimization on something internal and stable about themselves. Therefore, it was predicted that children who endorse more behavioral self-blame and external peer-blame beliefs will report lower levels of peer victimization, endorse more approach coping responses, and exhibit better psychosocial adjustment than children who endorse more characterological self-blame beliefs.</p>
<p>The second goal of this study was to investigate how parents arrive at their beliefs about how their children should cope with peer victimization. A number of researchers have hypothesized that parents can assist children in dealing with peer relationships (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0272431610396089">Parke &amp; Ladd, 1992</xref>). In fact, research indicates that even in early adolescence, parents remain involved and continue to retain considerable influence over their children’s peer relationships (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0272431610396089">Engels, Dekovic, &amp; Meeus, 2002</xref>). However, research aimed specifically toward the influence of parenting on peer relationships is scarce. Therefore, the current study examines how parents believe their children should cope with peer victimization and what factors determine those beliefs.</p>
<p>The current study predicts that the process by which parents arrive at their views about how their children should cope with peer victimization largely parallels the psychological processes that children engage in when selecting coping responses, with a few notable exceptions. Once parents are aware that their children are victimized, they are likely to try to determine the cause of the victimization; thus, they engage in an attributional analysis parallel to children’s attributional processing. Like children, parents consider the frequency of victimization: the more frequent the victimization, the more likely that parents will believe their children are partially or fully to blame. In contrast to the children themselves, parents’ attributions are likely to be influenced by the “actor-observer” bias that social psychologists have documented (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0272431610396089">Jones &amp; Nisbett, 1972</xref>). In contrast to actors who are biased toward making external situational attributions for things that happen to them, observers tend to attribute relatively more causal influence to the actor’s own stable personality traits. As observers, parents are also likely to consider their children’s stable personality characteristics, especially those that may provoke aggression from peers. Thus, if a child has a history of provocative (externalizing behavioral tendencies) or submissive (internalizing behavioral tendencies), parents may be more likely to blame the child for evoking victimization from peers.</p>
<p>On the basis of their decisions about causality, parents may arrive at different beliefs about how their children should cope with peer victimization. In theory, it is important to understand this process because parents may share their beliefs with their children and thereby exert influence on how children cope with peer victimization. The current study predicts that parents who make behavioral child-blame attributions are likely to endorse approach strategies such as trying to get along with the victimizer or seeking help and advice. This is because blaming their children’s behavior focuses the cause of the victimization on something less stable and modifiable. Thus, there is hope for stopping and preventing victimization if children can simply modify what they do or say to deescalate and prevent peer victimization. However, parents who make characterological child-blame attributions are likely to endorse avoidant strategies such as cognitive distancing. This is because blaming something stable and nonchangeable about their child’s behavior leaves very little hope for actively changing the situation, and therefore, the best strategy is to avoid the victimizer and downplay the emotional effect.</p>

<title>Participants</title>
<p>Participants were 100 parent–child dyads, primarily middle class, recruited from two elementary schools and through flyers distributed at after-school programs that were not affiliated with the city’s public school system in a southwestern U.S. city (56 boys and 44 girls). Children’s ages ranged from 10 to 12 years of age, (<italic>M</italic> = 10 years and 10 months, <italic>SD</italic> = 6 months). One school had a total of 4 fifth-grade classroom consisting of 102 fifth-grade children. Of these children, 43 returned their permission slips, a return rate of 42%. Of the 42% of families who returned their permission slips, 34 families or 79% of families chose to participate. The other school consisted of three fifth-grade classrooms with a total of 61 fifth-grade students. Of these students, 24 or 39% returned their permission slips. Of the 39% of families who returned their permission slips, 18 families or 75% chose to participate in the study. Data were collected from 60 families recruited through flyers and 40 recruited through the schools. The flyer contained information about the study along with contact information. When the family contacted the researcher, they were given more information about the study. At this time, if the family desired to participate, an interview was scheduled with the family. A <italic>t</italic> test revealed no significant differences, <italic>t</italic>(98) = .69, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .49, between child-reported victimization by peers for the children recruited through flyers, <italic>M</italic> = 1.79, and for the children recruited through the public schools, <italic>M</italic> = 1.72.</p>
<p>Assessment was done during the spring of children’s fifth-grade or sixth-grade year of school. Of the sample, 83.5% were White, 10.3% were Hispanic, and 6.2% were African American. Although the current sample represented the upper middle class, it was not a mirror reflection of the demographics of the broader school system; 71% White, 18.2% Hispanic, and 7.2% African American.</p>
<p>The child’s primary caregiver (defined as the caregiver who interacts with the child the most on a day-to-day basis and has the most intimate knowledge of the child’s peer interactions) was asked to participate in the study. This was most often the mother (<italic>n</italic> = 96).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0272431610396089">
<title>Procedures</title>
<p>Interviews with the participating parent and child took place at their homes. Children were interviewed individually by trained undergraduate and graduate students, whereas the participating parents completed their questionnaires in a separate room to ensure independent responses from both the parent and the child. On concluding the interview session, the parent and child were compensated US$15 each for participating.</p>

<title>Social Experience Questionnaire (SEQ)</title>
<p>To obtain information about the frequency of perceived peer victimization, the SEQ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0272431610396089">Crick &amp; Grotpeter, 1995</xref>) was administered to both parents and children. The SEQ consisted of 10 items that assessed how often children perceived that they experienced peer victimization, and a parallel version was given to parents in which the wording was changed to reflect how often parents perceived that their children were victimized. For example, the question for children, “How often do you get pushed or shoved by another child at school?” was restated for parents as “How often does your child get pushed or shoved by another child at school?” Parents indicated on a 5-point Likert-type scale how often they perceived that their child had experienced the behavior described in each statement with 1 indicating <italic>never experienced</italic>, 5 indicating <italic>all the time experienced</italic>, and 3 indicating <italic>sometimes experienced</italic>. Children used the same scale to rate how often they had experienced the events. Scores were calculated by averaging across the 10 items.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-0272431610396089">
<title>Attribution Questionnaire</title>
<p>Both children’s and parents’ attributions were measured with an Attribution Questionnaire designed to assess attributions about peer victimization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0272431610396089">Graham &amp; Juvonen, 1998</xref>). This measure consisted of a hypothetical scenario that depicted a child being victimized by peers beside his or her locker. Children and parents were instructed to imagine that this situation happened to them or to their child, then after reading the story, both children and parents rated their agreement with 16 different statements designed to assess characterological self-blame, behavioral self-blame, and external-other blame. The wording of these scales was modified for parents to reflect parental attributions about why the hypothetical situation would have happened to their child. Scores for children’s attributions were calculated following the procedures outlined by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0272431610396089">Graham and Juvonen (1998)</xref>. The alpha reliability coefficients of these three subscales were as follows: characterological self-blame, α = .83; behavioral self-blame, α = .68; and peer-blame, α = .55. One item, “How can my child keep this from happening again” was left out of the subscales as it did not meet the criteria.</p>
<p>As the attribution measure was modified for parents, their ratings were subjected to an exploratory factor analysis using principal factors extraction with oblique rotation. Scale scores were created from the variables with loadings of .40 or higher for each factor. One item, “How can my child keep this from happening again” was left out of the subscales as it did not meet the criteria. Three factors emerged that paralleled those that <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0272431610396089">Graham and Juvonen (1998)</xref> found in their factor analysis of child ratings on these scales (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0272431610396089">Table 1</xref>).

<title>Coping Scale</title>
<p>Children’s and parents’ coping strategies were measured with a modified version of the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0272431610396089">Causey and Dubow’s (1992)</xref> Self-Report Coping Measure for Elementary School Children (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0272431610396089">Kochenderfer-Ladd &amp; Skinner, 2002</xref>). The revised scale (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0272431610396089">Kochenderfer-Ladd &amp; Skinner, 2002</xref>) consists of 26 strategies; children are asked to rate how likely they would be to use each strategy if a child were being mean to them either by calling them names or hitting and pushing them. Parents were administered a parallel version with modified wording to reflect how parents believe their children should cope with peer victimization. Both children and parents were asked to indicate their responses on a 3-point scale where 1 = <italic>no would not/would not advise</italic>, 2 = <italic>maybe</italic>, and 3 = <italic>yes I would do that/ I would advise to do that</italic>. The questions were designed to assess the following coping strategies: advice and social support seeking (i.e., “would you ask a parent what you should do”), cognitive distancing (i.e., “would you make believe nothing happened?”), conflict resolution (i.e., “would you tell the child to stop?”), and emotion-focused strategies (i.e., “would you feel sorry for yourself?”). Following procedures outlined by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0272431610396089">Kochenderfer-Ladd and Skinner (2002)</xref>, scores for children’s coping responses were calculated by averaging across the respective items on each scale. The alpha reliability coefficients of these four subscales were as follows: social support seeking, α = .84; distancing, α = .79; conflict resolution, α = .41; and emotion focused coping, α = .31. As the coping measure was modified for parents, their ratings were subjected to an exploratory factor analysis using principal factors extraction with varimax rotation (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0272431610396089">Kochenderfer-Ladd &amp; Skinner, 2002</xref> for review). Two factors that could be meaningfully interpreted were identified (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0272431610396089">Table 2</xref>).</p>

This measure consisted of 16 items that assessed children’s feelings of loneliness such as “I feel lonely” or “I have lots of friends” and 8 distracter items such as “I like to paint and draw.” Children indicated on a 5-point Likert-type scale how true each statement was about them with 1 indicating <italic>always true about them</italic>, 3 indicating <italic>true sometimes</italic>, and 5 indicating <italic>not true at all</italic>.

<title>Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL)</title>
<p>To obtain parental reports of children’s internalizing and externalizing behavioral tendencies, parents completed the CBCL (ages 6-18). This test assessed child behavior and social competence. The questionnaire included questions that asked parents to rate their children’s behaviors (on a scale of 0 = <italic>not true</italic>, 1 = <italic>somewhat true</italic> or 2 = <italic>true</italic>), including behaviors indicative of internalizing and externalizing behavioral tendencies. Children’s internalizing and externalizing scores as rated by parents were used for all analyses.</p>

<p>Hypotheses were tested by conducting correlational analyses and multiple regression analyses. Results are presented in two sections. The first section reports preliminary analyses focusing on descriptive information for all the variables. The second section focuses on testing hypotheses about direct and indirect relationships among perceived peer victimization, attributions, coping responses, and children’s psychological adjustment.</p>

<title>Preliminary Analyses</title>
<p>Results of preliminary descriptive analyses of perceived peer victimization, causal attributions for victimization, and the endorsement of different coping responses according to child report and parent report are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0272431610396089">Tables 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0272431610396089">4</xref>. In the current study, both parents and children reported relatively low levels of victimization. More interestingly, the correlation between parent perceptions of peer victimization and children’s perceptions of peer victimization was relatively low, <italic>r</italic> = .21 (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-0272431610396089">Table 5</xref>), indicating that parent and child perceptions of the child’s victimization experiences were only modestly related.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The main purpose of this study was to determine whether the relationship between perceived peer victimization and psychosocial maladjustment could be accounted for by two mediating mental processes, causal attributions, and coping responses, and, if so, are these processes apparent in both child- and parent-report data. The findings revealed that peer victimization was moderately to strongly associated with child-reported anxiety, depression, and loneliness and with parent-reported internalizing and externalizing problems. Victimization was also associated with characterological self-blame attributions within both child- and parent-report ratings but was only modestly related to emotion-focused coping in child-report ratings. Self-blaming attribution patterns incrementally increase the prediction of adjustment problems beyond victimization, but coping strategies did not add to prediction. There was consistent evidence that self-blame attributions mediated the relationship between victimization and child reports of anxiety, depression, and loneliness and parent-reported internalizing problems.</p>
<sec id="section30-0272431610396089">
<title>Attributions and Coping as Mediators of the Effects of Victimization on Adjustment</title>
<p>Consistent with expectations and findings from several past studies, perceived frequency of peer victimization was robustly related to child-reported loneliness, depression, and anxiety and to parent-reported internalizing and externalizing problems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0272431610396089">Graham &amp; Juvonen, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0272431610396089">Kochenderfer-Ladd &amp; Skinner, 2002</xref>). Within child report and parent-report data, causal attributions were associated with both children’s socioemotional adjustment and levels of peer victimization, with characterological self-blaming attributions being most strongly associated with perceptions of peer victimization and children’s maladjustment. However, coping strategies were more weakly and less consistently related to adjustment within both parent- and child-report data. Mediational analyses revealed, as hypothesized, that attributions partially mediated the relationship between victimization and maladjustment, but there was little evidence that coping responses play a similar mediational role.</p>
<sec id="section31-0272431610396089">
<title>Implications of the partial mediation through self-blame</title>
<p>The fact that self-blame partially mediated the relationship between peer victimization and child adjustment suggests that peer victimization may have a direct effect on adjustment that is independent of any intervening processes, but that intervening processes, particularly characterological self-blame, have some influence on how children ultimately adjust to peer victimization. Therefore, simply changing a child’s attributional tendencies away from characterological self-blame would not eliminate entirely the ill effects of peer victimization, but it might alleviate some of the distress. Thus, based on these findings, there should be some partial reduction in maladjustment if we teach children not to attribute cause to their own internal stable characteristics. However, this may not be the best strategy in cases where children’s stable-internal traits actually are the cause of their being victimized. If this latter possibility is true, then trying to teach children to deceive themselves about the causes of victimization might be counterproductive and difficult to achieve. Logically, it seems it would be difficult to convince children who are called “freckle face” that they are not teased because of the freckles. In these cases, it may seem better to teach children to blame the peer for the victimization or to focus on possible behavioral causes of victimization (i.e., poor social skills or inappropriate responses to peer victimization). The current findings, however, suggest that this may not be the best strategy either. Although peer-blame attributions may protect children’s self-esteem (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0272431610396089">Graham &amp; Juvonen, 2001</xref>), in the current study, peer-blame attributions were associated with modestly higher levels of anxiety and depression. Thus, children who perceived that their victimization was caused by uncontrollable events, such as a rough school or mean kids, also reported feeling more anxious and more depressed. Therefore, it is still unclear whether behavioral or external blame has any adaptive or maladaptive qualities. Some of this uncertainty could be a result of poor measurement of both behavioral self-blame and peer-blame attributions. For example, only three items could be identified for the Behavioral Self-Blame Scale, and the internal consistency of these items was low. There also may be other yet to be identified attributions that children make about victimization. In addition, the current study only assessed one hypothetical scenario of “public victimization in front of a locker.” However, children’s attributions may differ when the circumstances of peer victimization change (i.e., physical aggression, verbal aggression, social aggression, and teasing). Therefore, future research needs to identify victimized children who have relatively few internalizing problems and interview them to probe more carefully how they construe the causes of peer hostility toward them within a variety of social contexts.</p>

<title>Coping responses</title>
<p>There was far less support for the hypothesis that coping responses mediate the relationship between perceived peer victimization and psychological adjustment. Three of the four coping responses assessed in the current study were uncorrelated with levels of victimization and measures of maladjustment. The only coping response that was related to victimization and maladjustment was emotion-focused coping, which is in reality a negative form of coping (i.e., blaming self and feeling sorry for self). In the current study, this type of coping was associated with worse rather than better adjustment. Mediational analyses revealed that coping responses were not significant mediators of the relation between peer victimization and child reported outcomes. There was even less evidence of a significant role of coping in parent-report data in that parental-advised coping was not correlated with victimization or parent-reported adjustment.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section33-0272431610396089">
<title>Implications of coping findings</title>
<p>One possible conclusion is that coping responses play no, or only a very small, role in determining children’s socioemotional reactions to victimization. This conclusion would stand in contrast to the fairly clear evidence from past studies that instrumental coping responses do influence whether peers perpetuate victimization, with several studies showing that instrumental approach responses, when used effectively, reduce the likelihood of further victimization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0272431610396089">Bijttebier &amp; Vertommen, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0272431610396089">Phelps, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0272431610396089">Smith et al., 2004</xref>). However, the lack of positive socioemotional benefits associated with approach coping in the current study is interesting. Taken together, these findings paint an almost paradoxical picture: emotion-focused coping results in continuing abuse by peers but has little discernable effect on children’s adjustment to the abuse. Similarly, past research indicates that instrumental coping reduces frequency of attacks but seemingly has no systematic affect on emotional responses to attacks. However, perhaps evidence of a positive effect of instrumental approach coping could be detected if the effectiveness of the coping responses are controlled. In studies assessing the relationship between coping responses and the perpetuation of victimization, this has been the case and could be the case for coping responses and maladjustment as well.</p>
<p>Another possible explanation of the current findings is that the measures of coping responses were limited. Two of the four coping scales had low internal consistency. There also have been difficulties replicating the factor structure of the scales across studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0272431610396089">Kochenderfer-Ladd &amp; Skinner, 2002</xref>) and across child and parent data in the current study as well. For example, for parents, only two factors—social support seeking and cognitive distancing—emerged. More interestingly, these were the two factors with the highest reliability for children as well. Perhaps parents have had some experience with the other coping strategies presented and have learned through this experience that these strategies do not work. Thus, both children and parents have some idea about what strategies do not work but have less idea about what could work. It could also be the case that the coping scale was limited in the types of strategies parents and children believe would be successful. Perhaps the types of coping responses examined should encompass a broader array of responses to victimization, including humor. For example, imagine a situation in which a girl is wearing an outfit that her peers begin to tease her about. She may get quite a different response from her peers if she laughs with them and says something along the line of, “I know. Isn’t it ridiculous, but my mom made me wear it,” as opposed to shutting down, becoming quiet, and “ignoring” or “snubbing” the offending peers. More psychometric work may be needed to develop measures that reliably and validly assess children’s coping responses.</p>
<p>It could also be the case that children’s emotions in relation to peer victimization mediate the relationship between causal attributions and children’s coping responses. Thus, contrary to the current study’s hypotheses, attributions may have an indirect effect on children’s coping responses. For example, Wiener’s two-phase theory of the emotions that follow negative events theorizes that these victimized kids get a double whammy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0272431610396089">Weiner, 1995</xref>). First, they experience the immediate outcome-related unpleasant emotions of pain and embarrassment, and then they experience the postattribution emotions of lowered self-worth and depression because of self-blame. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0272431610396089">Weiner’s (1995)</xref> model argues that children should experience different emotions following from their attributions. Therefore, immediate emotions could potentially influence children’s causal attributions, and the postattribution emotions most likely influence children’s coping responses. Future research should explore this possibility.</p>

<title>Attributions and coping responses as mediators of the effects of perceived peer victimization across parent and child data</title>
<p>There were similar patterns of findings within both parent and child data for associations among victimization, attributions, and adjustment. However, there were very few across-informant correlations. Similar to past findings (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0272431610396089">Ladd &amp; Kochenderfer-Ladd, 2002</xref> for a full review), the correlation between parent- and child-reported victimization was only <italic>r</italic> = .21. Similarly, parent reports of internalizing and externalizing child behaviors were correlated in the <italic>r</italic> = .15 to .28 range with child reports of loneliness, anxiety, and depression. Only one of the mediation models replicated across sources: The relationship between child-reported peer victimization and parent-reported externalizing behaviors was mediated by child behavioral self-blame attributions. The within-source (parent- and child-report data) replications boost confidence in our picture of the associations among the basic psychological processes. Lack of replication within these independent sources of data would have suggested that associations are only present in the minds of children. This does not appear to be the case, suggesting that parents’ and children’s reports reveal consistent patterns of associations among the variables. The lack of across-source associations can be interpreted in different ways.</p>
<p>A possible explanation for why this relationship did not hold across parent and child data could be a result of parents’ and children’s divergent perspectives on the frequency of peer victimization. In the current study, the correlation between parents’ and children’s perceptions of peer victimization was significant but low, about .21, indicating that parents and children did not agree about the basic facts about how often children are victimized. This is consistent with past findings that have compared peer and self-reports, with correlations ranging between <italic>r</italic> = .20 and .40, and those that have compared self-reports with parent and teacher reports, with correlations typically ranging between <italic>r</italic> = .17 and .30 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0272431610396089">Graham &amp; Juvonen, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0272431610396089">Kochenderfer-Ladd &amp; Skinner, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0272431610396089">Ladd &amp; Kochenderfer-Ladd, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0272431610396089">Pellegrini, 2001</xref>). The weak relations between child and parent perceptions can be interpreted in several ways. On the one hand, the low correlation suggests that parents may not know what is going on at school, at least in the realm of their children’s experiences with their peers. On the other hand, similarly low levels of agreement are found among peer, teacher, and parent reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0272431610396089">Ladd &amp; Kochenderfer-Ladd, 2002</xref>) suggesting that there is no general consensus about “actual” levels of victimizations.</p>
<p>In light of the low levels of agreement about victimization, it is not surprising that there is little consensus across parents and children in the intervening psychological processes. If they are not starting from the same premise (i.e., peer victimization), it is understandable that their descriptions of down-stream processes, such as attributions and coping responses, would diverge. The important finding related to comparisons across sources of information is that parents may be relatively unaware of whether their children are suffering emotional distress caused by peer victimization. It is hard to imagine that parents can effectively help children cope if they are not fully aware of their children’s suffering. Furthermore, we do not know whether parents are explicitly communicating to their children why they believe they were victimized or how they think their children should cope with peer victimization. It could be the case that parents are suggesting coping strategies that do not mesh with their children’s abilities. For example, a child that is passive or shy may be very unlikely to act assertively when victimized, even if that is what parents suggest they do. This would help explain why there is little consensus across parent and child report data. Interventions could perhaps encourage greater disclosure and discussion between children and parents. By doing so, parents may become more aware of their children’s social experiences and internal adjustment and subsequently could become more effective at helping their children deal with their peer victimization experiences.</p>

<title>Limitations of the Current Study</title>
<p>In previous sections, the possible limitations of the measures used in this study were briefly discussed. The lack of any systematic relationship between coping responses and the other variables could indicate that broader scales are needed to better assess both parents’ and children’s coping responses in relation to peer victimization.</p>
<p>A second limitation concerns generalizability. The current study included primarily upper middle-class White participants, thus the results of the study can best be generalized to this population of children. It could be that perceptions of peer victimization may be higher among lower socioeconomic children. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0272431610396089">Crick and Grotpeter (1995)</xref> reported a somewhat higher mean level of peer victimization for their primarily lower socioeconomic participants than what the current study found. However, utilizing a more socioeconomically diverse sample, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0272431610396089">Kochenderfer-Ladd and Skinner (2002)</xref> reported a mean level of peer victimization more similar to the current study. Future research should strive to include more economically and ethnically diverse populations.</p>
