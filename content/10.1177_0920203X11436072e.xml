<p>In the opening scene of the 2010 movie <italic>Legend of the Fist: The Return of Chen Zhen</italic>, the martial arts master Chen Zhen (played by Donnie Yen) was among dozens of Chinese labourers trapped in a Great War battle between the advancing German army and retreating French troops. With the aid of Hong Kong-styled action choreography and advanced computer graphics, the film shows how Chen stormed the German military strongholds and rescued fellow Chinese countrymen. Despite this cinematic portrayal of their heroism, the history of Chinese workers in wartime Europe remains an under-researched topic. The author of the book under review, Xu Guoqi, is to be commended for his valuable contribution in threading together the wartime experiences of Chinese labourers working for Britain and France on the Western Front during the First World War. A few of these men became war heroes. Some workers were executed by British and French commanders because of disciplinary problems; some were killed by Germans; and some married local women and settled down in continental Europe.</p>
<p>This is a very moving book from the start. It is as much concerned about what happened to these Chinese labourers as about their battlefield experiences, personal views, and feelings. By re-evaluating the role of Chinese labourers in the gruelling trench warfare in Europe, the book throws light on the complicated relations between war and labour, racism and migration, and China’s engagement with the West in the early 20th century. These contracted labourers constituted an integral part of China’s war policy with regard to Europe. When the Great War broke out, Liang Shiyi proposed to President Yuan Shikai to send hardworking labourers to support the Allies against Germany. The Chinese government regarded this labour policy as a key to facilitate China’s entry into the world of nations as an equal. Britain and France found this an irresistible proposal as they were faced with a serious labour shortage during the War. Many of the Chinese workers went to Europe for a variety of reasons, ranging from economic survival to personal adventure and patriotism. The majority of the British-recruited labourers reached France via Canada and returned to China by the same route. The Canadian journey revealed the strong anti-Chinese sentiment in North America. At the Western Front, the Chinese were seldom treated as civilian workers. They were sent to work in trenches, harbours, and military factories, and became vulnerable to the German attacks. The Chinese were never given arms to fight, but on many occasions they got involved in the actual fighting to defend themselves. There are many stories of bravery and courage of Chinese labourers who risked their lives to save fellow countrymen and British and French soldiers.</p>
<p>Xu draws on memoirs, letters, published and unpublished materials to reconstruct the stories of countless Chinese labourers in the war zone. Some of the accounts are terrifying, and they come fully alive in all the small details of the battlefield experience. Many of these narratives concern racism and deprivation, powerlessness and alienation in the military camps. As with other Indian, Egyptian, and African workers, the Chinese faced abuse and mistreatment from the British, French, and American officers. They frequently staged protests and strikes to defend their rights. The hardships that befell them highlighted the problem of institutional racism in Europe and led to a growing sense of frustration with the West among the Chinese workers.</p>
<p>One unintended consequence of this wartime labour policy was the political awakening of Chinese labourers. China sent many instructors to teach these workers and help raise their level of literacy. As a result, some literate labourers published war stories about an old Europe in decline and commented on Chinese politics and international affairs. Several prominent intellectuals such as Cai Yuanpei and Yan Yangchu became politicized after working with the labourers. The shared experience of politicization led the elite and labourers to embrace the idea of national salvation and to defend China’s sovereignty in the post-War era.</p>
<p>A major strength of this book is that Xu tells the story of Chinese labourers with great clarity and emotion, adding both a personal dimension and a China-centered perspective to the social history of the Great War. The 30 black-and-white photos provide a well of information about the everyday life of Chinese workers in the war zone. While reading <italic>Strangers on the Western Front</italic>, I could not hold back my sympathy for these wartime labourers. This book is full of insightful details; and because of its readability, it should appeal to anyone interested in wartime labour and racism in the early 20th century.</p>
