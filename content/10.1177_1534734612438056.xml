<abstract>
<p>This study describes a 2- to 13-year follow-up of a novel technique for osteosynthesis of neglected femoral neck fractures and nonunions that combines internal fixation with the benefits of fibular grafting and valgus angulation osteotomy. Twenty-three patients were treated by the “3-in-1” surgery, which consisted of osteosynthesis with a dynamic hip screw, nonvascularized fibular grafting, and valgus osteotomy, between January 1996 and June 2009. Union was achieved in all patients at an average of 5.4 months. The average shortening was 0.9 cm. Although avascular necrosis was seen in 4 patients, 2 of them still had good functional scores. Excellent and good hip functional scores were seen in 18 patients. Well-executed surgeries combining biomechanics and biology can ensure union in neglected femoral neck fractures and nonunions provided an adequate length of the neck and proximal fragment is present and there is no subchondral collapse.</p>

<body>
<p>Management of acute femoral neck fractures in the present day is much less ambiguous, with clear-cut treatment protocols for anatomical reduction and internal fixation. Despite these protocols for early intervention, nonunion has been reported in 10% to 30% of the cases.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1534734612438056">1</xref></sup> The problem is further compounded in the developing countries, where a significant number of patients with femoral neck fractures present late as a result of poverty, ignorance, belief in native bonesetters, and lack of hospital facilities and expertise.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1534734612438056">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1534734612438056"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1534734612438056"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1534734612438056"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1534734612438056"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1534734612438056">7</xref></sup></p>
<p>In geriatric patients and in unfixable nonunions, hemiarthoplasty or total hip arthroplasty often results in a satisfactory outcome. In physiologically younger patients, joint replacements are less ideal because of the higher functional demands of this population.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1534734612438056">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1534734612438056">8</xref></sup> The need for revision as a result of increased wear and loosening and the limitations that a replacement surgery imposes on a full active life warrant head preservation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1534734612438056">7</xref></sup></p>

In pursuit of optimizing the chances of successful osteosynthesis in young patients with neglected femoral neck fractures and nonunions, we combined internal fixation with a valgus osteotomy and fibular grafting, all 3 procedures being done simultaneously. The senior author (AD) has named this as 3-in-1 surgery. The principle behind combining the 3 techniques is to improve the mechanical as well as the biological environment at the nonunion site.</p>
<sec id="section1-1534734612438056" sec-type="materials|methods">
<title>Materials and Methods</title>
<p>We defined “neglected fractures” as those that were not surgically treated for more than 3 weeks and “nonunions” as those that showed no evidence of radiological healing with or without the presence of groin or buttock pain at 6 months postsurgery or postinjury.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1534734612438056">9</xref></sup></p>
<p>Data of all patients with a diagnosis of neglected femoral neck fractures and nonunions who were treated by this novel technique at a specialty care hospital in an Indian semiurban location between January 1996 and June 2009 were retrospectively analyzed, and functional outcomes were evaluated in the follow-up period. Local ethics committee approval was taken for this retrospective study.</p>
<p>All patients were operated on by AD. Preoperatively, postoperatively, and during follow-up visits, plain anteroposterior radiographs of the pelvis with both hips were used to assess proximal migration of the greater trochanter, neck-shaft angle (varus), Pauwels type, changes of avascular necrosis (AVN) stages according to the modified Ficat Arlet classification,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1534734612438056">11</xref></sup> secondary degenerative arthritis, status of graft and its incorporation, and evidence of healing. Clinically, patients were assessed using the Harris Hip Score. Nonunion at the osteotomy site was considered united when follow-up radiographs showed disappearance of the fracture line with trabeculae crossing the fracture and osteotomy site.</p>
<sec id="section2-1534734612438056">
<title>Operative Technique</title>
<p>The surgery was performed under combined anesthesia. The fracture was reduced by closed method under image intensifier control, on a fracture table by extension method. Two teams worked simultaneously, one harvesting a 10-cm nonvascularized fibular graft from the fractured limb and the other exposing the lateral aspect of the trochanter.</p>
<p>A dynamic hip screw (DHS) guidewire was passed through the inferior portion of the neck at an appropriate angle to the lateral aspect of the shaft of the femur that would ensure the required valgus in the end after the trochanteric osteotomy. A 6.5-mm AO cancellous screw (named after the Association for Osteosynthesis) was passed across the nonunion site proximal and parallel to the aforementioned guide wire, through the upper part of the neck. This temporary screw helps stabilize the fracture and prevent spinning of the head during reaming and DHS insertion. After triple reaming and tapping, a DHS of appropriate length was inserted. The barrel of a 5- to 6-holed 135°-angled side plate was slid over the screw but temporarily rotated away from the shaft. Under fluoroscopic guidance, 2 guidewires were placed along the line of the intended trochanteric osteotomy. This osteotomy was oblique in the coronal plane, extending from distal–lateral to proximal–medial and exiting at the level of the lesser trochanter medially.</p>
<p>Prior to osteotomy the limb was adducted using the guide wires as reference; the femur was osteotomized, preferably using an osteotome after drilling multiple holes. When the osteotomy was completed, the DHS side plate was rotated back parallel to the shaft. The limb was abducted again, and the distal femur was brought against the side plate and secured with cortical screws. The 6.5-mm cancellous screw was removed and its track reamed with an 8-mm DHS reamer to create a track for the fibular graft. The fibular graft was cut and trimmed to the size of the tunnel. Holes were drilled into the cortical bone to facilitate graft incorporation. The prepared fibular graft was then gently hammered into position in the neck and head proximal to the DHS screw. The remaining portion of the graft and the wedge that was removed were morcellized and used at the osteotomy site. A below-knee posterior plaster slab was applied on the ipsilateral leg until suture removal.</p>
<p>All patients were mobilized non–weight-bearing for a period of 8 weeks, followed by partial weight-bearing until apparent radiological union of the fracture and the osteotomy, at which time full weight-bearing was allowed.</p>

<sec id="section4-1534734612438056">
<title>Baseline Characteristics</title>
<p>A total of 23 patients were identified, from the review period (January 1996 to June 2006), to have neglected femoral neck fractures and nonunions and underwent surgery for osteosynthesis with a DHS, nonvascularized fibular grafting, and a valgus osteotomy.</p>
<p>The mean age in the patient group was 40 years (range = 24-55 years; <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1534734612438056">Table 1</xref>). Among the 23 patients, 21 sustained injury from road traffic accidents and 2 from home accidents. Though these 2 patients were in the 51- to 60-year age-group, they were included for analysis as their bone strength was good. All patients had been very active before the injury, and none was able to walk without support at the time of presentation. The right femur was affected in 13 patients. Eighteen patients had not received any orthopedic treatment, and 5 patients’ bone had failed to unite despite initial cannulated cancellous screw fixation. All patients had evidence of radiologically normal femoral heads, except the 3 patients who showed evidence of AVN (Ficat Arlet stage IIA) preoperatively. Skeletal traction was used in 15 patients for a period of 7 to 10 days to bring down the proximally migrated greater trochanter.</p>

<p>Patients were followed at an average of 55.7 months. All fractures at the site of osteotomies had united at an average of 5.4 months (range = 3-11 months), except in 1 patient. In this patient, the nonunion at the osteotomy site had united at 6 months, but the fracture failed to unite, and the implant had cut out of the head. Arthroplasty was done at 11 months.</p>
<p>The Pauwels grade improved from type III preoperatively to type II postoperatively in 15 cases and from type II to type I in 3 cases, and in 5 cases, it was the same as preoperative grade (II). The average neck-shaft angle at presentation was 107°, which valgalized to 136° postoperatively.</p>
<p>Four patients showed radiological signs of osteonecrosis at follow-up. Two each had stage IV and stage IIA modified Ficat Arlet changes. Three of the 4 patients already had stage IIA modified Ficat Arlet changes at the time of surgery. Two had progressed to stage IV AVN, of which 1 patient underwent arthroplasty until the time of the follow-up. The third remained static at IIA and was alright for 4 years, at which time he had started complaining. The fourth was the new one with fresh evidence of AVN. The 2 patients who had stage IV AVN had poor functional scores.</p>
<p>Shortening (proximal migration of trochanter), noticed in all but 2 patients, varied from 0.5 to 2.0 cm (average = 1.0 cm). The fibular graft was well incorporated in all but 1 patient in whom there was an implant cut out. There was no instance of graft breakage. Three cases had sensory blunting over the dorsum of the foot, and 1 patient had mild extensor hallucis longus muscle weakness as a result of the harvest of the fibular graft; but this donor-site morbidity was insignificant and did not trouble the patients in any way. In 2 patients, the implants were removed; one at 4 years and the other at 4.5 years. The modified Harris Hip Score<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1534734612438056">12</xref></sup> showed excellent to good results in 78% of the cases. None of the patients had degenerative arthritis until the follow-up of the study.</p>

<sec id="section6-1534734612438056" sec-type="discussion">
<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In developing countries, the delay in presentation is quite common. There is consensus regarding preservation of the femoral head in a young patient, all the more in societies with the custom of squatting. There is impaired healing potential in these cases of neglect and nonunion with a high Pauwels angle, variable amount of neck resorption, and the fracture not being amenable to simple fixation because of mechanical and biological factors.</p>
<p>The vertically oriented fracture (high Pauwels angle) produces shear at the fracture, which needs to be converted to compression forces for enhanced fracture healing. Valgus intertrochanteric osteotomies can convert shear forces at the nonunion site to compressive forces, which then promote fracture healing.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1534734612438056">13</xref></sup></p>
<p>The amount of recommended horizontality at the nonunion site after osteotomy is 20° to 30°. This creates the ideal forces directed at160° to be projected at an angle of 90°. This means that for an extremely high Pauwels angle of 70° an osteotomy of 50° is needed to convert to 20°. This much valgalization is likely to produce an abnormal biomechanical environment at the hip joint, leading to limp and abduction contracture. So in this series, the osteotomy wedge was restricted to a maximum of 30° in an endeavor to produce (a balance with the) adequate neck-shaft angle. This resulted in a postoperative angle of greater than 30° at the nonunion site in 20 of the patients. Despite this, the union occurred in all but 1 case, in which there occurred a cutout of the implant. This demonstrates that with adequate fixation with DHS and fibular grafting, union can be achieved with nonunion angles of greater than 30°. This is in agreement with other studies.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1534734612438056">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1534734612438056">15</xref></sup> Previous studies described the use of double-angled plates, but recent studies describe the use of the DHS, which provides a simple method of fixation, producing compression at the fracture site.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1534734612438056">15</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1534734612438056"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1534734612438056">17</xref></sup></p>

<p>Wu et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1534734612438056">14</xref></sup> compared the use of a sliding compression screw with and without subtrochanteric valgus osteotomy for femoral neck nonunion in 32 patients (mean age: 38 years). All the nonunions healed at a mean time of 4.6 months. Even though there were fewer complications in the nonosteotomy group, the authors recommended valgus osteotomy for patients with shortening of more than 1.5 cm because the valgus osteotomy helps gain leg length.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1534734612438056">15</xref></sup></p>
<p>Our ability to achieve union with a nonunion plane of greater than 30° demonstrates that this technique may be successful at producing a union with fracture planes upward of 40° to 50°. This technique does not limit the resultant fracture plane to less than 25° as suggested by Mueller. The nonunion plane reduction is limited to around 40° to minimize the amount of wedge to be taken at the level of the osteotomy. By not having to reduce the nonunion plane to less than 40°, the size requirement of the osteotomy is reduced. Splitting the size of the wedge on either side of the transverse osteotomy to provide adequate bone-to-bone contact was not required in this series.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1534734612438056">16</xref></sup> AVN in neglected displaced fractures is not inevitable. In fact, some authors have contended that with a displaced fracture, the hip assumes the position of maximum capacity, which helps relieve intracapsular pressure, decreasing the occurrence of AVN.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1534734612438056">18</xref></sup> A total hip replacement is considerably postponed.</p>
<p>Catto<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1534734612438056">19</xref></sup> showed that revascularization does take place in a necrotic femoral head following a fracture, though at a much lower rate, and also that the cartilage covering the necrotic bone rarely became abnormal until months or sometimes years had passed. Catto<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1534734612438056">19</xref></sup> also found that union can occur between an avascular head and a viable neck and that patients usually have no symptoms until collapse of the articular surface occurs, which on average takes 2 years (6 months to 17 years) to develop. This observation was further supported by Marti et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1534734612438056">10</xref></sup> and Tooke and Favero.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1534734612438056">20</xref></sup> From their studies, it was obvious that excellent function can be achieved after osteosynthesis of femoral neck fractures, even in the presence of preoperative radiologically evident AVN, unless gross subchondral collapse occurred. Schatzker<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1534734612438056">8</xref></sup> also stressed that AVN does not contribute to nonunion and that there is no contraindication to osteosynthesis in young adults with femoral head osteonecrosis. He also stated that segmental AVN is compatible with function and that reconstruction is a better alternative to arthroplasty in young patients.</p>
<p>Various methods of achieving osteosynthesis have been described, which basically consist of bone grafting (vascularized or nonvascularized), internal fixation, and angulation osteotomies. Meyer’s muscle pedicle grafting<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1534734612438056">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1534734612438056">21</xref></sup> requires prone positioning and skill. The disadvantages associated with muscle pedicle grafting are that it is more extensive, anatomy deforming, and more demanding with increased operating time.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1534734612438056">22</xref></sup></p>
<p>Coxa vara shortening and hip abductor weakness in cases of gluteus medius muscle pedicle grafting<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1534734612438056">21</xref></sup> are other associated drawbacks. Vascularized fibular and iliac crest grafts<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1534734612438056">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1534734612438056">5</xref></sup> are technically demanding and often require the services of a vascular surgeon. The method of free fibular grafting described by Nagi et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1534734612438056">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1534734612438056">23</xref></sup> is simple and efficient. In their initial series, all nonunions had united following treatment with a free fibular graft and a cancellous screw.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1534734612438056">23</xref></sup> In a later series,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1534734612438056">6</xref></sup> 38 of 40 cases went in for union at an average of 16.7 weeks. It can be used even if there is a partial resorption of the neck, as was the case in 5 of our patients. Nagi et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1534734612438056">6</xref></sup> found that their method of fibular grafting provided structural support, particularly in cases of neck comminution, promoted union, and allowed reconstruction in cases of neck resorption.</p>
<p>The trifin shape of the fibula prevented rotation, and drilled holes in the specially prepared fibular grafts promoted bony ingrowth. The fibular graft allegedly functioned as a “biological SP nail” with the bond between the “implant” and the femur strengthening with time, as was evident by the incorporation of the fibula into the femoral head.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1534734612438056">6</xref></sup> In their series, 7 out of 8 avascular femoral heads even revascularized after the procedure.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1534734612438056">6</xref></sup> However, their patients had to be put on a spica for 6 weeks, as the cortical autografts and the single compression screw were considered insufficient for adequate immobilization in cases of delayed union. Eleven of the 40 hips had developed coxa vara, and there was a mean limb length discrepancy of 2.9 cm (0.9-3.9 cm). Nagi et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1534734612438056">6</xref></sup> were of the opinion that this could be treated by an abduction osteotomy once the fracture had united. It was observed by Swiontkowski et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1534734612438056">24</xref></sup> that in the younger patients fractures tended to be more distal in the neck and more vertically oriented. With these vertical fracture lines, union despite stable fixation would be difficult because of shearing forces at the fracture site, as described by Pauwel.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1534734612438056">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1534734612438056">22</xref></sup> Intertrochanteric valgus osteotomies help to convert shearing forces at the nonunion site into compression forces and to achieve some length to an extremity shortened by neck resorption. Huang<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1534734612438056">4</xref></sup> encountered no failures in his series of 16 young adults with neglected femoral neck fractures, 11 of whom were treated with internal fixation and angulation osteotomy with or without bone grafting.</p>
<p>Marti et al,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1534734612438056">10</xref></sup> in their series of femoral neck nonunions treated with a Pauwels osteotomy and a 120-degree blade plate, encountered union at an average of 3.6 months in all except 3 of the 50 cases that had come for follow-up. It would be appropriate to combine the benefits of a fibular graft and a valgus angulation osteotomy in order to optimize the results with one single surgery. This prompted us to perform what we call the 3-in-1 surgery, wherein the aim was to fix, valgusize, and graft, all at once. We realized that the ideal implant to stabilize both the fracture and the osteotomy would be a DHS and plate.</p>
<p>Huang<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1534734612438056">4</xref></sup> had similarly treated 8 out of 16 cases of neglected femoral neck fractures with internal fixation, bone grafting, and angulation osteotomy. All of his patients had gone on to uneventful union within 6 months. However, he used an iliac bone graft at the nonunion site using the Phemister method, which would have apparently required visualization of the neck using the Watson–Jones approach. We were able to perform all 3 procedures through a single lateral approach that does not require visualization of the femoral neck and therefore avoids the inherent risk of further vascular damage.</p>
<p>We found that our results with regard to union rates (100%) and time to union (3-11 months) were comparable with other published reports (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1534734612438056">Table 2</xref>). Union rates in similar studies varied from 87.5% to 100%, and time to union varied from 2 to 10 months. The limb length discrepancy at follow-up was the lowest in our series (average 0.9 cm), with other workers describing shortening varying from 1 to 2.9 cm. Coxa vara was noticed in 26.7% of the cases in the series by Baksi et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1534734612438056">2</xref></sup> and in 18.75% to 27.5% of the cases in the series by Nagi et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1534734612438056">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1534734612438056">23</xref></sup> The low rates (5%) in our series can be attributed to the simultaneous osteotomy that helped achieve and maintain a valgus neck-shaft angle. As observed by Nagi et al,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1534734612438056">6</xref></sup> we too found that the fibular graft incorporated well.</p>

<p>Nagi et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1534734612438056">6</xref></sup> had to use a hip spica for 6 weeks for their patients who underwent AO screw fixation and nonvascularized fibular grafting. Huang<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1534734612438056">4</xref></sup> also used a hip spica in 4 cases. In their series of 168 cases treated with cancellous screws and fibular grafts, Sandhu et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1534734612438056">7</xref></sup> maintained patients on skin traction and bed rest for 3 to 4 weeks. However, all our patients did not need any form of external immobilization; they were mobilized non–weight-bearing at the earliest. The DHS provides a stable construct, with the fibular graft giving additional rotational stability.</p>
<p>One of 20 patients (5%) without preoperative and radiologically evident AVN developed stage IIA osteonecrosis following surgery (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1534734612438056">Table 3</xref>). However, this patient had a good functional score at review, 4.5 years after surgery. The low rate of AVN is similar to that seen in studies by Huang<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1534734612438056">4</xref></sup> (6.3%) and Sandhu et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1534734612438056">7</xref></sup> (3.6%). In 3 patients, radiological evidence of AVN was present prior to surgery. However, because of the absence of collapse, osteosynthesis was still carried out, and union was achieved. Two of these 3 patients had poor functional results that required further surgical treatment. Although one person underwent replacement surgery at 11 months, the other patient had 4 years of a symptom-free life following osteosynthesis. Similar results were seen by other workers. Of the 3 patients in Huang’s series with preoperative AVN, all of whom went in for union, only 1 patient underwent a replacement.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1534734612438056">4</xref></sup></p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Femoral head salvage in neglected femoral neck fractures and nonunions does provide good to excellent results. Even in the presence of AVN in delayed presentations, union is possible. Well-executed surgeries that combine biomechanics and biology will result in 90% to 100% union provided an adequate length of the neck and the proximal fragment is present and there is no subchondral collapse. Patients remain very active for many years following the conservative surgery, delaying the need for a replacement arthroplasty. Osteosynthesis with a DHS combined with a valgus osteotomy and free fibular grafting, the 3-in-1 surgery, optimizes biomechanics and biology for union, avoids coxa vara, and helps gain limb length.</p>
