<abstract>
<p>The recent economic crisis and swine flu pandemic have had significantly negative impacts on global tourism. Tourism in the United Kingdom has also suffered as a result of the two crises, although their actual impacts have yet to be evaluated. This study analyzes the impacts of these two phenomena on the demand for U.K. inbound tourism during the 2008Q1-2009Q2 period among visitors from the country’s 14 major visitor source markets. An econometric framework is proposed to separate and estimate the impacts of swine flu and the economic crisis on U.K. tourism demand.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Tourism demand studies have conventionally focused on the impact of one crisis alone. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0047287511400754">Araña and León (2008)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0047287511400754">Frey, Luechinger, and Stutzer (2007)</xref> examined the impact of terrorist attacks, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0047287511400754">Berrittella et al. (2006)</xref> those of natural disasters, on tourism demand. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0047287511400754">Blake, Sinclair, and Sugiyarto (2003)</xref> quantified the impact of foot and mouth disease on both tourism in the United Kingdom and the country’s overall economy. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0047287511400754">Hamilton and Tol (2007)</xref> addressed the influence of climate change, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0047287511400754">Pambudi, McCaughey, and Smyth (2009)</xref> estimated the impact of the Bali bombing on the Indonesian economy. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0047287511400754">Sheldon and Dwyer (2010)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0047287511400754">Smeral (2010)</xref>, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0047287511400754">Song and Lin (2010)</xref> evaluated tourism responses to the global financial crisis, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0047287511400754">Yang and Chen (2009)</xref> investigated the implications for tourism of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) epidemic in Taiwan. However, researchers recognize that global tourism is often faced with multiple crises at the same time. For example, in the period leading up to the second quarter of 2009, the sector had to deal not only with the global economic crisis that started in 2008Q1 but also with the swine flu pandemic that swept various parts of the globe in 2009Q2. The overlap between these two crises in 2009Q2 created a major headache for researchers attempting to identify their individual impacts. No investigation to date has sought to estimate or separate the effects of multiple crises on tourism. To our knowledge, this is the first study to propose a research framework that isolates the respective effects on tourism demand of two simultaneous events, the global economic crisis and the swine flu pandemic in this case.</p>
<p>Interest in the crisis-tourism nexus has been given substantial impetus by growing public awareness of global terrorist threats, particularly in the wake of the 9/11 attacks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0047287511400754">Blake and Sinclair 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0047287511400754">Wang 2009</xref>), and their impact on global and regional tourism demand (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0047287511400754">Araña and León 2008</xref>). There is also increased interest in the tourism effects of natural disasters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0047287511400754">UNWTO 1998</xref>). Such incidents not only have a direct impact on the volume and value of tourism flows between source and destination areas, but there is also direct evidence to show that displacement may occur, with demand shifting from a particular destination in response to a crisis-induced short-run event. Analysis in the wider domain of tourist health and safety has found that such events prompt visitors to change their travel patterns due to concerns over perceived risks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0047287511400754">Clift and Page 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0047287511400754">Wilks and Page 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>The origins of the global economic crisis can be traced back to 2004, when problems first arose in the U.S. subprime mortgage market as interest rates rose and mortgagees defaulted on their payment obligations. A notable trigger point in the United Kingdom was the collapse in late 2007 of Northern Rock (a bank specializing in high-cost subprime lending that was subsequently nationalized) following investor withdrawals of £1 billion in a single day. Other banks and financial institutions around the globe began to announce losses in the subprime market, but the key catalysts in 2008 were the collapse of Lehman Brothers and the domino effect of that collapse.</p>
<p>The <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0047287511400754">UNWTO (2009)</xref> reported that world tourist arrivals grew by 6% in the first 6 months of 2008 before contracting by 1% in the second half of the year. Public sector responses to this drop in overseas travel included measures to promote domestic tourism (the so-called staycation concept). The <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0047287511400754">UNWTO (2009)</xref> outlined three key areas in which action could be taken to revive ailing tourism demand internationally: resilience (in retaining and enhancing existing demand), stimulus (e.g., reviewing such policies as those governing taxation and visas to remove barriers to tourism), and the investment in the green economy (aiming to strengthen sustainable development through tourism).</p>
<p>As the credit crunch intensified in 2008 and spilled over into 2009, a further crisis appeared: the H1N1 influenza virus—or swine flu—pandemic. The initial outbreak occurred in Mexico in March 2009 before spreading to coterminous countries in the Americas and then to countries further afield, including the United Kingdom. The rapid increase in the number of swine flu cases in the United Kingdom attracted global media coverage, thanks to the country’s prominent position on the international tourism map. The world was not entirely unprepared for the swine flu crisis, given the preparations made by the World Health Organization in 2005 and 2006 in anticipation of a possible avian flu outbreak, but most countries were feeling its effects by December 2009, although its severity and scale varied by region (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0047287511400754">Figure 1</xref>).</p>

<p>According to an Oxford Economic Forecasting (OEF) report published in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0047287511400754">2009</xref>, although the economic costs of the swine flu pandemic were relatively low, in the longer term similar pandemics can be expected to result in much higher costs. In terms of tourism demand, we can expect a significant reduction in travel volume, which will have an impact on tourism supply. An important tourism-related point raised in the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0047287511400754">OEF (2009)</xref> economic model is that the by-country impact will be highly variable because of differing levels of economic dependency on tourism exports and imports (which the OEF models in relation to a tourism intensity measure).</p>
<p>An assessment of the simultaneous effects of the global economic crisis and the swine flu pandemic on tourism at the country level will be of interest to both destination policy makers and researchers. Such an assessment will allow the former to formulate appropriate policies aimed at minimizing the impacts of these or similar crises and the latter to develop suitable methods of assessing the individual impacts of multiple events on tourism.</p>
<p>The research framework proposed in this paper is based on an econometric technique that we have adopted to estimate tourism demand during multi-crisis periods under different scenarios. In reviewing existing studies on tourism demand modeling and forecasting, we discovered that a diverse range of methodologies have been applied in tourism demand analyses, including univariate time series approaches and multivariate econometric methods. The former model and forecast of demand for tourism based only on historic tourism demand data. The simplest of these is the naïve (or no-change) model, which is often used as a benchmark for assessing the forecasting accuracy of different tourism demand models. Other univariate time series models include the exponential smoothing and autoregressive moving average models. In contrast to these univariate time series techniques, multivariate or causal forecasting models take the factors influencing tourism demand into consideration, including the prices of tourism goods/services and their substitutes, tourist income, seasonality, and such one-off events as the two crises examined in this study. This set of models comprises the error-correction model, the autoregressive distributed lag model, and the time-varying parameter (TVP) model (for a detailed review, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0047287511400754">Song and Li 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>Prior studies have proved the TVP technique to be a reliable modeling strategy for short- to medium-term tourism demand forecasting when the underlying structure of the model changes over time because of external shocks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0047287511400754">Li, Song, and Witt 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0047287511400754">Riddington 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0047287511400754">Song and Wong 2003</xref>). It relaxes the constant regression parameter restriction and allows the model coefficients to vary over time, thus permitting an examination of coefficient changes due to such external shocks as policy changes and economic or noneconomic crises. The use of the TVP approach is highly appropriate for the current study, which deals with the impacts of the economic crisis and swine flu on the demand for U.K. tourism (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0047287511400754">Song, Witt, and Li 2009</xref>). Other empirical studies have also proved the technique to be an efficient tool for generating accurate forecasts in tourism demand studies (see, e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0047287511400754">Song, Witt, and Jensen 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0047287511400754">Riddington 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. The next section presents the background to inbound tourism and discusses the econometric approach used to separate the respective effects of the two crises of interest on U.K. inbound tourism. The impacts of these crises on international tourist income are assessed next, with a particular focus on their economic consequences. The last section concludes the paper.</p>

<title>Research Background and Data</title>
<p>Overseas arrivals in the United Kingdom have grown steadily since the 1980s. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0047287511400754">Figure 2</xref> shows that this broadly upward trend has helped to position the country’s inbound market as one of the most significant globally. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0047287511400754">Deloitte (2008)</xref> put the economic value of international visitors to the United Kingdom in 2007 at £16 billion, a figure comparable to the approximately £21 billion value of the country’s numerically greater domestic tourism market. The United States remains the most important source market for international tourism to the United Kingdom, sending more than 3.6 million visitors in 2007 who spent £2.6 billion. Its closest rival is Germany, whose citizens in the same year made 3.3 million visits and a £1.2 billion contribution to tourist revenues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0047287511400754">Deloitte 2008</xref>).</p>

</fig>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0047287511400754">Figure 3</xref> shows that the United Kingdom’s earnings from overseas visitors have displayed consistently greater growth than visitor arrivals. Arrivals grew by 3.4% between 1980 and 2008, whereas earnings grew by 6.3% over the same time frame. Yet as VisitBritain (the United Kingdom’s national tourism organization responsible for overseas marketing) acknowledges, in the early part of the new millennium, the average spend per overseas visitor was relatively static.</p>

<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0047287511400754">Deloitte (2008)</xref> also examined a possibly favorable scenario associated with the economic recession, that is, the continued drop in gross domestic product (GDP) and consumer spending would lead to a depreciating currency, which, theoretically, would make the country attractive to international tourists. The recession was predicted to reduce the growth in international arrivals to 0.2% in 2008, 0.5% in 2009, and 1.1% in 2010, with a corresponding impact on their spending of 1.0%, 0.4%, and 0.1%, respectively. However, this set of results based on the expected effects of depreciation in the value of Sterling has to be set against those of surveys evaluating the propensity of overseas visitors to come to the United Kingdom during the credit crunch. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0047287511400754">Olive Research (2009)</xref> reported that 64% of visitors from the United States, Spain, Ireland, and France were likely to cut back on holidays in terms of duration and spending. Surveys have indicated that the United Kingdom’s inbound tourism is unlikely to see any firm signs of a sustained recovery until 2011. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0047287511400754">Deloitte (2008)</xref> observed that exchange rate sensitivity and security concerns have also had a profound effect on U.S. tourism to the United Kingdom in the past. Even so, the United Kingdom remains a strong international destination.</p>
<p>The data used in this study were obtained from two major sources. Arrivals and expenditure data for 1993Q1-2009Q2 were retrieved from the International Passenger Survey carried out by the United Kingdom’s Office for National Statistics (ONS), and are available from the VisitBritain website (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.visitbritain.org/">http://www.visitbritain.org/</ext-link>). Data on the explanatory variables, including GDP, Consumer Price Indices (CPI), and exchange rates, were obtained from the International Monetary Fund’s <italic>International Financial Statistics</italic> (1985-2009).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0047287511400754">
<title>Research Framework</title>
<p>The procedure adopted to separate the impacts of the two crises of interest is as follows. First, the data sample (1993Q1-2009Q2) was divided into two periods: the model estimation period (1993Q1-2007Q4), during which neither the economic crisis nor the swine flu pandemic had yet emerged, and the ex post forecasting period (2008Q1-2009Q2), which begins when the economic crisis hit the United Kingdom and ends with both events still affecting it. Second, the TVP model was estimated using data for 1993Q1-2007Q4 to identify the causal relationship between tourism demand and its determinants (i.e., tourist income, the price of U.K. tourism for international tourists, and the prices in substitute destinations). Third, to separate the effects on tourism demand of the two crises, we evaluated demand in the forecasting period under two scenarios/assumptions, the “no-impact scenario” and the “economic-impact scenario,” based on the relationship identified by the TVP model (presented later in this section as <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="disp-formula1-0047287511400754">Equations 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="disp-formula2-0047287511400754">2</xref>, respectively).</p>
<sec id="section5-0047287511400754">
<title>No-impact scenario (Scenario A)</title>
<p>In this scenario, we assumed that neither crisis occurred in the 2008Q1-2009Q2 period. The TVP model was used to estimate the economic relationship between the demand for U.K. tourism among the residents of an origin market <italic>i</italic> and the determinants of that demand based on 1993Q1-2007Q4 data. Therefore, the demand data (including arrivals, income, and tourism prices) contained no information on either the economic crisis or the swine flu pandemic. We then generated forecasts of the factors influencing tourism demand under scenario A for the 2008Q1-2009Q2 period. The exponential smoothing approach was adopted to produce the forecasts of these influencing factors based on historic data up to 2007Q4. Prior research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0047287511400754">Song, Witt, and Jensen 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0047287511400754">Song, Wong, and Chon 2003</xref>) has demonstrated that this approach generally produces more reliable forecasts of explanatory variables than do other time series approaches. The visitor income and price variable forecasts for 2008Q1-2009Q2 should thus not reflect the influence of either crisis. These estimated values were then substituted into the demand relationship estimated by the TVP model to generate forecasts of tourism demand (visitor arrivals) for this period. These forecasts should represent the number of arrivals that would have been recorded if neither the economic crisis nor the swine flu pandemic had occurred. As the latter first appeared in 2009Q2, the difference between the tourism demand forecast under scenario A and actual tourism demand over the 2008Q1-2009Q1 period measures the pure impact of the economic crisis on demand in this period. The difference between the scenario A forecast and actual tourism demand in 2009Q2 measures the combined impact of the economic crisis and the swine flu pandemic on tourism demand in this quarter. Scenario B, the economic-impact scenario, was then used to separate the impacts of the two crises in 2009Q2.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0047287511400754">
<title>Economic-impact scenario (Scenario B)</title>
<p>In this scenario, the actual values of the relevant explanatory variables for 2009Q2 are substituted into the established TVP model to generate the arrivals variable for this quarter. The explanatory variables are tourist income and tourism prices and are measured by economic indicators, including GDP, CPI, and exchange rates. Although it can safely be assumed that the swine flu pandemic is exogenous to these economic indicators, the economic crisis, which had a significant impact on all three, is likely to be endogenous. The actual values of the explanatory variables for 2009Q2 therefore contain information on the economic crisis, but not on the swine flu pandemic. As a result, the estimation of visitor arrivals under scenario B measures the demand for U.K. tourism in 2009Q2 with no influence from the pandemic. It could be argued that the swine flu outbreak may have had an impact on GDP growth, but both <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0047287511400754">Fukač and Lees (2009)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0047287511400754">Keogh-Brown et al. (2009)</xref> found that impact to be small and indirect. We therefore consider our assumption that the swine flu pandemic is exogenous to economic growth to be a valid one.</p>
<p>Once tourism demand in each of the two scenarios had been estimated, the impacts of the two crises could be measured separately by comparing the estimates with actual visitor arrivals over the 2008Q1-2009Q2 period. As previously noted, the difference between the scenario A tourism demand forecast and actual demand in the 2008Q1-2009Q1 period measures the pure impact of the economic crisis in these five quarters. The difference between actual tourism demand (arrivals) and the scenario B demand forecast (arrivals) in 2009Q2 measures the pure impact of the swine flu epidemic in this quarter, whereas the difference between the scenario A and B forecasts measures the pure impact of the economic crisis in this quarter.</p>

<title>Time-Varying Parameter Model</title>
<p>Due to its aforementioned advantages, the TVP model was used both to establish the relationship between tourism demand and the explanatory variables and to produce the ex post forecasts under the two scenarios. The TVP approach relaxes the constant-parameter restriction by specifying the model in a state space form and the unobserved variables (the time-varying coefficients of the explanatory variables) in a random walk process. More specifically, the two following equations, the measurement equation and the transition equation, are included in the model:</p>

As the model’s parameters for each source market vary over time, space constraints prevent us from reporting the model estimates for all source markets. However, to give the reader a feel for the model estimations, we report the estimated income elasticities and diagnostic statistics for three source markets, the United States, Spain, and Hong Kong, in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0047287511400754">Figure 4</xref>. The estimates of the remaining coefficients for all markets are available from the authors on request. The results in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0047287511400754">Figure 4</xref> show that the estimated income elasticities vary over time, as expected, and the model diagnostics suggest a reasonable fit to the data.</p>

<title>Crisis Impact Assessment</title>
<p>The impacts of the global economic crisis and the swine flu pandemic on the demand for U.K. inbound tourism are examined by source market. The principal source markets considered are Australia, Canada, mainland China, France, Germany, Hong Kong, India, Ireland, Japan, South Korea, the Netherlands, Russia, Spain, and the United States, which together accounted for 60.6% of total visitor arrivals in the United Kingdom in 2008. The inclusion of these 14 tourism source markets allows us to examine the effect of both crises from different geographic perspectives, as they encompass the traditional source markets in Europe, the Americas, and Oceania, as well as such emerging Asian markets as China and India. <italic>Foresight</italic>, the regular market intelligence publication of VisitBritain (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.visitbritain.org/insightsandstatistics/reports/foresight.aspx">http://www.visitbritain.org/insightsandstatistics/reports/foresight.aspx</ext-link>), provides further details.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0047287511400754">Figure 5</xref> illustrates actual total inbound visitor arrivals and the demand estimates produced under scenario A in the 2008Q1-2009Q2 period, from which it can be seen that the former are lower than the latter. The difference between the actual and forecast figures in this period illustrates the cumulative effects of the economic crisis and the swine flu pandemic on overall visitor arrivals to the United Kingdom. The difference in the 2008Q1-2009Q1 period reflects the pure impact of the economic crisis, whereas that for 2009Q2 reflects the joint impact of the two events. We can conclude that the global economic crisis and swine flu pandemic together had a significantly negative impact on the demand for inbound tourism to the United Kingdom.</p>

Their collective major negative impact on that demand in all 14 markets can clearly be seen, with an overall loss of 4.7 million visitors over this period, accounting for about 14.3% of estimated visitor arrivals from these origins under scenario A. Arrivals from the United States, Germany, Ireland, and Spain saw the greatest decline and those from Asian source markets the least (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0047287511400754">Table 2</xref>). When the percentage changes are considered, however, the global economic crisis and swine flu pandemic had the greatest effect on inbound tourism flows from mainland China, Russia, and South Korea, which saw declines of 40.5%, 39.9%, and 35.9%, respectively (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0047287511400754">Table 3</xref>). Tourism demand in France, Canada, and Australia was influenced the least, with estimated decreases of 4.4%, 8.0%, and 9.5%, respectively.</p>

<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0047287511400754">Tables 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0047287511400754">3</xref> identify the impact of the economic crisis on U.K. inbound tourism, as measured by the change in the number and percentage of visitor arrivals from the 14 source markets, respectively. This crisis clearly had a negative impact on tourist inflows from all of the source markets concerned during the 2008Q1-2009Q2 period. As can be seen from <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0047287511400754">Table 2</xref>, an estimated 3.7 million visitor arrivals from these markets can be considered to have been lost because of the economic crisis. If all source markets are considered, then it is likely that the crisis kept as many as 6 million potential visitors away, accounting for approximately 11.1% of total visitor arrivals under scenario A. Germany and the United States appear to be the two source markets most affected, with reductions in visitor arrivals of 1,074,500 and 962,300, respectively, followed by Ireland, which sent 537,600 fewer visitors to the United Kingdom as a result of the economic crisis. These results are not dissimilar to the findings of attitudinal research commissioned by VisitBritain in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0047287511400754">2009</xref> to examine behavioral changes in specific source markets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0047287511400754">Olive Research 2009</xref>). The resulting report highlighted concerns over the cumulative effect of a recent increase in air passenger duty in the United Kingdom, a cost borne by the traveler, which was expected to net the U.K. government around £2.5 billion a year.</p>

<title>Impact of swine flu pandemic</title>
<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0047287511400754">Tables 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0047287511400754">3</xref> also show the impact of the swine flu pandemic on U.K. inbound tourism demand in the second quarter of 2009, as measured by the change in the number and percentage of visitor arrivals from each source market, respectively. It is evident that the pandemic had a negative impact on that demand in all 14 origin countries, being responsible for an estimated loss of 1.6 million visitors in 2009Q2 (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0047287511400754">Table 2</xref>). Some of these potential visitors were discouraged from traveling by global policy responses, such as the advisories against travel to infected areas issued by some countries, quarantine measures for suspected cases of infection, and thermal screening, all of which fueled media interest and led to a contraction in demand. Although some countries, including the United Kingdom, followed the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0047287511400754">UNWTO’s (2009)</xref> roadmap by switching to an emphasis on domestic tourism, the outbreak’s effect on inbound arrivals remained significant. As <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0047287511400754">Table 3</xref> shows, in terms of the percentage change, it had the greatest effect on arrivals from China, Spain, South Korea, and Russia. These sudden declines in arrival numbers in comparison with the normal seasonal pattern of inbound tourism will have resulted in a significant loss in revenues. The next section seeks to quantify the effects of these losses on the U.K. tourism sector.</p>

<sec id="section11-0047287511400754">
<title>Direct revenue losses</title>
<p>We also estimate the direct revenue loss to the United Kingdom in the 2008Q1-2009Q2 period due to the impact of the two crises on reducing visitor arrivals and, accordingly, expenditures. Direct revenue loss refers to the reduction in visitor spending in the United Kingdom due to the decline in visitor arrivals. We therefore calculate this loss by multiplying the estimated fall in arrivals from 2008Q1 to 2009Q2 by tourism expenditure per capita for each source market.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0047287511400754">Table 4</xref> indicates the direct revenue loss estimated to have occurred as a result of the economic crisis and the swine flu pandemic. It is estimated that £4.7 billion in receipts were lost because of these two events in the 2008Q1-2009Q2 period, with £3.7 billion attributable to the economic crisis and £940 million to the swine flu outbreak. This represents a cumulative loss in inbound U.K. tourism revenue of about 19.6% based on 2007 expenditure figures. In terms of magnitude, the economic crisis had a proportionally greater long-term cumulative effect than the flu outbreak, accounting for almost 80% of the direct revenue loss. Nevertheless, within the three-month period for which it was examined in this study, the swine flu pandemic accounted for 20% of total direct revenue loss over the 2008Q1-2009Q2 period. This significant loss illustrates the event’s immediate effect and limited time lag in changes to demand, features normally associated with severe shocks such as SARS or the 9/11 attacks.</p>

<p>Refers to the total losses resulting from the economic crisis and swine flu outbreak combined in the 2008Q1-2009Q2 period.</p>

</table-wrap-foot>
</table-wrap>
<p>In the case of the economic crisis, the source markets responsible for the greatest reductions in U.K. tourism receipts were the United States (£750 million) and Germany (£445 million), followed by Ireland (£173 million) and Russia (£143 million). In 2008Q1 and 2008Q2, the crisis led to reductions of £39 million and £511 million, respectively, with the decline reaching a peak in 2008Q3, which saw a loss in tourist receipts of approximately £1.2 billion. Since 2008Q4, the revenue directly lost to the economic crisis has gradually diminished, with a relative reduction in the economic value of inbound tourism totaling £119 million in 2009Q2, a quarter in which much of the overall fall (£940 million) can be attributed to the swine flu outbreak. The decline in expenditures due to this outbreak in 2009Q2 is roughly equivalent to that due to the economic crisis in the last quarter of 2008 (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0047287511400754">Table 4</xref>). Among the various source markets, the highest swine flu–related losses in 2009Q2 were from Spain and the United States, estimated at £164 million and £114 million, respectively. The flu outbreak had the smallest economic impact on the Japanese and Hong Kong outbound markets, which were responsible for respective reductions in U.K. revenues of £0.5 million and £1.4 million. It is clear that by 2009Q2, swine flu had supplanted the economic crisis as the main crisis affecting inbound tourism to the United Kingdom, although the decline in expenditures remained a prominent issue (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0047287511400754">Table 4</xref>). Given the magnitude of these two crises and their effects on inbound tourism demand in 2008 and 2009, it is essential that we consider how crises such as these affect short-term demand. The United Kingdom also needs a realistic reassessment of its current expectations for inbound tourism and its tourism sector’s ability to recover from its current position.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>To our knowledge, this is the first study to propose the use of a research framework based on an econometric method (the TVP model) to evaluate the distinct impacts of two simultaneous crises on the demand for tourism under different scenarios. From the methodological perspective, this study contributes to the tourism demand forecasting literature by introducing an innovative approach to separating the impacts of multiple crises on tourism demand. The study’s empirical results suggest that the swine flu pandemic and the global economic crisis that began in 2008 have together had a significantly negative impact on the demand for U.K. inbound tourism in all 14 source markets under consideration. The largest recorded declines in visitor arrivals during the period under study were from the United States, Germany, Ireland, and Spain, whereas the smallest were from Asian markets. In terms of the percentage change of visitor arrivals, the greatest declines were seen in mainland China, Russia, and South Korea and the least in France, Canada, and Australia. In addition to the impact of the economic crisis, it is estimated that the swine flu pandemic had a significantly negative effect on U.K. tourism demand in all 14 source markets in the second quarter of 2009. In terms of the percentage change, visitor arrivals from mainland China, Spain, South Korea, and Russia declined more than those from the other source markets as a result of the swine flu outbreak.</p>
<p>This study is not without limitations. First, we use only visitor arrivals to measure tourism demand. Future research could also explore other tourism demand proxies such as tourist expenditures or hotel revenues to help policy makers to establish effective marketing and investment strategies. The second limitation of the study is that the proposed theoretical framework can deal with only two simultaneous events at a time, with one being exogenous to the economic variables in the demand model. If both crises were endogenous to the economic variables, then the proposed framework would no longer be suitable. The third limitation of the study is the use of France as a substitute destination. A more appropriate approach would be to consider multiple destinations that provide similar tourism products as possible substitute destinations of the United Kingdom. A final limitation is that the model used in this study produces only point forecasts when assessing the impact of two crises. Interval forecasts would be more desirable, as they reduce the risk of complete forecasting failure. However, when interval forecasts are used to evaluate the impact of a crisis, the implications so derived may be weak or even barely meaningful. The current study thus focused on point forecasts.</p>
