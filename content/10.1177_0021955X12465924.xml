<p>It has been a great pleasure to host the third BIOFOAMS conference (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="www.biofoams2011.com">www.biofoams2011.com</ext-link>) after the success of the first two conferences in Capri (2007) and at Niagara Fall in Canada (2009). The BIOFOAMS conference this year was sponsored by the Italian National Research Council (CNR), the University of Naples “Federico II” and the University of Toronto.</p>
<p>Invited and keynote presentations were focused on basic science, technologies and applications related to the use of biopolymers and biomaterials in the development of foams and, more in general, of porous structures. Quite a few papers were polylactic acid (PLA) and filled PLA systems through the use of micro and nano particles such as glass particles for biomedical applications, microfibrillated cellulose and nanoclays. Several paper were related to the use of polysaccharides, mainly starch, chitosan and proteins/lignin systems for the development of plastic formulations suitable for the preparations of cellular materials. Other papers focused on the preparation and characterization of flexible and rigid polyurethane foams based on formulations containing bio-based polyols.</p>
<p>Selected papers presented at the conference in Capri are published in two Special Issues (September and November 2012) dedicated to BIOFOAMS by the Journal of Cellular Plastics.</p>
