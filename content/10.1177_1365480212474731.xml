<abstract>
<p>There is a real prospect of a significant increase in the number of children and young people processed through the juvenile/youth justice system in Nigeria. Yet, both community- and institutionally-based structures for juvenile/youth justice management are grossly inadequate and have led to ‘crisis’ conditions. Several countries in sub-Saharan Africa are either in the middle of, or have concluded, sweeping changes in their youth/juvenile justice systems. A common feature of these reforms is the strengthening of diversion programmes. Drawing on the lessons generated by such initiatives, this article makes various recommendations towards advancing juvenile/youth justice policy and practice in Nigeria with a particular emphasis on diversion programmes.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>In the last decade, various data and reports from different parts of the world have revealed that the population of children and young people coming into contact with juvenile/youth justice systems is growing at a rapid rate (see, for example <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1365480212474731">Kibuka, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1365480212474731">Ozen et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1365480212474731">Rodriguez, 2007</xref>). The rising global youth population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-1365480212474731">UN, 2008</xref>) and the concurrent dwindling of global resources have combined in a way that might increase youth crime and/or youth criminalization. Furthermore, the rate of adverse social outcomes for children and young people is expected to climb highest in the developing countries of Africa and Southern Asia: vast regions accommodating 80 per cent of the world’s children and young people (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-1365480212474731">UN, 2008</xref>) that are also the worst-hit areas with regard to the devastating effects of the global economic crisis (ILO, 2010). To make matters worse, the social circumstances of children and young people in these regions – especially in sub-Saharan Africa– are compounded by growing youth unemployment, profound disruptions in family and kin networks, patterns of rural-urban migration, high prevalence of HIV/AIDS and widening social inequalities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1365480212474731">Shaw and Tschiwula, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-1365480212474731">Unicef, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-1365480212474731">UMP, 2000</xref>). In this context, many children and young people are facing multiple social difficulties that might increase their recourse to crime and/or invoke their criminalization.</p>
<p>Among the countries in sub-Saharan Africa, Nigeria arguably presents the most worrisome case with regard to juvenile/youth crime. This is not unconnected to the poorer-than-average social and economic indicators in the country and the sheer volume of Nigerian children and young people. Nigeria ranks high among the world’s countries with the lowest Human Development Indices (HDI) falling below the regional average across sub-Saharan Africa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-1365480212474731">UNDP, 2011</xref>). The per capita income in Nigeria in 2003 was USD 290 with only three countries –Rwanda, Mali and Togo – being more disadvantaged within the entire African region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1365480212474731">Earth Trends, 2003</xref>). Since that time, the level of poverty in Nigeria has continued to rise (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1365480212474731">Omotola, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1365480212474731">Oshewolo, 2010</xref>). The most recent <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-1365480212474731">Unicef (2012)</xref> report of the ‘state of the world’s children’ puts the proportion of Nigerians living below the poverty line of USD 1.25 per day at above 60 per cent, with the figures climbing to as high as 91 per cent if a benchmark of USD 2 is applied (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1365480212474731">CIA, 2011</xref>). Similarly, a conservative estimate of youth unemployment in Nigeria in 2010 stood at 24 per cent (according to official government data; see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1365480212474731">National Bureau of Statistics, 2010</xref>). Social inequality is also stark as endemic corruption has created a situation whereby approximately two-thirds of the national wealth is concentrated in the hands of the richest 20 per cent of the population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1365480212474731">Earth Trends, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1365480212474731">Oshewolo, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>This is the context within which 75 million children and young people live in Nigeria, a figure that accounts for about 20 per cent of the entire youth population of sub-Saharan Africa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1365480212474731">CIA, 2011</xref>). The combination of an extraordinarily large youth population, together with chronic conditions of poverty and social inequality, comprises a key driver of delinquency, youth crime and criminalization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-1365480212474731">UMP, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-1365480212474731">UN, 2000</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-1365480212474731">2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-1365480212474731">UNCSD and HA, 1993</xref>;). As might be expected, there is evidence that a large proportion of children and young people in Nigeria are, or have been, in contact with the juvenile/youth justice system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1365480212474731">Ogundipe, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>The current policy and practice emphasis within the Nigerian juvenile/youth justice system remains focused on incarceration due largely to a weak legal and administrative framework that fails to sustain community-based alternatives (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1365480212474731">Alemika and Chukwuma, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-1365480212474731">Unicef, 2006</xref>). This situation has created a scenario whereby even the most minor offenders (including status offenders) are often incarcerated in overcrowded juvenile institutions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1365480212474731">Atilola 2012a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1365480212474731">Okusanya, 2004</xref>), while other young offenders are detained in adult prisons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1365480212474731">Amnesty International, 2008</xref>) in flagrant violation of international human rights standards. Incarceration of children and young people – especially minor or status offenders –carries the risk of compounding delinquent and/or offender identities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1365480212474731">Dishion et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1365480212474731">Elliot, 1994</xref>) and marking the beginning of a life of chronic offending (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1365480212474731">Eberly et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-1365480212474731">Yoshikawa, 1995</xref>).</p>
<p>This article examines how the lack of well-established alternatives to child/youth incarceration in Nigeria leads to human rights violations. It addresses the Government of Nigeria directly – being the primary duty-bearer for the protection of the rights of all Nigerian children and the custodian of juvenile justice administration in the country. The article is divided into five sections. The first section briefly surveys the concepts and the philosophical underpinnings of diversion in juvenile/youth justice. The second section examines the current administrative and legal framework for juvenile/youth justice management in Nigeria with some emphasis on diversion and diversion programmes. The third section considers how the lack of diversion programmes underpins the crisis being experienced in Nigeria’s juvenile/youth justice system and presents a rights-based argument in support of the development and implementation of such programmes. The fourth section reviews local and international best practices that have helped to evolve robust diversion programmes for children and young people in trouble and that might be taken to inform policy and practice development in Nigeria. The final section of the article makes a series of recommendations towards improving policy and practice and stimulating further debate in respect of juvenile/youth justice management in Nigeria.</p>

<sec id="section2-1365480212474731">
<title>Diversion and Juvenile/Youth Justice Management</title>
<p>For the purposes here, diversion is taken to refer to ‘strategies developed in the youth justice system to prevent young people from committing crime or to ensure that they avoid formal court action and custody if they are arrested and prosecuted’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1365480212474731">Muncie, 1999</xref>: 305). To put it another way, an approach that encompasses non-punitive measures in responding to juvenile cases. In this way, the social and theoretical underpinnings of diversion might be allied to a ‘welfare’ based model whereby children and young people are principally conceptualized not as ‘rational or self-determining agents, but rather are subject to, and are the product of, the environment within which they live’ and that ‘any criminal action on their part can, therefore, be attributed to dysfunctional elements in that environment’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1365480212474731">Alder and Wundersitz,1994</xref>: 3). The key objective of diversion as an operational management strategy, therefore, is to channel children and young people in trouble away from formal juvenile/youth justice systems–without necessarily fully absolving them of culpability for their actions – and, where appropriate, to offer supportive interventions within the conventional correctional apparatus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1365480212474731">Beck et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1365480212474731">Goldson, 2000</xref>).</p>
<p>Despite popular critiques that diversion of children and young people from formal adjudication amounts to: going soft on offenders; neglecting the needs of victims; focusing on the needs of the juvenile instead of her/his deeds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-1365480212474731">Walgrave, 2004</xref>); the principle has continued to retain a significant presence within juvenile/youth justice administration worldwide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1365480212474731">Holden and Kapler, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1365480212474731">Muntingh and Shapiro, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1365480212474731">Polk et al., 2003</xref>). The continued relevance of diversion as an alternative to formal adjudication variously hinges on: its cost effectiveness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1365480212474731">Aos, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1365480212474731">Dick et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1365480212474731">Levin, 2010</xref>); association with reduced risk of recidivism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1365480212474731">Benda and Tollet, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1365480212474731">Goldson, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1365480212474731">Holman and Ziedenberg, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1365480212474731">Shelden, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1365480212474731">Sulivan et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-1365480212474731">Whitehead and Lab, 2001</xref>); increased chances of children and young people receiving appropriate interventions beyond juvenile/youth justice systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1365480212474731">Beck et al., 2006</xref>); and reduced chances of negative interference with the continued social development and socialization of children and young people including their schooling and family life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1365480212474731">Balfanz et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1365480212474731">Levin, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>Furthermore, in observance of the ‘best interests of the child’ –which is a fundamental principle underpinning the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child –diversion is imperative. Indeed, diversion is one of the key ways to protect the best interests of the child in terms of future social prospects, without interfering significantly with the course of justice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1365480212474731">Beck et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1365480212474731">Muntingh and Shapiro, 1997</xref>). This is especially so, in the case of minor or status offenders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1365480212474731">Alberola and Molina, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1365480212474731">Goldson, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1365480212474731">Holden and Kapler, 1995</xref>). In sum, diversion as used here is taken to refer to the various ways by which children and young people in trouble might be offered – as appropriate –safe, stable, fair and temporary support and supervision within the community, without recourse to undue criminalization, retribution and/or punishment (Archburkle and Jones, 2006; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1365480212474731">Crowell, 2001</xref>).</p>

<title>The Contemporary Framework for Juvenile/Youth Justice Management in Nigeria</title>
<sec id="section4-1365480212474731">
<title>The administrative and legal framework</title>
<p>There are two different jurisdictions for juvenile justice administration in Nigeria: the Federal and the State jurisdictions. The Federal jurisdiction is focused on responding to children and young people in trouble and/or those who are adjudged to be ‘beyond parental control’. This jurisdiction is guided by the Borstal Institution and Remand Home Act (BIRCA) of Nigeria. On the other hand, State jurisdictions focus more on abused or neglected children and young people deemed to be in need of care and protection, but they also encompass status offenders. This jurisdiction is guided by the Children and Young Persons Act (CYPA) of Nigeria as domiciled in the respective states.</p>
<p>The BIRCA provides for the establishment of borstal homes that are run by the Federal Government under the direct control of the Nigerian Prison Services. After being processed in the juvenile courts, children and young people in trouble and/or those declared as ‘beyond parental control’ are sentenced to borstal institutions for a period not less than three years unless given special state pardon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1365480212474731">Ogundipe, 2011</xref>). There are three borstal homes run by the Federal Government with a total capacity of approximately 500. Two of these institutions are located in one of the six geo-political zones in the country. They all admit boys only.</p>
<p>The CYPA provides for the establishment of remand homes as a place of refuge for victims of child maltreatment or neglect as well as children in any form of circumstance warranting protection.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1365480212474731">1</xref></sup> By extension, remand homes also serve a multipurpose function as temporary detention centres for status offenders who, in Nigeria, are mostly street children. At least two-thirds of the 36 states in Nigeria currently run a remand home.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1365480212474731">
<title>The current state of diversion</title>
<p>A report by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-1365480212474731">Unicef (2006)</xref> –published after a nationwide survey of diversion programmes in Nigeria –revealed that only a very limited number of programmes actually exist, and these are the result of the efforts of Non-Governmental Organisation (NGOs) and Community Based Organisations (CBOs). Beyond, the NGO/CBO-driven programmes, state-provided initiatives are virtually non-existent. The resources available to diversion programmes were also found to be deficient in the Unicef survey. Firstly, there is a paucity of family courts to dispense juvenile justice cases, leading to long delays in moving children and young people from temporary detention to the few available diversion programmes where applicable. Secondly, the level of training available to staff operating diversion schemes –as well as the motivation of judicial and social work staff to participate fully in such training – were found to be poor. More importantly, there is currently no coherent legal framework for diversion schemes in Nigeria, thereby creating routine and obstructive disagreements on technical grounds among parties involved in processing juvenile offenders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-1365480212474731">Unicef, 2006</xref>).</p>
</sec>

<sec id="section6-1365480212474731">
<title>The ‘Crisis’ in the Nigerian Juvenile/Youth Justice System</title>
<p>In a recent report submitted by Nigeria to the United Nations Committee on the Rights of the Child, the implementation of diversion programmes was recognized as a priority strategy to address what was termed the ‘crisis’ in the juvenile justice system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-1365480212474731">UN/CRC, 2009</xref>: 125). Such a ‘crisis’ comprises various dimensions that are considered below.</p>
<sec id="section7-1365480212474731">
<title>Overcrowding in juvenile penal institutions</title>
<p>In a country with a child/youth population in excess of 75 million – many of whom contend daily with adverse socio-economic circumstances– operationalizing juvenile/youth justice management presents myriad challenges. The most striking problems relate to overcrowding in the borstal homes. Despite the claim in a report by the Comptroller General of Nigeria Prison Services that the ‘facilities at the (borstal) institutions have been upgraded’, official reports also show, for example, that the Kaduna Borstal home with an operating capacity of 120, actually held ‘454 inmates as at mid-year’ in 2011 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1365480212474731">Ogundipe, 2011</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-1365480212474731">
<title>Child incarceration in adult prisons</title>
<p>An even more problematic implication of the under-developed nature of diversion programmes in Nigeria is the unlawful routing of children and young people into adult prisons. Faced with the ‘double jeopardy’ of overcrowded juvenile penal institutions and under-developed diversion programmes, significant numbers of children and young people are being detained in adult prisons in Nigeria. Though accurate data is difficult to obtain and is notoriously shrouded in secrecy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1365480212474731">Sloth-Nielsen, 2008</xref>), the information that is available suggests that the number of children and young people languishing in adult prisons in Nigeria is high. It is known, for example, that police officers in Nigeria routinely falsify the age of young prisoners to pass them off as adults in order to conceal the lack of adequate facilities for juveniles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1365480212474731">Alemika and Chukwuma, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1365480212474731">Constitutional Rights Project, 2003</xref>). Furthermore, the African Committee of Experts on the Rights and Welfare of the Child has estimated that the number of children in adult prisons in Nigeria approximated 6000 in 2007 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-1365480212474731">Unicef/Nigeria, 2007</xref>). Similarly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1365480212474731">Amnesty International (2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1365480212474731">2008</xref>) has revealed that up to 30 children aged 12 years were held together with adult prisoners in one prison in Abuja, a practice that is likely to be replicated in many of the 232 prisons in Nigeria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1365480212474731">Nigerian Prison Service, 2010</xref>). It is not surprising, therefore, that the issue of children in adult prisons was one of the key concerns highlighted in the most recent report submitted by Nigeria to the United Nations Committee on the Rights of the Child (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-1365480212474731">UN/CRC, 2010</xref>: 9).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-1365480212474731">
<title>Inappropriate ‘placements’ and gender-blind ‘justice’</title>
<p>The problems created by inadequate resources and services for juvenile/youth justice management in Nigeria go beyond overcrowding in juvenile penal institutions and the detention of children in adult prisons. For a country with a landmass of approximately one million square kilometres, having only three institutions for juvenile offenders located within two of six national geo-political zones is bound to create further problems. As stated, such problems are compounded by the under-developed nature of diversion programmes and a juvenile/youth justice apparatus that ultimately hinges on incarceration. Fundamentally, this means that a child committed to a borstal home will have to be transported over great distance in view of the skewed geographical distribution of the three borstal homes. One consequence of this is that many young offenders are ‘temporarily’ held in state government run remand homes and, in some cases, spend their entire three-year <italic>borstal</italic> sentences in such <italic>remand</italic> homes. This situation is clearly problematic. Remand homes are meant to provide a place of refuge for child-victims of abuse and neglect. Most residents of remand homes in Nigeria are younger (as young as six years of age) than the children detained in borstal homes and are mainly admitted for care and protection rather than criminal transgressions. Keeping older ‘offenders’ with such children, and detaining ‘offenders’ and ‘non-offenders’ together in the same facility, fails to appropriately meet the interests and/or needs of either group.</p>
<p>A further problem with juvenile/youth justice management in Nigeria relates to the gender-blind nature of provision. The three juvenile borstal homes admit males only and the number and mode of management of girl offenders in Nigeria is not at all clear. Notwithstanding this, it seems like the same patterns of inappropriate institutional ‘placements’ that apply to boys, also pertain to girls. In a survey of 474 juvenile offenders who were inappropriately placed in remand homes for vulnerable children in Lagos, for example, 60 (13%) were girls (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1365480212474731">Okunsanya, 2004</xref>). There are also anecdotal reports of teenage girls being sent to adult women’s prisons for minor offences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1365480212474731">Akinkuotu, 2012</xref>)</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-1365480212474731">
<title>Penal severity</title>
<p>Studies have shown that the majority of inmates classified in juvenile/youth justice institutions in Nigeria have either committed status/minor offences or have not been convicted of any offence at all. For instance, a study among young ‘offenders’ in Abeokuta Borstal home revealed that being deemed ‘beyond parental control’ and/or being involved in non-violent theft constituted 90 per cent of the ‘offences’ committed by the child prisoners (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1365480212474731">Atilola, 2012a</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1365480212474731">Ajiboye et al. (2009)</xref> found similar patterns in a borstal home in Ilorin. Furthermore, in a survey of two state-run remand homes for vulnerable children in Lagos, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1365480212474731">Okunsanya (2004)</xref> found that theft without causing physical harm constituted 70 per cent of the offences committed by the children detained in the institution. About 15 per cent of children in the same study were admitted as status offenders after a police-raid of the streets. In the context of international human rights standards, Article 37(b) of the Convention of the Rights of the Child (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-1365480212474731">UN, 1989</xref>) provides that state parties shall ensure that deprivation of liberty shall be ‘used only as a measure of last resort’, while Article 40 states that institutionalization of young offenders should be the exception and not the norm. Such practices clearly violate these standards.</p>
<p>Several studies have also shown that social and familial problems contribute significantly to children coming into conflict with the law in Nigeria as elsewhere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1365480212474731">Ajiboye et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1365480212474731">Atilola, 2012b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1365480212474731">Bella et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1365480212474731">Ogunlesi, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1365480212474731">Oloruntimehin, 1970</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-1365480212474731">Unicef, 2006</xref>). Furthermore, the majority (as high as 93%) of juvenile offenders in Nigeria are first-time offenders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1365480212474731">Nwanna and Akpan, 2003</xref>) and many have not been tried and/or found guilty prior to their incarceration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1365480212474731">Gallinetti, 2003</xref>). The penal detention of young first-time offenders and/or children who have been charged but not tried/convicted in criminal proceedings – whose lives are fraught with multiple social and familial problems– is not consistent with human rights principles. This is especially so in the majority of cases where the offence is minor and/or when no primafacie case has been established against such children and young people. Article 17(3) of the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1365480212474731">Organization of African Unity’s (2000)</xref> <italic>Charter on the Rights and Welfare of the Child</italic> emphasizes that reform and social and familial reintegration should be the philosophical underpinnings of juvenile justice. In this sense a departure from penal severity and the development of diversion programmes are the surest ways to secure the observance of African and international human rights treaties and standards. It follows, therefore, that diversion has been extensively referenced in different contexts –including sub-Saharan Africa– as one of the most effective means responding to minor and status offenders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1365480212474731">Alberola and Molina, 2003</xref>; Archburckle and Jones, 2006; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1365480212474731">Correctional Services of Canada, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1365480212474731">Crowell, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1365480212474731">Goldson, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1365480212474731">Holden and Kapler, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1365480212474731">Muntingh and Shapiro, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1365480212474731">Scotts 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-1365480212474731">Unicef, 2006</xref>).</p>

<title>Charting a Way Forward: Developing Policy, Practice and Diversion Programmes in Sub-Saharan Africa</title>
<p>Several countries in sub-Saharan Africa are either in the middle of, or have concluded, sweeping changes in their youth/juvenile justice systems. A common feature of these reforms is the strengthening of diversion programmes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1365480212474731">Mbambo, 2005</xref>). This provides an opportunity for Nigeria to engage with the wider developmental context and to draw on, and apply, the lessons learnt from such initiatives. Many countries in sub-Saharan Africa share similar histories, socio-economic situations, cultures and traditions and, where appropriate, this might serve to ease the processes of best policy and practice transfer.</p>
<p>The key to effective juvenile/youth justice management is the establishment of a coherent corpus of law for juvenile justice administration within which diversion forms a central focus. In Uganda, for example, juvenile justice reform was anchored on the passage of the Child Statute whereby diversion programmes became the preferred mode of disposal in juvenile cases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1365480212474731">Kakama, 1999</xref>). This served as a springboard for a proliferation of family courts, the recruitment and training of specialist probation officers and the establishment of a legal-aid council for children and young people in trouble (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1365480212474731">Kakama, 1999</xref>). A similar sequence of events applied in respect of the Child Act of Malawi (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1365480212474731">Penal Reform International, 2000</xref>) as well as the Child Justice Act of South Africa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1365480212474731">Mbambo, 2005</xref>) and the Juvenile Justice Act in Namibia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1365480212474731">Kamwanyah and Mukonda, 2000</xref>).</p>
<p>Before the increased involvement of state governments, diversion programmes in many part of sub-Saharan Africa were driven by NGOs and CBOs. A good example of this arrangement is the National Institute for Crime Prevention and the Rehabilitation of Offenders (NICRO) which solely anchored diversion programmes for children and young people in trouble in South Africa until the late 1990s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1365480212474731">Mbambo, 2005</xref>). Another example is the Rural Youth and Children in Need (RYOCHIN) which continues to deliver diversion programmes for juvenile offenders in Zambia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1365480212474731">Musenge, 2010</xref>). Being the primary duty-bearer for efficient juvenile/youth justice management, however, it is imperative for state governments to engage directly with the delivery of diversion programmes. This said, rather than ‘hijacking’ established diversion programmes from NGOs and CBOs, active collaboration with such agencies– that often have substantial experience in the field – can better guarantee the success of such programmes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1365480212474731">Siegel and Senna, 1991</xref>). A good illustration of the need to exercise caution with transitionary arrangements is to be found in South Africa where diversion programmes were exclusively provided by NICRO for many years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1365480212474731">Mbambo, 2005</xref>) before the government completely took over the scheme in the early 2000s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1365480212474731">Sloth-Nielsen, 2003</xref>) which led to the near-collapse of a programme that had previously operated effectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1365480212474731">Muntingh, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>Involving the community in diversion programmes can also yield benefits. Uganda’s Village Resistance Committee Courts – that are run by trained community elders–provide a good example of this. This arrangement serves to create a familiar environment for the child being ‘tried’ whilst also providing the community with some measure of responsibility for ‘their own child’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1365480212474731">Andersson and Stavrou, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>In addition to coherent legislation, collaborative state government and NGO/CBO arrangements for the provision of diversion programmes and, where appropriate, community involvement; state governments are increasingly identifying the importance of establishing dedicated juvenile/youth justice systems that operate quite separately from ‘mainstream’ adult criminal justice processes. Here a good example is the Inter-Ministerial Committee on Young People at Risk (IMC-YPR) in South Africa that co-ordinates a discrete juvenile/youth justice system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1365480212474731">Shaw and Tschiwula, 2002</xref>). Probation and diversion services in Kenya represent another good example where they have been raised to the level of an independent, but collaborative, department in the Home Services division of the country’s administration.</p>
<p>Such promising illustrations are instructive even if the focus of this article is not primarily concerned with evaluating the merits or otherwise of specific diversion programmes. A key argument being advanced here, however, is that each jurisdiction should tailor diversion programmes in ways that meet the particular needs of children and young people at the local, national and/or regional level.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-1365480212474731">
<title>Recommendations for Developing Policy, Practice and Diversion Programmes in Nigeria</title>
<p>Perhaps the key impediment to the development of successful diversion programmes in Nigeria is the incoherence intrinsic to the legal framework (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-1365480212474731">Unicef, 2006</xref>). The corpus of Nigerian law for the management of juvenile/youth justice continues to privilege penal detention over diversion and there are no explicit provisions and guidelines for the diversion of children and young people from the formal justice system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1365480212474731">Alemika and Chukwuma, 2001</xref>). Furthermore, Nigeria operates a peculiar hybrid legal system through a complex amalgam of the English-law based Criminal Code, the Islamic-law based Penal Code and the culture-driven Customary Law (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1365480212474731">Ebbe, 1997</xref>). Each of these legal frameworks is dominant in different regions of the country and at different levels of the judicial hierarchies. Although efforts have been made to streamline these ‘strands’ or ‘pathways’ into a coherent, inclusive and uniform legal system, the management and administration of criminal justice in Nigeria remains both complex and unwieldy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-1365480212474731">Uwais, 2000</xref>).</p>
<p>Each of the three criminal justice strands/pathways in Nigeria has its own provisions for juvenile/youth justice management with different inclinations and approaches towards diversion. While the CYPA (section 14) – which operates under the Criminal Code– provides for some degree of community based diversion, the Islamic-law based Penal Code facilitates public whipping as a form of ‘diversion’ from prisons. The conflicting milieu created by the lack of a coherent and uniform legal framework has been cited as a de-motivating factor among judicial officers in Nigeria who may otherwise be willing to issue diversion orders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-1365480212474731">Unicef, 2006</xref>). Drawing on the lessons from other sub-Saharan African countries, Nigeria needs to urgently begin a process of streamlining and overhauling the extant laws on juvenile/youth justice management into a coherent single framework; make diversion programmes the thrust of reform and expunge provisions, policies and practices that are at odds with the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child and other international human rights standards (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1365480212474731">Goldson and Muncie, 2012</xref>).</p>
<p>With specific regard to diversion, rather than attempting to implement any ambitious parallel programme or ‘hijacking’ the existing diversion programmes provided NGOs and CBOs, the state government should collaborate and work in tandem with such agencies. In doing this, the Nigerian Government may do well to create a discrete and adequately resourced Department that will be charged with responsibility for co-ordinating diversion programmes. The Government might also note that the most effective diversion is often multi-disciplinary and inter-sectoral in nature. The proposed Department, therefore, should draw its membership from various key stakeholders in the field of juvenile/youth justice management including, but not necessarily limited to: the social welfare department; the prisons department; the judiciary; the police; child health services and academic institutions. The Department might also be encouraged to form strong partnerships with professional groups and service providers allied to child and youth care including child and adolescent psychiatrists, psychologists, special-education experts and faith groups. One of the very first tasks of the new Department should be to identify the current challenges that the NGOs and CBOs involved in diversion programmes face and to provide support in assisting them to meet/overcome such challenges. This should be followed by a gradual but progressive process of recruiting and training specialist juvenile/youth justice probation officers, involving the existing NGOs and CBOs, so as to facilitate effective working relationships from the outset.</p>
<p>A further core task for the new Department should be to get the court systems into ‘diversion mode’. There is evidence that judges in Nigeria, including judges presiding over juvenile courts, have limited knowledge of the workings of diversion programmes and that they are often reluctant to embrace diversion as an option for children and young people in trouble (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-1365480212474731">Unicef, 2006</xref>). There is a need for intensive training of judicial officers on diversion programmes using a revised juvenile justice law as a point of contact. Vigorous efforts should be made to further develop diversion programmes in Nigeria within the next five years. All services should not only have specific provision for girls but should be constructed in a gender-sensitive manner from the outset. This may need to involve further training of officials by on-site learning-visits to African countries such as Kenya, Namibia, Uganda and South Africa, in addition to other international jurisdictions that have pioneered effective diversionary strategies.</p>
<p>Even if Nigeria engages a paradigm shift towards diversion and de-institutionalization it is unlikely – at least in the short term – to diminish the fact that the current number of borstal homes (or juvenile prisons) is inadequate in terms of number, spread and gender equality. In a holistic reform of juvenile/youth justice management in Nigeria, attention should be given to developing additional appropriate institutions that are strategically located – taking into account the country’s six geo-political zones – and that provide suitable services for girls. Such facilities should be reserved for the most serious offenders only. In this sense, a key function of the proposed new Department should comprise juvenile crime prevention including conducting research and implementing its findings in different regions of the country. Ultimately, to stem juvenile crime in Nigeria the Government should invest in welfare programmes for children and young people to offset, or at least to mediate, the adverse social conditions in which so many of them live. Family support programmes should be instituted, wealth must be re-distributed through social-protection schemes and wanton corruption should be systematically addressed.</p>
<p>This article does not, and cannot, represent a ‘fix’ for juvenile/youth justice management in Nigeria but it might serve to stimulate steady progress, invoke further debate and encourage additional research.</p>
