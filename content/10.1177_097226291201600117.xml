<p>I remember having written a paper on ‘Marriage and Live-in Relationships Insurance: A Business Idea’ in the year 2007. I sent the paper to a few journals and conferences. The paper was rejected outright. However, interestingly, one of the referees was kind enough to send me a note stating that although my idea was a novel one, nonetheless, my paper only contained statements and was bereft of empirical research. The difficulty which I was facing was that I had no idea of how to translate my idea into a mathematical or economic model, how to apply <italic>t-</italic>test, <italic>F-</italic>test, chi-square test, Z-test, etc. In 2010, when I got a chance to read the book under review, I felt that had I read the book earlier, then, my research could have been more meaningful and perhaps my paper would not have been rejected outright. This is a gem of a book which is easy to read and entertaining yet rigorous and comprehensive in its approach, covering economic theory, mathematical economics, economic statistics and mathematical statistics. It is my personal conviction that for gaining a sound understanding of research methodology, a student should get examples and exercises which explain the intricacies of concept specification, theory building, setting null hypothesis, alternate hypothesis, sampling, designing questionnaire, collecting data, building econometric models, subjecting the data to different tests and arriving at meaningful inferences. The book under review is just the ideal book for any student or researcher who subscribes to the aforementioned ideology. A reading of the book will activate the grey cells and enable the reader to find comfort in conducting research. The beauty of this superlative tome lies in the fact that this book can be very helpful to students who want to understand and conduct research, to all management teachers because it has enlightening illustrations from several disciplines of management and management practitioners because it provides a gamut of examples from multiple industries.</p>
<p>The book is divided into four parts. The first part consisting of eight neat chapters is devoted to the fundamentals of research. The second part comprising four chapters is devoted to the fundamentals of mathematics and statistics. The third part consists of three chapters and is devoted to the basic concepts of multivariate analysis and econometrics. The fourth part contains 38 exhilarating case studies drawn from varied areas such as marketing management, human resource management, finance and banking management, production and operations management, information technology and the pure social sciences. The book is an elegant inquiry into the research methodology; it gets to the basics from the start and guides the reader to a sound level by the end. The author has been able to strike a fine balance between concepts, statistics, econometrics and practice.</p>
<p>The first chapter is devoted to the basic concepts involved in research, the steps in decision-making and thus helps build a sound orientation towards research. The chapter has live examples of ethnographic market research and explores the categories and scope of social science research institutions in India. The second chapter provides an in depth study of formulation of research problems and the steps involved in research. The chapter also explores the differences between bibliographies and Citation Index. The third chapter delves into the major research design decisions and the confounding process of hypothesis formulation. A careful reading of the third chapter will enable the reader in understanding the steps in hypothesis testing, the three approaches of hypothesis testing, size and statistical power of a test, significance level, confidence level, type–1 and type–2 errors. The fourth chapter is devoted to sampling methods and techniques. The chapter explains the laws of sampling and the methods of determining the appropriate sample size. Obviously data plays a very important role in research. The fifth chapter is dedicated to the characteristics of data, the types of data and measurement of data using different scales. Through practical examples the author has vividly brought out which type of scale can be most appropriate for which type of data. The sixth chapter explains several methods of collecting primary data. The chapter provides useful hints which can be very helpful in the construction of a questionnaire, conducting a survey and performing field experiments. The chapter minutely explores the differences between the different data collecting techniques. The seventh chapter is exclusively devoted to the coding, tabulation and presentation of data. The eighth chapter is devoted to the presentation of research findings. The chapter presents a microscopic view of the widely used IMR &amp; D (Introduction, Methodology, Result analysis, Discussion and recommendation) format. The chapter also does justice to oral and poster presentations.</p>
<p>The ninth chapter examines the utility of statistical topics such as arithmetic mean, weighted arithmetic mean, median, mode, geometric mean, harmonic mean, through real life examples. The tenth chapter presents the methods of measuring dispersion in such a lucid way that even a student with little knowledge of mathematics will find the topics highly engrossing. The eleventh chapter is devoted to matrix algebra. The highlights of the chapter are the application of matrix notation in case of regression analysis and least squares. The twelfth chapter explains the usage of the binomial probability distribution, the poisson probability distribution and the normal probability distribution. The thirteenth chapter is especially important because it examines the role of factor analysis, discriminant analysis, cluster analysis, dimensional analysis, meta analysis and conjoint analysis in decision making. The author has assiduously explained the steps in executing the different aforementioned analysis alongwith the application areas, merits and demerits of each method. The fourteenth chapter is devoted to the real time usage of correlation and regression. The fifteenth chapter examines data analysis using Microsoft Excel.</p>
<p>The author has provided eye-opening case studies drawn from organizations such as Narottam Paper Limited, IFB, Whirlpool, City Scan, Tata Tea, Idea Cellular Limited, Tashee Group, etc., and areas as diverse as the Marshallian Utility Theory, Theories of International Trade, Indian Textile Industry, Indian Paper Industry, Investment and Economic growth in Asian countries. The book contains comprehensive questionnaires/schedules for conducting surveys related to household durables, consumer expenditure, etc. The author has also provided a list of possible research areas (almost 63) in each broad category of Management such as Marketing, Finance, Production, Information Technology, Personnel and Rural. The sample questionnaires and suggested areas of research are a boon for anyone who finds selecting a research topic perplexing and intimidating. The questions given at the end of each chapter help the reader evaluate himself/herself at every stage.</p>
<p>The book is informative, inspirational, illustrative, educative, enjoyable and thought-provoking. Each chapter offers new insights into the application of research methodology to management situations. The author has pain-stakingly provided a comprehensive list of various important government ministries as well as international agencies and their publications. A novice who reads the book thoroughly will definitely be in a position to identify research topic(s) and conduct meaningful research independently and successfully.</p>
