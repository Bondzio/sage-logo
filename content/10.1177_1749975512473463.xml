<abstract>
<p>Programmatic ideas regarding cultural sociology and its inter-relationship with cultural production inspired by the work of Inglis et al., Mukerji and Bennett are explored. A particular cultural assemblage, the editorial practices arising in an interdisciplinary project concerned with researching and publishing the letters of South African feminist writer and social theorist Olive Schreiner, is detailed. Four key aspects of the particular ‘bringing-into-being’ which these working practices involve are interrogated, regarding the ‘moment of writing’, archive stories, the ‘editorial moment’ and the involvement of the later reader, with these examined in depth in relation to examples of Schreiner’s letters.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>… cultural sociology <italic>itself</italic> operates as a series of modes of bringing-into-being forms of ‘culture’ and the ‘cultural’ that did not already exist … the cultural sociologist must be highly reflexively vigilant as to the often subterranean assumptions and interests which may underpin her practice. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1749975512473463">Inglis et al., 2007</xref>: 16)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Cultural sociology has greatest import not as the development of a particular area called culture but as a means of focusing reflexive analytical attention on ‘the making of the cultural’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1749975512473463">Inglis et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1749975512473463">Bennett, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1749975512473463">Mukerji, 2007</xref>; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1749975512473463">Hall et al., 2010</xref>). Cultural practices involve their own often implicit knowledge-claims, with cultural production encompassing what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1749975512473463">Mukerji (2007</xref>: 50) calls the ‘time-making activities’ through which cultural forms eventuate. Consequently, seeing these in terms of cultural genealogy, around the production of epistemic knowledge both within society and within cultural sociology, raises the important elements of process, time and historicity for cultural sociology, and underlines that historical and cultural sociologies have closely-related concerns. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1749975512473463">Bennett’s (2007</xref>: 33) ideas about ‘the work of making it’, the material practices that eventuate cultural production, and ‘the work it does’, organized by cultural knowledges and competencies, usefully emphasize that both are constituents of cultural assemblage. We also take seriously his insistence that merging the cultural and the social should be resisted, and so discuss the work that has gone into making a particular cultural assemblage, as part of our wider concern with exploring key features of a programmatic basis for conceptualizing cultural sociology, taking off from the work of Inglis et al., Mukerji and Bennett.</p>
<p>The particular ‘cultural assemblage’ around which these ideas are explored consists of the c.4800 extant letters of South African feminist writer and social theorist Olive Schreiner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1749975512473463">Stanley, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1749975512473463">Burdett, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1749975512473463">McClintock, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1749975512473463">Berkman, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1749975512473463">First and Scott, 1980</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1749975512473463">1</xref></sup> This acts as a case study for pinning down what ‘cultural assemblage’ looks like and demonstrating the usefulness of the reflexive engagement with the practices of cultural sociology recommended by Inglis et al. ‘The work of making it’ involves the editorial practices we have engaged in as an interdisciplinary team concerned with researching as well as publishing what originated as thousands of manuscript letters in world-wide archives; the ‘cultural assemblage’ produced by this is the <italic>Olive Schreiner Letters Online</italic> (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.oliveschreiner.org">www.oliveschreiner.org</ext-link>), while ‘the work it does’ is composed by the re-readings of these letters by later readers post-publication as impacted by editorial anticipations of such activities.</p>
<p>Olive Schreiner (1855–1920) was a major critic of imperialism and colonialism and an active cultural entrepreneur (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1749975512473463">Stanley, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1749975512473463">Stanley et al. 2010</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1749975512473463">2013a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1749975512473463">2013b</xref>). She and other members of her epistolary networks were active in a socio-political landscape which was in part the imperial metropolis of London, in part one of its colonial peripheries, southern Africa at a time of massive imperial interventionism and rapid change for all its peoples. Their interventions occurred largely under the sign of cultural politics, with the political activities engaged in by Schreiner combining face-to-face meetings with a high volume of letter-writing and related cultural work, with her letters frequently political interventions in their own right rather than simply recording or reflecting on such (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1749975512473463">Stanley et al., 2013b</xref>). Network members included Eleanor Marx, Havelock Ellis, Edward Carpenter, Alf Mattison, Bob Muirhead, Isabella Ford, Mary Sauer, Schreiner’s sister Ettie Stakesby-Lewis, Betty Molteno and Alice Greene, Harriet Colenso, Caroline Murray, Lucy Molteno, Mimmie Murray, Ruth Alexander; and, as public figures whose views she sought to change, W.T. Stead, her brother Will Schreiner, Cecil Rhodes, John Lloyd, John Cross, Alfred Milner, John X. Merriman, Julia Solly, F.S. Malan, and Jan Smuts.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1749975512473463">2</xref></sup></p>

<title>Bringing-Into-Being a Cultural Assemblage: The Schreiner Letters</title>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1749975512473463">Inglis et al.’s (2007)</xref> comments about reflexivity and modes of ‘bringing-into-being’ the cultural, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1749975512473463">Bennett’s (2007)</xref> attention to ‘the work of making it’, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1749975512473463">Mukerji’s (2007)</xref> ideas about cultural genealogy have provided impetus for teasing out key working practices in producing Olive Schreiner’s letters for publication (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.oliveschreiner.org/">http://www.oliveschreiner.org/</ext-link>) and generating related research outputs (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.oliveschreinerletters.ed.ac.uk/TeamPublications.html">http://www.oliveschreinerletters.ed.ac.uk/TeamPublications.html</ext-link>). Some important questions and issues have arisen concerning not <italic>subterranean</italic> assumptions as Inglis et al. propose, but structural factors connected with the material practices involved impacting on the interpretational dynamics of the editorial/research team. This has led to sometimes different readings of Schreiner’s epistolary and wider cultural activities, surfacing around particular letters (although by no means confined to these), with responding to such differences an important component of ‘the work of making it’ regarding the <italic>Olive Schreiner Letters Online</italic>. In addition, further interpretational complexities now exist following publication of the letters, with various of these editorial practices orienting to, structuring and responding to the activities of ‘later readers’ and their re-readings of the letters.</p>
<p>In fact, interpretational issues have underpinned the entire project regarding what is seen to compose ‘the Schreiner letters’, for how the ontology of this is conceived has considerable epistemic effect. What ‘the letters’ consist of can be thought about in (at least) four ways: (i) as what now remains, the extant letters; (ii) as all the epistolary activity someone ever engaged in, including all their now missing or destroyed letters; (iii) as all this person’s letter-writing and also that of all their correspondents too; and also (iv) as the ‘ur-letters’ editorially produced as ‘the selected letters of A’ or ‘the correspondence of A and Z’. The concept of an ‘epistolarium’ provides a shorthand way of recognizing issues concerning the overall shape and structure of someone’s letter-writing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1749975512473463">Stanley, 2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1749975512473463">2011</xref>). All four are the letters of, for instance, Thomas Carlyle (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://carlyleletters.dukejournals.org/">http://carlyleletters.dukejournals.org/</ext-link>), Max Weber (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.maxweberstudies.org/WLD.aspx">http://www.maxweberstudies.org/WLD.aspx</ext-link>) or Charles Darwin (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.darwinproject.ac.uk/">http://www.darwinproject.ac.uk/</ext-link>), but ontologically these encompass different kinds of epistolary ‘things’, have a complicated interrelationship, with different configurations of epistolary space/time marking content.</p>
<p>Typically, editors of letters work with the first (extant letters), and they publish edited versions of these in the fourth (a published selection), although frequently ignoring the selectivity involved and that this is actually not all the letters written by someone (second in the list). Also the shift from manuscript letters to published print or digital versions involves a translation and transformation into a different representational form, involving considerable editorial work often accompanied by selections, omissions and ‘tidyings’. Also letters now missing through routine attrition and/or dramatic destructions are a literally unknown quantity although impacting on what remains, because their non-existence powerfully though invisibly structures the extant letters. In addition, working with full correspondences (third in the list) demonstrates the reciprocity at the heart of letter-writing and its interconnected rhythms of reading and replying, although we know of no letters project which strives to be ‘total’ in this way.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-1749975512473463">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>We now discuss important aspects of cultural assemblage in a case study of Olive Schreiner’s letters, beginning by examining broadly four key editorial practices involved. This is followed later in the paper by interrogating these ideas about bringing-into-being, the ‘work of making it’, by examining genealogical aspects of the material practices involved concerning two particular letters.</p>
<sec id="section3-1749975512473463">
<title>The Three ‘Moments’ of Epistolarity</title>
<p>The term ‘moments’ is used in Lefebvre’s sense of structured modalities or fields of action arising in a context and having a boundaried time/space character (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1749975512473463">Lefebvre, 2002 [1961]</xref>: 340–58), and references broad events linked in social perception, such as ‘the Enlightenment’ or ‘the scramble for Africa’. A letter is a product of its first ‘moment of <italic>writing</italic>’, which can encompass a number of inscribed times as well as additions and emendations, rather than necessarily being completed in one seamless activity. For instance, Schreiner’s final letter to South African politician Jan Smuts has two October 1920 dates, was started and left unfinished, then completed a week later with additions criticizing Smuts’ role in violently ending a strike by black workers (19 and 28 October 1920, Smuts A1/207/185). Also, letters can refer to multiple times and places represented in the ‘scene of what is written about’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1749975512473463">Stanley and Dampier, 2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1749975512473463">2010</xref>), with the moment of letter-writing prototypically a compendium of places and times. For example, Schreiner’s letter to Mohandas Gandhi of 15 August 1914 (Hermann Kallenbach, MSC 26/2.3.2) invokes the immediacy of ‘here’ where it was written, ‘anywhere’ they might meet, and the mediation of the steamship company Gandhi had sailed to Britain with, in providing her with his new address.</p>
<p>Letter-reading too has temporal complexities, marked by partial readings, interrupted readings, third-party readings not intended by the writer, and re-readings. The spatial and temporal configurations of this second ‘moment of <italic>reading</italic>’ overlay each other, for readers/readings of letters can move from place to place (from kitchen, to garden …), as well as over time (when received, later re-readings …), including by letters being ‘enclosed’ with new letters written by their addressee-reader and sent to third parties. In addition, the third ‘moment of <italic>sending</italic>’ also involves a matrix of places and times. Now, these are marked by recent changes in mass communications technologies and global computer hardware and software industries. However, there were similarly consequential changes over Schreiner’s life-time, from relying on passing travellers to carry letters to speedy international postal systems; from using charcoal-ink, to fountain-pens and typewriters; from months between sending and receiving a letter, to weekly arrivals of international mail ships and (at least) daily postal deliveries.</p>

<title>Archival Stories</title>
<p>Yet for many researchers the complexities of these ‘moments’ of writing, sending and reading letters are incidental to their analytical concerns. Instead it is <italic>archive stories</italic> that researchers usually tell, regarding the survival or attrition of sources, provenance of extant documents, and professional practices used in different archives, with these all significantly affecting the what, where and how of research and therefore the knowledge that results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1749975512473463">Burton, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1749975512473463">Stoler, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1749975512473463"><italic>History of the Human Sciences</italic>, 1998–9</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1749975512473463">Hamilton et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1749975512473463">Thomas, 1993</xref>). And once the door of an archive is opened, there is what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1749975512473463">Steedman (2001</xref>: 18) has called ‘the great, brown, slow-moving strandless river of Everything, and then there is its tiny flotsam that has ended up in the record office you are working in’.</p>
<p>What is extant, ‘collected’ and available in archives is not the Abolition of Slavery or the Russian Revolution, but rather the chance materials ending there, which a researcher perforce works on, searches for related items, then assembles into new configurations. The writing of history inscribes present-time conceptual and analytical processes by engaging with historical flotsam, not ‘what happened’ in any immediate sense. Archival research is consequently a cultural assemblage and ‘mode of bringing-into-being’ <italic>par excellence</italic>, with the interpretations of researchers coming to be seen as ‘the history’ and gaining canonical status and force (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1749975512473463">de Certeau, 1988 [1975]</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1749975512473463">Trouillet, 1995</xref>). The flotsam of Schreiner’s letters enables many aspects of ‘the history’ of the times they were written in to be questioned. Two examples are: Schreiner orchestrated much behind-the-scenes opposition to Rhodes both before and after her public attack on his imperialist policies in <italic>Trooper Peter Halket of Mashonaland</italic> (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/1431">http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/1431</ext-link> and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.oliveschreiner.org/vre?page=capitalismandimperialism">http://www.oliveschreiner.org/vre?page=capitalismandimperialism</ext-link>); and it was she who actually produced the speech ‘by’ Emily Hobhouse in unveiling the Vrouemonument commemorating the women and children who died in the concentration camps of the South African War (OS to Will Schreiner, November 1913, BC16/Box5/Fold2/1913/47).</p>
<p>There are also archive stories about the lack of what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1749975512473463">Stoler (2009</xref>: 8–10) terms transparency, by which she means not that archives are closed to readers nor that archivists prohibit access to documents, but that the organizing principles and myriad contents of complex collections require significant contextual knowledge to comprehend. For instance, Schreiner’s letters are archivally organized around sequential ordering, including as listed in collection inventories or finding aids. It might be supposed that the reference number assigned to a letter for retrieval purposes will make little difference – a letter is a letter. But while what de Certeau (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1749975512473463">1988</xref>: 56–113) terms ‘the historiographical operation’ (the grounded working practices produced by such structural factors) is tightly framed by sequence, an example shows this can be both misleading and epistemologically consequential.</p>
<p>Schreiner’s letters in the Humanities Research Center, Texas, are located under the names of her addressees, including Havelock Ellis, Frank Harris, Oscar Wilde and others, and assigned numbered references for every sheet and envelope in strict order. However, although this reflects ordering as discerned when first archived, a sequence does not necessarily represent ‘a letter’: its parts may have been separated and appear in different locations or even different collections, or unrelated sheets of paper mistakenly put together as though ‘a letter’. Consequently, an apparently certain ordering and sequence can mislead, unless researchers already have the contextual knowledge they hope their research will provide them with – the Catch 22 situation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1749975512473463">Stoler (2009)</xref> remarks on. Sequence and number also presume equivalence, that the interval between 3 and 4 is the same as that between, say, 72 and 73. An example will show the misconception involved here.</p>
<p>This concerns the National Library of South Africa (NLSA) Schreiner collection, composed by sub-collections of letters to different addressees, with each letter-set uniquely numbered in the assumed chronological order of contents. There are, for instance, 133 letters to Mary Sauer, Schreiner’s close friend of the 1890s, with these letters tapering off then ending in the 1900s for unknown reasons. As with other NLSA Schreiner sub-collections, the Sauer letters have a clear sequential numerical order, from MSC 26/2.11.1 to MSC 26/2/11/133. This implies - indeed to put it more strongly, imposes - presumed equivalence to these 133 items. However, contextual knowledge regarding the apparently equivalent moves from 26/2.11.88, to 26/2.11.89, to 26/2.11.90, shows that the calm abstraction of sequence – 88, 89, 90 – can elide profoundly non-equivalent realities. In the first letter (1 April 1895, Mary Sauer MSC 26/2.11.88), Schreiner is ‘creeping along’, waiting for her baby to be born; in the second (17 April 1985, Mary Sauer MSC 26/2.11.89) she is planning for life changes after the birth; in the third (10 May 1895, Mary Sauer MSC 26/2.11.90), in shaking writing she explains that after a terrible labour her baby daughter had died the next morning. Archival numbering presumes equivalence and encourages thinking in terms of parallel documents, that the move from 89 to 90 is the same as from 88 to 89. However, the human events that letters deal with relate to their contents and specific circumstances of writing; and archival sequential order exerts epistemic force of a sometimes violently disjunctural kind.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1749975512473463">
<title>The Editorial ‘Moment’</title>
<p>The material practices composing editorship are a fourth ‘moment’ in addition to those of writing, reading and sending, and this in fact commences with archive stories and making initial sense of the provenance, composition and ordering of collections. Relatedly, ‘the Schreiner letters’, whether in manuscript in world-wide archive locations or as published in the <italic>Olive Schreiner Letters Online</italic>, is actually a fabrication: at no point did Schreiner ever see ‘her letters’, which were written to an array of people, often in different countries, at many different points in time. The collections worked with editorially were never ‘collected’ for Schreiner, because her letters were written to be scattered, with this scattering signifying the continuance over time of particular relationships, and for many this primarily involved face-to-face meetings ‘joined up’ by epistolary exchanges during the in-between (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1749975512473463">Stanley, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1749975512473463">Stanley et al., 2013a</xref>). ‘A collection’, then, is in an ontological sense profoundly antithetical to what letters ‘are’ in their moments of writing, sending and reading, albeit a creation of considerable epistemological import.</p>
<p>Equally consequential is that the practices involved in editing someone’s letters necessitate a temporally and ontologically displaced re-enactment of ‘the moment of (first) reading’ and ‘the moment of (first) writing’. That is, all Schreiner’s letters have to be read in order to transcribe them, which requires them to be read ‘sort of’ as though Oscar Wilde, Mary Sauer, Jan Smuts, Mohandas Gandhi; and then transcribing them requires writing every Schreiner letter ‘sort of’ how she had written it. Obviously ‘sort of’ and the differences are very important. But so too are the intertwined activities of re-reading and re-writing and their complicated effects regarding editorship (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1749975512473463">Stanley, 2011</xref>), attentively focusing on letter-content through this re-reading and re-writing. However, what follows imposes a very different rhythm, with letter-content backgrounded and technical aspects foregrounded. With an e-edition like the <italic>Olive Schreiner Letters Online</italic>, the text is prepared by surrounding it with xml mark-up codes so that layout and formatting are shown correctly in the html online edition, while major print editions too, for example the Thomas Carlyle letters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1749975512473463"><italic>Collected Letters</italic>, 1970–2010</xref>), require equally rigorous standardization in such matters. Attending to such technicalities inevitably deflects attention from what is written, shifting it onto ‘the word’ in a narrower sense. Regarding xml, for instance, a marked-up letter bristles with so much code that sentences can barely be discerned let alone read, although coding errors are highlighted.</p>
<p>Editorial activities produce other epistemologically consequential transformations too, including that letters are re-presented in first one (transcription) and then another (xml/html, or print) representational media, with what results being ur-letters rather than simulacra because prepared in a uniform format and usually also footnoted and their contexts explained, both very unlike the originals. However, it is these ur-versions that later readers read as though ‘the letters of Carlyle, Darwin, Weber’, although they are actually an editorial creation significantly different from their manuscript incarnations. For some commentators, producing an e-edition using jpegs is perceived as avoiding such editorial intervention.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-1749975512473463">4</xref></sup> However, a jpeg is not ‘the letter’ any more than a transcription is, but another two-dimensional form of re-representation, and editors still retain control over what is included and excluded.</p>
<p>Indeed, editors significantly shape ‘the letters’ as a cultural product as part of routine working practices. As well as the things already mentioned, this includes deciding where the limits of someone’s epistolarium lie, and in what form and with what interpretive aids later readers will access the (published, edited) letters, both with important structuring effects. Also apparently very simple letters can be among the most puzzling to deal with in both regards because highly elliptical, as for instance with multiple puzzles concerning one of Schreiner’s business letters about some typing (OS to Miss Battie, Saturday nd, Henry Nourse (Miss Battie) A743/Bf3; see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1749975512473463">Stanley, 2010</xref>). And such interpretational complexities multiply for long-term letter-sets like those to Mary Sauer, for reaching a view about their relationship, why the letters stop, and whether the friendship continued thereafter, requires reading across the total Schreiner letters to garner hints about this.</p>
<p>Editorial shaping also goes further, because we are researchers too and so interpreters of Schreiner’s letters in this additional sense. We elected to work with ‘whole letters’ rather than tagging particular elements (picking out passages on this or that) or constructing variables (by coding, for instance, family, health, writing …), so as to ensure that context and not just specific content is retained. This programmatic research choice has also been followed through into editorial activities and concerns, so that later readers of the published letters are provided with whole letters regardless of how specific their searchers are, requiring them to read each letter to find the specifics they are seeking (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.oliveschreiner.org/vre?page=capitalismandimperialism">http://www.oliveschreiner.org/vre?page=capitalismandimperialism</ext-link>).</p>

<title>The Lateness of the Reader</title>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1749975512473463">Altman (1982)</xref> comments that readers of published editions of letters always ‘come late’. That is, not only have the letter-writer, their addressees, third-party readers and archivists all already been busy in organizing what ‘the letters’ are, so too have editors in producing their media-transformed ur-versions. Re-readings by later readers are also made within very different contexts, because removed from the scene of writing, from the archive, and from the fourth ‘moment’ of editorial activities. Inevitably, these ‘fifth moment’ re-readings of published letters by later readers are made from within their own contexts and (limits of) knowledgeability. Given the breadth of Schreiner’s writings and her cultural and political activities, a very wide distribution of readers and users of the <italic>Olive Schreiner Letters Online</italic> exists, including genealogists, family historians and popular readers, as well as academics in literature, politics, sociology, history, women’s and gender studies. There have been editorial implications.</p>
<p>Recognition that later readers will be many, varied and pursuing their own agendas – which are also likely to be different from each other’s as well as from the editorial one – has been reflexively engaged with throughout editorial work. The inter-relationship between shaping and facilitating, influencing and constraining, the work of making and the work it does, run through this. Thus the <italic>Olive Schreiner Letters Online</italic> has extensive full-text Boolean search facilities, enabling later readers to produce sub-sets or mini-collections of letters around their individually-particular interests. However, the programmatic decision always to work with whole letters noted earlier has not only shaped what results, but also the guides and finding aids provided for later readers. Relatedly, we have rejected providing explanatory footnotes except regarding Schreiner’s writing, to avoid imposing editorial contextual interpretations on the later reader. Recognizing the diversity of re-readings by later readers, we have signaled the importance of holism, context and intertextualities – but also recognized that later readers can - and some do - simply ignore this. It is important, however, that later readers can produce their own re-readings and not have a master one imposed, and so features like the search facilities actively support variant re-readings, and an editorial apparatus is provided and shapes these, but is also optional and non-intrusive.</p>

<title>The ‘Work of Making’ and ‘The Work It Does’</title>
<p>We have sketched out some key material practices involved in producing the cultural assemblage of the Schreiner letters and indicated how this relates to its use by the many later readers of the <italic>Olive Schreiner Letters Online</italic>. We have proposed that ‘the work of making it’ impacts and shapes how cultural products are used, so that ‘the work it does’ through later readers is not simply an ‘after’ but is structured if not determined by what is ‘before’, with a symbiotic relationship existing between these. We now substantiate this by exploring how such things have played out regarding two detailed examples. These show the dynamics of cultural genealogy and the analytical purchase provided by a reflexive engagement with these matters, by demonstrating the inter-relationship of ‘the work of making’ and ‘the work it does’ in our case study of cultural assemblage. These examples are straightforward everyday letters. They are not among Schreiner’s ‘great letters’ stylistically or regarding content, with their prime concern oiling the wheels of well-established relationships. However, they are neither insignificant nor unproblematic in interpretational terms and permit wider issues to be raised with economy.</p>
<sec id="section8-1749975512473463">
<title>To Fan Schreiner, 14 October 1907</title>
<p>The first example is a birthday letter dated 14 October 1907 written to Schreiner’s sister-in-law Fan Schreiner, married to her much loved younger brother, the lawyer-politician Will Schreiner (BC16/Box3/Fold6/1907/27).</p>
<p><italic>Moments of writing, sending, reading</italic>: Schreiner routinely sent birthday letters to family members. In Fan Schreiner’s case, she sometimes forgot the precise date or that she had already sent a birthday letter, so two or three might be dispatched over a period of weeks. In this particular example, the diminutive ‘little’ appears, frequently used fondly of other people and regarding Schreiner herself. As well as requesting information about Fan’s eldest daughter Dot (line 9) and husband Will, ‘our dear boy’ (line 12), it sets the scene of the place if not the exact moment of writing, in Schreiner’s home in De Aar. In doing so, it ‘out-Boers’ Fan, someone of Boer (now Afrikaner) background, with Schreiner living in one room in the old ‘fore-trekker style’ (line 26), roughing it complete with loaded revolver. Both the use of diminutives and the out-Boering are epistolary Schreinerisms, in the latter case contrasting her traditional earthiness with the ordered lives of the educated Afrikaner urban elite. The letter winds down with ‘I’ve given you all our news give me yours’ (line 37), also a typical Schreinerism in encouraging Fan to write more regularly than she usually did.</p>
<p>There is additionally a more nebulous ‘moment’ embedded in this and other letters to Fan concerning Schreiner’s involvement in the family group, with this letter’s comment about ‘our Dot’ part of a wider pattern concerning ‘our’ children. The phrasing implies a closer relationship than just an aunt, but whether this is to be understood as Schreiner inserting herself into the family figuration, or simply as an in-passing expression of her deep love for Will and Fan’s children, has been as an interpretational difference within the editorial team.</p>
<p><italic>Archival stories</italic>: This birthday letter is in a large meta-collection in Manuscripts and Archives, University of Cape Town, composed of a number of originally separate collections amalgamated during the apartheid era. Key addressees of its letters are Will Schreiner and Schreiner’s close friend Betty Molteno, with c.430 and c.450 letters respectively, and with c.270 to Fan Schreiner and c.120 to Molteno’s partner, Alice Greene. However, the question arises whether quantity provides a measure of meaningfulness and strength of relational tie. There have been differences in team perspectives on this. We are agreed on the depth and warmth of the c.430 letters to Will Schreiner and also concerning the sharpness and incisive feminism of her c.30 letters on Women’s Enfranchisement League (WEL) matters to Julia Solly, but there are differences concerning the effects of the c.430 versus the c.30 for the reader. Certainly import cannot be gauged in simple quantity terms, for both sets of letters have considerable importance, albeit for different reasons. However, it is at the same time true that reading c.340 letters is a different kind of experience from reading under a tenth of this number, and where we have been in debate concerns what this ‘different kind of experience’ is and how (and if) to respond to it editorially.</p>
<p><italic>The editorial moment</italic>: Placing this letter in the wider interpretational context of Schreiner’s letter-writing to Fan, Will and their children raises whether Fan Schreiner should be seen as a domestic cipher. One response hedged by provisos is, yes, she was ‘wife and mother’ and operated in a primarily domestic context. However, by the time this letter was written Fan was involved in WEL activities, including as organizer of ‘drawing-room’ meetings (OS to Lucy Molteno, 11 August 1907, BC16/Box3/Fold6/1907/24); and, regarding her two daughters at college in the UK, Schreiner commented that Fan would ‘have to personally conduct all by yourself’ (line 13) visiting them. We all agree that Fan Schreiner travelled more than geographical distance over the years.</p>
<p>But an interpretational division has remained. In late 1889 when Schreiner returned to South Africa from Britain, she was struck by the slow pace of life among white South Africans. She commented that this was a nation of Philistines with no aristocracy of labour, education or property, relatedly characterized by cliques and narrow-mindedness. She linked gossip to this – writing soon after arriving to her friend Havelock Ellis that ‘I began to think how unkind my brother’s wife &amp; her relations had been to me in Cape Town, &amp; how wicked &amp; mean &amp; jealous women are … Fancy a whole nation of <underline>lower</underline> middle class people’ (14 May 1890, HRC/CAT/OS/4b-xiii) – with these issues about cliques and gossip exercising her over many years. The question that has divided us concerns whether and to what extent the later letters from Schreiner to Fan remain marked by this, with Fan’s tardiness in responding indicating a more troubled relationship than the surface words suggest.</p>
<p>A related interpretational difference concerns Schreiner repeatedly attaching herself to the wider family networks of people close to her, involving the Molteno, Greene and Murray families, as well as Will and Fan, and regarding Fan’s Reitz and Silke family connections. Perhaps Schreiner maintained a friendly relationship with Fan as the price of her close friendship with Will, her closer than usual relationship with his four children, and her ingress into the Reitz/Silke networks, while Fan was more hands-off about the friendship. However, an equally plausible stance places more interpretational weight on the later letters to Fan, thinking temporally backwards from Schreiner’s many later inscriptions of affection, in particular regarding letters written around and after the death of Will Schreiner in 1919, such as: ‘In a way you seem nearer to me than any one in the world. That little casket in the quiet grave holds so much for you &amp; me – more than for any one else’ (22 January 1920, BC16/Box7/Fold3/Jan-Feb1920/11, lines 75–77).</p>
<p>Is it one or the other? In fact there are also ‘letters in the middle’, to Fan as well as about her to other people, which also imply a troubled aspect to the relationship. Consequently we have settled at recognizing that Schreiner’s relationship with Fan was initially very prickly, that Schreiner’s desire to be closely involved with her nephews and nieces required her to temper any negative feelings, that the relationship changed over time, that by 1919 they became closer around Will Schreiner’s death, that these letters as a whole and not just the few mentioned here have to be located and interpreted in the wider context of Schreiner’s letter-writing, and that interpretational issues about what can and cannot be known remain.</p>
<p><italic>The lateness of the reader</italic>: This letter is very mundane. In formal historical terms, Fan has importance primarily as Will Schreiner’s wife, Olive Schreiner’s sister-in-law, the sister of Frank Reitz as former President of the Free State and State Secretary of the Transvaal, and as a minor name in the membership lists of the Cape WEL. In searches of the <italic>Olive Schreiner Letters Online</italic> by later readers, Fan Schreiner is most likely to appear as a name mentioned in other letters. Schreiner’s letters to Fan may not come to the attention of later readers, but if they do they are likely to be seen as rather uninteresting – they contain no ‘great letters’ and rarely comment on ideas or public events. However, this letter-set actually raises important interpretational questions, including the extent to which letter-content and intent should be taken at face value, whether to read letters chronologically forwards or around ‘knowing the end’, and how to interpret individual letters in relation to all those written to a particular person and in the wider letter-writing context. Such matters are clearly epistemologically highly consequential, while closure regarding them is hard to achieve, leaving the later reader with an interpretationally fairly open field.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-1749975512473463">
<title>To Hermann Kallenbach, December 1914</title>
<p>The second example is a letter to Hermann Kallenbach, a wealthy South African architect and close friend and supporter of Mohandas Gandhi in the latter’s campaigns regarding Indian rights in South Africa (December 1914, Hermann Kallenbach MSC 26/2.3.13). It is just six lines long.</p>
<p><italic>Moments of writing, sending, reading</italic>: The letter is concerned with two different matters. Schreiner’s ‘more deep sympathy than I can express’ sign-off (line 13) relates to its first paragraph and that the Gandhi family and followers had received permission to leave Britain for India, with the news that Kallenbach had just been refused this having occasioned its writing. The second is ‘Don’t forget when you return the book to let me pay you the 4/- or what ever it was it cost. You ought to have let me pay you for my ticket. When we go again you must’ (lines 9–11). This ‘ought’ and ‘must’ repeats a refrain across Schreiner’s letters to Kallenbach, that he should allow her to pay for herself when organizing purchases or planning visits for them. The scene of writing is very close to what is written about in this letter: its wording conveys that Schreiner wrote and sent it immediately she heard Kallenbach’s news and realized its import, not just for him personally but for Gandhi and his supporters generally. That the interpersonal matter of ‘who pays’ is raised in the same short letter clearly signals its importance for Schreiner.</p>
<p><italic>Archival stories</italic>: There are 36 Schreiner letters to Kallenbach and one to Gandhi archived under Kallenbach’s name in the NLSA sub-collections. Kallenbach’s architectural practice was in Johannesburg, c.1400 kilometres from Cape Town; and while the collection seemingly ‘arrived’ in the early 1950s, nothing else is known about its provenance. Relatedly, many more Kallenbach letters, primarily to Gandhi, were recently sold by descendants, suggesting provenance may have involved purchase rather than donation. There are no clues as to why or when the NLSA Schreiner sub-collections were put together as a meta-collection, but probably during the 1950s or 1960s.</p>
<p>This particular Kallenbach letter has been dated by an unknown hand as December 1914. Our dating is reliant on this, because content is not detailed enough to provide more precise information. Gandhi et al. left for India on 19 December 1914; and Schreiner and Kallenbach were both resident in London and saw a lot of each other in late 1914 and through 1915. When Schreiner became seriously ill during an early 1915 influenza epidemic, Kallenbach provided her with attentive care, shopping and reading matter; and in later 1915 when Kallenbach, German by origin, was interned on the Isle of Man, Schreiner wrote frequently to him until his late 1916 release.</p>
<p><italic>The editorial moment</italic>: Kallenbach was very helpful to Schreiner when she was ill and they shared many outings when she was well. However, a man of independent means, Kallenbach purchased tickets and other items in advance, with his kindness acting as a financial usurpation which removed Schreiner’s independence and equality. Her comments about accounts and paying her way in this letter are unequivocally made, and echo the analysis of gender inequalities in her published writings (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/1440">http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/1440</ext-link>). Such comments strongly feature in Schreiner’s earlier letters to Kallenbach and recur in subsequent ones, suggesting that Kallenbach failed to comprehend why she wrote what she did. The sense of disparity in their ideas about personal conduct is reinforced by another epistolary ‘trouble’, when Schreiner rebuked Kallenbach’s ‘ungentlemanly’ remarks about the artist and poet Isaac Rosenberg, an acquaintance of hers (16 March 1915, Hermann Kallenbach, MSC 26/2.3.25). After Kallenbach’s release from internment, the letters just stop and there is nothing stated which explains this. But his unwelcomed over-generosity, resulting in inequalities in the friendship, and different ideas about gossip could have been involved.</p>
<p>There is, however, another obvious re-reading of this letter. This backgrounds all the above and sees it as a portal regarding the connection with Gandhi, who is mentioned many times in Schreiner’s letters, and it also represents that ‘moment’ when the configuration of the political movement around Gandhi changed because of Kallenbach’s financial as well as personal removal. Both interpretations are defensible, with different preferences among the team concerning this. However, editorially we recognize the danger of over-emphasizing the Gandhi link because of his wider political significance; and, relatedly, we all accept the need to treat Schreiner’s letters to Kallenbach as a topic in their own right and not as a proxy resource concerning Gandhi.</p>
<p><italic>The lateness of the reader</italic>: But might later readers coming across this letter simply ignore Schreiner’s relationship with Kallenbach and just pick out the Gandhi connections? Certainly there is likely to be great interest in the Schreiner/Gandhi relationship, with many references to Gandhi and his circle in Schreiner’s other letters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1749975512473463">Stanley and Dampier, 2010</xref>). Also, Schreiner’s letter to Gandhi (Olive Schreiner: Hermann Kallenbach, MSC 26/2.3.2) is an important one, calling him to task over pacifist issues, while there has recently been a renewed interest in Kallenbach’s friendship with Gandhi (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1749975512473463">Lelyveld, 2010</xref>), again stressing the Gandhi link. However, what Schreiner’s letters to Kallenbach contain about South African expatriates in wartime London, pacifist and vegetarian shops and cafes, and the mutually caring if troubled friendship between them, are of considerable interest and should not be lost sight of. These letters also raise important matters about provenance, interpretational issues concerning the relationship between specific letter-content and the wider context giving it meaning, and also regarding ‘important’ versus ‘obscure’ lives, all of which have epistemic consequences for what can be known or gauged from the letters.</p>

<title>Conclusion: Genealogy and Cultural Assemblage</title>
<p>The issues raised by Schreiner’s letters to Fan Schreiner and Hermann Kallenbach also exist across the entire Schreiner epistolarium, reinforcing our earlier comment that the work of making cultural assemblages, and the work that such assemblages do, are closely inter-related. As we have shown, this symbiosis has shaped working on Schreiner’s letters from start to finish, including how matters of dating and provenance have been handled, the specifics of transcription practices, how the ‘look’ of letters has been rendered using xml, the way that historical and biographical information is provided, and how search facilities and so re-readings of the letters have been structured. Clearly ‘culture’ and the ‘cultural’ do not already exist but are produced, and the idea of cultural assemblage is very helpful in underlining this. Rather than discussing such matters abstractly, attentive detail has been provided by analytically scrutinizing the material practices that constitute the ‘bringing-into-being’ involved in one such assemblage and asking the questions about this raised by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1749975512473463">Inglis et al. (2007)</xref>, concerning what the reflexive vigilance called for might look like and the analytical purposes this should serve.</p>
<p>Our response is that cultural sociology, not just reflexivity, should be grounded in the specifics of particular contexts and examples. That is, the ideas from Inglis et al., Bennett and Mukerji with which we started are important and raise fundamental principles and programmatic concerns for cultural sociology, and should be responded to in their own terms. This is not done with abstractions, but instead by reference to the analysis of time, place, persons and – importantly – the practices or work involved in making the cultural in <italic>this</italic> time, <italic>this</italic> place, involving <italic>those</italic> persons and circumstances. From this has derived the detailed attention to the specifics of the editorial practices discussed, and also the emphasis on the always already culturally-imbued character of the materials – the letters – worked with in making the cultural assemblage that is the <italic>Olive Schreiner Letters Online</italic>.</p>
<p>Discussion has pinned down what the particular ‘mode of bringing-into-being’ has been in the making of the cultural regarding Schreiner’s letters, exploring in detail editorial working practices, both overall and regarding specific examples. ‘The letters’ that researchers and editors work with are already shaped by their writers, addressees, third parties and archivists in ways that have powerful epistemic consequence. The discussion has also shown that matters of ontology and epistemology cannot be separated without analytical violence, for how the ontological being of ‘the letters’ is conceived will shape how they are understood, worked with, theorized and knowledge-claims made.</p>
<p>Cultural assemblage, the work of making the cultural, is then an irrevocably social matter involving considerable activity and busyness. In this case study of Schreiner’s letters, it includes the ‘moments’ of writing, sending and reading of Schreiner and company; later archival professional practices in packaging the flotsam of things that become collections and sub-collections; an array of research and editorial practices in investigating, interpreting and – in the case of editorship – transmuting their representational form; the many temporally and spatially diverse later re-readings and interpretations that are carried out. And at all points, the ontological character and parameters of this particular cultural assemblage can change as a result of the practices deployed in making and using it. It is not the case that, for example, Mary Sauer may have destroyed many Schreiner letters and so this imposes a final shape and meaning to these letters. Rather, the meaning of the contents of the extant letters remains under construction through the interpretive work of researchers, through the transmutational practices of editors, through the potentially myriad activities of later readers. Regarding all of Schreiner’s letters, closure may have been sought through, for example, guarded and careful forms of letter-writing, or destructions of letters; but what occurs thereafter, once the doors of the archive that <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1749975512473463">Steedman (2001)</xref> invokes swing open, involves proliferation, militating against at least some aspects of the canonical tendencies powerfully theorized by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1749975512473463">de Certeau (1988 [1975])</xref>, for the later reader will hopefully be ‘undisciplined’ in the best sense of the word by re-reading from within many different frameworks.</p>
<p>‘Undisciplining’ is, however, not reserved for later readers, with a research team offering its own challenges in this regard. Central to our editorial practices has been a programme of concerted re-readings of the Schreiner letters, and collectively and in depth discussing interpretations of these. Important differences regarding particular letters and also aspects of Schreiner’s letter-writing more generally have certainly arisen; and while many have resolved into shared thinking, others remain, including those discussed above. However, these interpretive differences have not mapped in any discernible way onto our disciplinary (sociology, history, geography, literature, computer science) backgrounds, but stem instead from more complexly configured intellectual interests, prior stocks of knowledge, and individual responses to sets of letters and how to interpret them.</p>
<p>The cultural genealogy provided here emphasizes the importance of the working practices which go to make up cultural assemblage, but is not to be reduced to the descriptive work it does. Nor should cultural genealogy be seen as simply a methodological contribution with theoretical consequence, nor even as a theoretical intervention that is methodologically underpinned, valuable though these are. Instead it is a contribution to a more programmatic concern with re/configuring the project of cultural sociology by showing the symbiosis of ‘the work’ and ‘the work it does’. Detailed reflexive discussion of how knowledge is produced makes material the activities which constitute the mode of bringing-into-being of both cultural sociology and the cultural assemblages of its concern. And for us, the analytical reflexivity that Inglis et al. call for should not be confined to cultural sociology, having similar resonance for other inter/disciplines engaged in cultural production and analysis.</p>
