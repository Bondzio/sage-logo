<p>Principals play a crucial role in establishing the culture of a school and ensuring that there is quality instruction and learning happening in each classroom. Articles in this issue of the <italic>NASSP Bulletin</italic> offer unique ideas for principals to consider as they think about their work. It is my hope that readers will find new perspectives on how schooling can be improved and how the exercise of leadership influences this improvement.</p>
<p>Every principal is challenged with “finding the time to lead.” In the lead article, researchers Hallinger and Murphy review the evolution of instructional leadership as a model for principal practice and examine barriers to its successful enactment. Based on these findings, the authors propose strategies that school leaders can employ to reduce the gap between intentions and reality. They suggest that these strategies when used in concert have the possibility to create the time and capacity to lead learning in schools. The researchers assert that principals need to clarify their personal vision and supporting “habits,” articulate a collective instructional leadership role, and enable others to act. Principals will find this article especially insightful for its discussion on how they can enact leadership and find the time and capacity to lead learning.</p>
<p>Leading schools and school systems today extends beyond application of a style or particular leadership approach. According to author Paul Fallon, changes in priority, multiple mandates, financial constraints, and the transient nature of student and families present formidable challenges to leading. The question is, what mechanism is available for principals to analyze their leading to know if leadership is operating and how it is operating? The Oriented Compass Model is a tool proposed for this purpose. The author states that leaders can leverage the model to evaluate the act of leading, in route, via a measurable trajectory toward an outcome of leadership. Attention is centered on mechanisms to detect error, surmount barriers, build leadership capacity, sustain optimum performance, and identify artifacts of leadership. Using the model, principals can gain powerful insights that have great potential to inform next steps, recalibration of strategy, and mission/vision attainment.</p>
<p>Schools face considerable challenge as they seek to improve student performance and close achievement gaps. In response, many schools are instituting a tiered support system for students. Author Shannon Dulaney presents her findings from a case study at Crest Middle School on how the leaders at Crest Middle and their school community have been able to work toward sustaining systematic school improvement through implementing “response to intervention” as a structure of support. Discussion of the challenges and creative solutions associated with assessment processes, student scheduling, teacher professional development, and parent involvement are presented. The author contends that this approach can be seen as a tool to strengthen school-wide practices and bring together a staff with a single motivating purpose of student success. Principals will find this research enlightening and instructive as they engage in the response to intervention journey.</p>
<p>Performance incentive programs are invariably connected to teacher evaluation as states and districts move toward greater accountability for teacher performance. Authors Miller and Grobe explore the intersection between performance pay incentives and teacher performance as perceived by principals who must make a judgment of teacher effectiveness. Findings from this research suggest there are a number of challenges for school leaders as they work within a system of performance incentives. In particular, the authors note the difficulty of administrators making objective decisions on performance versus maintaining a quid pro quo relationship. This article presents instructive considerations for both district leaders and principals engaged in creating performance incentive initiatives.</p>
<p>As you read this issue, I hope you will gather ideas that will help you move your school forward. Each article is a “must read”!</p>
