<abstract>
<p>Focus group interviewing is widely used by academic and applied researchers. Given the popularity and strengths of this method, it is surprising how rarely focus group interviewing is taught in the undergraduate classroom and how few resources exist to support instructors who wish to train students to use this technique. This article fills the gap in the teaching and learning literature in sociology by addressing focus group research. I describe how to integrate a complete research project with student-led focus groups into a single semester course. I outline the various stages involved in the research process and then consider how this approach enhances three specific areas: learning, teaching, and scholarship. The effectiveness of the focus group project was assessed through a one-group pretest-posttest survey of the student-researchers’ experiences. I conclude with a reflection on the practical limitations as well as the considerable advantages of training students to conduct focus group research.</p>

<p>Focus groups have been used for a range of purposes and in various contexts by academic and applied researchers. As defined by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0092055X12465295">Krueger and Casey (2009</xref>:2), “A focus group study is a carefully planned series of discussions designed to obtain perceptions on a defined area of interest in a permissive, nonthreatening environment.” The origin of focus groups is often traced back to the eminent sociologist Robert K. Merton at Columbia University in the 1940s. Beginning in the 1960s, focus groups became the method <italic>du jour</italic> among commercial market researchers. It was not until the 1980s when focus groups reemerged and gained traction as a prominent research technique in academic settings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0092055X12465295">Bloor et al. 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0092055X12465295">Fontana and Frey 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0092055X12465295">Morgan 1996</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0092055X12465295">1997</xref>).</p>
<p>The pervasive use of focus groups is partly based on the time and cost savings compared to individual interviews. Beyond these pragmatic benefits, group interviews create an opportunity for participants to discuss collectively normative assumptions that are typically unarticulated, thus providing insight into complex motivations and behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0092055X12465295">Bloor et al. 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0092055X12465295">Morgan and Krueger 1993</xref>). The interaction between focus group participants has the potential to create a dynamic synergy that is absent in individual interviews. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0092055X12465295">Morgan (1996</xref>:139) explains, “What makes the discussion in focus groups more than the sum of separate individual interviews is the fact that the participants both query each other and explain themselves to each other.” A highly versatile method, focus groups have been used by sociologists across a wide range of subfields, including the sociology of health and health education (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0092055X12465295">Kidd and Parshall 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0092055X12465295">Kitzinger 1994</xref>), the sociology of race and racism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0092055X12465295">McDonald and Wingfield 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-0092055X12465295">Trepagnier 2001</xref>), and the sociology of work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0092055X12465295">Bobo et al. 1995</xref>), to name a few.</p>
<p>The strengths of focus group research are considerable, but the method is not easy to implement and has a number of weaknesses. A growing body of literature has focused on the methodological and analytical complexity involved in focus group research. Scholars have expressed concern about the reliability, validity, and generalizability of focus group findings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0092055X12465295">Carey 1995</xref>). There have also been legitimate questions raised with regard to the moderator’s role in generating data as well as the impact of the group itself on focus group data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0092055X12465295">Morgan 1996</xref>). Furthermore, focus groups suffer from the dangers inherent in all research methods that rely on self-reported data; namely, participants may self-censure, underreport, or overreport. These tendencies may be compounded by the presence of multiple participants, requiring researchers to be mindful of how the issues of privacy and embarrassment may constrain data collection efforts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0092055X12465295">Lofland and Lofland 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0092055X12465295">Peek and Fothergill 2009</xref>). Scholars have also called for the need to recognize multiple, overlapping social contexts in any focus group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0092055X12465295">Hollander 2004</xref>). Certainly, then, focus groups may work well only under certain circumstances and for particular topics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0092055X12465295">Carey 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0092055X12465295">Jowett and O’Toole 2006</xref>). Despite these drawbacks, focus groups hold substantial power and potential for researchers and participants when used with careful research design and when combined with other methods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0092055X12465295">Morgan 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0092055X12465295">Peek and Fothergill 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0092055X12465295">Smithson 2000</xref>).</p>
<p>Given the popularity, flexibility, and value of focus groups, they have been surprisingly under-utilized in the classroom. With the exception of lengthy texts primarily aimed at professional researchers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0092055X12465295">Bloor et al. 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0092055X12465295">Krueger and Casey 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0092055X12465295">Morgan 1998</xref>) and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0092055X12465295">Collier and Morgan’s (2002)</xref> contribution in <italic>Teaching Sociology</italic> about how students can use focus groups for a service-learning project, to date there are no published pedagogical reports that assist teachers in training their students to conduct focus groups. In contrast, there are extensive descriptions of how to teach students to use a variety of other research methods, such as in-depth interviewing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0092055X12465295">Charmaz 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0092055X12465295">Healey-Etten and Sharp 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0092055X12465295">Raddon, Nault, and Scott 2008</xref>), survey research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0092055X12465295">Cutler 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0092055X12465295">Singleton 2007</xref>), content analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0092055X12465295">Taylor 2003</xref>), and field research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0092055X12465295">Broughton 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0092055X12465295">Keen 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0092055X12465295">Schmid 1992</xref>).</p>
<p>The project described in this article heeds the call from educators who have long advocated for the value of experiential learning in the social sciences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0092055X12465295">DeMartini 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0092055X12465295">Gary and Meighen 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0092055X12465295">Gondolf 1980</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0092055X12465295">1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0092055X12465295">Grant et al. 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0092055X12465295">Greenberg 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0092055X12465295">Ripptoe 1977</xref>) and contributes to the consensus that students learn best by “doing” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0092055X12465295">Crull and Collins 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0092055X12465295">Longmore, Dunn, and Jarboe 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0092055X12465295">Takata and Leiting 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0092055X12465295">Teixeira-Poit, Cameron, and Schulman 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-0092055X12465295">Winn 1995</xref>). In particular, this article adds to descriptions of how to provide students with a complete project experience from start to finish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0092055X12465295">Raddon et al. 2008</xref>) and directly addresses the relative absence of focus groups in the scholarship of teaching and learning literature.</p>
<p>First, I describe how the course-based, student-led focus group project was conducted in a research methods course. I provide detailed information about how students were guided through the various stages of the research process including ethics training, data collection, and analysis. Second, I discuss the associated advantages of implementing an undergraduate focus group research project with regard to learning, teaching, and faculty scholarship. To assess the effectiveness of the project, I report the results of a one-group pre- and post-survey evaluation of the student-researchers’ experiences. This is followed by a thorough consideration of the practical limitations, and the potential extensions, of using focus groups in a research methods course.</p>

<title>The Undergraduate Focus Group Research Project</title>
<sec id="section2-0092055X12465295">
<title>Genesis of the Study</title>
<p>The study took place at California Lutheran University (CLU), a small, private, liberal arts school. The class project began as an effort to collect data for larger, campuswide research and programming related to alcohol use. In 2009, the university received a grant from the National College Athletic Association CHOICES Program. The objectives of the CHOICES grant were to provide learning opportunities for students and to heighten awareness of campus norms and subcultures regarding alcohol consumption. The focus group projects conducted by students in my class served as a qualitative follow-up study to a quantitative survey that was conducted at the school the previous year.</p>
<p>During Phase I of the research project, the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0092055X12465295">American College Health Association’s (2011)</xref> National College Health Assessment II was distributed on campus during the 2009–2010 academic year to all traditional, full-time undergraduates at CLU. The National College Health Assessment II is a national instrument administered by the American College Health Association and among the most widely recognized instruments for gathering data on sensitive topics related to student social life with high validity and reliability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0092055X12465295">Douglas et al. 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0092055X12465295">Lorentson 2010</xref>). The web-based survey asked students questions about various health and wellness topics, including physical fitness, mental health, alcohol and drug use, academic performance, and sexual responsibility.</p>
<p>The survey shed light on important aspects of students’ health, particularly risky behaviors, and yielded a 39 percent response rate on our campus, with data collected from 752 respondents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0092055X12465295">Lorentson 2010</xref>). While strong on breadth, the survey’s quantitative question formats failed to capture in-depth data regarding the motivations and decision-making experiences of students. Furthermore, the very issues that might result in nonresponses in survey research, such as self-selection, become even more problematic when seeking to collect data from students who may report unhealthy behaviors. These drawbacks are compounded by the fact that specific subpopulations of students at CLU, such as transfer or commuter students, are hard to reach and thus underrepresented on the survey.</p>
<p>To address these gaps in our knowledge of campus life, we launched Phase II of the CHOICES (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0092055X12465295">National College Athletic Association 2012</xref>) data collection. I was asked to serve as the primary faculty investigator charged with collecting much-needed qualitative data on student health to augment our existing quantitative campus data. I brainstormed a number of methodological designs before deciding to involve students not only as respondents but as active researchers.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0092055X12465295">
<title>Research Design</title>
<p>In the fall of 2011, the CLU Institutional Review Board (IRB) approved for students who were enrolled in my course to conduct focus group research with their peers. I also received approval to collect data on the student-researchers’ experiences by distributing surveys to the class before and after the project. The IRB application included the primary questions to be asked during the focus group (included in the <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-0092055X12465295">appendix</xref>). The research project accounted for approximately 60 percent of the requirements for a single-semester (15-week) course. The course itself was an upper-division research methods course and was required for sociology majors. All students enrolled in the course were majoring in sociology. The format of the course involved twice-weekly meetings for 1 hour and 45 minutes each session. Typically, one class period a week was devoted to lecture, and the other class period was reserved as the practicum aspect of the course. During the lecture period, I covered the fundamentals of research design, ethics, data collection, and analysis. During the practicum class periods, the students worked on various aspects of the focus group project, including strategizing for recruitment, practice moderating, and transcribing. The lectures and hands-on work were supported by a comprehensive, general research methods text (<italic>Making Sense of the Social World</italic> by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0092055X12465295">Chambliss and Schutt 2010</xref>), the leading text for focus group research (<italic>Focus Groups: A Practical Guide for Applied Research</italic> by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0092055X12465295">Krueger and Casey [2009]</xref>), and supplemental readings that consisted of empirical articles about student alcohol use and focus group research. There were 22 students enrolled in the course, with 19 women (86.4 percent) and 3 men (13.6 percent). All but 2 of the students were juniors or seniors. Thirty-one percent had taken at least one general introductory research methods course previously, whereas this was the first research methods course for 68 percent of the class.</p>
<p>A significant amount of attention in class was devoted to outlining the fundamentals of protecting research participants before, during, and after the focus group project. During the practicum sessions, students brainstormed about potential ethical problems, practiced ensuring voluntary consent from their participants, and received training for dealing with specific ethical issues during data collection. For example, students were given scenarios to practice during the practicum sessions to learn how to handle situations wherein inappropriate information is shared during a focus group interview. Students learned how to redirect discussions as well as warn and dismiss disruptive participants.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0092055X12465295">
<title>Student Research Teams</title>
<p>Students were divided into five research teams, which consisted of three to five students per team. Each team was responsible for the recruitment and facilitation of one focus group. The teams were divided by taking into account the students’ grade level, prior achievement, and work habits. Rather than allowing students to self-select their teams, this method was chosen to avoid having some students feel left out and to maximize heterogeneity as well as distribute more able students evenly among the teams.</p>
<p>The central focus of the class projects remained on student alcohol use, but each research team was asked to identify a specific subpopulation of students on campus to study. The subpopulations the students selected included: (1) commuter students; (2) international students; (3) students who identified as lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and questioning; (4) students involved in campus ministry; and (5) transfer students.</p>
<p>The student-researchers received a handout that outlined the specific roles and related duties of the individual members of each research team, such as the primary moderator, note takers, logistical coordinator, and lead transcriber. The students were tasked with selecting or delegating their own roles. This clear division of labor thus became self-directed and encouraged students to develop ownership of specific aspects of their team’s project. The goal was to make students accountable to one another, not just to the instructor, to combat the diffusion of responsibility and social loafing that can occur in group projects.</p>
<p>The students implemented purposive sampling, a technique commonly used in focus group research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0092055X12465295">Miles and Huberman 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0092055X12465295">Patton 1990</xref>) and the most appropriate technique given the specific subpopulations targeted in the project. Similar to the recruitment strategies described in the focus group research of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0092055X12465295">Peek and Fothergill (2009)</xref>, a combination of researcher-driven, key informant, and spontaneous recruitment was used by the student-researchers. Students reached their potential participants in a variety of ways and relied largely on their campus social networks as well as student clubs, which were helpful in providing sampling frames. Each research team was required to produce a flier for its target population, which announced the focus group session’s purpose, meeting time, and location. With support from the CHOICE grant, each team was able to advertise and provide incentives for participation. The funds covered pizza and refreshments during the session as well as a gift certificate for a smoothie for each participant.</p>
<p>The student research teams were required to recruit 6 to 12 participants for their interview, keeping within the range of the most effective size for focus groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0092055X12465295">Morgan 1997</xref>). Beyond the group size and primary screen set by each research team for its respective subpopulation (i.e., international students), students were encouraged to seek diversity in group composition with regard to participants’ gender, class year, race, and ethnicity. Recruitment proved to be the most challenging aspect of the project, which is common in focus group research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0092055X12465295">Krueger and Casey 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0092055X12465295">Morgan 1995</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0092055X12465295">
<title>Conducting the Interviews</title>
<p>Before conducting the focus group interviews, each student was required to produce an individual literature review. The literature review was an essential part of the research process, as it provided students with a more thorough grounding in scholarship regarding student alcohol use. In addition to the literature review, each team was required to develop four key questions and a stimulus activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0092055X12465295">Kitzinger 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0092055X12465295">Krueger and Casey 2009</xref>) such as a vignette, image, or game tailored to its population. After instructor approval, these questions and stimulus activities would be used during the focus group interviews to augment the primary focus group questions about alcohol use, which the instructor provided every team.</p>
<p>During class, students received intensive training before conducting their focus groups. Lectures covered the principles of successful interviewing, including a discussion of how <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0092055X12465295">Healey-Etten and Sharp’s (2010)</xref> tip sheet for in-depth interviewing could be adapted and applied for group interviews. Students learned strategies for distributing informed consent sheets, moderating, and note taking. Students also received tips on how to create an inviting atmosphere during the sessions that would encourage participants to share a variety of opinions and viewpoints.</p>
<p>This training required extensive discussion of social-psychological phenomena specific to small-group interaction. For example, we discussed how “social desirability bias” may encourage participants to refrain from revealing negative information to present the most favorable impression of themselves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0092055X12465295">Goffman 1959</xref>). Similarly, we addressed how to minimize “groupthink,” a hazard common in groups when participants may censure or withhold information for the sake of conformity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0092055X12465295">Asch 1956</xref>). Students learned how to combat groupthink, such as “playing the devil’s advocate” during a focus group by having the moderator provide alternative perspectives, introduce different scenarios, or ask thought-provoking questions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0092055X12465295">MacDougall and Baum 1997</xref>). Students role-played these techniques during practice sessions that were observed and critiqued by the instructor. This provided each team with practice and concrete feedback for improving its moderating skills.</p>
<p>Large conference rooms were reserved for the student research teams to conduct their focus group interviews, each of which lasted for approximately 1 hour and 30 minutes. The instructor was available during each session but did not directly observe or participate in the data collection. This supervisory absence was an intentional aspect of the research design; it reinforced students’ autonomy as independent researchers by allowing peer moderators to facilitate the discussion without interference from a faculty member (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0092055X12465295">Broadbear, O’Toole, and Angermeier-Howard 2000</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0092055X12465295">
<title>Data Analysis and Presentation of Findings</title>
<p>The remaining weeks of the semester were dedicated to debriefing with student-researchers, transcribing, analyzing, and presenting findings orally and in writing. As transcription is a notoriously arduous and time-consuming task, each student was required to transcribe a portion of the interview, approximately 25 minutes of the 90-minute recording. Each team member contributed to the transcript, but one student, the lead transcriber, was ultimately in charge of ensuring that all the transcription efforts were standardized and compiled into one document.</p>
<p>With their transcriptions complete, students were trained in data analysis. They learned how to use open and focused coding by subjecting their data to a line-by-line analysis to generate and refine analytic categories (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0092055X12465295">Emerson, Fretz, and Shaw 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0092055X12465295">Strauss and Corbin 1998</xref>). Students were also provided readings that specifically addressed how to analyze and interpret focus group data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0092055X12465295">Kidd and Parshall 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0092055X12465295">Krueger 1997a</xref>).</p>
<p>Independently, students first identified core themes or analytical categories in their interviews. The next step involved sorting quotes under each theme. One particularly useful method for teaching students how to code was by having them read the Findings section of an empirical article in class and then use backward or reverse outlining to identify the main points, progression of ideas, and integration of examples in writing. This technique allowed students to see how scholars use data to produce a narrative structure.</p>
<p>The final components of the research project consisted of a group presentation from each research team as well as a final report from each individual student. The report was a 10-page paper that followed an abbreviated outline of an academic article and included a revised literature review and analysis of the findings. Students were able to draw on their transcripts and field notes when describing what they learned from their focus group interviews.</p>

<title>Student Benefits</title>
<p>The focus group research project provided a number of demonstrable benefits for students. One advantage was that the research design required students to work not only independently but in groups as well as with groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0092055X12465295">Collier and Morgan 2002</xref>). The ability to work alone as well as collaboratively is a beneficial skill for students to acquire for almost any postgraduate job they are likely to obtain. Through cooperative work, students develop transferable skills for career development, such as written and oral communication, planning, conflict management, adaptability, and the ability to define and solve problems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0092055X12465295">Colbeck, Campbell, and Bjorklund 2000</xref>). These tangible skills, in addition to critical thinking and complex reasoning, are necessary and often underdeveloped aspects of students’ development and employability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0092055X12465295">Arum and Roska 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0092055X12465295">Hacker and Dreifus 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>Engaging students in group research projects can improve and deepen students’ academic experiences. Experiential pedagogy has been found to be more enjoyable for students than traditional lecture formats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0092055X12465295">Rohall et al. 2004</xref>) and can help students acquire a fuller appreciation of the value and complexity of the research process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0092055X12465295">Hopkinson and Hogg 2004</xref>). In addition, the importance of research ethics is enhanced when students are required to undertake a project with human participants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0092055X12465295">Teixeira-Poit et al. 2011</xref>). Ethics becomes a concrete and consequential matter rather than a merely abstract concept. The focus group research project also linked research methods with a substantive issue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0092055X12465295">Cutler 1987</xref>). Students discovered how sociological investigation can illuminate real-world issues, such as student alcohol use.</p>
<p>To evaluate the effectiveness of the project in more depth, I developed and implemented a one-group pretest-posttest survey.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0092055X12465295">1</xref></sup> The goal was to learn more about the student-researchers’ learning expectations, experiences, and outcomes. The questionnaire was created and administered using Qualtrics, an online survey software program. The survey included 11 closed-ended questions and 3 open-ended questions. Apart from the demographic question regarding class year, students were asked whether they had previously taken a research methods course, along with a number of items to assess students’ attitudes toward group projects in general, their understanding of the procedures and assignments related to the focus group research project, their feelings toward their research teams’ topics, whether they were satisfied with the individual role they fulfilled on their research teams, and the level of perceived difficulty associated with the project. The final items assessed whether students believed that their involvement in the project increased their general understanding of research methods and prepared them to work on collaborative projects later in their careers. The open-ended questions asked students to identify specific skills they learned during the class, as well as to describe the most challenging aspects of the project and to explain what would have supported or improved their overall experiences.</p>
<p>The pretest had a response rate of 86 percent (19 out of 22 students completed the survey), and the posttest had a response rate of 95 percent (21 out of 22 students completed the survey). The results for four of the most salient questions on the survey are listed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0092055X12465295">Table 1</xref>.</p>

<p>These results indicate that the focus group research project exceeded the students’ expectations in many respects. For example, as reflected in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0092055X12465295">Figure 1</xref>, before the semester, 21 percent (<italic>n</italic> = 19) of students indicated that they disliked working on group projects in general, and afterward no one (<italic>n</italic> = 21) reported disliking group work; in fact, by the end of the semester the students reported liking group projects more (45 percent, <italic>n</italic> = 21) than at the beginning of the semester (16 percent, <italic>n</italic> = 19), with a little more than half remaining neutral on the topic (55 percent, <italic>n</italic> = 21). The students also reported feeling happier about their participation in the focus group research project (25 percent very happy, <italic>n</italic> = 21) than they had originally anticipated (11 percent very happy, <italic>n</italic> = 19). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0092055X12465295">Figure 2</xref>, when asked if participating in the focus group research project would enhance their understanding of research methods, students reported strongly agreeing (26 percent, <italic>n</italic> = 19) or agreeing (74 percent) on the pretest and were split 50/50 between strongly agreeing (50 percent, <italic>n</italic> = 21) and agreeing (50 percent, <italic>n</italic> = 21) by the semester’s end. Finally, as illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0092055X12465295">Figure 3</xref>, before the project, students believed that their involvement would prepare them to work on collaborative projects in the future (pretest: 42 percent strongly agreed, 53 percent agreed, and 5 percent neutral, <italic>n</italic> = 19), and after their participation they believed it with increased conviction (posttest: 50 percent strongly agreed, 50 percent agreed, <italic>n</italic> = 21).</p>

<title>Pedagogical Advantages</title>
<p>Instructors also have much to gain by structuring a research methods course around a focus group project. It is useful to have one common, empirical study to refer to throughout a semester. It creates a community of learners (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0092055X12465295">Macheski et al. 2008</xref>) and serves as a constant source of examples (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0092055X12465295">Singleton 2007</xref>) for illustrating methodological concepts and challenges. Having a concrete project to refer back to consistently is helpful when explaining complicated issues related to the overall research process, conceptualization, operationalization, sampling, literature reviews, research ethics, and the intricacies of data collection and analysis. Therefore, the substantive project served as a way to communicate the fundamentals of social research more generally and to teach the method of focus group interviewing in particular.</p>
<p>Another pedagogical benefit came from using a combination of individual and group work throughout the semester. Dividing students into research teams was more efficient than supervising each student’s individual project. This format will be particularly important for managing the logistics of a research project in courses with larger enrollments. Students were also evaluated on the basis of both their individual efforts and their group’s efforts. For example; students were graded individually for portions of the group research project (30 percent), attendance and participation (20 percent), and periodic quizzes throughout the semester (20 percent). The remaining proportion of the group project was graded collectively (30 percent). And importantly, when assigning individual grades, students were graded against the standard and not other members of their group. Using these multiple methods of evaluation was useful, particularly for maximizing fairness and avoiding the difficulty of assessing the quality and quantity of individual students in a collaborative project. Furthermore, relying more heavily on individual work helps to minimize certain dangers of group work, such as social loafing and the diffusion of responsibility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0092055X12465295">Pedersen 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>One final pedagogical asset to using the focus group research project is that it can provide a variety of opportunities and extensions. For instructors who work in teaching-intensive environments, integrating research into the classroom may be the most effective strategy to maintain an active scholarly agenda. Countless studies have shown how teaching effectiveness and research productivity can be complementary and mutually supporting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0092055X12465295">Braxton 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0092055X12465295">Neuman 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-0092055X12465295">Webster 1986</xref>).</p>
<p>Instructors could also partner with departments or programs on campus that have evaluation needs. The topic for the focus group research project can then be directed to collecting data for that particular campus client, such as student health services or the athletic department. Thus, beyond the topic of student alcohol use, focus groups that are conducted by and with undergraduates could generate insight into various aspects of campus life. Furthermore, the project could be extended off campus by partnering with local organizations, thus providing students the experience and benefits of community-based research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0092055X12465295">Bach and Weinzimmer 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0092055X12465295">Collier and Morgan 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0092055X12465295">Gondolf 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0092055X12465295">Marullo, Moayedi, and Cooke 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>In addition, instructors could continue certain aspects of the focus group project and carry it over into additional classes. I was able to use this approach with my students due to the sequence of the required methods courses at CLU. The research methods course in which students conducted the focus group interviews was offered in the fall and was a prerequisite for a quantitative methods course I taught the next semester. Most all of the same students from the first class were enrolled in the second class. The students were able to augment the qualitative data from their focus groups with quantitative data from the CHOICE survey. This made it possible for me as an instructor to provide students with continuity in their coursework. The combination of research conducted in both classes also allowed me to mentor a handful of motivated students to present their research in an on-campus conference and ultimately produce independent senior thesis projects based on triangulated data.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-0092055X12465295">
<title>Contributions to Knowledge</title>
<p>The focus group research project undoubtedly fulfilled the primary objective of the CHOICE grant by providing learning opportunities for both student-researchers and participants about alcohol use. The results shared by the students in their on-campus presentations contributed to an understanding of the campus culture and norms around alcohol use, particularly about harder-to-reach student populations that were largely absent from the earlier CHOICE survey.</p>
<p>The larger scholarly reach of such a project is possible but more complicated. The depth and breadth of the data were constituted by the research design and the use of student-researchers. Most of the students were doing empirical research for the first time, and no student had prior experience conducting focus group interviews. The validity of the research was reduced because students lacked advanced skills in data collection and analysis as well as an in-depth understanding of the literature on student alcohol use. Reliability was also diminished by the use of different moderators and researchers for each focus group. Also, the data from this research cannot be generalized to other settings.</p>
<p>Certain steps can be taken to protect against these weaknesses and improve the scholarly application of the project. Instructors could take a more central role in data collection and analysis to help raise the quality and consistency of the overall project. Instructors could be responsible for moderating each focus group interview and for coding the data while still involving students as research assistants. Student tasks could include identifying sources for the literature review, recruiting respondents, and serving as note takers and transcribers. This arrangement would reduce student engagement in the overall research project but likely improve the odds of producing higher- quality data. These steps could then open up scholarly opportunities beyond the classroom. Instructors can actively collaborate with undergraduates on “real” research by copresenting findings at professional conferences and coauthoring papers to submit for publication.</p>
<p>I intend to build on the data that my students collected in their focus groups by continuing the project as a requirement of the research methods course and collaborating more actively with student-researchers. The ultimate goal is to contribute to the body of scholarly literature on student alcohol use. In particular, the class project can add to the insights of other scholars who have found the method of focus group interviewing to be effective for studying students’ attitudes and behaviors regarding drinking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0092055X12465295">Broadbear et al. 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0092055X12465295">Emery et al. 1993</xref>), as well as marijuana use (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-0092055X12465295">Warner, Weber, and Albanes 1999</xref>) and sexuality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-0092055X12465295">Walden and Fennell 1995</xref>).</p>

<title>Practical Considerations and Limitations</title>
<p>Despite the many benefits of having students complete a focus group research project over the course of a semester, there are certain challenges that must be considered. These are predominately pragmatic issues related to logistics and workload that are common to project-based courses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0092055X12465295">Keen 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0092055X12465295">Nyden 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0092055X12465295">Raddon et al. 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0092055X12465295">Takata and Leiting 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-0092055X12465295">Winn 1995</xref>).</p>
<p>First, the project requires a significant amount of planning and preparation before the semester. It is recommended that well in advance of the course, the instructor select the substantive topic of investigation and apply for IRB approval to ensure timely progression of the project. This front work, in turn, curtails student involvement; with exclusion from the research design, students are unable to contribute their ideas about the research topic or interview schedule. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0092055X12465295">Singleton (2007</xref>:55) points out, “Student input is likely to affect their engagement with the project: the greater their role, the greater their sense of ownership.” Another issue related to instructor workload is the intensity and vigilance required to keep the students’ projects on track from week to week. Adherence to the lecture and practicum plans can create a significant amount of inflexibility that can constrain both teachers and students.</p>
<p>This brings us to the second major challenge, which is the demand placed on students. The group research project requires regular attendance in lecture and practicum in addition to a substantial amount of work outside of class. Chronic student absences can create a serious problem for both an individual student and his or her research team. Furthermore, the course requirements and high expectations may be too heavy a burden for some students; students may be painfully shy, may be dealing with personal or health problems, or have learning challenges that prevent them from participating fully in the group project. Instructors must be prepared to accommodate such students and provide them with alternative requirements and necessary support.</p>
<p>Third, successful student research often demands institutional resources. Our funding from the CHOICE grant was used to create fliers and provide research participant incentives, such as the pizza, refreshments, and smoothie gift certificates. Some type of compensation for participants is crucial in focus group research. Without these tangible and unfortunately costly incentives, perhaps instructors in other courses would be willing to provide their students extra credit for participating as respondents. Students should also have access to digital recorders and a location on campus to conduct their focus group interviews.</p>
<p>The last and most important concern with the research project involves ethical issues related to student research projects. Throughout the course, students received training in ethics but were largely embarking on their first empirical research project. This inexperience, coupled with a sensitive research topic and the involvement of their peers as research participants, has the potential to create serious ethical problems. Furthermore, specific ethical dilemmas, such as limits to confidentiality and researcher control, are endemic to the method of focus group interviewing itself (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-0092055X12465295">Tolich 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>In focus group research, confidentiality cannot be absolutely ensured due to the presence of multiple participants. IRB protocol requires the student-researchers to maintain confidentiality by striking identifying information from the record and using pseudonyms to protect participants. Ground rules are also set for participants before the focus group interview and in debriefing. Participants are reminded not to disclose personal or incriminating information about themselves or others and are explicitly asked not to share information with others about the focus group interview. Inexperienced researchers, however, may have difficulty enforcing these rules during the interview and may allow respondents to introduce new topics or overdisclose (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0092055X12465295">Krueger 1997b</xref>).</p>
<p>Moreover, there are no formal ethical sanctions for a participant who reveals information shared by another focus group participant. Such scenarios are problematic for researchers and participants. These threats must be addressed during student-researcher training and explained to the participants prior to collecting data so that everyone is made adequately aware of the risks involved. Such ethical issues with student-led focus group research are unavoidable but can be minimized through strict adherence to IRB standards. This includes using best practices with informed consent forms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0092055X12465295">Morgan 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-0092055X12465295">Tolich 2009</xref>), providing substantial training in focus group moderating, and simply encouraging student-researchers to study more-benign and less-fraught topics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0092055X12465295">Kitzinger and Barbour 1999</xref>).</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>In this article, I have provided a model for implementing a focus group research project into the undergraduate classroom. I described the logistics and practical limitations involved in structuring a research methods course around a substantive project to which students contribute individually and collectively. Applying this learning-by-doing approach with the underused method of focus group research provides advantages in learning, teaching, and scholarship. Evaluation of the project revealed that students improved their knowledge of research methods more generally and derived skills with long-term benefits. The potential disadvantages of such a project, including the substantial workload for the instructor and students, are outweighed by the advantages to be gained when faculty members infuse research and service into their teaching. Furthermore, such a project has the potential to contribute to advancing knowledge about important issues on campus, in the broader community, and for academic audiences.</p>
