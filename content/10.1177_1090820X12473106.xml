               <p>The response rate for this survey was 67%. Average follow-up was 2.8 years.

Before the operation, 6% of respondents reported diagnosed depression. The postoperative changes were equal between improved and worsened depression. In 27%, the operation increased motivation for daily activities; 73% felt like a “whole” person, and 26% experienced improvement in social skills. In terms of the cosmetic result, 93% were satisfied or very satisfied. However, 27% indicated they were unsatisfied or very unsatisfied with skin sensation.</p>

               <p>Although in some cases depression increased postoperatively, the depression rate in our study was still lower than the published range in the general population in Norway. Breast enlargement increased motivation to perform daily activities in our patients. The procedure improved QOL in both psychosocial and cosmetic aspects. However, the relatively high percentage of patients who experienced reduced breast skin sensitivity postoperatively can represent a challenge for the surgeon. Multicenter/clinic studies are necessary to form a better idea about the implications of the depression rate postoperatively.</p>

   <body>
      <p>An increasing number of Norwegian women undergo breast enlargement surgery for cosmetic and reconstructive reasons.<sup>
            <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1090820X12473106">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1090820X12473106">2</xref>
         </sup> Approximately 70 000 women in Norway have breast implants. (The total population in Norway is about 5 million.) Despite the high incidence of breast augmentation in Norway and the Western world, relatively few studies have been published concerning postoperative quality of life (QOL).<sup>
            <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1090820X12473106">3</xref>
            <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1090820X12473106"/>

         </sup> It seems to be a common view that women with breast implants have certain stereotypical traits: single, young, wants that are considered glamorous, and seeking very big breasts. This stereotypical patient comes from a specific social level and is not well educated. She is epitomized on the front pages of tabloid and popular style magazines, possibly a reflection of a society that focuses on physical appearance and voluptuous women. However, aesthetic surgeons subjectively know that this stereotype does not accurately represent the majority of our patients.</p>
      <p>Therefore, we designed a study to investigate and describe via a written survey the type of women who choose to undergo breast enlargement, including their motivation(s). Questions concerning age, relationship status, children, education, and others were included on the survey; we anticipated that the results would help us provide information about whether a stereotypical patient truly exists in our population. Because recently published (and somewhat worrisome) data about this patient group have documented a high incidence of psychiatric diseases such as depression and a higher suicide rate,<sup>
            <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1090820X12473106">14</xref>
            <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1090820X12473106"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1090820X12473106">16</xref>
         </sup> we also included questions about depression. The survey also included queries about specific aspects of QOL in this group of patients. The effects of breast augmentation procedures on daily activities and participation in work activities have not been addressed in the literature to our knowledge, so these were included, together with an analysis of overall cosmetic and psychosocial changes.</p>

         <title>Methods</title>
         <p>This study was conducted using the QuestBack mail system (QuestBack AS, Oslo, Norway), which guarantees anonymity for the participants. By registering e-mail addresses from our patients, we could send them the questionnaire by e-mail. Patients received a phone call from us some weeks in advance, giving them information about the study and informing them that an anonymous questionnaire about the results would be e-mailed to them and confirming the correct e-mail address. There were no discussions about the contents of the study during the phone conversations. However, if they requested the information, patients were informed of the aim of the study, which was to improve quality of our clinical work. Our aim in including phone calls as part of the survey protocol was to increase the response rate by encouraging the patients to check their e-mail and answer the questionnaire. Patient identity was blinded to the authors because the incoming answers were processed by the QuestBack system and sent as diagrams and figures. The authors had no influence on forming the results. We believe that this system ensured that the patients answered freely.</p>
         <p>Of 121 potential candidates from a consecutive series of patients who underwent cosmetic breast implant augmentation at the senior author’s (AK) clinic between 2005 and 2008, 93 were reachable via e-mail. The survey (Appendix, available online at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.aestheticsurgeryjournal.com/supplemental" xlink:type="simple">www.aestheticsurgeryjournal.com/supplemental</ext-link>) consisted of 47 questions that were specifically grouped with the intent of seeking information about the following aspects: the breast implant patient herself, the postoperative depression incidence/change, changes in daily motivation and work activities, psychosocial changes, and cosmetic changes. (In our study, depression was self-reported but was defined as a diagnosis of depression from health personnel.) In addition, some general questions were included about motivations for the procedure, patient willingness to recommend similar surgery to a friend, and information related to the surgery itself. Answer options were divided into 3 options on a scale: grade 1, <italic>very disappointed or disappointed;</italic> grade 2, <italic>no opinion/no change;</italic> and grade 3, <italic>satisfied or very satisfied.</italic>

         <title>Results</title>
         <p>The response rate was 67%. Mean postoperative follow-up time for the respondents was 2.8 years. Respondents were distributed as follows in terms of age: 8 (13%) patients were 21 years or younger, 20 (33%) patients were between 22 and 29 years, 15 (25%) patients were between 30 and 37 years, and 18 (29%) patients were 38 or older. At the time of operation, 48 (79%) patients were in a romantic relationship and 13 (21%) patients had no relationship. Only 19 (31%) patients had no children at the time of operation, whereas 32 (53%) patients had 1 or 2 children and 10 (16%) had 3 children or more. Concerning education level, 38 (62%) patients had finished elementary or high school, whereas 23 (38%) studied at university or college. Patient income per year was $40 000 to $80 000 USD for 30 patients (49%), $81 000 to $120 000 USD for 9 patients (15%), and more than $120 000 USD for only 2 (3%).

         <p>Motivation for surgery was as follows: 40 (65%) patients sought breast augmentation for cosmetic reasons, 29 (48%) indicated emotional reasons (reduced self-esteem), 13 (22%) indicated intimate reasons, and 6 (10%) specified physical reasons. Cosmetic motivation was mostly related to the appearance of the breasts themselves and the body image of patients stemming from their form and size. Motivation for intimate reasons was mostly related to the feeling patients had with their partner, their willingness to show their naked breasts, and the improvement surgery would (or did) have in their sexual life. Some patients gave more than 1 reason for undergoing surgery, which explains why respondent numbers exceed the total number of patients (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1090820X12473106">Table 2</xref>). Only 3 (5%) patients gave an unspecific response (“other”) as their reason for undergoing the operation. Preoperatively, 4 patients (6%) had been diagnosed with depression. The changes after the operation were equal between improved and worsened depression—1 patient each, with “no difference/not specified” as a response from the remaining 2 patients.</p>

            </sup> have suggested a model called the BREAST-Q that can be used to study the effects and effectiveness of breast surgery from a patient perspective. In this study, we focused on the patient’s perspective and her subjective evaluation of the result more than on the surgeon’s opinion/perspective. After all, the patient is the one who lives with the surgical result. The study was designed to eliminate bias through guaranteed anonymity for patients, absence of industry sponsorship for the study, and use of a balanced scale for answer alternatives (such as “dissatisfaction,” “no effect/no judgment,” and “satisfaction”), rather than offering leading questions or answer options.</p>
         <p>Tabloid and popular style magazines often depict breast augmentation patients as stereotypically single, young, and glamorous (or seeking glamour). They portray them as desiring very big breasts and having little education. This idea is strengthened by television shows and video programming, including some plastic surgery channels. However, we believe this stereotypical view is changing and becoming closer to the picture of a “normal,” average woman. This could be explained by greater acceptance of aesthetic procedures in general, and breast augmentation specifically, among all sorts of women in various countries and cultures. Technical improvements and continual evolution from cosmetic surgeons have also likely contributed to this, along with increasing savviness and competence among patients considering cosmetic surgery procedures. However, our study did show that only a small percentage of women had finished a higher level of education. This could partly be explained by the high number of patients who were in their early 20s at the time of surgery. Several may have been studying at university or college but had not finished at the time they completed their questionnaire.</p>
         <p>Although some patients reported an increase in postoperative depression, the depression rate in our study was lower than the given range in a general population in Norway, which ranges from 7% to 17%.<sup>

            </sup> Our respondents were equally distributed among rural and urban areas, so our lower rate could be explained by a balanced set of social, educational, and health backgrounds, but we cannot conclude with certainty that our sample represents a whole population or explains the difference in depression rates from our study versus others.</p>
         <p>In our study, breast enlargement increased motivation to perform daily activities and, to lesser a degree, work activity. We think that the general improvement in QOL contributes to this, as physical and psychological limitations were improved. Although some studies have not shown improvement in health-related QOL,<sup>

            </sup> The procedure provided amelioration of feelings of wholeness and self-esteem, as well as being comfortable in intimate situations. According to Didie and Sarwer,<sup>

            </sup> breast augmentation patients seem to undergo the surgery for their well-being and are focused on becoming more feminine. In this way, with regard to surgical motivation, our results were in line with the reports of other investigators.<sup>

            </sup> However, some of our patients had more than 1 motivation for the procedure.</p>
         <p>The question of reduced breast skin sensitivity was approached on a general level in the survey; the questions were not specific for an area or duration because we did not expect a large percentage of patients to be affected. However, we think the loss of sensibility is related to the submammary scar area, in the lower pole of the breast. A similar study is planned for patients who have undergone augmentation-mastopexy, and questions about the characteristics of the area of reduced sensibility will be expanded upon. The study will also include a larger sample in the cosmetic breast augmentation group, with longer follow-up.</p>
         <p>The patient group in this study was taken from 1 clinic, which therefore includes a select group of women who were considered acceptable candidates for surgery and agreed to the clinic policy of not placing extremely large implants. Patients with certain psychological characteristics that could have affected the outcome of the study were therefore naturally excluded. Furthermore, the study included only those patients who had e-mail and could answer a questionnaire sent through that method, thereby excluding a small group of patients, which could have also affected the final picture.</p>
         <p>The data on patients’ psychological health were obviously gleaned solely from postoperative patient reports; no psychometric measures were included, which was a shortcoming of the study. Furthermore, the use of a nonvalidated survey, rather than valid and reliable psychometric measures previously documented in the literature, was a shortcoming in our research. Ideally, there should have been a standardized evaluation of patients’ pre- and postoperative mental health, to help us gain a better understanding of the relationship between breast augmentation and depression. Additional studies, preferably multiclinic/center studies, are also needed to increase patient population to form a better picture of the QOL outcomes.</p>

         <title>Conclusions</title>
         <p>In our study—which included patients from a variety of ages, backgrounds, socioeconomic status categories, and education levels—breast augmentation was associated with an increased quality of life, including motivation to perform daily activities and overall satisfaction/self-perception. However, an important challenge for the surgeon is the relatively high percentage of patients who were dissatisfied with postoperative skin sensitivity on the breasts. Multicenter studies with standardized questions concerning mental health are needed to better specify the depression rate and its postoperative implications on a larger scale.</p>
