<p>The author Professor Dilip K. Chakrabarti is one of the senior Indian archaeologists and his contribution in the field of theoretical archaeology is well recognised. He has also been evincing keen interest in archaeological geography and written some important works in that special field using his rich field knowledge: <italic>Archaeological Geography of the Ganga Plain</italic>, 2001, <italic>The Archaeology of the Deccan Routes</italic>, 2005 and so on. Unlike the other works devoted primarily to archaeological problems, the present work confines to the historical times and sources. The main objective of this book is to trace the relations between geography and historical developments in Indian history during the ancient period, say from early first millennium BCE (the author calls it legendary beginnings) to 1300 CE. He points out that there were some major geopolitical orbits from the beginning and that a number of minor, regional orbits came up over the centuries and interacted with the major ones making networks over major parts of India. These major and minor orbits were always changing their range and sweep. The author tries to demonstrate the network of these orbits historically according to a broad periodisation.</p>
<p>The earliest clear orbits in linking Gandhara on the north-west to Magadha in the east are found in the time of the <italic>mahajanapada</italic>s, for which mainly literary evidence (Vedic, Puranic, Buddhist and Jain) is used. From the time of the Nandas and Mauryas more substantial geographical information is available from archaeology, inscriptions and Greek accounts, besides literature. By this time the large Oxus–Indus orbit coalesces with the equally large Gangetic orbit. During post-Mauryan times, from second century BCE to third century CE the Deccan orbit comes into prominence and interacts more with the Oxus–Indus orbit than with the Gangetic orbit. From the time of the imperial Guptas, the Gangetic orbit again gains importance. Subsequently, from the eighth century onwards, the several regional orbits emerge, leading to supra-regional orbits which linked the peninsular India with the northern parts.</p>
<p>The author has elsewhere criticised the earlier scholars like B. Subba Rao who conceptualised the existence of some perennial nuclear regions in contrast to areas of relative isolation and some unchanging hierarchy among those regions. He thinks that such concepts smacked of geographical determinism. Hence in this work the author wants to demonstrate that regions in Indian history had never any immutable historical shape or identity but were fluid both in their interactions and outlines. But the way he is referring repeatedly to several traditionally recognised regions like Malwa, Kosala, Vidarbha, Kalinga and so on throughout the periods under discussion would suggest that these geographical entities had some distinct immutable features and identity. This may be a mistaken impression, but the author has not tried to give his own definition of a region in explicit terms. Most of the time, he seems to be referring to just political regions.</p>
<p>The political regions would be always changing according to changes in the political formations of the day. From ancient to medieval times more and more states emerged in different parts of India and naturally the political geography could not remain the same even for shorter durations. But the book does not explain the geographical processes of this changing political geography; they are taken for granted. The problem with this book is that it summarises meticulously most of the time the dynastic histories as found in standard history books, like in the Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan Series on ‘History and Culture of the Indian People’, and concerns only with the changing political boundaries of the kingdoms. Except that these changes are described under the garb of ‘geopolitical orbits’, there is no explanation for the underlying geographical factors, though some passing mention is made of the economic resources here and there. He also talks about social and cultural factors on some occasions like in the treatment of the Oxus–Indus orbit during the time of the Kushanas (pp. 43–46). He does not question the statements made in earlier history books about the territorial extent of individual kingdoms, which are based on exaggerated eulogistic statements in inscriptions. Until the tenth century most of the states, with some rare exceptions, were small and confined to narrow geographical limits. If a ruler claimed to have won a battle against a distant king that does not mean that he controlled a wider area. That is the case of the Chalukyas of Badami and the Pallavas of Kanchi, who fought each other but controlled small nuclear areas, only if we go by the spread of their own inscriptional evidence. There was a vast expanse of land lying in between, which neither of the ruling family controlled or administered though their armies might have passed through that now and then. Such problems are not considered at all in this book. Strangely the author has ignored most of the historiographical developments since 1950s.</p>
<p>Had the author focused on one or two of his major orbits, say Gangetic orbit, he could have dealt with the geography part more deeply from his rich first-hand archaeological field experience and enlightened the readers on his basic thesis. Another weakness of this work is the absence of good maps. Except marking by dots a number of places, there is no indication of the orbits, the routes or the regions which are spoken of throughout the work. Without proper maps to guide us it is difficult to imagine the locations of the numerous regions and routes that are the staple of this work.</p>
