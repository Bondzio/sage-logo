<abstract>
<p>Most research on reporter practices examines coverage of contested topics. These require reporters to demonstrate objectivity by counterposing authoritative sources representing opposing sides. I examine news articles about a topic uncontested in the USA, female genital cutting (FGC), to complicate our understanding of how reporters do their job. In contrast to the literature, reporters strike a balance, including the ‘general public’ of FGC-practicing communities extensively. However, because the balance is confined to non-authoritative speakers ‘over there’, the balance nonetheless serves to stigmatize proponents. This research shows that the negative portrayal of members of FGC-practicing communities is due not only to their erasure in news coverage. Instead, whether standing translates into influence depends on context, something reporters can manipulate when there is consensus. Likewise, the separation of topics into contested and uncontested erases the ways in which controversy is not a characteristic of issues, but a function of reporter decisions.</p>

<body>
<p>In contemporary western culture, professional norms require reporters to appear objective (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1464884911431537">Baldasty, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1464884911431537">Soloski, 1989</xref>). They do so, in part, by balancing opposing positions and quoting and paraphrasing authoritative sources on both sides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1464884911431537">Tuchman, 1972</xref>). Not all reporting, however, requires objectivity. Reporters may only feel the need to be objective when an issue is seen as contested (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1464884911431537">Gamson et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1464884911431537">Gans, 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1464884911431537">Hallin, 1986</xref>). Yet little research specifically addresses the dynamics of reporting on uncontested topics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1464884911431537">Downey, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1464884911431537">McAdam et al., 2005</xref>). This is an interesting area of research because the findings may challenge our understanding of how reporters do their job and, therefore, teach us something about the social consequences of reporter practices.</p>
<p>I explore this type of reporting with an examination of US newspaper coverage of female genital cutting (FGC). FGC is practiced by ethnic groups in parts of Africa, the Middle East, and Asia. The practices include the pricking, cutting, or removal of the external genitals and, in about 15 percent of cases, the fusing of the anterior vulva leaving a (sometimes very) small opening for intercourse and elimination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1464884911431537">WHO, 1998</xref>). Also known as ‘female genital mutilation’, widely divergent interest groups – including doctors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1464884911431537">AMA, 1995</xref>), politicians (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1464884911431537">US Codes Annotated, 1996</xref>), intergovernmental agencies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1464884911431537">WHO, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1464884911431537">WHO/UNICEF/UNFPA, 1997</xref>), feminists (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1464884911431537">Equality Now, n.d.</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1464884911431537">VDay, n.d.</xref>), and journalists (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1464884911431537">James and Robertson, 2002</xref>; Shweder, 2002; Wade, forthcoming) – all agree that there is no reasonable rationale for FGCs. Accordingly, news coverage of FGCs is an excellent case with which to explore how reporters cover uncontested issues.</p>
<p>I analyze 58 news articles about FGCs and find that, in contrast to existing theory about news coverage of non-contested issues, when writing articles about FGCs, reporters do strike a balance. They contrast the opinions of proponents and opponents of FGCs ‘over there’. Instead of seeking out primarily authoritative speakers to articulate each side, however, reporters present the issue as a ‘cultural’ problem, extensively including the ‘general public’ of FGC-practicing communities. Both of these findings – the striking of a balance on an issue uncontested within the USA and the inclusion of a significant number of non-authoritative, usually invisible, and inconvenient sources – refine our existing understanding of who reporters include as sources and why.</p>
<p>Moreover, the inclusion of these sources does not necessarily translate into influence, as is often presumed. The additional presence of authoritative opponents serves to uphold the anti-FGC position as ‘objectively’ true. Insofar as there is a sphere of consensus around FGCs, those speakers that contest that consensus do not influence the discourse in their favor. Instead, they draw condemnation upon themselves. In the context of consensus, then, following the norms of the genre (i.e. performing objectivity) results in the delegitimation of counter-consensus speakers.</p>

<title>News coverage of contested issues</title>
<p>Many journalists understand that objectivity is epistemologically and practically elusive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1464884911431537">Cooper and Ebeling, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1464884911431537">Cottle, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1464884911431537">Hallin, 1986</xref>). In place of the paralyzing quagmire that a call to objectivity poses, the profession has adopted a series of ‘strategic rituals’ that are understood to result in an objective account: fairness and balance, the subjection of personal biases, and an effort to report accurately, even if the truth is elusive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1464884911431537">Tuchman, 1972</xref>: 660; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1464884911431537">Gitlin, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1464884911431537">Glasser, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1464884911431537">Hackett and Zhao, 1996</xref>).</p>
<p>This article focuses on one of these inter-related rituals, the balancing of (typically two) opposing positions so as to present ‘both’ sides of the story (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1464884911431537">Fishman, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1464884911431537">Hall et al., 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1464884911431537">Lichtenberg, 2000</xref>). As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1464884911431537">Ericson (1995</xref>: 152) explains:
<disp-quote>
<p>Objectivity consists of a point-counterpoint format: one source makes an allegation … the source subject to the allegation makes a counterpoint, and truth is held to reside somewhere in between.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Guided by this approach, the role of reporters is to ‘merely provide a vehicle’ for contests between these positions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1464884911431537">Glasser, 1992</xref>: 182).</p>
<p>Because reporters are also expected to avoid expressing personal opinions, each position must be attributed to a source or sources. Reporters typically rely on visible, influential, and convenient sources. Visible sources are recognized as spokespeople for interest groups and carriers of expertise (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1464884911431537">Ericson et al., 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1464884911431537">Ferree et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1464884911431537">Gans, 1979</xref>). Influential sources hold positions in important hierarchies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1464884911431537">Becker, 1967</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1464884911431537">Fishman, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1464884911431537">Hall et al., 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1464884911431537">Hallin, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1464884911431537">Molotch and Lester, 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1464884911431537">Schlesinger and Tumber, 1994</xref>). Visible and influential sources add an air of legitimacy to the reporting. Convenient sources help reporters cope with quick deadlines, the short shelf-life of news, and the need for routine information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1464884911431537">Ericson et al., 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1464884911431537">Gans, 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1464884911431537">Schlesinger and Tumber, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1464884911431537">Sigal, 1973</xref>).</p>
<p>This operationalization of objectivity as the balancing of authoritative sources has the consequence of offering those individuals who are already privileged the greatest opportunity to shape news coverage. By relying on sources culturally deemed authoritative, reporters tend to ‘… systematically echo the judgments and perspectives of the power elite’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1464884911431537">Schiller, 1981</xref>: 123; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1464884911431537">Becker, 1967</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1464884911431537">Ericson et al., 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1464884911431537">Hackett and Zhao, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1464884911431537">Hall et al., 1978</xref>). Describing early coverage of the Vietnam War, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1464884911431537">Hallin (1986</xref>: 25) writes:
<disp-quote>
<p>… most of the reporting, in the best tradition of objective journalism, ‘just gave the facts.’ But they were not just <italic>any</italic> facts. They were <italic>official</italic> facts, facts about what the president said and what ‘officials here believe.’ The effect of ‘objectivity’ was not to free the news of political influence, but to open wide the channel through which official influence flowed.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Furthermore, because reporters need to nurture positive ongoing relationships with sources, on whom they often rely tremendously, these sources can often exercise significant influence over what reporters say and how they say it (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1464884911431537">Schlesinger and Tumber, 1994</xref>). The outcome of performing objectivity by balancing authoritative sources, then, is an over-representation of powerful and privileged individuals as sources in news articles, relative to those who challenge or are marginalized by the status quo.</p>
<p>Marginalized and challenger groups do appear in the news, but typically as objects of pity or scorn. Afghan women, for example, were a frequent news topic during US military attacks after September 11, 2001, but coverage rarely included them as sources (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1464884911431537">Fowler, 2007</xref>). Likewise, relative to breast implant manufacturers, women with implants are usually included as objects of concern instead of agents negotiating their health care (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1464884911431537">Powers and Andsager, 1999</xref>). Similarly, mainstream news coverage of marginalized groups – such as the ‘rioters’ in the racially charged LA uprisings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1464884911431537">Jacobs, 1996</xref>), perpetrators of crime (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1464884911431537">Hall et al., 1978</xref>), or war protesters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1464884911431537">Gans, 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1464884911431537">Hackett and Zhao, 1994</xref>) – often portrays them as illegitimate. Critics of news coverage of FGCs make similar observations. They argue that reporters largely exclude the perspectives of people who practice FGCs, leaving them free to characterize them as ‘malicious torturers or hapless victims’, either suffering from false consciousness or themselves cruel perpetrators of the practices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1464884911431537">James and Robertson, 2002</xref>: 5; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1464884911431537">Nnaemeka, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>In sum, the prevailing wisdom about reporter practices suggests that reporters resolve the epistemological and practical difficulties of the requirement of objectivity in part by featuring authoritative sources who animate opposing claims with competing frames designed to define and control the contest. If reporters do this, they appear objective. Yet these practices tend to exclude the perspectives of those already marginalized in society in favor of already powerful individuals and institutions.</p>

<title>News coverage of non-contested issues</title>
<p>In one of the most important treatments of news coverage of non-contested issues, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1464884911431537">Hallin (1986)</xref> found that, when certain beliefs were ‘deeply held’ by reporters, politicians, and readers alike, reporters could assume or affirm these positions without appearing partial. Drawing on media coverage of the Vietnam War, he showed that support for the war was initially within this ‘sphere of consensus’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1464884911431537">1986</xref>: 25). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1464884911431537">Leavy (2007)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1464884911431537">Schudson (2002)</xref> show that this was also the case after the attacks on US buildings on September 11, 2001. Many reporters ‘placed 9/11 outside of the bounds of their professional objectivity and thus outside of democratic political discourse’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1464884911431537">Leavy, 2007</xref>: 91). News anchor Dan Rather publicly abdicated his watchdog role, stating: ‘George Bush is the President, he makes the decisions, and … as just one American, he wants me to line up, just tell me where’ (quoted in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1464884911431537">Leavy, 2007</xref>: 91). Syndicated columnist Ellen Goodman similarly expressed: ‘When terrorists struck on 11 September <italic>there was only one side</italic> … No one expected reporters to take an “objective” view of the terrorists’ (quoted in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1464884911431537">Schudson, 2002</xref>: 39, my emphasis). The sense that offering balance would have been inappropriate reveals the fact that sometimes balance and accuracy are not compatible. When an issue does not necessarily include two legitimate sides, offering balance by including a counterposition may seem like distortion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1464884911431537">Hackett, 1984</xref>).</p>
<p>Reporters covering US foreign policy, in fact, routinely leave out critics of American positions and policies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1464884911431537">Hackett, 1984</xref>). They can exclude the ‘other side’ because allegiance to one’s country is an ‘enduring value.’ Enduring values, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1464884911431537">Gans (1979</xref>: 197) writes, are ‘those of journalism rather than of journalists’. Affirming these values in newsprint, then, is not equivalent to journalists expressing their own opinions. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1464884911431537">Gans (1979</xref>: 42–52) and others have identified many such ideologies, including values held by the middle class, the keeping of order, capitalism, individualism, and altruistic democracy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1464884911431537">Campbell, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1464884911431537">Schudson, 2003</xref>). Because these are all well within the sphere of consensus, when covering these topics and taking these positions ‘… the reporter’s role is to serve as an advocate or celebrant of consensus values’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1464884911431537">Hallin, 1986</xref>: 117).</p>
<p>It is the ability to tap into these consensus values that allows investigative journalists to write articles in which ‘the fiercest of indignation [is] fused with the hardest of fact’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1464884911431537">Ettema and Glasser, 1998</xref>: 10). Not as tightly subjected to norms of objectivity as other reporters, investigative reporters nevertheless pride themselves on remaining objective. They do so by invoking widely held beliefs about right and wrong and contrasting them with robustly researched and deftly arranged evidence showing that important figures or systems are violating community standards. Often refraining from explicitly arguing that they have identified a moral breach, to incite a response they use ironic contrasts between what (supposedly) should be and what is. Investigative reporters, then, insist that the values they invoke are not <italic>their</italic> values, but universal ones.</p>
<p>The same can be said of scandals, both those of the kind of interest to investigative reporters (e.g. the ‘serious’ scandals involving politics and economics) and those seen as driven by prurient interest (e.g. the ‘trivial’ scandals of love triangles and celebrity drug habits) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1464884911431537">Adut, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1464884911431537">Thompson, 2000</xref>). Scandals function, in part, to rally observers around a value that is being publicly and collectively celebrated. They hold individuals accountable ‘to an imagined, idealized standard of social conduct’, thereby affirming that value as good and true (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1464884911431537">Lull and Hinerman, 1997</xref>: 5).</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1464884911431537">Gans (1979)</xref> notes that news reporting on consensus issues also often functions to uphold hegemonic values. Yet, while the role of consensus in enabling scandal and investigative reporting has been well studied, the role of consensus in the work of reporters pressing out daily newsprint remains largely unexamined (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1464884911431537">Downey, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1464884911431537">McAdam et al., 2005</xref>). This is an important oversight, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1464884911431537">Hallin (1986</xref>: 150) argues that topics that call for objectivity and those that do not make for ‘… two entirely different kinds of journalism’. Examining news coverage of non-contested issues, then, promises to inform our current understanding of reporter practices.</p>

<title>Sample</title>
<p>US news coverage of FGCs began in earnest in 1992 in response to the publication of Alice Walker’s novel, <italic>Possessing the Secret of Joy</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1464884911431537">Boyle, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1464884911431537">Boyle and Hoeschen, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1464884911431537">James and Robertson, 2002</xref>). Between 1992 and 1996, FGCs became a widely recognized social problem. By 1996 opposition to the practices was near universal in the USA. That year the US government changed asylum law in response to the practices, passed a federal law criminalizing them, and instituted FGC-related transnational economic sanctions. Subsequently, news coverage declined (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1464884911431537">Boyle and Hoeschen, 2001</xref>). This five-year period was chosen for analysis, then, because it is during this time that US newspaper readers were most likely to encounter information and opinions about FGCs.</p>
<p>To get a sample of influential newspaper discourse about FGCs between 1992 and 1996, I chose six high-circulation US newspapers with archives available in full text (to avoid a disproportionate focus on one location, the <italic>New York Times</italic> was included, but other New York-based newspapers were excluded). Archives were searched for the three most common terms for FGCs: ‘(female) genital mutilation’, ‘female circumcision’, and ‘female genital cutting’. Excluding news briefs and summaries, a random selection of 75 percent of the news articles in each newspaper was drawn from those that mentioned FGCs in the headline or first two paragraphs. Two of the articles sampled were borrowed from the Associated Press and appeared twice. In one additional instance, an article originally published in the <italic>New York Times</italic> was syndicated in a second newspaper. Since being published in multiple papers multiplies the impact of an article, each of these were counted twice. The sample, then, consists of 58 (55 unique) news articles published in the <italic>Houston Chronicle</italic> (<italic>HC</italic>) (<italic>n</italic> = 12), the <italic>Los Angeles Times</italic> (LAT) (<italic>n</italic> = 14), the <italic>New York Times</italic> (<italic>NYT</italic>) (<italic>n</italic> = 19), the <italic>San Francisco Chronicle</italic> (<italic>SFC</italic>) (<italic>n</italic> = 1), <italic>USA Today</italic> (<italic>USAT</italic>) (<italic>n</italic> = 4), and the <italic>Washington Post</italic> (<italic>WP</italic>) (<italic>n</italic> = 8).</p>

<sec id="section5-1464884911431537">
<title>Operationalization</title>
<p>Articles were examined for whether reporters follow the rituals of objectivity. Text was coded for who was given standing (by role and origin), balance (sources’ position on FGCs), and framing of FGCs.</p>
<p><italic>Sources</italic>: Each sentence was coded for the origin of the speaker (emic- or etic-origin) and their affiliation, if any.</p>
<p>Speakers were coded as <italic>emic-origin</italic> sources when they were born into and grew up in a community that practiced FGCs. Speakers were coded as <italic>etic-origin</italic> sources when they were born into and grew up in the USA or another non-practicing country. Nearly all of the etic-origin speakers live in the USA and some emic-origin speakers had migrated to non-practicing countries.</p>
<p>Sources were categorized as affiliated or non-affiliated. <italic>Non-affiliated</italic> sources were members of the general public not identified by the reporter as representing any particular occupation or organization. <italic>Affiliated</italic> sources were people who represented an organization or occupation. These included academics, activists, government officials, health professionals, lawyers and judges, religious leaders, and representatives of the United Nations (UN). Speakers were coded as <italic>activists</italic> when they were identified as belonging to or representing a particular social movement organization. Sentences were attributed to academics, lawyers/judges, religious leaders, or health professionals when the speakers were identified accordingly. Government officials include politicians, government representatives, and appointees such as immigration officials. Because the UN, specifically the World Health Organization (WHO), has been involved in transnational anti-FGC efforts, I coded UN/WHO representatives separately. If a reporter specifies that a speaker is in more than one category (e.g. a feminist doctor), that speaker’s sentences are coded as both (<italic>n</italic> = 6).</p>
<p>Reporters routinely described the background of speakers on the premise that their experience or expertise was significant in the context of an article about FGCs. In these cases, the majority, discerning a speaker’s role or origin was simple. If the reporter did not specify these details, I could often rely on my familiarity with figures mobilizing around FGCs; in other cases, I searched the internet for biographies. In cases in which information could not be confirmed, the sentence was excluded from analysis (<italic>n</italic> = 4).</p>
<p><italic>Balance</italic>: To measure balance, speakers were coded for whether they were in favor of, against, or neutral as to the continuation of FGCs. These speakers are identified as <italic>proponents, opponents</italic>, and <italic>other</italic> respectively.</p>
<p><italic>Framing</italic>: Simply being given standing does not, in itself, translate into influencing public understanding of an issue. A source’s comment must directly engage with the meaning of the practices by offering a frame (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1464884911431537">Benford and Snow, 2000</xref>). Using a grounded approach, I allowed frames for FGCs to emerge from the data. I read articles, identified frames, coded, re-read, and re-coded until I had exhausted the range of frames. Nine frames for FGCs occurred in at least 10 of the 58 articles.</p>
<p>The <italic>cultural tradition</italic> frame emerges primarily through words that are essentially synonyms for culture or tradition (e.g. ‘ritual’ and ‘custom’), descriptions of the practice as socially normative, and the identification of the practices with certain places or communities. If the tradition was identified as religious, I coded the sentence as an instance of the <italic>religious tradition</italic> frame.</p>
<p>The <italic>physical harm</italic> frame includes language that suggests that FGCs are harmful to physical health. This includes the description of short- and long-term health problems, obstetric problems, sexual dysfunction, and death. The <italic>psychological harm</italic> frame defines FGCs as a source of mental anguish. This includes references to FGCs as the cause of psychological, mental, or emotional ‘harm’, ‘trauma’, or ‘problems’.</p>
<p>The <italic>control of women</italic> frame defines FGCs as gendered subordination. Sometimes FGCs were described as a way to control women through the reduction of her sexual pleasure or activity specifically (when sexual problems are medicalized instead of moralized – e.g. ‘sexual dysfunction’ – the language is coded as the physical harm frame). The <italic>child abuse</italic> frame identifies FGCs as victimizing children. This includes descriptions of FGCs as ‘child abuse’ and calls to protect children. Unlike the control of women and child abuse frames, which make gender and age salient, the <italic>human rights violation</italic> frame identifies FGCs as an affront to humanity. I coded references to ‘rights’ and ‘human rights’ (but not ‘women’s rights’) as an instance of this frame.</p>
<p>Finally, sources using the <italic>marriageability</italic> frame argue that genital cutting is required to make women eligible for marriage.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1464884911431537">
<title>Strategy for analysis</title>
<p>The next section explores whether reporters writing about FGCs follow professional conventions by offering standing primarily to authoritative speakers and balancing opposing sides offering contrasting frames. This means examining whom reporters choose to include, what ‘sides’ to the issue are presented, and the impact of framing efforts in context.</p>
<p>Following <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1464884911431537">Ferree et al. (2002)</xref>, the analytical focus is on standing. Standing means not only being included as a source, but adding framing. I exclude from analysis sentences that do not include framing, but serve as connective tissue in the article or are descriptions of other things. Of the 2,506 sentences printed in the 58 articles under analysis, 718 include framing. Six could not be coded on critical variables (source or position on FGC) and are excluded. Analysis, then, includes the 712 sentences that remained. Hereafter, ‘sentences’ refers only to sentences with framing.</p>
<p>Both the sentence and the article are used as units of analysis. Sentence-level analysis is sensitive to the repetition of ideas and sources within a document. Article-level data reveals whether data is overly influenced by individual articles.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-1464884911431537">
<title>Findings</title>
<p>In the sub-sections that follow, I show how professional norms of objectivity intersect with consensus. I examine who is given standing in news articles about FGCs, whether reporters balance opinions on the practices (and what balance they strike), how they are framed (and by who), and the qualitative consequences of this particular constellation of sources, opinions, and ideas about FGCs.</p>
<sec id="section8-1464884911431537">
<title>Standing</title>
<p>Existing theory predicts that reporters would turn to the activists, health professionals, and representatives of international agencies that drove anti-FGC organizing. In fact, reporters do turn to some of these sources. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1464884911431537">Table 1</xref> shows that activists and health professionals are the most frequently included sources (18 and 15% of sentences each). Lawyers and judges are also included quite frequently (11% of sentences); several high-profile legal cases are tried during this time. Representatives of international agencies, such as WHO, however, account for only 4 percent of sentences. Other authoritative sources also appear infrequently.</p>

<p>Interestingly, all affiliated sources together account for 58 percent of sentences. Reporters, then, also include a substantial number of individuals meant to represent your ‘average’ person.

Despite the fact that emic-origin speakers are usually geographically, linguistically, and culturally inconvenient to reporters and, arguably, less authoritative than etic-origin speakers in an American context, nearly half of all sentences are attributed to emic-origin speakers. They account for 47 percent of all sentences and are included in half of articles. Moreover, most of these speakers are non-authoritative. Non-affiliated emic-origin speakers appear almost seven times more often than affiliated speakers and are included in 27, as opposed to eight, of the 58 articles. Considering all sources, non-affiliated, emic-origin speakers – the ‘general public’ of FGC-practicing communities – account for 42 percent of all sentences.</p>

<p>In sum, nearly half of sentences in these articles are attributed to individuals who have no special importance or influence, are not highly visible, and are not convenient to the reporter. In stark contrast to the existing literature on sources, as well as the literature criticizing media coverage of FGCs, reporters interview difficult-to-find sources with no particular expertise or authority save their membership in FGC-practicing communities.</p>
<p>These findings suggest that reporters writing on topics within the sphere of consensus do not necessarily rely on the same set of sources as reporters who are reporting on controversial issues. It also suggests that reporters writing about such issues do not use sources for the same purpose. Instead of seeking out an evaluation of FGCs from a person with recognized expertise, these reporters sought out individuals who could articulate common cultural beliefs about cutting. With this in mind, I look at the content of source sentences: their position on and frames for FGCs.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-1464884911431537">
<title>Balance</title>
<p>Surprisingly, despite writing about an issue on which most Americans agree, reporters choose to strike a balance. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1464884911431537">Table 3</xref> reveals that, when including emic-origin sources, reporters quote and paraphrase both opponents and supporters of FGCs. Thirty-eight percent of sentences attributed to emic-origin sources are in opposition to FGCs, while 62 percent support them. Likewise, emic-origin, affiliated speakers are quoted or paraphrased both supporting and opposing FGCs (eight sentences are in opposition; 12 sentences are in support).</p>

<p>All affiliated etic-origin speakers, however, are quoted or paraphrased in opposition to FGC (no non-affiliated sources are included offering a frame). All etic-origin speakers, then, and nearly all affiliated speakers, are in opposition to FGCs. Proponents of the practice are almost exclusively non-affiliated, emic-origin speakers and reporters do not include any etic-origin speakers who are in favor of (or uncertain about) the practices.</p>
<p>Importantly, while balancing opposing positions is typically understood to place an issue within the ‘sphere of legitimate controversy’, that is not the effect here. Reporters do not or cannot marshal up authoritative sources to defend each side. Instead, on one side are members of FGC-practicing communities who support FGCs and on the other side are otherwise similar men and women who oppose the practices plus all of the highly authoritative US speakers: largely doctors, activists, and lawyers.</p>

</table-wrap>
<p>The table shows that reporters and opponents of FGCs most frequently use the cultural tradition, physical harm, and control of women frames to condemn the practices (in 43, 41, and 21% of reporter sentences, respectively; and in 30, 40, and 22% of opponent sentences). Both reporters and sources who oppose FGCs, then, frame the practices as a physically harmful cultural tradition designed to oppress women. This framing was aligned with contemporaneous transnational FGC eradication efforts.</p>
<p>Proponent framing both confirms and challenges this narrative. First, proponents agree that FGCs are a cultural tradition (in 33% of sentences), affirming for opponents and readers that the practices are culturally mandated. They also echo reporters and opponents in framing FGCs as a mechanism for controlling women (in 37% of sentences). However, instead of using the frame to condemn the practices, they use it to defend them. FGCs, they argue, decrease women’s sexual pleasure and desire and, more generally, make women more submissive to husbands and fathers. For proponents, these are positive outcomes. Proponents also use the physical harm frame, but they use it much less frequently than other speakers (in 7% of sentences) and, when they use it, they do so to deny that the practices cause harm, to assert a health benefit, or to affirm their support in spite of acknowledged harmful health consequences.</p>
<p>Although the standing offered to proponents theoretically offers them an opportunity to shape public perceptions of FGCs, this was not the effect here. All three frames, when articulated by proponents, serve only to invalidate their support for the practices and stigmatize their group.</p>
<p>First, when proponents of FGCs agree that the aim is to control women, they validate opposition to the practices by affirming the frame on which opposition is built. Their language, then, does not call into question the condemnation of FGCs (their goal), but draws that condemnation upon supporters themselves. For example, a man explains his support for FGCs: ‘If a woman is more passive it is in her interest … her father’s interest and in her husband’s interest’ (<italic>NYT</italic>, 8 August 1996); ‘A woman’s role in life is to care for her children, keep house and cook’, a circumciser is paraphrased explaining, ‘If she has not been cut … a woman might think instead about her own sexual pleasure’ (<italic>NYT</italic>, 5 October 1996). Other proponents are also quoted emphasizing the importance of decreasing women’s sexual desire and behavior. A father explains: ‘If you don’t cut this part, she will be a harlot’ (<italic>HC</italic>, 7 July 1996). Another proponent asks: ‘In the morning, leaving your apartment, would you leave your door open or locked? A woman is not a door, but she’s property to someone’ (<italic>LAT</italic>, 12 March 1995).</p>
<p>If a reader is opposed to FGCs on the basis that they are oppressive to women, then these statements are likely to enhance readers’ confidence in their condemnation of the practices, not call it into question as the speakers intend. That is, when proponents are quoted explaining their support for FGCs with the same frame with which opponents condemn it, proponents validate opponents (i.e. the opponents are ‘right’ that FGCs are oppressive to women). Assuming the reader is ideologically aligned with opponents, doing so also invalidates any authority supporters may have derived from being given standing.</p>
<p>Second, proponents undermine their effort to articulate a pro-FGC argument when they use the physical harm frame. Proponents’ apparent ignorance about, rejection of, or disregard for potential harm all contribute to their de-authorization. Both reporters and opponent sources frequently use the physical harm frame and health professionals account for 15 percent of all sentences. In this context, when proponents deny that FGCs are physically harmful or fatal, they sound as if they are in denial, ignorant, or irrational. For example, one supporter shrugs when asked why some girls die and is paraphrased saying: ‘Girls who bleed modestly from their genital wounds are known to be virgins … while those who bleed profusely are not’ (<italic>NYT</italic>, 11 September 1996). In another article, a proponent is quoted saying ‘It’s easier to give birth if you’re excised … There are no lips to close the opening of the vagina’ (<italic>NYT</italic>, 5 October 1996). The reporters call this ‘a bit of folklore’ and an ‘old wives’ tale’ respectively, encouraging the reader to dismiss their rationale.</p>
<p>Proponents’ perspectives come across as illegitimate in context whether they acknowledge or deny the potential harmful consequences of FGCs. In two articles addressing the reactions of families after their daughters died from complications of genital cutting, parents’ refusal to attribute the death to FGCs makes them appear delusional to people within the sphere of consensus. In one a father asserts: ‘There are some girls who die after being excised, it is true,’ he said. ‘But to me it’s not the excision that caused the death’ (<italic>NYT</italic>, 11 September 1996). The reporter continues: ‘Asked why some girls die, he spread his hands and shrugged.’ Some proponents admit that the practices are harmful, but endorse them anyway. A man explains that, in his experience, sex with a woman without cutting is ‘happy, joyous’, but sex with a woman who has been cut is ‘difficult … dry’ (<italic>NYT</italic>, 5 October 1996). Nonetheless, the reporter explains, ‘he believes the cutting is a duty [and that] his daughters must endure the rite courageously …’ In other cases, women recount the FGC-related health problems they have endured, but insist on a form of FGC for their own daughters (<italic>NYT</italic>, 28 December 1996). These comments either stand in conflict with the framing of FGCs as physically harmful or accept it alongside an endorsement of the practices. In addition to sounding misogynistic, then, proponents sound irrational or cruel.</p>
<p>Finally, framing the practices as specifically cultural also contributes to the de-authorization of supporters. Reporters quote proponents explaining their helplessness in the face of cultural support for genital cutting. A man explains: ‘Our mothers, our grandmothers, our aunts all had this … We must do it’ (<italic>HC</italic>, 2 June 1995); a father says: ‘Our forefathers started this, so we can’t banish it’ (<italic>NYT</italic>, 11 September 1996); a brother who watched his sister suffer is quoted saying: ‘Maybe in the next two or three generations, things will change’ (<italic>WP</italic>, 22 November 1992).</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1464884911431537">Volpp (2000</xref>: 115) argues that framing a problematic practice as ‘cultural’ serves to demonize homogenized groups of others, while simultaneously ‘extraterritorializing’ problematic behaviors and conditions. For example, honor killings that occur outside the USA are frequently framed as cultural, but spousal murder in the USA is seen as a function of disturbed individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1464884911431537">Narayan, 1997</xref>). The use of the cultural tradition frame by proponents affirms the idea that FGCs are not an individual problem restricted to ignorant or misogynistic people, nor a measure of human failing unrestricted to a particular group. Instead, when proponents use the cultural tradition frame alongside reporters and opponents, they support the idea that ignorance and misogyny are culture specific: solidly ‘over there’ in another, often undifferentiated ‘African’, culture.</p>
<p>In this context, proponents’ defense of the practices as cultural affirms either a willful resistance to change or helplessness in the face of social pressure. Indeed, one reporter writes that the custom is ‘deeply ingrained’, ‘embedded’, and ‘potent’ (<italic>NYT</italic>, 8 August 1996). Proponents are described as putting up ‘stiff resistance’ and ‘defiance’ (<italic>WP</italic>, 24 November 1996; <italic>NYT</italic>, 8 August 1996), and ‘follow[ing] the tradition blindly’ (<italic>HC</italic>, 2 June 1995; <italic>HC</italic>, 2 September 1995).</p>
<p>In sum, because proponents are defending FGCs in a context that strongly supports opponents, their speech does not effectively challenge opponents’ frames. Proponent endorsement of the control of women frame makes them advocates of injustice; both their neglect of the ‘fact’ that FGCs are harmful and an acknowledgement of it positions proponents as ignorant or irrational; and their insistence on the cultural importance of FGCs only serves to further entrench the condemnation of FGC-practicing groups. The inclusion of proponents, then, does not translate into an authoritative re-framing of FGCs, as we typically assume sources with standing have the power to do. Because the practice is considered objectively bad, whether they contest existing frames or affirm them, proponents of the practice contribute to their own de-authorization. Their words, in contrast to their intentions, lend credibility to the arguments of those opposed to FGCs and deepen the discriminatory tone of the discourse.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>Media scholars have shown that reporters perform objectivity in part by counterposing the comments of sources representing opposing sides of an issue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1464884911431537">Ericson, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1464884911431537">Fishman, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1464884911431537">Glasser, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1464884911431537">Hall et al., 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1464884911431537">Lichtenberg, 2000</xref>). These sources, more often than not, are visible, authoritative, and/or convenient to the reporter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1464884911431537">Becker, 1967</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1464884911431537">Ericson et al., 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1464884911431537">Gans, 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1464884911431537">Molotch and Lester, 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1464884911431537">Schlesinger and Tumber, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1464884911431537">Sigal, 1973</xref>). I examine news articles about an uncontested issue, female genital cutting, in order to bolster our understanding of how reporters do their job. I find that reporters included a surprising number of speakers who were not visible, authoritative, or convenient and offered a balance on this uncontested topic. However, neither the balance nor the inclusion of counter-consensus voices translated into an influential contribution to the discourse. These findings are relevant both to scholars interested in US media coverage of FGCs and to scholars interested in journalist practices more generally. I now discuss the contributions.</p>
<p>To begin, these findings confirm <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1464884911431537">Hallin’s (1986)</xref> argument that issues in the media can be presented as either uncontested and apolitical (e.g. capitalism) or contested and, therefore, political (e.g. abortion). But they also complicate the typology in that FGCs were presented as simultaneously controversial (‘there’) and uncontroversial (‘here’). This suggests that issues are not always simply ‘in’ the sphere of consensus or the sphere of legitimate controversy. Instead, reporters must decide whether to strike a balance, what kind of balance to strike, who to include as representatives of each side, and how to contextualize that balance. Examining how reporters make these decisions, and their effects, may be a useful way to further complicate our understanding of the function of balance in news reporting.</p>
<p>In my case balance did not function the way that theorists predict. My findings suggest that, when a balance is struck in the context of consensus, those who take up a counter-consensus position articulate a position that is made to delegitimate them. The disconnect – ‘their’ inability to see what is obvious to ‘us’ – creates a context in which proponents’ words serve to invalidate their position. Presenting FGCs as controversial ‘there’ and uncontroversial ‘here’, in other words, serves as a mechanism for denigrating the ‘other’ and affirming the self, even as the reporter performs objectivity.</p>
<p>This finding resonates with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1464884911431537">Ettema and Glasser’s (1994</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1464884911431537">1998</xref>) discussions of investigative reporting and irony. Journalists use ironic gaps between what is and what (people agree) should be in order to inspire outrage without deviating from the rules of objectivity. In line with this observation, news coverage of FGCs was stigmatizing not because reporters consistently condemned the practices overtly, but because they counterposed widely held US values and beliefs with the ideas and actions of proponents of genital cutting. If FGCs are <italic>objectively</italic> bad, then the fact that proponents will not or cannot admit as much is <italic>objectively</italic> outraging.</p>
<p>In order to create this ironic contrast, reporters sought out ‘average’ people in or from communities that practice FGCs and counterposed their support for FGCs with authoritative opponents. Being included as a source in news articles, then, did not translate into discursive influence. Insofar as FGCs were within the sphere of consensus, the pro-FGC position was invalid and proponent frames, whether aligned with opponent frames or not, could only affirm the anti-FGC position. The balance was not objective, but voyeuristic, encouraging the reader to assume a sense of distanced outrage and moral superiority. More, exactly because the sources were not authoritative or convenient, reporters were freed of the need to represent them in ways that would ensure ongoing access. Non-authoritative sources, then, do not have the power that authoritative sources have to pressure reporters to represent them in ways they approve (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1464884911431537">Schlesinger and Tumber, 1994</xref>).</p>
<p>While students of the media coverage of FGCs know very well that US discourse about FGCs is stigmatizing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1464884911431537">James and Robertson, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1464884911431537">Nnaemeka, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1464884911431537">Wade, 2009</xref>, forthcoming), these findings shed light on one <italic>mechanism</italic> by which defamation occurs. While others have argued that proponents of FGCs appear in news articles primarily as objects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1464884911431537">Korieh, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1464884911431537">Mekuria, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1464884911431537">Shweder, 2000</xref>), in these articles proponents of FGCs were not excluded from active participation. Instead, reporters carefully contextualized their perspectives to ensure that they drew condemnation on themselves.</p>
<p>Importantly, it was this careful contextualization, not just the inclusion of counter-consensus voices, that contributed to the denigration of proponents of FGCs. First, by largely leaving out the voices of emic-origin anti-FGC activists, an authoritative source from ‘over there’, reporters made invisible the fact that there is a long history of indigenous anti-FGC activism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1464884911431537">Abusharaf, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1464884911431537">James and Robertson, 2002</xref>). ‘The women and men of the societies in which circumcision is now practiced,’ explains anthropologist Ellen <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1464884911431537">Gruenbaum (2001</xref>: 32), ‘are arguing this issue out for themselves … and their ideas are as diverse and varied as the political discourse on women’s issues is anywhere.’ Members of these communities are far from helplessly subject to their culture.</p>
<p>Second, by emphasizing the culture frame, reporters enabled an ‘extraterritorialization’ of genital cutting that makes the condemnation of ‘their’ genital cutting easy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1464884911431537">Volpp, 2000</xref>: 115; Wade, forthcoming). Types of genital cutting that occur in the USA – surgeries on the genitals of children born with ambiguous genitalia, cosmetic surgeries on women’s genitals, and male circumcision – are excluded from the conversation when genital cutting is framed as something that happens ‘over there’. The control of women frame further differentiates FGCs from the most common genital cutting practice in the USA, male circumcision. Male circumcision has some things in common with FGCs – it is a procedure that is often performed outside of a hospital setting, has at least some risk of physical harm, and is done to non-consenting infants for cultural/religious reasons – and comparing the practices might help Americans better understand the motivations of proponents of FGCs. The cultural and control of women frames, however, discourage these kinds of comparisons and, accordingly, that kind of self-reflection.</p>
<p>In conclusion, while the professional tools of reporters are well understood, the implications of those tools are less so. In this case, the application of a routine practice (balance), designed to enhance objectivity, translated into news articles that contributed to the negative stereotyping of a marginalized population. This stigmatization, importantly, did not occur through straightforward denigration alone, nor through silencing, but by following standard journalistic procedures in a non-standard context.</p>
