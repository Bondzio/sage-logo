<title>Introduction</title>
<p>During its 2013-2014 Term, the U.S. Supreme Court will consider the constitutionality of Proposal 2, a ballot measure that amended Michigan’s state constitution to ban the consideration of race as a factor in admissions at public postsecondary institutions. In <italic>Schuette v. Coalition to Defend Affirmative Action et al.</italic> (No. 12-682), the Court will be reviewing a lower court opinion from the Sixth Circuit, which struck down Proposal 2 as unconstitutional on the grounds that it violated the equal protection clause of the 14th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0895904813490067"><italic>Coalition to Defend Affirmative Action by Any Means Necessary et al. v. Regents of the University of Michigan et al.</italic> and <italic>Chase Cantrell et al. v. Regents of the University of Michigan et al</italic>., 2012</xref>; hereafter <italic>Cantrell</italic>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0895904813490067">1</xref></sup> That ruling differs from two decisions by the Ninth Circuit, which upheld the constitutionality of Proposition 209, a similar ban on affirmative action in California (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0895904813490067"><italic>Coalition for Economic Equity v. Wilson</italic>, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0895904813490067"><italic>Coalition to Defend Affirmative Action v. Brown</italic>, 2012</xref>; hereafter <italic>Wilson</italic>/<italic>Brown</italic>). The Court’s ruling in <italic>Schuette</italic> will resolve the divide between the two circuits and will have broad implications for educators who seek to further diversity in higher education.</p>
<p>In other cases that have examined the constitutionality of race-conscious policies in education, the Court has used social science research to inform its conclusions, doing so most famously in its landmark opinion in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0895904813490067"><italic>Brown v. Board of Education</italic> (1954)</xref>, and more recently in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0895904813490067"><italic>Grutter v. Bollinger</italic> (2003)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0895904813490067"><italic>Parents Involved in Community Schools v. Seattle School District No. 1</italic> (2007)</xref>.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0895904813490067">2</xref></sup> In <italic>Fisher v. University of Texas</italic>, an education case currently before the Court that examines the constitutionality of a race-conscious admissions policy at the University of Texas at Austin (a decision is expected by June 2013), numerous friend-of-the-court, or amicus curiae, briefs presented social science research findings relevant to the legal determinations. In sharp contrast to the ample social science evidence that was submitted in earlier cases, little social science evidence has been presented to inform the legal analyses in challenges to bans on affirmative action, including <italic>Schuette</italic>. This is not surprising as <italic>Schuette</italic> involves a substantially different legal framework for assessing the constitutionality of the law than the legal tests involved in cases like <italic>Grutter</italic> and <italic>Parents Involved</italic>.</p>
<p>Social science researchers need to be responsive to legal questions that emerge in cases related to bans on affirmative action, as these cases have broad implications for educators. Therefore, in this article I outline the legal questions that have emerged in this area of litigation and identify social science research that may help provide answers to these questions, thereby informing the outcome in <italic>Schuette</italic> and future litigation. The timing of <italic>Schuette</italic>, which will be heard during the 2013-2014 term,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0895904813490067">3</xref></sup> gives the research community an opportunity to become more familiar with the legal tests in this case so they can share study findings that could inform the Court’s determinations. Having a deeper understanding of the legal questions in <italic>Schuette</italic> will help researchers identify studies that can inform similar questions in future cases, including those that may arise after the case is decided. For educators who want to be responsive to how court decisions shape educational practice, this analysis should help enhance the relevance of research to legal determinations.</p>
<p>Before I turn to the main analysis, I must acknowledge that the question of whether social science research <italic>should</italic> inform legal decision making is open to debate. On one hand, some scholars and judges argue that constitutional interpretation should be grounded in social realities that social science research can help establish. This view is particularly important to social issues related to race and equity. On the other hand, some scholars have criticized the role social science findings play in constitutional interpretation for a number of reasons, including the fact that evidence can be selectively introduced (or relied on) to support an ideological position, that judges are not necessarily trained to assess the methodological strengths or weaknesses of a study and that research findings may change as methodologies develop (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0895904813490067">Ancheta, 2005</xref>). Critics thus argue that legal theory should drive constitutional interpretation, not empirical evidence that may shift over time.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, a number of prominent U.S. Supreme Court decisions have drawn on social science research to support their conclusions; these decisions subsequently have shaped educational practice. In light of this practical consequence, we should consider the ways social science research can continue to influence legal developments. I argue that, in order to have such influence, social science research must be relevant to the legal framework of a case and the research findings should help judges resolve the dispute at hand. This will require researchers to design studies that can inform legal questions within these frameworks and to collaborate with the legal community in communicating findings to relevant audiences. Although the case I discuss here is in the area of higher education, the broader lessons and implications I draw from the analysis apply to researchers and educators across the K-12 and higher education sectors.</p>
<p>I will first summarize the literature within which I situate this analysis and then outline the legal tests that have been used in education cases since <italic>Grutter</italic>, the legal questions in <italic>Cantrell</italic> (the challenge to Michigan’s affirmative action ban) and <italic>Wilson</italic>/<italic>Brown</italic> (the challenge to California’s affirmative action ban), and accordingly in <italic>Schuette.</italic> I conclude with implications for researchers who seek to inform legal developments in this area.</p>

<title>Factors That Influence the Consideration of Social Science Evidence in Legal Cases</title>
<p>The way social science evidence is presented in legal cases varies, depending on the stage of litigation. The evidence can be presented as expert testimony at a trial or in district court, or in legal briefs at the appellate level. These briefs can be filed by the main parties in the case or by individuals or organizations that are not direct parties but have an interest in the outcome of the case. The latter, friend-of-the-court briefs, are one method through which social science evidence has been presented to the Court in cases like <italic>Brown, Grutter, Gratz</italic>, and <italic>Parents Involved</italic>. The studies included in these briefs span a range of methods (qualitative, quantitative, historical, etc.). A vast literature has accumulated on the utility and impact these briefs have in judicial decision-making (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0895904813490067">Kearney &amp; Merrill, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0895904813490067">Rustad &amp; Koenig, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0895904813490067">Segal, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0895904813490067">Songer &amp; Sheehan, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0895904813490067">Spriggs &amp; Wahlbeck, 1997</xref>). Some studies find that these briefs have little or marginal impact (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0895904813490067">Collins, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0895904813490067">Songer &amp; Sheehan, 1993</xref>), whereas others find they do have some influence when they reinforce the arguments in the main parties’ briefs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0895904813490067">Spriggs &amp; Wahlbeck, 1997</xref>) or when they are filed by experienced litigators or by the solicitor general, who represents the United States before the Supreme Court (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0895904813490067">Kearney &amp; Merrill, 2000</xref>). The literature focuses on one key factor in maximizing the influence of social science evidence in legal opinions: the medium through which information is presented in legal cases. For the purpose of this analysis, however, I pay close attention to the substance of the legal questions that are raised in a case and to whether social science research can inform the legal determinations, rather than to the medium used to present the evidence.</p>
<sec id="section3-0895904813490067">
<title>Whether the Legal Determination Involves a Finding of Fact or Finding of Law</title>
<p>Most studies that explore the role of social science research in legal developments agree that social science evidence has come to play an influential, if limited, role in judicial decision making. Although studies outline numerous factors that influence the consideration of social science evidence in legal cases, the main distinction drawn in the literature concerns whether the legal question at hand requires a “finding of fact” (e.g., the racial composition of the student body) or a “finding of law” (e.g., whether institutions have a “compelling interest” in student body diversity). In their recent analysis of social science research and the courts, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0895904813490067">Morgan and Pullin (2010</xref>, citing Monahan &amp; Walker, 2007) refer to this distinction as an “adjudicate” (fact-finding) versus a “legislative” (constitutional interpretation) question. Most studies agree that social science research can influence the former more than the latter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0895904813490067">Dunn &amp; West, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0895904813490067">Ryan, 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>A related line of analysis draws a similar distinction, which shows that social science research has also influenced questions of constitutional interpretation. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0895904813490067">Ancheta (2006)</xref>, for example, provides a thorough overview of constitutional cases that involve the equal protection clause of the 14th Amendment, such as those regarding desegregation, reproductive rights, and sexual orientation, in which social science research has been deemed relevant. He argues, however, that this influence remains “checkered and value-driven” (p. 94). The Court’s use of social science evidence in <italic>Parents Involved</italic>, the most recent desegregation decision, is one such example. In their analysis of how the justices used the social science research presented in the case, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0895904813490067">Frankenberg and Garces (2006)</xref> conclude that a value-driven determination—that is, the justices’ understanding of the role schools play in addressing harms caused by racial segregation in our society—ultimately influenced the way they considered social science evidence. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0895904813490067">Morgan and Pullin (2010)</xref> reach a related conclusion about how the ideological positions of the justices influenced the consideration of social science evidence in the case.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0895904813490067">
<title>Does the Evidence Speak to the Legal Standards in the Case?</title>
<p>Studies have begun to explore the connection between social science evidence and legal opinions and whether this evidence is presented in a manner that addresses the legal issues in a case (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0895904813490067">Ancheta, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0895904813490067">Morgan &amp; Pullin, 2010</xref>). Recent examples of how the social science community communicated research evidence in a manner that spoke to the legal standards and ultimately helped inform the decisions include <italic>Grutter</italic> and <italic>Gratz</italic>, the Court’s most recent affirmative action case, and <italic>Parents Involved</italic>, the most recent voluntary desegregation case.</p>
<p>To understand how social science research helped inform the outcome in <italic>Grutter</italic>, one must consider its predecessor case, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0895904813490067"><italic>Regents of the University of California v. Bakke</italic> (1978)</xref>, which involved a challenge to an affirmative action admissions policy at the University of California at Davis School of Medicine. In <italic>Bakke</italic>, to assess the constitutionality of the policy, the Court applied strict scrutiny, its highest standard of review, which requires demonstration of a compelling interest and of means that are narrowly tailored to further that interest. (I discuss the strict scrutiny standard in more detail below.) In his opinion, which provided the Court’s controlling rationale, Justice Powell found that the medical school had a compelling interest to further its educational mission by providing a diverse student body, although he found that the way the policy was implemented was not narrowly tailored to that interest. <italic>Bakke</italic> thus set the precedent for the legal test that would apply in future cases. When the case was first litigated, little social science research had been presented to support the Court’s determinations. More important, Justice Powell’s opinion sent signals to the social science community regarding the type of research that could influence future cases.</p>
<p>As legal challenges to the race-conscious admissions policies at the University of Michigan and the University of Michigan Law School made their way through the lower courts, the social science community responded to Powell’s signals by documenting the benefits of a racially and ethnically diverse student body, including improved critical thinking skills and cross-racial understanding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0895904813490067">Ancheta, 2006</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0895904813490067">4</xref></sup> By the time the cases were heard by the Court in 2003, there was ample social science evidence documenting the benefits of diversity that could be cited in legal briefs. This evidence spoke primarily to the benefits of a racially diverse student body, which the Court’s majority opinion subsequently cited (see <italic>Grutter</italic>, 539 U.S. at 330). Justice O’Connor’s majority opinion also cited studies that examined the effectiveness of percent plans for achieving a racially diverse student body (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0895904813490067">Horn &amp; Flores, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0895904813490067">Marin &amp; Lee, 2003</xref>) to support the Court’s finding that the policies were narrowly tailored because “race-neutral” alternatives (such as percent plans) had not proven as effective.</p>
<p>After the Court agreed in 2006 to determine the constitutionality of voluntary K-12 desegregation plans cases (<italic>Parents Involved</italic>), the social science community mobilized to present social science evidence relevant to the Court’s determinations, including studies documenting the educational benefits of racial and ethnic diversity in K-12 schools and the harm caused by racial isolation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0895904813490067">National Academy of Education [NAE], 2007</xref>). This evidence helped inform the Court’s analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0895904813490067">Frankenberg &amp; Garces, 2006</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0895904813490067">Morgan and Pullin (2010)</xref>, however, assert that “very little, if any, social science evidence entered into the ultimate judgment [in <italic>Parents Involved</italic>]” (p. 522). This proposition is debatable, as it is now widely understood that Justice Kennedy’s separate concurring opinion was the controlling opinion in the case (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0895904813490067">Department of Justice, 2011</xref>). In his opinion, Justice Kennedy disagreed with the plurality’s opinion that there were no compelling interests to justify the use of voluntary, race-conscious desegregation policies. He instead outlined the school’s interest in achieving a diverse student body and avoiding racial isolation. His discussion of the compelling interests in the case reflects the themes and conclusions of most of the social science research evidence presented in the case (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0895904813490067">Frankenberg &amp; Garces, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0895904813490067">NAE, 2007</xref>). Moreover, had Justice Kennedy not said otherwise, the Court’s holding would have been that the desegregation plans did not further any compelling interests. For these reasons, it is reasonable to conclude that social science research influenced the Court’s holding, although admittedly not to the extent many researchers had hoped. Although researchers presented evidence to support the conclusion that the voluntary desegregation policies were narrowly tailored, Justice Kennedy found otherwise, thereby striking down the policies as unconstitutional.</p>
<p>I will now consider the lessons researchers can draw from these cases to help inform future legal developments.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0895904813490067">5</xref></sup> More specifically, I will focus on what thus far seems to be an underexplored consideration in determining whether social science research will be relevant in future judicial decision-making: the extent to which the evidence can speak to the legal standard in a case. Regardless of whether the Court’s inquiry involves questions of fact or law or whether a case hinges on a determination that may be value driven, a broader consideration is whether social science researchers are asking questions that can help provide answers to the legal questions at hand. With this in mind, I discuss the legal tests in the next round of litigation before the Supreme Court (<italic>Schuette</italic>) and outline areas of research that could inform these questions. My goal is to consider an initial and important step for helping increase the relevance of social science research to legal decisions, that is, to facilitate the design of studies and communication of findings that are relevant to the legal determinations at hand by explaining the legal questions that have emerged in this area of litigation.</p>

<title>Legal Standards/Tests in Post-<italic>Grutter</italic> Cases</title>
<p>Since <italic>Grutter</italic>, litigation around affirmative action policies in higher education has involved challenges to two different types of policies or laws: (a) those that introduce race as one factor among many in admissions decisions, and (b) those that ban or prohibit the consideration of race altogether in admissions policies. Challenges to both types of policies or laws (initiated by different types of organizations or parties) are grounded on the 14th Amendment, which provides that “[n]o state shall . . . deny to any person . . . the equal protection of the laws.” The consideration of whether these laws violate the equal protection clause of the 14th Amendment courts involves two types of analysis: a traditional/conventional analysis, and a political restructuring analysis. Challenges to the first type of policy (<italic>Fisher</italic>) trigger a traditional/conventional analysis, whereas challenges to the second type of policy (<italic>Cantrell</italic> and <italic>Wilson/Brown</italic>) implicate another framework, the political questions restructuring doctrine. This political restructuring doctrine involves different than those in the traditional/conventional analysis. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0895904813490067">Table 1</xref> presents the types of policies and applicable analyses.</p>

<title>Traditional or Conventional Analysis</title>
<p>Under a traditional or conventional analysis for determining whether a law or policy violates the equal protection clause of the 14th Amendment, a court examines the type of classification the law makes (i.e., a facial classification) to determine which legal test to apply.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0895904813490067">6</xref></sup> When the law or policy classifies on the basis of race, such as the race-conscious policies at issue in <italic>Bakke, Grutter</italic>, and <italic>Gratz</italic>, the courts have applied a legal test called strict scrutiny. The strict scrutiny test requires demonstration of a “compelling” interest and of means that are “narrowly tailored” to meet that objective; it is the Court’s highest level of review and the hardest one to meet. The Court applies the strict scrutiny test to “smoke out” illegitimate uses of race by ensuring that the institution “is pursuing a goal important enough to warrant use of a highly suspect tool” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0895904813490067"><italic>Johnson v. California</italic>, 2005</xref>). These requirements apply to any institution that receives federal funding, which includes the majority, if not all, of the nation’s private postsecondary institutions. This test applies irrespective of whether the classification is made to help or hurt racial minorities.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0895904813490067">7</xref></sup> As noted, this traditional or conventional analysis to determine whether a law satisfies the requirements of the equal protection clause is the type of inquiry the Court conducted in <italic>Grutter</italic>. Laws or policy that draw other facial classifications, like gender, implicate a different legal test called intermediate scrutiny, and most other classifications trigger the legal test known as rational basis.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-0895904813490067">8</xref></sup></p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-0895904813490067">
<title>The Political Restructuring Doctrine</title>
<p>Another line of analysis used to determine whether a law violates the equal protection clause of the 14th Amendment involves the political restructuring doctrine, which focuses on how the law or policy affects the political or decision-making process. This doctrine emerges from two U.S. Supreme Court cases, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0895904813490067"><italic>Hunter v. Erickson</italic> (1969)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0895904813490067"><italic>Washington v. Seattle School District No. 1</italic> (1982)</xref>, which have interpreted the equal protection clause as ensuring a fair political process by providing assurances that the majority does not manipulate the political process in a manner that places unique burdens on issues important to racial minorities. Under this doctrine, the Court examines whether the law at issue (a) has a racial focus that targets a goal or program that “inures primarily to the benefit of the minority” and (b) reallocates political power or reorders the decision-making process in a way that places “special burdens” on a minority group’s ability to achieve its goals through that process. If both parts of the test are met, then the law is considered in violation of the equal protection clause unless the law or policy passes heightened constitutional review (strict scrutiny). In essence, the political restructuring doctrine is a mechanism through which the court uncovers a classification made by the law that is subject to strict scrutiny from the fact that the law places a special burden on a racial minority.</p>
<p>Because the <italic>Hunter</italic> and <italic>Seattle</italic> cases established the parameters for the political restructuring doctrine, understanding the facts of these cases can help illuminate the legal issues and arguments in <italic>Cantrell</italic> and <italic>Wilson/Brown</italic> (and, accordingly, in <italic>Schuette</italic>). In both cases, the Court overturned referendums that addressed racial issues. <italic>Hunter</italic> involved a challenge to the constitutionality of a referendum that repealed a fair housing ordinance in Akron, Ohio, and amended the city charter to require approval by a majority of the electorate before any ordinance regulating real estate “on the basis of race, color, religion, national origin, or ancestry” could become effective. In other words, the referendum amended the city charter so that only ordinances that regulated real estate for the specified reasons required majority approval by the electorate. The U.S. Supreme Court held that the referendum violated the equal protection clause because it “placed special burden[s] on racial minorities within the governmental process” by making it “more difficult to secure enactment” of fair housing legislation than any other type of housing ordinance. <italic>Hunter</italic> thereby set a precedent for applying a political restructuring doctrine in cases that challenge, on equal protection grounds, a law that altered the political decision-making process in ways that selectively placed comparative structural burdens on advocates for issues that are directly and distinctively race conscious.</p>
<p>About 13 years later, the Court applied the political restructuring doctrine in another case, <italic>Seattle</italic>. The case involved a challenge to the constitutionality of a state ballot initiative that Washington residents implemented in response to a desegregation plan the school district adopted that required the mandatory reassignment (busing) of students to desegregated schools. The initiative prohibited school boards from “directly or indirectly requir[ing] any student to attend a school other than the school which is geographically nearest or next nearest the student’s place of residence.” The initiative included various exceptions that meant the real effect of the ban was to eliminate school reassignment for racial purposes only. The Court concluded that, by removing authority over student assignment decisions for the purpose of desegregating schools from the school board (e.g., busing for racial purposes) and placing the authority at a more remote level of government (the state legislature or statewide electorate), the initiative required “those championing school integration to surmount a considerably higher hurdle than persons seeking comparable legislative action.” The Court thus held that, like the Akron city charter amendment at issue in <italic>Hunter</italic>, the Washington initiative violated the equal protection clause under the political structure doctrine.</p>
<p>Relying on the precedents set by these two cases, individuals and organizations have challenged bans on affirmative action, such as Proposition 209 in California and Proposal 2 in Michigan, as unconstitutional under the political restructuring doctrine. They argue that the amendments to the respective state constitutions restructured the political process in a manner similar to the restructuring that took place in <italic>Hunter</italic> and <italic>Seattle</italic>; that is, the amendments were not race neutral, as they placed a special burden on racial minorities to secure legislation that was in their interest. In its review of a challenge to Proposal 2, the Sixth Circuit agreed with these arguments (<italic>Cantrell</italic>), whereas the Ninth Circuit disagreed in its review of Proposition 209 (<italic>Wilson</italic>/<italic>Brown</italic>).</p>

<p>The debate over race-conscious policies at Michigan’s public colleges and universities dates back to the 1960s and 1970s, when individuals first lobbied the universities to consider race in admissions. Subsequent challenges to the implementation of these policies in the 1990s culminated in the <italic>Grutter</italic> and <italic>Gratz</italic> cases in 2003. Three years later, in 2006, Michigan voters passed Proposal 2 by a 58% to 42% margin. The proposal amended the state’s constitution to prohibit public universities and colleges in the state from considering race in admissions.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-0895904813490067">9</xref></sup> Thereafter, the Coalition to Defend Affirmative Action by Any Means Necessary (known as BAMN) and a group of students, faculty, and prospective applicants to Michigan’s public universities (Cantrell plaintiffs) filed two separate cases that sought to prevent enforcement of the law on the grounds that it violated the equal protection clause of the 14th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution.</p>
<p>In their challenges, which were considered together by the district court, the plaintiffs asserted that Proposal 2 restructured the political process in a manner that placed special burdens on diversity advocates. In this case, the political process involved the channels through which individual citizens could advocate for affirmative action policies in college admissions. In general, the process through which citizens can advocate for affirmative action policies depends on the governance structure of higher education, which varies by state. Under Michigan’s constitution, universities are controlled by independent boards. Board members, who at the state’s three flagship schools (including the University of Michigan) are elected by citizens of the state, have autonomy over admissions policies and practices and have largely delegated this responsibility to units within the institutions, including central admissions offices, schools, and colleges. Individuals can lobby the board or admissions committees to adopt, or not adopt, particular admissions policies. It was after such lobbying efforts that the University of Michigan decided to include the consideration of race as a “plus factor” in admissions, a change that led to the litigation in <italic>Grutter</italic> and <italic>Gratz</italic>.</p>
<p>The passage of Proposal 2 changed this process. The university can no longer consider race in admissions, and individuals can no longer lobby the board or admissions committees directly to enact such policies. To regain the right to do so, they must repeal or modify the changes enacted by Proposal 2 with an amendment to the state’s constitution. The plaintiffs in the case argued that this change violates the equal protection clause because it restructured the political process in a manner that is not race neutral. That is, the law made it more difficult for minorities to advocate for race-based admissions policies, whereas it left earlier, less cumbersome channels in place for individuals who advocate for other, non–race-based policies.</p>
<p>In the district/trial court, the judge disagreed with these arguments; on appeal, however, a three-judge panel of the Sixth Circuit reversed the decision, holding that Proposal 2 violated the equal protection clause under the political restructuring doctrine. That three-judge panel’s decision was upheld after a review by the full Sixth Circuit in a split 8-7 en banc decision.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-0895904813490067">10</xref></sup> The court found that Proposal 2 had a racial focus because holistic race-conscious policies at public colleges and universities “at bottom inures primarily to the benefit of the minority, and is designed primarily for that purpose.” The court further clarified that this was the case even if the policy was not intended to solely benefit minorities, as white students also benefit from diversity. The court also addressed arguments that affirmative action policies actually “harm” racial minorities because it stigmatizes them, noting that that question was one to be resolved through the political process. The court compared the issue to the one in the <italic>Seattle</italic> case, which involved busing to achieve integration and a similar controversy concerning the desirability and efficacy of the policy. The court noted that “it is enough that minorities may consider [the repealed policy] to be ‘legislation that is in their interests’.”</p>
<p>After concluding that race-conscious admissions policies at colleges and universities are adopted primarily to benefit the minority, the court proceeded to determine whether Proposal 2 affected a political process. In examining the administrative structure of Michigan’s public universities and their admissions processes, the court found that, while the board—whose members are popularly elected—delegated their authority to set admissions policies to other non-elected university administrators, as a body, they retained the ultimate decision-making authority in this area. Because board members are popularly elected, decision-making power over admissions policies is part of the political process. Before Proposal 2 took that authority away, publicly elected board members had the authority to put race-conscious admissions policies in place—and they used it.</p>
<p>Having found that the implementation of undergraduate admissions policies involved the political process, the court then turned to whether Proposal 2 restructured that process in a manner that placed special burdens on the ability of racial minorities to advocate for their interests. The court outlined the various ways actors could effect change in admissions policies: by lobbying admissions committees, administrators, or board members directly or by campaigning for an amendment to the Michigan constitution. It noted that anyone else who wanted to influence admissions policies, such as an individual seeking a guarantee of admission based on “legacy” status, could seek to do so by convincing officials directly. But because an individual seeking to advocate for a change in an admissions policy involving race must first work to amend the state constitution—“an extraordinarily expensive process and the most arduous of all the possible channels for change”—their burden is substantially higher than the steps that must be taken by individuals who seek to advocate for non–race-based policies.</p>
<p>After striking down the law under the political restructuring doctrine, the Sixth Circuit then declined to address whether Proposal 2 would also violate the equal protection clause under a traditional or conventional analysis. The Ninth Circuit’s decisions in <italic>Wilson</italic> and <italic>Brown</italic>, however, reached a different conclusion with respect to Proposition 209.</p>

<p>The legal challenge to Proposition 209 has had a long and complicated history in the courts. Approved in November 1996, California’s Proposition 209 was the first voter-approved initiative in the country to restrict government action based on race, ethnicity, and gender. The provision amended California’s constitution to prohibit the consideration of race or ethnicity in public education. A legal challenge to the law started on November 6, 1996, the day after the proposition passed, when several individuals and organizations sought a court order prohibiting implementation of the law (i.e., a preliminary injunction) on the grounds that it was unconstitutional under the equal protection clause of the 14th Amendment (<italic>Wilson</italic>). As in <italic>Cantrell</italic>, plaintiffs argued that the law was unconstitutional under the political restructuring doctrine and a traditional/conventional analysis. After considering the arguments in the briefs, the district court issued an order preventing enforcement of the law, finding that the petitioners had met the legal test for a preliminary injunction.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-0895904813490067">11</xref></sup></p>
<p>On appeal in 1997, about a year later, a three-judge panel of the Ninth Circuit reversed the district court’s order, disagreeing with its legal determinations and finding that Proposition 209 did not violate the equal protection clause under either the political restructuring doctrine or the traditional/conventional analysis. In its decision, the court characterized affirmative action as a policy that grants preferential treatment on the basis of race. On this ground, the court distinguished Proposition 209, which banned such preferential treatment, from the laws at issues in <italic>Hunter</italic> and <italic>Seattle</italic>, which according to the panel, denied equal protection, rather than banning preferential treatment.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-0895904813490067">12</xref></sup></p>
<p>The three-judge panel also conducted a traditional/conventional analysis, which, as noted previously, looks to whether the law makes a “facial” classification or has a discriminatory impact. In this case, the court interpreted the amendment not as one that classifies on the basis of race but as one that prevents preferential treatment on the basis of race or that addresses race-related manners in a neutral fashion. This characterization thus rendered the law presumptively valid under the traditional/conventional analysis. Following the three-judge panel’s decision, the full Ninth Circuit Court denied full court (en banc) review, with four judges dissenting on the grounds that the legal issues were governed by the <italic>Hunter</italic> and <italic>Seattle</italic> line of precedent.</p>
<p>The challenge to Proposition 209 was recently reignited when, in 2012, a new set of individuals and organizations filed a related challenge (<italic>Coalition to Defend Affirmative Action v. Brown</italic>). During this round of litigation, the State of California declined to defend the constitutionality of Proposition 209. The court, however, dismissed the challenge on the grounds that the court’s prior ruling in <italic>Wilson</italic> was binding precedent. Given their different outcomes, the <italic>Cantrell</italic> and <italic>Wilson</italic>/<italic>Brown</italic> cases created a circuit split that the nation’s high court agreed to resolve when it granted the Michigan attorney general’s petition for a writ of certiorari in <italic>Schuette</italic> on March 25, 2013.</p>

<title>Implications of the Court’s Ruling in Schuette</title>
<p>The Court’s ruling in <italic>Schuette</italic> could affect the constitutional viability of bans in other states, though the determination will be context-specific, as it will depend on how the bans restructured the political process in these other states. In addition to California and Michigan, six states presently ban affirmative action at public postsecondary institutions. Of the eight states that have banned affirmative action, six (Arizona, California, Michigan, Nebraska, Oklahoma, and Washington) implemented the bans through voter-approved initiatives or referendums; two others (Florida and New Hampshire) banned the practice by executive decision and legislative vote, respectively. The voter-approved initiatives share nearly, though not completely, identical language and structure. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0895904813490067">Table 2</xref> outlines the various policies and their origins.</p>

<p>These bans are in place despite the Court’s endorsement of race-based affirmative action policies in higher education admissions in <italic>Grutter</italic> because states can amend their constitutions—through state ballot measures, initiatives, or legislation—to prohibit practices that the federal constitution may otherwise allow, unless, of course, the laws themselves violate provisions of the U.S. Constitution—the question that is at issue in <italic>Schuette</italic> with respect to the ban in Michigan. The analysis, and outcome, for the bans in other states will, as noted, depend on the specifics of how the laws restructured the political process in these other states.</p>

<title>Implications for Researchers</title>
<sec id="section13-0895904813490067">
<title>Social Science Evidence Submitted in <italic>Cantrell</italic> and <italic>Wilson/Brown</italic></title>
<p>A review of the records in these cases reveals that some social science evidence was introduced at the lower court level in <italic>Cantrell</italic>, although less than was presented at the courts of appeals in prior cases like <italic>Grutter, Gratz, Parents Involved</italic>, and <italic>Fisher</italic>. At the court of appeals in <italic>Cantrell</italic>, the most extensive discussion of social science research can be found in three amicus briefs filed before the en banc court in support of the plaintiffs. One, filed by political science professors, outlines how statewide ballot initiatives have frequently been used in the U.S. history to disfavor racial minorities but have been used rarely, if ever, to promote the interests of racial minorities. The evidence was submitted to support the conclusion that Proposal 2 placed a higher burden on racial minorities than others to advocate for policies in their interests. The brief summarized findings from empirical research in the political science field on statewide ballot initiatives. These studies examined the subject matter of statewide initiatives and the interest groups supporting the initiatives. The findings show that the majority of initiatives targeted minority groups and were placed on the ballot by those opposed to minority interests. The brief also cited studies of the racial voting patterns in statewide initiatives and of the costs associated with passing such initiatives.</p>
<p>Another brief, filed by law professors and constitutional historians, places Proposal 2 in the broader historical context of civil rights movements in terms of the efforts of minority groups to advance their interests through normal political channels and responses by the majority that make it more difficult for them to do so through such channels. For instance, the brief cites historical accounts published in books and law review and journal articles of times during the Civil Rights movement when whites passed laws that deprived African Americans of the right to vote, or other policies and practices that undermined racial integration efforts.</p>
<p>A separate amicus brief, submitted by California social science researchers and admissions experts in support of the plaintiffs, presented empirical data documenting the effects of Proposition 209 in California. Amici argued that the evidence was relevant in helping the court determine whether laws that ban affirmative action target a law or program that benefits minorities. They cited studies published in education journals that describe the racial and ethnic inequities that continue to plague K-12 schools, the unequal schooling conditions that prevent many African American and Latino/a students from accessing selective colleges, and the limits of traditional indicators of “merit,” such as standardized test scores, in identifying potential for success and academic ability. The brief also included data from university reports documenting a significant drop in the admission of students of color at selective University of California (UC) colleges after Proposition 209 was implemented, and the chilling effect the law had on administrators’ ability to experiment with alternative admissions schemes that otherwise might have helped increase racial and ethnic diversity on UC campuses.</p>
<p>Other evidence considered part of the case record was introduced at the district court. This information was presented via expert reports and testimony and involved a range of topics,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn14-0895904813490067">14</xref></sup> including the historical patterns of racial exclusion and discrimination against underrepresented minority students at the University of Michigan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0895904813490067">Anderson, 2008</xref>) and the history of race relations in U.S. society, including a historical overview of the role affirmative action policies played in halting the unequal treatment of African Americans since slavery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0895904813490067">Foner, 2008</xref>). Reports also provided evidence related to California’s experience with Proposition 209, which resulted in a sharp drop in the number of underrepresented minorities at selective colleges and universities in the state, and of the expected similar effects of Proposal 2 in Michigan. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0895904813490067">Laird (2008)</xref>, for example, presented testimony related to his experience as interim director of undergraduate education at UC Berkeley from 1994 to 1999 and the university’s efforts to maintain pre–Proposition 209 levels of racial/ethnic diversity after the ban, which were unsuccessful due to educational inequities in the K-12 system and inherent bias in the traditional standards used to evaluate applicants, such as grade point averages and test scores. He also discussed the “chill” the ban placed over admission officer’s decisions to admit any student of color who was not among the few with relatively high test scores. Because the pattern of unequal education and unequal test results is common among underrepresented students of color in Michigan, Laird anticipated that institutions there would face similar challenges after the passage of Proposal 2.</p>
<p>Other reports addressed how framing affirmative action policies as “preferences” overlooks inequalities and entrenched racial hierarchy in society (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0895904813490067">Bonilla-Silva, 2008</xref>) as well as information about the factors that help determine a minority student’s success in college, which include myriad considerations not measured by standardized tests (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0895904813490067">Schaeffer, 2008</xref>). More important, reports also addressed the complex nature of the voter-initiative process and statewide ballot initiative campaigns, and the “extraordinarily onerous, expensive and burdensome” steps that would be involved in overturning Proposal 2 in Michigan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0895904813490067">Wilfore, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>In sharp contrast to <italic>Cantrell</italic>, little social science evidence was introduced in the briefs filed at the court of appeals in <italic>Wilson</italic>/<italic>Brown</italic> or at the district court. This may be due to the fact that the case was first decided on a motion for a preliminary injunction, which involves a review of the documents submitted in the case without necessarily involving testimony by the parties or supplemental briefing. It is also possible that social science evidence was not subsequently introduced at the court of appeals because of the general view that the case raises “questions of law” that are answered more directly by prior cases and precedent than by social science findings. Given the little collaboration that appears to have taken place between the legal community and social scientists in these cases, social scientists may have been relatively unaware of the legal issues raised by the case and relevant social science findings. As challenges to bans on affirmative action proceed in the courts, empirical evidence can be submitted on topics similar to those addressed in the amicus curiae briefs and expert reports considered in <italic>Cantrell</italic>.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section14-0895904813490067">
<title>Open Areas of Investigation</title>
<p>Areas of investigation that can inform the legal determinations in these cases remain open. For example, information documenting the effects of Proposal 2 on the representation of racial minorities at postsecondary institutions in Michigan can be introduced, as were the empirical studies documenting the impact of California’s Proposition 209. Descriptive reports have documented the decline in the proportion of racial minorities at the University of Michigan following the implementation of Proposal 2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0895904813490067">Yun, Moses, &amp; Marin, 2012</xref>), and additional studies could be conducted to isolate the causal impact of the law on the representation of students of color. Similar studies have been conducted on the impact bans in other states (Washington, Florida, and California) have had on the representation of students of color in undergraduate and graduate education (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0895904813490067">Backes, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0895904813490067">Garces, 2012</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0895904813490067">2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0895904813490067">Hinrichs, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0895904813490067">Tienda, Leicht, Sullivan, Maltese, &amp; Lloyd, 2003</xref>). New studies also could begin to examine the impact of affirmative action bans on the higher education access of students of color in Arizona, Nebraska, New Hampshire, and, most recently, Oklahoma. Qualitative accounts could also provide a better understanding of how the bans influenced the decision-making processes of admissions officers. For instance, did admissions officers experience a “chilling” effect on the admission of students of color?</p>
<p>It also would be relevant to document whether the bans imposed restrictions on a range of institutional policies intended to further racial and ethnic diversity. For example, studies might document the extent to which any scholarships, outreach and recruitment practices, or academic support programs for students of color were eliminated or changed after the bans. This evidence may be deemed relevant in determining whether the prohibition on affirmative action in the state made it more difficult for racial minorities to advocate for other admission-related policies that may be in their interest.</p>
<p>Researchers in the fields of political science and higher education policy might study the various processes and political channels available to individuals for enacting changes to higher education admissions policies, like the evidence introduced in <italic>Cantrell</italic> on the nature of the voter-initiative process and statewide ballot initiatives. These studies might document the past successes and failures of state initiatives, including the strategies and expense involved in these efforts and incorporate any lessons learned from prior campaigns that have successfully passed, or defeated, initiatives (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0895904813490067">Moses et al., 2010</xref>). This evidence would inform an understanding of the burden imposed on racial minorities to overturn Proposal 2.</p>
<p>The issues in <italic>Schuette</italic> also raise broader questions regarding the nature of a democracy and the use of direct democracy efforts, such as ballot measures or state initiatives, to enact higher education policy. As outlined in the political scientists’ amicus brief filed in <italic>Cantrell</italic> studies, for example, could continue to provide a better understanding of the organizations or individuals who support ballot measures that ban affirmative action to clarify who is (and is not) represented in these efforts, Analyses also could document the use of the ballot measure throughout the U.S. history to support or deny civil rights. These studies could provide a better understanding of the ways in which ballot measures, as a method for governance, amplify the voices of a few or can be disproportionately used to undo efforts toward greater racial equity. Theoretical pieces might explore whether these direct democracy efforts may in fact undermine the democratic process.</p>
<p>Another important area related to the courts’ analyses in these cases is whether affirmative action policies harm racial minorities, a topic that has been the subject of substantial media attention since the Court agreed to hear the <italic>Fisher</italic> case (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0895904813490067">Sander &amp; Taylor, 2012</xref>), and a conclusion that is highly contested by social science researchers (see Brief of Empirical Scholars as Amici Curiae in Support of Respondents). This question was addressed in various amicus briefs filed in <italic>Fisher—</italic>including those that called into question the methodology of studies that suggest affirmative action harms racial minorities and those that present summaries of analyses that support different conclusions<italic>—</italic>and it may be relevant again in <italic>Schuette</italic>, as the attorney general and amici in support of his petition raised the argument in their briefs. As noted above, the en banc court in <italic>Cantrell</italic> found that the question of whether affirmative action harms racial minorities was not relevant to the legal determinations in the case but that it was a topic best addressed through the political process. That is, the court noted that the question before it was whether the <italic>process</italic> for considering affirmative action policies, as changed by Proposal 2, violated the equal protection clause, not whether the <italic>objective</italic> of affirmative action was desirable. The Court (or judges in other cases), however, may consider the question of whether affirmative action policies are desirable relevant to the political restructuring doctrine analysis.</p>
<p>Finally, one important difference that, in practice, determined the different outcomes in <italic>Cantrell</italic> and <italic>Wilson</italic>/<italic>Brown</italic> relates to how the judges framed the policy of affirmative action. The policy can be framed as (a) granting preferential treatment on the basis of race, or (b) ensuring equal treatment on the basis of race. The Ninth Circuit in <italic>Wilson</italic>/<italic>Brown</italic> followed the first approach, finding that the political restructuring doctrine did not apply. The Sixth Circuit in <italic>Cantrell</italic>, on the other hand, adopted the second approach, framing the policy as seeking to ensure equal treatment by helping level the playing field. Within this framing, the court then proceeded with the political restructuring analysis. Given the political nature of these policies, it is possible that the judges’ opinions already fall into one category or the other. Empirical evidence, however, could help inform these determinations. Studies, for example, can outline the broader historical and educational context within which affirmative action policies are implemented.</p>
<p>Of course, one remaining question is whether any of the evidence outlined here will, in the end, influence the Court’s determinations. A related question is whether the Court will give more weight to one type of study over another (i.e., qualitative, quantitative, historical, causal, descriptive, etc.). Though I do not directly address these important questions in this analysis, they are worthy of further consideration, and the Court’s decision in <italic>Schuette</italic> could clarify the type of evidence the Court finds persuasive. For now, this analysis serves as an initial step to explain legal questions that have emerged in this area of litigation to facilitate the relevance of social science research to legal determinations.</p>
<p>Ultimately, the social science community, including scholars across the political science and higher education policy fields, will need to partner more closely with members of the legal community involved in the litigation in <italic>Schuette</italic> so they can communicate research findings in a manner that shows how the evidence bears on the legal determination. These are important efforts, given that the decisions in these cases could ultimately shape the everyday practices of educators.</p>

<p>The challenge to Proposal 2 involves two separate cases (with different sets of plaintiffs and legal teams), which the district court consolidated; for the sake of simplicity, I refer to the consolidated cases as <italic>Cantrell</italic>. After the Court agreed to hear the Sixth Circuit case, the name changed to <italic>Schuette v. Coalition to Defend Affirmative Action et al.</italic>, as Bill Schuette, Michigan’s attorney general, was the one who asked the Court to review the lower court decision.</p>

<p>The 2013-2014 term extends from October 2013 to June 2014. During this time, the parties and friends-of-the-court will have an opportunity to file briefs that address the substance of the legal questions (<italic>i.e.</italic>, merit briefs) in the case. This timing will allow the Court to consider the legal issues in light of the outcome in <italic>Fisher</italic>, as a decision is expected in <italic>Fisher</italic> by June 2013.</p>

<p>It will be important to consider the extent to which the social science evidence submitted in <italic>Fisher</italic> informs the Court’s forthcoming conclusions. Given the timeline for publication of this article, I am not able to incorporate these lessons here.</p>

<p>The traditional/convention analysis also applies when the law has a discriminatory purpose or impact. For the sake of simplicity, I limit my discussion to the application of the analysis to facial classifications.</p>

<label>7.</label>
<p>The application of strict scrutiny to these questions merits a longer discussion that is not the focus of this article. For a more extensive discussion of the extension of strict scrutiny review to classifications that are intended to help racial minorities, see, e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0895904813490067">Olivas (1997)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0895904813490067">Simmons (1996)</xref>.</p>

<p>Under intermediate scrutiny, the objective needs to be “important” and the means need to be “substantially related” to the objective. Under a rational basis test, the lowest level of review and the easiest standard to satisfy, the Court will uphold a policy if the institution is pursuing a “legitimate” objective and there’s a “rational relation” between the means chosen and the objective.</p>

<p>Specifically, the amendment banned public institutions from “discriminat[ing] against, or grant[ing] preferential treatment to any individual or group on the basis of race, sex, color, ethnicity or national origin” (Michigan Constitution, Article I, Section 26). Public institutions affected by the proposal include state governments, local governments, public colleges and universities, community colleges, and school districts. Proposal 2 sweeps more broadly, and applies to all contexts, including employment and contracting, but both groups of Plaintiffs in Michigan only challenged the law as applied to university admissions.</p>

<p>When a district/trial court decision is appealed to a circuit court (i.e., a court of appeals), it is first considered by a panel of three judges. The losing party in the appeal can then ask all the active judges who sit on the circuit to review the three-judge panel decision. That review is called en banc review and the decision is referred to as the en banc opinion.</p>
</fn>
<fn fn-type="other" id="fn11-0895904813490067">
<label>11.</label>
<p>To rule on the preliminary injunction, the trial judge needed to determine whether those who initiated the lawsuit demonstrated a likelihood of success on the merits of the case and the possibility of irreparable injury or that the case raised serious questions and the balance of hardships was tipped sharply in favor of the parties asking for the preliminary injunction.</p>
</fn>
<fn fn-type="other" id="fn12-0895904813490067">

<p>The Sixth Circuit full court (en banc) decision addressed these arguments and reached a different conclusion.</p>
