<title>Background:</title>
<p>Injectable forms of anesthesia for nonsurgical facial rejuvenation, although efficacious, are uncomfortable for the patient. Preclinical studies have demonstrated that laser pretreatment at low energies enhances absorption of topical lidocaine.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-1090820X13496248">
<title>Objectives:</title>
<p>The authors assess the safety and efficacy of laser-assisted transdermal delivery of topical anesthetic.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-1090820X13496248">
<title>Method:</title>
<p>Ten patients were split into 2 groups (A and B). All patients received 15 g of BLT (20% benzocaine, 6% lidocaine, and 4% tetracaine triple anesthetic cream) for 20 minutes with no occlusion. Then the cream was removed and the first blood draw taken. Group A patients were pretreated with the full ablative laser and group B patients with a fractional ablative laser to the full face. A further 15 g BLT was applied for another 20 minutes. Group A patients then underwent full ablative laser treatment, and group B received fractionated ablative laser treatment. Blood draws were taken at 60, 90, 120, 180, and 240 minutes after the initial topical anesthetic application, and the serum was analyzed for lidocaine and monoethylglycinexylidide (MEGX) levels. Patients were asked to rate the pain felt at intervals during the procedure.</p>

<sec id="section4-1090820X13496248">
<title>Results:</title>
<p>No patient required supplemental nerve blocks. Pain scores were equivalent at the end of the first pass for both groups (<italic>P</italic> = .436). Group A patients had significantly lower pain scores at the start of the second laser treatment (<italic>P</italic> = .045), but pain scores became equivalent by the end (<italic>P</italic> = .323). Combined serum lidocaine and MEGX levels were significantly higher in group A patients up to 90 minutes (peak average of 0.61 µg/mL for group A and 0.533 µg/mL for group B; <italic>P</italic> = .0253), which corresponded to greater initial analgesic effect.</p>

<sec id="section5-1090820X13496248">
<title>Conclusions:</title>
<p>Data from this study demonstrate that topical anesthetic for facial rejuvenation can be enhanced with laser pretreatment while maintaining safe blood serum levels. Further studies should examine optimal application amount and time to allow safe multipass facial rejuvenation without the need for invasive nerve blocks.</p>

<body>
<p>The rates of nonsurgical cosmetic surgery procedures such as botulinum toxin injections, fillers, and laser treatments are increasing.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1090820X13496248">1</xref></sup> Often, these nonsurgical procedures require either a topical or injectable anesthetic to ensure adequate analgesia during the procedure. Injectable forms of anesthetic, although efficacious, are uncomfortable for the patient during administration. Laser pretreatment previously has been studied in the context of improving the analgesic effects of topical lidocaine prior to procedures such as venipuncture and facial resurfacing.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1090820X13496248">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1090820X13496248"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1090820X13496248">4</xref></sup> The results of these studies have been subjective, based on pain perceptions. The aim of our study is 2-fold. First, we investigate whether laser-assisted transdermal delivery is safe and more effective than topical anesthetics alone. Second, we examine whether we can enhance the anesthetic ability of topical anesthetics to help diminish the need for local infiltration and nerve blocks.</p>
<p>Preclinical studies by our group have demonstrated that laser pretreatment at low energies enhances absorption of topical lidocaine.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1090820X13496248">5</xref></sup> Our previous study demonstrated that at very low energy settings, pretreatment with the laser caused increased systemic absorption of lidocaine in a porcine model. The serum levels of lidocaine and its metabolite, however, remained well below the levels that would be considered toxic. Physiologically, lidocaine is broken down into monoethylglycinexylidide (MEGX), an active metabolite that has a similar toxicity. Lidocaine typically has a half-life of approximately 2 hours in individuals with normal hepatic function. We have also seen significant interperson variability with regard to lidocaine metabolism in previous studies.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1090820X13496248">6</xref></sup></p>
<p>We hypothesized that serum lidocaine levels would rise and the risk of lidocaine toxicity would increase in individuals who undergo treatments leading to the disruption of normal physiological barriers to dermal absorption, although this has not been proven. Lasers can be used to ablate the stratum corneum of the skin and therefore enhance absorption of topically applied drugs. To our knowledge, no documented studies have examined the serum concentrations of lidocaine and its metabolite MEGX in this context, so that was our aim: to look at the serum levels of lidocaine and MEGX after the application of topical lidocaine following pretreatment of the skin with an ablative laser.</p>

<p>At time 0, all patients had 15 g of BLT (20% benzocaine, 6% lidocaine, and 4% tetracaine) triple anesthetic cream applied to their face for 20 minutes with no occlusion. The topical anesthetic was then removed and the first blood draw made.</p>
<sec id="section7-1090820X13496248">
<title>First, Superficial Laser Treatment</title>
<p>Patients in group A underwent a superficial pretreatment to the face with the full ablative Er:YAG laser (Sciton PROFILE 2940 nm; Sciton, Palo Alto, California). Laser settings were 15 microns (2.8 J/cm<sup>2</sup>). Patients in group B had a superficial pretreatment with the fractionated CO<sub>2</sub> laser (UltraPulse; Lumenis, San Jose, CA) (15 mJ [1.1 J/cm<sup>2</sup>], 300 MHz [4.5 W], density 2, column spot size 1.3 mm). Immediately after these treatments, a further 15 g of BLT was reapplied to the faces of patients in both groups and left without occlusion for another 20 minutes.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-1090820X13496248">
<title>Second, Deeper Laser Treatment</title>
<p>After removal of the second application of topical anesthetic, the second laser treatment commenced. For group A patients, the Er:YAG laser setting for the deeper treatment was 100 microns (25 J/cm<sup>2</sup>) on the full ablative setting. For group B patients, the fractionated CO<sub>2</sub> laser (UltraPulse; Lumenis) setting for the deeper treatment was 50 mJ (3.8 J/cm<sup>2</sup>), 300 MHz (15 W), density 3, and column spot size 1.3 mm.</p>
<p>At the patient’s request, analgesia could be supplemented with 1% lidocaine (plain) in the form of nerve blocks. We planned that these requests would be recorded and those patients would still have their blood taken. The total amount of lidocaine administered by any route was capped at 2 mg/kg.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-1090820X13496248">
<title>Blood Draws</title>
<p>Blood serum samples (approximately 1 tablespoon, or 7 mL) were taken at 20 (immediately after the topical anesthetic was removed), 60, 90, 120, 180, and 240 minutes after application. These samples were taken via an intravenous line left in place for the course of the procedure.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-1090820X13496248">
<title>Patient Pain Score Questionnaire</title>
<p>Patients were required to complete a short questionnaire rating their pain experience prior to discharge.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-1090820X13496248">
<title>Blood Sample Procurement and Analysis</title>
<p>Again, whole-blood samples (approximately 7 mL) were collected in serum separator tubes (BD Vacutainer; BD, Franklin Lakes, New Jersey). The blood samples were centrifuged (3000 rpm for 10 minutes at 4°C), and the serum was aliquoted into Eppendorf tubes in duplicate and stored at −80°C until analyzed. The samples were sent to the Department of Clinical Chemistry at George-August University (Goettingen, Germany), where lidocaine and MEGX in plasma were analyzed using a previously described technique.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1090820X13496248">6</xref></sup></p>

<title>Statistical Analysis</title>
<p>The serum concentration-time courses of lidocaine and MEGX were characterized using Microsoft Excel (Microsoft Corp, Redmond, Washington). A repeated-measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) test for nonparametric data was used to analyze differences between the groups.

<sec id="section22-1090820X13496248">
<title>Correlating Pain Scores With Combined Serum Levels of Lidocaine/MEGX</title>
<p>For group A patients, there was a rapid increase in serum levels of lidocaine/MEGX by 60 to 90 minutes. These patients had the lowest pain scores at the start of the second pass. This correlates with rapid absorption of lidocaine and its metabolism—hence the increase in pain scores by the end of the second pass. In contrast, group B patients experienced a slow increase in serum lidocaine/MEGX levels with lower serum levels overall but also had a fairly consistent pain score throughout both first- and second-pass laser treatments compared with group A. This correlates with slower absorption (and, therefore, slower metabolism) of lidocaine.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section23-1090820X13496248">
<title>Adverse Events</title>
<p>No patient developed any complications with regard to the topical anesthetic. One patient in group B (the fractionated laser group) developed posttreatment hyperpigmentation, despite being prescribed pretreatment hydroquinones to reduce her risk. Posttreatment, she was given a 1-month course of hydroquinone cream, and the hyperpigmentation resolved completely.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Topical anesthetics are used to perform countless procedures across a number of medical disciplines. Nonsurgical cosmetic/rejuvenation procedures, such as laser resurfacing of the face, are becomingly increasingly popular. For laser resurfacing, topical anesthetic is often used, either with conscious sedation or with nerve blocks. This is the first study, to our knowledge, that examines the use of lidocaine-containing topical anesthetic only for laser resurfacing and assesses the possibility of enhancing its efficacy with the elimination of the superficial epidermis while correlating this with the serum levels of lidocaine. Previous studies from our group have demonstrated the histopathological injury that fractionated devices can cause in human skin.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1090820X13496248">7</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1090820X13496248"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1090820X13496248"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1090820X13496248"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1090820X13496248"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1090820X13496248">12</xref></sup></p>
<p>The aim of this study was to investigate whether the principles of laser-assisted transdermal drug delivery could be used to provide complete anesthesia for facial rejuvenation without the need for supplementary nerve blocks. Several articles in the literature describe the use of laser assistance to enhance topical anesthetics<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1090820X13496248">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1090820X13496248">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1090820X13496248">14</xref></sup>—for example, for venipuncture and intramuscular injections.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1090820X13496248">4</xref></sup> However, there is little literature that examines the role of laser-assisted anesthesia for facial rejuvenation and/or correlates this with serum levels of the drug. Previous work performed by our group demonstrated that the depth of fractional ablation used influences the absorption of lidocaine and subsequent metabolite levels. Animal preclinical studies performed in our laboratories investigated the role of the fractionated laser (Er:YAG) to assist transdermal delivery of drugs, using lidocaine as the study drug.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1090820X13496248">5</xref></sup> This study found that as the depth of laser treatment increased, so too did the serum levels of lidocaine. In addition, we have also investigated the safety of topical anesthetics applied to the face.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1090820X13496248">6</xref></sup> All of our prior clinical studies regarding lidocaine-containing topical anesthetics demonstrated considerable interindividual variability in the way lidocaine is metabolized.</p>
<p>Yun et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1090820X13496248">15</xref></sup> compared laser-assisted topical anesthetic and topical anesthetic alone for facial rejuvenation. Half of each subject’s face was pretreated with the laser, and then the whole face was covered with EMLA (Eutectic Mixture of Local Anesthetic containing 2.5% lidocaine and 2.5% prilocaine) cream (AstraZeneca, London, United Kingdom) for 60 minutes. Patients then underwent passes of treatment with the ablative Er:YAG laser. The investigators found that supplemental nerve blocks were required during both the first and the second passes of treatment. However, they concluded that laser pretreatment reduced the need for supplemental nerve blocks. In our study, no patient requested supplemental analgesia.</p>
<p>Kilmer et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1090820X13496248">16</xref></sup> used a supplemental protocol in which patients had topical EMLA applied to their faces (30 g for 90 minutes with occlusion) prior to oral analgesia, sedatives, and intramuscular analgesia being given. Then another 30 g of EMLA was applied 45 to 60 minutes before the actual laser treatment. Of the 200 patients treated with this protocol, 5% required supplemental nerve blocks. Most patients had 2 to 3 laser passes on the face and 1 laser pass to the neck. No evidence of lidocaine toxicity was recorded in any patients in that series, but serum levels were not measured.</p>
<p>Carruthers et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1090820X13496248">17</xref></sup> investigated the serum levels of lidocaine applied to the face, neck, and chest after intense pulsed light treatment. Their study drug contained 15% lidocaine and 5% prilocaine (less than 10 g in all cases). They found low levels of serum lidocaine and no evidence of lidocaine toxicity in any of their patients. Intense pulsed light is a broad-spectrum–focused treatment and does not disrupt the stratum corneum in the way that a mono-wavelength laser does. Its action for increasing transdermal drug delivery is most likely through warming of the skin, as opposed to perforation of the stratum corneum.</p>
<p>Our clinical study looks not only at the analgesic effect of laser-assisted drug delivery but, more important, at the safety profile. It also illustrates the differences between ablative and fractionated lasers and their effect on transdermal drug delivery. Patients who had full ablative treatments with removal of all of their stratum corneum had significantly higher levels of lidocaine/MEGX in their bloodstream compared with those who had a fractionated treatment and therefore only partial removal of the stratum corneum. The highest serum level seen in this study for any one patient was 0.935 µg/mL. To put this into context, the lower therapeutic limit for intravenous lidocaine treatment of cardiac arrhythmias is 1.0 µg/mL. The toxic levels for lidocaine are 5.0 µg/ml, and so the levels seen in this study are way below this threshold, and no patient had any adverse events.</p>
<sec id="section25-1090820X13496248">
<title>Duration of Analgesia</title>
<p>The patients who had full ablative treatments demonstrated significantly lower pain scores (and therefore greater anesthetic effect) at the start of the second pass of treatment than the patients in the fractionated laser group. However, by the end of the second treatment, the pain scores were equivocal. This suggests that in the full ablative group, the lidocaine was more quickly absorbed through the skin and metabolized than in the fractional group. This was also reflected in the faster rise in serum levels in the full ablative group compared with the fractionated group.</p>
<p>All patients stated that they would undergo future laser treatment performed with this method of anesthesia again. However, because the fractionated laser group had more consistent pain scores from the first to the second pass, we can infer that the drug is retained in the dermis over a longer period. This may well be affected by changing the treatment density of the fractionated laser. The serum levels of lidocaine/MEGX in this group started to fall by 120 minutes. Compare this with the levels in the ablative group, where the pain scores were very low at the start of the second pass but had risen by the end. This suggests that the drug is not being retained within the dermis. For these patients, the serum levels started to fall by 90 minutes but reached significantly higher levels than in the fractionated group. Extrapolating this trend, multiple-pass treatments using this topical lidocaine regime may provide sufficient analgesia for fractionated and ablative laser treatments, but reapplication of the topical anesthetic would probably be required between passes. The amount and timing of doses need further investigation.</p>

<title>Efficacy of Topical Lidocaine Enhanced by Laser Treatments</title>
<p>Few studies have investigated the use of topical anesthetic only as a method of analgesia for laser treatments, and even fewer have included serum levels of lidocaine/MEGX to assess systemic toxicity. Alster et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1090820X13496248">18</xref></sup> compared the analgesic effect of EMLA with the S-Caine peel (which is no longer manufactured) when a 4 × 4-cm area on the cheek was treated with the CO<sub>2</sub> fractionated laser. They used assessors to rate the patient’s discomfort rather than asking the patient directly and found that 85% of patients had moderate pain (pain score average 5.25) on the EMLA side. In our study, we treated the whole face and asked the patient to rate the experience.</p>
<p>Marra et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1090820X13496248">19</xref></sup> described the case of a woman with a body mass index of 17 who developed systemic toxicity following fractional laser treatment to the face. In this instance, 30% lidocaine was applied topically to the face and neck and left for 60 minutes before treatment began. The patient then underwent multiple-pass treatments (8 on the face) and developed symptoms of toxicity, with a serum level of 1.5 µg/mL 60 minutes after the onset of symptoms. There have also been reports of lidocaine toxicity from application of topical lidocaine applied copiously to the lower limbs and wrapped in occlusive dressings prior to laser hair-removal treatments.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1090820X13496248">20</xref></sup></p>
<p>Several lessons are to be learned with cases such as these. Our study has demonstrated that peak serum levels of lidocaine and its metabolite occur between 60 and 90 minutes after treatment, depending on the laser used. In addition, greater absorption is expected when 30% of the topically applied substance is lidocaine. Also, in the previous publication,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1090820X13496248">19</xref></sup> the drug was left on for 60 minutes before treatment. The half-life of lidocaine is 90 to 120 minutes and, therefore, it is not surprising that the patient developed toxic symptoms, especially with laser treatments. (Depending on the laser, we know that treatment could perforate or obliterate the stratum corneum in its entirety. This would then lead to absorption of any remaining lidocaine in the skin into the bloodstream.) Increasing temperature also facilitates drug diffusion, and the laser treatment generates heat within the skin, as does the occlusive dressing. The cumulative effect, therefore, of stratum corneum disruption and tissue heating caused by the laser would lead to increasing absorption of the topical lidocaine.</p>

<title>Effect of the Laser Device</title>
<p>In this study, a fractionated CO<sub>2</sub> laser device was used. Previous studies by our group and by many others in preclinical animal models have used the fractionated Er:YAG laser to facilitate transdermal drug delivery.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1090820X13496248">5</xref></sup> Farkas et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1090820X13496248">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1090820X13496248">10</xref></sup> demonstrated that the fractionated CO<sub>2</sub> device causes more thermal injury than the fractionated Er:YAG. It may well be that the amount of drug absorption would be affected by the differences in thermal injury between the devices. We have already alluded to this, with the ablative Er:YAG device facilitating greater drug absorption than the fractionated CO<sub>2</sub> device. Therefore, one could extrapolate that the fractionated Er:YAG device would cause less drug absorption than the fractionated CO<sub>2</sub> device, because less thermal injury occurs initially. It may well be that if the topical drug were applied after a delay, the channels generated would become sealed off with exudate/blood and general tissue edema, thus preventing any further drug absorption. This would be more marked with the fractionated CO<sub>2</sub> laser because it generates more thermal injury than the fractionated Er:YAG laser. Therefore, <italic>timing</italic> of drug application may be important in the amount of drug absorption.</p>
<p>In addition, the treatment density of the fractionated device could be examined. In preclinical studies on a porcine model conducted by our group, reducing the treatment density of the fractionated Er:YAG laser led to less lidocaine being absorbed into the animal’s bloodstream (data not published). A further study would have to be conducted to test this hypothesis.</p>

<title>Limitations and Future Directions</title>
<p>In this study, only serum levels of lidocaine and its metabolite MEGX were measured. However, BLT contains 20% benzocaine as well as 4% tetracaine. Both of these drugs also have potential toxicity. The toxicity profile of lidocaine is fairly well investigated because of the work done in its role as an intravenous treatment for cardiac arrhythmias, but the literature examining the safety profile of the other 2 drugs is extremely limited. It would have been interesting to measure the serum levels of these drugs to note if they rose in a similar fashion to lidocaine.</p>
<p>Despite all patients stating that they would undergo future laser treatment with this method of anesthesia again, it is unclear whether they would have tolerated more than 1 pass at the deeper fluence. The amount of topical anesthetic applied was based on our previous study, in which 30 g of BLT was applied to the face with occlusion for 1 hour. While there were no controls, this present study demonstrated, on average, a 3-fold rise in serum levels with full ablative treatments compared with no laser at all (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1090820X13496248">Figure 3</xref>) and compared with historic results from our previous studies.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1090820X13496248">21</xref></sup></p>

</fig>
<p>These results suggest several areas for further investigation. First, in this study, a time of 20 minutes was arbitrarily chosen as sufficient to achieve anesthesia. The effect of a shortened period on serum levels of lidocaine/MEGX and pain scores is worthy of study. Second, investigators could compare the amount of BLT applied with serum levels and patient pain scores. The potential benefit of this would be that a lower dose of BLT (and, therefore, serum lidocaine/MEGX levels) could possibly be used with similar anesthetic effect. Third, if the dose of BLT is reduced, could it be reapplied at this lower dose (eg, 5 g between each laser pass), thus facilitating multipass laser treatments? An accumulative effect on a rise in serum lidocaine/MEGX levels would be expected, and this study would allow titration of serum levels against multipass laser treatments. Fourth, our previous study demonstrated that preparation of the drug has an effect on serum levels of lidocaine/MEGX when applied to the face with occlusion. Much of the literature surrounding laser-assisted topical analgesia uses EMLA as the study drug, probably because it is one of few Food and Drug Administration–approved topical anesthetics.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1090820X13496248">22</xref></sup> A study looking at the effect on differing drug absorption when used in combination with laser treatment would be useful, since a number of different topical lidocaine preparations are available over the counter as well as by prescription. It may well be that a certain specific preparation demonstrates better efficacy and safety than the others when used for laser treatments. Certainly, in our previous studies, LET (lidocaine, epinephrine, and tetracaine) topical anesthetic had a low systemic absorption compared with its counterparts.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1090820X13496248">21</xref></sup> This formulation may persist for longer at the dermal level because it includes epinephrine and therefore would have a longer analgesic effect. This would need further investigation.</p>
<p>Last, the influence of surface area treated in relationship to the laser treatment and the amount of drug applied has not been fully examined. In this study, the whole face was treated. However, laser treatments for specific cosmetic units (eg, the periorbital region for wrinkles) would require a lesser amount of topical anesthetic applied to a smaller area, and thus the amount of drug absorbed would be expected to be much less. This would render this method of analgesia less of a toxicity risk.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>This study is the first step in understanding the relationship between lidocaine-containing topical anesthetics and their interaction with laser treatments. It has demonstrated that there are differences in the amount of drug absorption depending on the type of laser used; ablative lasers significantly increase the amount of topical lidocaine absorption compared with fractionated lasers. Our data also highlight the fact that a patient’s ability to metabolize lidocaine is highly individual. It is therefore unsurprising that there are instances of toxicity and even death with seemingly innocuous topical applications of the drug. Topical anesthetics, however, can be a good form of anesthesia for laser treatments, relieving the need for nerve blocks, conscious sedation, or general anesthetics. Therefore, further work must be done to define the safety parameters for this method of analgesia.</p>
