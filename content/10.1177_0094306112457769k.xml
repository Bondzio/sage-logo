<p>Although south Florida has long been a destination for Cubans, the remaining southeastern states have not had a notable Latino presence since the Ponce de León and de Soto expeditions of the sixteenth century. This changed in the last half of the 1990s, when thousands of Latin American immigrants and U.S.-born Latinos began settling in Georgia, North Carolina, and Tennessee in response to labor market restructuring, radical changes in immigration laws, and the demand for construction and auxiliary services resulting from Sunbelt migration. The rapid demographic transformation of the U.S. Southeast has given rise to a new area of sociological research generally referred to as “new destination scholarship,” and <italic>The Latino Migration Experience in North Carolina</italic> provides a broad overview of the various areas of inquiry that now mark this new specialty.</p>
<p>Between 1990 and 2000, North Carolina boasted the largest Latino population growth rate of all U.S. states. Hannah Gill documents how this rapid transformation has affected North Carolina communities and how locals have responded to the presence of a new out-group whose phenotype, language, and way of life challenges traditional notions of what it means to be Southern. Although Gill acknowledges the hostility that many native North Carolinians feel toward those making an incursion into previously insular communities, she meticulously documents the positive impact of Latinos on local economies. Drawing on more than six years of ethnographic research, Gill gives voice to North Carolina’s Latino newcomers, focusing most of her attention on Mexican immigrants, who currently comprise the largest proportion of North Carolina’s Latino population.</p>
<p>Scholars familiar with the new destination literature will be impressed with Gill’s comprehensive overview of the complexity of the South’s demographic transformation. Gill takes pains to note that Latinos now living in the South are a heterogeneous population that includes both immigrants and the U.S.-born. Many of the farm hands, poultry workers, and entrepreneurs she interviews are unauthorized immigrants, but she also gives voice to U.S.-born Latinos, naturalized citizens, and H2A and H2B visa guest workers. She also documents the extreme plight of Central America’s indigenous people who arrive in the United States to discover that they must learn both English and Spanish to survive.</p>
<p>Gill stresses that Latinos are quickly becoming a part of the evolving landscape of the U.S. South. In fact, she concludes her book with a vignette of a middle-school classroom discussion of immigration. In response to a teacher’s question about which students in the class had immigrant ancestors, one Latina girl noted that her family was from somewhere in Mexico, but she did not know where because, “I am not an immigrant. I am from North Carolina.” Stories such as these underscore the second and third generation’s rapid acceptance of North Carolina as home.</p>
<p>One noteworthy feature of this book is that it emphasizes the reciprocal nature of assimilation. Just as Latino immigrants must adjust to life in new destinations, the long-time residents in these destinations must also change to accommodate newcomers who have shored up North Carolina’s flagging agriculture industry, provided inexpensive labor in highly competitive industries, and offset destructive native rural-to-urban migration streams. Change is difficult, however, and it is especially hard when misunderstandings abound. Gill notes that the widespread assumption that all Latinos are “illegals” coupled with the misconception that access to legal entry is available for most Latino immigrants who would avail themselves of it is common in North Carolina, and these assumptions color most Anglo-Latino relationships.</p>
<p>Another strength of Gill’s work is her attention to the important connections between life in Mexico and life in North Carolina. Although many Latinos in North Carolina are neither Mexican nor immigrants, most are, and the connections of trade and travel between the two places have forever marked both places of origin and destination. Gill provides a thick description of remote Mexican villages in Guanajuato and Oaxaca populated entirely by women, children, and the elderly. The economic uncertainty that communities face when sporadic remittances are the primary source of income, and the familial disruption that occurs when husbands’ planned short-term trip to <italic>Carolina del Norte</italic> turns into permanent settlement are described in disturbing detail.</p>
<p>Despite Gill’s comprehensive treatment of Latino life in North Carolina and the communities left behind in Mexico, there is little in the presentation that will surprise new destination scholars. The general findings of this ethnography have been documented by sociologists, historians, and anthropologists in more than a hundred peer-reviewed journal articles published over the last decade, and Gill makes no attempt to connect her work to ethnographic research conducted in other sites in the U.S. South. This is not a weakness nor an oversight of the book—it is intentional. Gill acknowledges early that she is writing to a general audience, and—although she does not acknowledge it overtly—her goal is to help uninformed readers view North Carolina’s Latinos with greater empathy and less hostility. Anyone who wants to gain a better understanding of new destination migration will clearly benefit from reading this book.</p>
