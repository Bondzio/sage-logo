<p>When I was seven years old, my aunt gave me juggling balls as a birthday present. Learning how to juggle was good for connecting both sides of the brain, she said, and this would enhance my creativity. Popular beliefs about brain hemispheres such as that inspiring my aunt’s choice of gift stand at the beginning of Lieb’s study on split-brain research and its consequences.</p>
<p>Lieb begins with a historical and philosophical contextualization of contemporary split-brain research by discussing the mind-body problem on the one hand, and notions of lateralization in the history of the brain sciences on the other. She points out that since at least the mid-nineteenth century, the left hemisphere has been associated with intellectual capacities, and the right hemisphere with emotions and coordination, encouraging a further association of the left hemisphere with masculinity and so-called ‘superior’ races, i.e. Europeans, and the right hemisphere with femininity and ‘inferior’ races (pp. 24–8).</p>
<p>Following this contextualization and a brief excursion into psychosurgery (pp. 28–33), Lieb arrives at the main part of her study: a detailed discussion of commissurotomy, particularly corpus callosotomy in epilepsy treatment and research. The author stresses that these surgeries had only a minor place in epilepsy therapy, and were only the last, palliative step if no other – pharmaceutical – therapy provided significant relief. The idea behind this surgery was that separating the two hemispheres would limit the seizures to one hemisphere and thus alleviate them (pp. 34–64). However, what was more important than the actual benefits for severe epilepsy cases was the psychiatric effect these surgeries had. It appeared that patients who underwent such an intervention had impaired or no communication between the hemispheres, and that the hemispheres responded differently to given tasks. Moreover, one hemisphere could not process information provided to the other hemisphere. As a result of these findings, it was speculated that there was hemispheric specialization in language, spatial and visual thinking, face recognition, and even consciousness in general (pp. 72–83).</p>
<p>These outcomes, Lieb emphasizes, found more attention within psychology than in neurology (p. 125). It was psychology that was interested in potential hemispheric specialization and propagated a strong dichotomy between the hemispheres. Soon, ‘every existing dichotomy’ in human behaviour and psychology had a correspondence to the two hemispheres. Since the psychiatric findings were much more relevant than surgery for epilepsy, Lieb says that she is more interested in those discourses (p. 133). However, the discussion of them is less detailed than the description of the neurological debates about the surgery and the famous CalTech case studies. While Lieb addresses questions of alleged gender differences and the influence of ‘handedness’ on hemispheric development and organization (pp. 39, 99, 142–6), it is a bit surprising that Anne Fausto-Sterling’s historical review on corpus callosum research, <italic>Sexing the Body</italic> (2000), and its consideration of gender is mentioned nowhere in the discussion.</p>
<p>The investigation of pop-cultural references to split-brain research is not as prominent as the book’s title and introduction suggest. The author intends to analyse the impact of split-brain research on popular culture in Germany and announces a detailed analysis of the archival material provided by a leading newspaper (<italic>Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung</italic>) and a leading weekly magazine (<italic>Der Spiegel</italic>). Yet the few pages which actually discuss these articles also include other publications and remain superficial (pp. 133–7). By analysing some further articles, as well as other sources of popular culture, most prominently the Peases’ work on gender differences (pp. 142–7), Lieb shows how hypotheses about hemispheric specialization find their way into popular culture and how they transform into facts on the way. As an explanation of why the public is interested in these findings, she suggests a general interest in New Age thinking in the 1970s and 1980s as well as a marketing potential for training both sides of the brain (pp. 159–164). However, the reader needs some more precise analytical work about how and why these changes occurred.</p>
<p>The author employs her own medical knowledge to make complex medical procedures accessible for a broad audience, but in her discussion of popular science, I would have appreciated references to current debates in the history of medicine, science studies, and particularly feminist debates about brain organization. Nonetheless, Lieb’s study provides a good literature overview of the recent history of split-brain research and its relevance for psychology and public discourse.</p>
