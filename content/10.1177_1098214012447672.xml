<abstract>
<p>The importance of evaluation use has led to a large amount of theoretical and empirical study. Evaluation use, however, is still not well understood. There is a need to capture the complexity of this phenomenon across a diverse range of contexts. In response to such complexities, the notion of “evaluation influence” emerged. This article presents a theory of evaluation influence within public sector partnerships. An analysis of key concepts is used to develop propositions about the relationships between evaluation attributes, partnership functioning and characteristics, partnership evaluation behavior, individual characteristics, contextual factors, and evaluation influence. The model highlights the complexities of evaluation influence and identifies a range of factors that evaluators can consider in practice. The model also extends on existing theories of evaluation influence in considering the role of individual characteristics, stakeholder evaluation behavior, and partnership contexts.</p>

<p>Evaluation as a discipline has had a long interest in its use. Initially, concern over use was driven by the desire to maximize the positive social impacts of evaluation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1098214012447672">Ciarlo, 1981</xref>), a theme that remains in the more recent literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1098214012447672">Mark &amp; Henry, 2004</xref>). Equally, those commissioning evaluation want to benefit from its potential to inform practice. The importance of evaluation use has led to a large amount of theoretical and empirical study over the past 30 years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1098214012447672">Caracelli &amp; Preskill, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1098214012447672">Cousins &amp; Leithwood, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1098214012447672">Kirkhart, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1098214012447672">Patton, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1098214012447672">Peck &amp; Gorzalski, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1098214012447672">Shula &amp; Cousins, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-1098214012447672">Weiss, 1979</xref>). Evaluation use, however, is a complex phenomenon that is still not well understood. These complexities are reflected in the various definitions and conceptualizations of evaluation use, each of which focus on different categories of use.</p>
<p>Evaluation use typically refers to one of four types of use; instrumental, conceptual, symbolic, and process use. Instrumental use refers to the use of evaluation findings for decision making, such as program continuation or change (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1098214012447672">Rich, 1977</xref>). Conceptual use includes enlightenment or general learning through evaluation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1098214012447672">Rich, 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-1098214012447672">Weiss &amp; Bucuvalas, 1980</xref>). The use of evaluation to justify existing views with no real intention of benefiting from the process or findings is termed symbolic use (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1098214012447672">Patton, 2008</xref>). Process use refers to learning or change that is stimulated by the learning that occurs during the process of an evaluation rather than its findings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1098214012447672">Patton, 2008</xref>). To fully capture the multiple ways in which evaluation can affect programs, policies, and stakeholders, however, discussions have turned to the notion of “evaluation influence” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1098214012447672">Henry &amp; Mark, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1098214012447672">Kirkhart, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1098214012447672">Mark &amp; Henry, 2004</xref>). A term originally coined by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1098214012447672">Kirkhart (2000</xref>) and developed further by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1098214012447672">Mark and Henry (2004</xref>), this term encompasses traditional conceptions of use, as well as various changes at the individual, interpersonal, and collective levels. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1098214012447672">Mark and Henry (2004</xref>) present a theory of evaluation influence that depicts the numerous factors that can affect the influence of an evaluation, including context. This model is particularly relevant for this article, which seeks to build on the notion that evaluation influence is impacted on by many factors within an evaluation environment. To support this notion, this article builds on the work of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1098214012447672">Mark and Henry (2004</xref>) by presenting a conceptual model of evaluation influence within public sector partnerships. Specifically, this article uses public health partnerships as an example to explore the complexities of evaluation influence in a partnership context.</p>
<p>The public sector involves services that are built on the notion of public good or services based on universal access for the citizenry rather than private provision through market mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1098214012447672">Broadbent &amp; Guthrie, 2008</xref>). While the public sector varies in different countries, it generally includes health care, education, the police, and local Government services. An increased focus on whole systems approaches has seen an increase in public sector partnerships. These partnerships typically seek to address the complex social problems facing modern society through enhancing collaboration and coordination across organizations and sectors. At an international level for example, public–private partnerships between health organizations have worked to expand access to drugs and vaccines in poor countries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1098214012447672">Reich, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1098214012447672">Smith, 2000</xref>). Partnerships have also been a key focus in the United States, with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1098214012447672">Lasker, Weiss, and Miller (2001</xref>, p. 179) noting the vast investment in “thousands of alliances, coalitions, consortia and other health partnerships.” Similar trends have also been seen in countries such as Canada, the United Kingdom, and Australia. In public health specifically, partnerships are often working to tackle issues such as obesity, teenage pregnancy, and social exclusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-1098214012447672">Institute of Medicine, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-1098214012447672">Department of Health, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>The term partnership encompasses a broad range of relationships between organizations and sectors. Public sector partnerships maybe working within- or across-sectors, with private or not-for-profit organizations for various purposes. This diversity makes partnerships difficult to define. As a consequence, terms such as coordination, cooperation, collaboration, networks, and partnerships are often used interchangeably and sometimes incorrectly. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1098214012447672">Lasker et al. (2001</xref>, p. 180) describe partnerships as enabling “different people and organizations to support each other by leveraging, combining and capitalizing on their complementary strengths and capabilities.” This description captures the notion underpinning partnerships. In practice, however, securing the level of functioning needed to produce the intended benefits can be challenging. This article adopts a broad definition of partnerships in reflection of the diversity of partnership arrangements in the public sector. The definition also includes a specific focus on public health. Specifically, public health partnerships are defined here as “organizational partnerships (of two or more organizational bodies), which aim to improve public health outcomes (through population health improvement and/or reduction in health inequalities)” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1098214012447672">Smith et al., 2009</xref>, p. 2).</p>
<p>The diversity and complexity of public sector partnerships in terms of their characteristics and functioning sees evaluators working with programs with increasingly complex political and organizational structures that pose additional challenges to evaluation design and influence. Further, the literature suggests many of the characteristics that are important for partnership functioning, such as mutual trust, joint decision making, and open communication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1098214012447672">Mandell &amp; Keast, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1098214012447672">Smith et al., 2009</xref>), are also important for evaluation use within organizations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1098214012447672">Johnson et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1098214012447672">Preskill, Zuckerman, &amp; Matthews, 2003</xref>). Furthering our understanding of evaluation influence within partnerships, therefore, is also likely to contribute to our general understanding of evaluation influence.</p>
<p>There is little literature on evaluation influence within partnerships specifically. Existing evaluation literature, however, does identify a range of factors that are likely to be important for evaluation influence within partnerships. This article uses this literature to provide an in-depth analysis of existing concepts that appear to be important for evaluation influence within partnerships. Specifically, current literature will be critically analyzed to present propositions that explore the relationships that are important for evaluation influence within public sector partnerships, with public health partnerships used as an example. This analysis will build on the work of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1098214012447672">Mark and Henry (2004</xref>) to develop a conceptual model to enhance our understanding of evaluation influence across different contexts.</p>
<p>The article will begin with a brief review of key literature on evaluation use and influence to identify some of the key concepts informing the model. The model is then described through four key stages using literature relating to (1) evaluation attributes, (2) partnership functioning, characteristics and evaluation behavior, (3) evaluation influence and individual characteristics, and (4) contextual factors. The model is by no means complete or conclusive. In actual fact, it highlights a number of gaps within the field. In this respect, the model will be able to guide future research, while also contributing to current evaluation theories and practice.</p>

<title>Understanding Evaluation Use and Influence</title>
<p>Evaluation use typically refers to one of four types of use including instrumental, conceptual, symbolic, and process use. While these conceptualizations of use are important, it has been suggested they do not fully capture the multiple mechanisms and pathways through which evaluation can affect stakeholders, programs, and policies. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1098214012447672">Kirkhart (2000</xref>) adopted the term “evaluation influence” to capture the multidirectional, incremental, unintentional, and unidirectional influences of evaluation that are not captured in the term “use.” The term seeks to ensure that the complexities of use are fully captured, explored, and understood. Kirkhart’s (2000) integrated theory of evaluation influence includes three key dimensions, source of influence (process and use), intention (unintended and intended), and time frame (immediate, end of cycle, and long term).</p>
<p>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1098214012447672">Mark and Henry (2004</xref>) developed this work further by presenting a schematic theory of evaluation influence. Their work builds on an earlier model of evaluation influence that focused on participatory approaches to evaluation by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1098214012447672">Cousins (2003</xref>). Importantly for this article, their generic model captures the importance of contextual factors without focusing on one specific evaluation approach. For example, the model reflects the evaluation context (human and other evaluation resources), the decision making/policy setting, and the potential role of contextual factors in evaluation influence. These aspects of influence are likely to be particularly relevant to a partnership context due to the added complexities that partnership can bring to an evaluation context, particularly when a partnership is struggling to secure harmonious functioning.</p>
<p>Mark and Henry’s (2004) theory also draws on research traditions outside of evaluation, as they identify the multiple pathways and mechanisms through which evaluation can influence attitudes and action. Overall, this theory suggests that evaluation influence can occur at the individual, interpersonal, and collective levels. Mechanisms of evaluation influence include changes in attitudes or beliefs at the individual level; persuasion or justification at the interpersonal level and changes in policy or agenda setting at the collective level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1098214012447672">Henry &amp; Mark, 2003</xref>). The authors’ article in 2004 further classifies the mechanisms into four kinds including general mechanisms, cognitive and affective (or attitudinal) processes, motivational outcomes, and behavioral outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1098214012447672">Mark &amp; Henry, 2004</xref>). While recognizing these processes, the model presented in this article also highlights the role of partnership functioning, stakeholder behavior, and individual characteristics in facilitating evaluation influence mechanisms into outcomes.</p>
<p>Mark and Henry’s (2004) theory of evaluation influence also encourages us to reconsider the impact of evaluation and the changes processes that evaluations can ignite. While their work begins to drill down to the specific mechanisms of evaluation influence, this model has not been populated with data and some also argue for greater clarity of the model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-1098214012447672">Weiss, Murphy-Graham, &amp; Birkeland, 2005</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1098214012447672">Mark and Henry (2004</xref>) also advocate for exploring the model within specific contexts. This article begins to do this by examining evaluation influence within public health partnerships.</p>

<sec id="section3-1098214012447672">
<title>Understanding Evaluation Influence: The Role of Evaluation Attributes</title>
<p>The first component of the model includes the evaluation attributes that are identified as important for evaluation influence in the literature (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1098214012447672">Figure 1</xref>). An evaluation’s focus and rationale are considered important, as they impact on the evaluation approach. Here, an evaluation approach refers to the type of evaluation undertaken, such as formative or summative, as well as the specific theories that may underpin the evaluation. There are a wide range of evaluation approaches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1098214012447672">Stufflebeam &amp; Shinkfield, 2007</xref>), and these approaches impact evaluation attributes and subsequently evaluation influence. Equally, influence is promoted and valued differently across evaluation approaches. For example, a utilization-focused approach will have a greater focus on usage than many other approaches. A survey of evaluators has also highlighted the importance of an evaluation’s approach in facilitating use (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1098214012447672">Fleischer &amp; Christie, 2009</xref>). An evaluation’s approach also affects evaluation activities, such as the degree of stakeholder participation. A participatory approach has been associated with evaluation use (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-1098214012447672">Weiss, 1979</xref>), and stakeholder participation has also been associated with enhanced influence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1098214012447672">Christie, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1098214012447672">Greene, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1098214012447672">Turnbull, 1999</xref>). These findings highlight the potential impact of an evaluation’s approach on evaluation influence. In saying this, our understanding of the importance of factors such as stakeholder participation still lacks clarity. It is unclear what level of participation is important, which stakeholders need to be participating and when to support different influences. The potential importance of the evaluation approach, its focus, and rationale, however, warrant the inclusion of these factors in the “evaluation attributes” component of the model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1098214012447672">Figure 1</xref>).</p>

</fig>
<p>The literature describes a diverse range of evaluator roles, which are reviewed in detail by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1098214012447672">Ryan and Schwandt (2002</xref>). Some definitions focus on the actions of the evaluator during the evaluation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1098214012447672">Greene, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1098214012447672">Patton, 2008</xref>); while some focus on the internal or external status of the evaluator (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1098214012447672">Weiss, 1998</xref>). Other definitions also draw on the influence that the evaluator role can have on the programs and communities within which they work, such as social betterment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1098214012447672">Mark, Henry, &amp; Julnes, 2000</xref>) or empowerment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1098214012447672">Fetterman, 2001</xref>). Regardless of these various definitions, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1098214012447672">Ryan and Schwandt (2002</xref>) posit that all evaluators make decisions on their role and other aspects of the evaluation. It is these decisions that will affect the entire evaluation process and its influence. Evaluator roles suggested as important for influence include the broadening of the evaluator role to support stakeholder participation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1098214012447672">Cousins, 2003</xref>), and the evaluator as a mutual partner of stakeholders and a coproducer of knowledge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1098214012447672">Rossman &amp; Rallis, 2000</xref>). Therefore, it is important that the evaluator and their role are captured in the model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1098214012447672">Figure 1</xref>).</p>
<p>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1098214012447672">Skolits, Morrow, and Burr (2009</xref>), however, suggest that the demands of evaluation require evaluators to adopt a variety of roles during an evaluation. This notion suggests that it is not only the evaluator role that is important; evaluator skills and expertise are also likely to be important. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1098214012447672">Preskill, Zuckerman, and Matthews (2003</xref>) found that evaluator control and the level of dialogue and reflection during meetings were important facilitators of process use. In their review of 41 studies, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1098214012447672">Johnson et al. (2009</xref>) also suggest that evaluator competence, both professional and cultural, are important for evaluation influence. Mark and Henry’s (2004) theory also highlights the importance of evaluator attributes including expertise and role flexibility. Evaluator skills, expertise, flexibility, and cultural competence, therefore, are also captured in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1098214012447672">Figure 1</xref>.</p>
<p>In terms of evaluation feedback and findings, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1098214012447672">Mark and Henry (2004</xref>) highlight the importance of sophistication, credibility, timeliness, responsiveness, and communication. More specifically, the inclusion of these attributes builds on the work of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1098214012447672">Cousins (2003</xref>) who highlighted the importance of these attributes of evaluation feedback for participatory evaluation. As one would anticipate evaluations that are perceived to provide credible feedback that responds to the needs of stakeholders in terms of information needs and sophistication will be more influential. Equally, feedback must be timely to enhance some influences, and good communication is likely to support this process. Quality has also been added to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1098214012447672">Figure 1</xref>, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1098214012447672">Henry (2003</xref>) found that evaluations of high technical quality were more likely to be influential. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1098214012447672">Figure 1</xref> captures each of these attributes of evaluation feedback. In practice, however, evaluation attributes do not exist in isolation. Evaluation design, implementation, and outputs are affected by the evaluation environment and context. The next stage of the model begins to recognize the contribution of the partnership context to evaluation influence.</p>

<title>Understanding Evaluation Influence: Partnership Functioning, Characteristics and Evaluation Behavior</title>
<p>For partnerships to achieve their potential, they need to reach a level of harmonious functioning. The dynamic and complex nature of partnerships, however, poses challenges to achieving this. While we are still learning about the factors that enhance functioning, the literature does highlight some important contributors. For example, partnerships experiencing mutual trust, shared power and decision making, open communication, and appropriate leadership are more likely to function effectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1098214012447672">Alexander, Comfort, Weiner, &amp; Bogue, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1098214012447672">Casey, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1098214012447672">Dowling, Powell, &amp; Glendinning, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1098214012447672">Mandell &amp; Keast, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1098214012447672">Smith et al., 2009</xref>). Achieving mutuality within the public sector, however, can be challenging. Traditionally, the sector is managed through hierarchies that do not lend themselves well to the notion of shared power or decision making. Public health partnerships for example, are often working within a context that typically includes long-standing hierarchical relationships between organizations, existing contractual relationships, and strong demands for accountability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1098214012447672">Keast, Mandell, Brown, &amp; Woolcock, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1098214012447672">Lewis, 2005</xref>). It is these challenges to partnership functioning that will also mediate evaluation influence.</p>
<p>In terms of partnership functioning, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1098214012447672">Figure 2</xref> suggests that the clarity of a partnership’s purpose will mediate evaluation influence. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1098214012447672">Austin (2000</xref>) notes the incongruence in perceptions and expectations of partnerships as a potential source of conflict between partnership members. While there is little evidence that directly associates this factor with influence, it is likely to be important due to its potential to affect the functioning of the partnership and the responsiveness of the evaluation. For example, if the partnership’s purpose is not clear, then it will be difficult for the partnership to respond to the evaluation, as the unclear sense of purpose will hinder the partnership in moving forward and using the evaluation to support this process.</p>

</fig>
<p>A sense of ownership is also captured in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1098214012447672">Figure 2</xref>. This factor is important for partnership functioning, as ownership can affect an individual’s involvement in the partnership (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-1098214012447672">Weiss, Anderson, &amp; Lasker, 2002</xref>). The model proposes that a lack of ownership among partnership members will result in limited involvement in the partnership and its evaluation. Therefore, ownership has the potential to mediate evaluation influence, as participation is a key facilitator of evaluation influence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1098214012447672">Fleischer &amp; Christie, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Partnership culture is a crucial aspect of partnership functioning and reflects the type of relationships that exist between partners. Key elements of partnership culture include trust, power differentials, and communication. Trust, open communication, and information sharing are all important for securing a culture of learning and reflection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1098214012447672">Antonacopoulou, 2006</xref>; Preskill &amp; Torres, 2000a). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1098214012447672">Preskill et al. (2003</xref>) also highlights the importance of trust among members for securing a climate of risk taking to support learning and change. The authors also found that power differentials between group members sometimes hindered open dialogue. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1098214012447672">Lasker et al. (2001</xref>, p. 192) note that “it is only possible for the group to think in new ways if partners are able to talk to each other and are influenced by what they hear.” Collectively, this literature highlights the importance of trust, power, and communication in facilitating a learning culture and enhancing the opportunity for evaluation influence to occur. Thus, these factors are captured in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1098214012447672">Figure 2</xref>.</p>
<p>Within organizations, leadership typically refers to a formal hierarchical position with the authority to impose actions and decisions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1098214012447672">Alexander et al., 2001</xref>). For partnerships, however, leadership can be more complicated. Leaders do not have authority over their partnership members, and so partnership leaders need to strike a balance between power sharing and control and between interpersonal trust and formal procedures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1098214012447672">Alexander et al., 2001</xref>). This requires a different set of skills to those needed for traditional leadership roles and can pose challenges to partnership functioning, as leaders are sometimes ill prepared for this role. The literature suggests leadership is also important for evaluation influence. Openness and transformational leadership can facilitate learning within organizations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1098214012447672">Hult, Hurley, Giunipero, &amp; Nichols, 2000</xref>), as can managerial support for engaging in learning-based activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1098214012447672">Ramus &amp; Steger, 2000</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1098214012447672">Patton (2008</xref>) also highlights the value in engaging key decision makers to facilitate use. These findings suggest that the support for evaluation from leadership and other influential members within the partnership is important for evaluation influence.</p>
<p>The degree of participatory decision making within a partnership is important for partnership functioning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1098214012447672">Casey, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1098214012447672">Mandell &amp; Keast, 2008</xref>). While there is no evidence on the direct role of participatory decision making in evaluation influence, its connection to power differentials, open communication, and trust suggests that partnerships adopting a participatory approach to decision making will be better placed to facilitate influence. In particular, influences beyond the level of individual partnership members will be more likely as open discussions between members could trigger influences between members and across the partnership.</p>
<p>Knowledge management refers to the ways in which the knowledge held by individuals is used to support decision making and action. The aim of knowledge management is for organizations or partnerships “to become aware of its knowledge, individually and collectively, and to shape itself so that it makes the most effective and efficient use of the knowledge it has or can obtain” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1098214012447672">Bennet &amp; Bennet, 2003</xref>, p. 440). Policies and strategies to facilitate knowledge management are important for facilitating learning and change (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1098214012447672">Keen &amp; Mahanty, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1098214012447672">Muro &amp; Jeffrey, 2008</xref>), and hence evaluation influence. For example, successful knowledge management strategies can result in increased communication, participation, and improved problem-solving capabilities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1098214012447672">Alavi &amp; Leidner, 1999</xref>).</p>
<p>Systems to manage and respond to evaluation information are also important for evaluation influence. While there is less evidence on the importance of these systems in the literature, they potentially represent the systems whereby the partnership process evaluation mechanisms into outcomes, particularly for partnership level influences. The importance of these attributes is also highlighted in their inclusion in tools designed to assess partnership functioning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1098214012447672">Strategic Partnering Taskforce, 2003</xref>), and readiness for evaluation and organizational learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1098214012447672">Preskill &amp; Torres, 2009</xref>). Thus, knowledge management policy, information sharing, and adaptation/change processes are included in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1098214012447672">Figure 2</xref>.</p>
<p>Partnership characteristics are included in the model due to their potential to impact on partnership functioning and subsequently evaluation influence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1098214012447672">Figure 2</xref>). The important characteristics are purpose, size, complexity, and level of collaboration. The purpose of the partnership is important due to its impact on the other partnership characteristics. For example, the purpose of the partnership will influence the level of collaboration and the complexity of the partnership. A partnership can encompass many different levels of collaboration including networking, coordination, cooperation, or collaboration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1098214012447672">Himmelman, 2001</xref>). These various levels of collaboration will impact on the type of relationships between partnership members and partnership functioning. For example, collaborative partnerships require significant investment in establishing relationships and are often more difficult to achieve (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1098214012447672">Mandell &amp; Keast, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>Partnership size is also important due to its potential to impact on partnership functioning. For example, partnerships that are very large may become too complex, difficult to lead, and challenging to secure harmonious functioning. This notion is supported by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1098214012447672">Garcia-Canal, Valdez-Llaneza, and Arinio (2003</xref>) who noted that there are fewer interests to harmonize in two-way alliances than multiple cross-sector partnerships. Therefore, larger partnerships can impact on the clarity of a partnerships purpose and its functioning, as multiple perceptions and expectations are brought to the table (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1098214012447672">Austin, 2000</xref>), and need to be managed.</p>
<p>Complexity can also be a consequence of the way that the partnership is resourced. For example, public health partnerships with multiple funding sources may experience greater levels of complexity due to the multiple accountability requirements that these funding sources can bring. Equally, partnerships may be funded at least partially on competitive contracts. This can challenge functioning, as they rely upon and display hierarchical and market mechanisms and characteristics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1098214012447672">Lewis, Baeza, &amp; Alexander, 2008</xref>). The resulting tensions between competition and collaboration have been associated with strained partner relationships and difficulties in formalizing a partnership approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1098214012447672">Babiak &amp; Thibault, 2009</xref>). Public health partnerships may also be externally mandated or voluntary. These types of partnerships function quite differently from networks which emerge on the basis of mutual benefit, trust, and reciprocity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1098214012447672">Lowndes &amp; Skelcher, 1998</xref>).</p>
<p>Given the potential importance of stakeholder participation, the model suggests that evaluation influence will be mediated by the partnership’s evaluation behavior (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1098214012447672">Figure 2</xref>). This concept refers to the partnership’s participation in the evaluation, their support for the evaluation, and their readiness to engage in the evaluation. The model proposes that these factors can mediate the impact of evaluation influence. This notion is supported by an early review of 65 empirical studies by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1098214012447672">Cousins and Leithwood (1986</xref>), which suggested that stakeholder involvement and commitment to evaluation were important characteristics for use. For example, if partnership support for the evaluation is low, it is less likely be influential, as it will not have buy-in and engagement from the partnership.</p>
<p>Evaluation readiness refers to the preparedness of the partnership to engage in evaluation. Specifically, it relates to their willingness and capacity to evaluate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1098214012447672">Clinton, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1098214012447672">Stockdill, Baizerman, &amp; Compton, 2002</xref>). Capacity refers to the resources that they have available to support the evaluation, such as time; and willingness refers to their attitude toward the evaluation and their cooperation in the process. The model proposes that partnerships exhibiting higher levels of readiness will facilitate influence, as partnership members will have higher levels of engagement in the evaluation and be more open to its feedback.</p>

<title>Understanding Evaluation Influence: Mechanisms and Outcomes of Evaluation Influence, and Individual Characteristics</title>
<p>The mechanisms and outcomes of evaluation influence represent change or action as a consequence of evaluation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1098214012447672">Mark &amp; Henry, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1098214012447672">Figure 3</xref>). The mechanisms of evaluation influence include elaboration, heuristics, priming, and skill acquisition at the individual level. Justification, persuasion, and minority opinion influence are interpersonal level mechanisms and policy consideration, standard setting, policy discussion and deliberation, and coalition formation reflect collective level mechanisms. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1098214012447672">Mark and Henry (2004</xref>) describe these as general influence processes and suggest that these are the key starting points for change. They suggest that it is these processes that are likely to lead to some change in the cognitive/affective, motivational, and behavioral processes that follow. For example, an individual may engage in elaboration when reading an evaluation report. The findings in this report may cause the reader to think more or differently about certain aspects of their program. While this is an important first step, it is any resulting changes in the person’s attitudes, motivations, or actions that are of interest to those seeking to understand evaluation influence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1098214012447672">Mark &amp; Henry, 2004</xref>).</p>

<p>
<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1098214012447672">Figure 3</xref>, however, suggests that the transformation of these mechanisms into outcomes is mediated by an individual’s characteristics. More specifically, the model suggests that an individual’s evaluation readiness, and existing knowledge and attitudes will mediate the outcomes of evaluation influence. For example, a simulation study conducted by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1098214012447672">Christie (2007</xref>) suggests that the influence of evaluation data is mediated by decision makers’ previous beliefs about program efficacy. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1098214012447672">Christie (2007</xref>) notes that once decision makers believe in a program they are less likely to be influenced by anecdotal or case study data. Earlier work has also suggested that evaluation use and behavior change is affected by individual values and beliefs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1098214012447672">Rogers, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-1098214012447672">Weiss, 1983</xref>). In terms of an individual’s willingness and capacity for evaluation, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1098214012447672">Preskill et al. (2003</xref>) suggests that learning through participation in evaluation can be affected by individual’s previous experiences of evaluation and previous training. With regard to partnerships specifically, an individual’s involvement in the partnership is also likely to be an important mediator, as it will affect engagement in the evaluation, and potential for influence.</p>

<sec id="section6-1098214012447672">
<title>Contextual Factors</title>
<p>Public sector partnerships are operating within a specific policy context and the role of context needs to be understood if we are to learn more about the pathways of evaluation influence. The role of contextual factors is highlighted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1098214012447672">Figure 4</xref>, as some of the features of the public sector may be important mediators of partnership functioning and evaluation influence. For example, traditional policies and management techniques within the public sector do not lend themselves well to the notion of shared power and decision making required for partnership working (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1098214012447672">Keast et al., 2004</xref>). Competitive markets within the sector can also see partner organizations competing for the same funding pools, a potential challenge to trust and openness, and subsequently evaluation influence within the partnership. The impact of competitiveness on trust building is also highlighted by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1098214012447672">Babiak and Thibault (2009</xref>). Accountability requirements also mediate evaluation influence, as they can affect the type of evaluation conducted. Within the health sector for example, it has been suggested that evaluation can focus on outcomes at the cost of understanding process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1098214012447672">Keast, Mandell, &amp; Brown, 2007</xref>). These perceptions of “evidence” can also affect perceptions of evaluation credibility, quality, responsiveness, and ultimately influence. Evaluation is also just one of many activities facing public sector partnerships, competing priorities can result in limited resources and time to engage in evaluation. Each of these factors can impact on partnership evaluation behavior and influence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1098214012447672">Figure 4</xref>).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>This article provides an analysis of key concepts that are important for evaluation influence within public sector partnerships. This critical analysis builds on the work of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1098214012447672">Mark and Henry (2004</xref>) to develop propositions about the relationships between evaluation attributes, partnership functioning, stakeholder evaluation behavior and characteristics, contextual factors, and evaluation influence. The model contributes to existing theories of evaluation influence by highlighting the importance of stakeholder evaluation behavior, individual characteristics, and contextual factors. The model also contributes to our understanding of evaluation influence within partnerships, and public sector partnerships specifically. Overall, the model identifies the complexities of evaluation influence pathways, and the ways in which stakeholders and their organizational and political context can mediate influence.</p>
<p>With respect to the evaluation attributes, the model highlights the importance of the evaluation approach and design, the evaluator, and the evaluation outputs. Specifically, the model identifies a participatory approach, the evaluator and the credibility, timeliness, responsiveness, and technical quality of evaluation outputs as important for influence. Partnership functioning is highlighted as a key mediator of evaluation influence, with partnership arrangements, such as leadership, decision making and adaptation or change processes, and partnership culture being important. The model also suggests that partnership characteristics, such as size and complexity are important due to their impact on partnership functioning. The model presented here also notes the importance of stakeholder behavior and individual characteristics; with evaluation readiness, existing knowledge and attitudes, and participation in evaluation identified as mediators of influence. Contextual factors that are noted as important included the time and resources dedicated to evaluation, as well as the organizational and political context of a partnership.</p>
<p>In terms of current practice, the model highlights a number of factors that warrant consideration by evaluators. In fact, the model suggests that the evaluator is important for triggering evaluation influence due to their impact on the evaluation attributes. For example, the literature underpinning the model suggests that influence is facilitated by participatory evaluations that are undertaken by appropriately skilled evaluators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1098214012447672">Christie, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1098214012447672">Greene, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1098214012447672">Johnson et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1098214012447672">Turnbull, 1999</xref>). Feedback that is of sound technical quality, timely, sophisticated, credible, and responsive to stakeholder needs will also be more influential (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1098214012447672">Cousins, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1098214012447672">Mark &amp; Henry, 2004</xref>). This suggests that evaluators can seek to enhance influence by adopting a participatory approach that is responsive to stakeholder needs, while also providing an evaluation that produces technically sound and appropriately sophisticated feedback.</p>
<p>The model highlights the reciprocal nature of the pathways to evaluation influence. Indeed, evaluation attributes alone are not enough to achieve influence. Achieving evaluation influence is likely to involve commitment from both evaluators and stakeholders. In terms of partnerships specifically, the model suggests that partnership functioning is a key mediator of evaluation influence. An analysis of the existing literature suggests that partnerships struggling to secure harmonious functioning will present more challenges to evaluation influence than those with higher functioning levels. While partnership functioning can present some challenges to influence, the model does highlight a number of factors for evaluators to consider when working with partnerships.</p>
<p>The literature underpinning the model highlights the important role of leadership and decision makers in evaluation influence and other learning-based activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1098214012447672">Hult et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1098214012447672">Patton, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1098214012447672">Ramus &amp; Steger, 2000</xref>). This suggests that evaluators could maximize their opportunity for influence by engaging leadership and other key decision makers in the evaluation and its processes. The importance of adaptation or change processes to respond to evaluation was also highlighted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1098214012447672">Preskill &amp; Torres, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1098214012447672">Strategic Partnering Taskforce, 2003</xref>). Evaluators, therefore, can also seek to enhance influence by identifying and facilitating these processes. This may be particularly important when working with partnerships, as their processes and procedures may not be well established.</p>
<p>In terms of the broader context, the model highlights the importance of current policy, traditional policies and management techniques, and public sector support for evaluation. These factors were important for both partnership functioning and evaluation influence. This component of the model highlights a number of challenges to influence that are beyond the control of the evaluator. Addressing such challenges would require support from the public sector. For example, the model suggests that the sector can facilitate influence when appropriate resources and time are dedicated to evaluation. This component of the model also reinforces the reciprocal nature of evaluation influence. While an evaluator can adopt strategies to facilitate evaluation influence, it is the combination of evaluation attributes and other factors within the model that provide the opportunity for influence to occur.</p>
<p>The model presented here contributes to our understanding of evaluation influence; however, it is by no means complete or conclusive. The model draws on literature from different disciplines and further research is needed to understand the importance of the models components for evaluation influence specifically. For example, research on the role of partnership functioning in evaluation influence is warranted, as much of the evidence is based on other learning-based activities. To further inform practice, research could also seek to populate the model with data to identify the crucial components of the model. Research focusing on specific factors within the model is also warranted. For example, research could explore the level and type of participation needed to facilitate influence, as well as which members of the partnership need to participate to facilitate influence at individual, interpersonal, and collective levels. Indeed, this type of information would be useful for identifying the ways in which evaluation could seek to enhance its influence across the public sector.</p>
<p>The model has proposed some relationships between the components of the model. Currently, however, the evidence behind these connections is limited. The model would benefit from a greater understanding of the connections between the factors within the model. For example, it would be useful to explore whether any evaluation approaches and activities, such as participatory approaches, and evaluation capacity building could enhance partnership functioning and evaluation behavior with a view to facilitating influence. This type of evidence would help inform existing theories and evaluation practice, as well as informing our expectations of an evaluators’ capacity to achieve evaluation influence.</p>
