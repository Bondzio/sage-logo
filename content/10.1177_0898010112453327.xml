<abstract>
<p><bold>Purpose:</bold> The purpose of this study was to develop the Holistic Wellness Assessment (HWA) that incorporates conventional dimensions of wellness with a new dimension of wellness influencing young adults: financial wellness that is psychometrically sound and developmentally appropriate. <bold>Design of the study:</bold> The study design to establish the initial psychometrics of the HWA was the single-group design. The cross-sectional nature of this design allowed for the postclassification of the participants into different demographic groups facilitating comparisons of the instrument’s derived subscales. <bold>Method:</bold> From 5,075 university students, 2,090 participants completed an online 285-item HWA and 2,086 respondents provided demographic information. <bold>Results:</bold> Exploratory factor analysis of the HWA revealed eight dimensions: Self-Regard, Self-Awareness and Responsibility, Sustainability, Relational, Risk Prevention, Spirituality, Physical Health, and Health Care Maintenance. <bold>Findings:</bold> Four of the eight factors were consistent with existing models of wellness. Three new dimensions of wellness— Self-Regard, Self-Awareness and Responsibility, and Sustainability—emerged from the comprehensive item set that included financial wellness and will set the stage for the development and expansion of wellness models and theories. <bold>Conclusion:</bold> Initial psychometric analysis suggests that this instrument may prove useful in the young adult population for measuring wellness awareness curriculum and behavior change outcomes.</p>

<title>Holistic Wellness Assessment</title>
<sec id="section2-0898010112453327">
<title>Theoretical Framework</title>
<p>The concept of wellness was first defined by the World Health Organization (WHO) in 1947 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0898010112453327">WHO, 1958</xref>); however, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0898010112453327">Dunn (1961)</xref> is considered to be the “architect” of the wellness movement, which focuses on maximizing the potential of the individual. Dunn fostered a new perception of health, veering from the traditional medical model’s five Ds: dissatisfaction, discomfort, disability, disease, and death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0898010112453327">Edlin &amp; Golanty, 2004</xref>). As new views and models of health and wellness began to emerge in the literature and curriculum, evaluative tools were needed to validate and promote the essential aspects of the different wellness models. To wit, in many postsecondary education holistic health programs where individuals are likely to be first introduced to these models, the coursework will often incorporate a wellness self-assessment. Often these self-assessments are completed in a pre–posttest setting allowing students to judge their personal growth over the course as well as providing curriculum-related evaluation information to the course instructors. However, because of the robust number of wellness models and associated assessments there remains a need for a current and comprehensive model and wellness assessment.</p>
<p>A common characteristic shared among different wellness models is that they are all dimensional or taxonomic in form. To illustrate, one of the most prominent wellness models taught in the typical undergraduate curriculum is <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0898010112453327">Hettler’s (1984)</xref> wellness model. This model postulates six broad dimensions of health-related behavior: physical wellness, emotional wellness, spiritual wellness, social wellness, occupational wellness, and intellectual wellness cast from the medical (disease-based) model. Consistent with Hettler’s wellness model, The National Wellness Institute created and maintains two instruments, the 100-item Wellness Inventory of the Life Assessment Questionnaire (LAQ; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0898010112453327">National Wellness Institute, 1983</xref>) and the TestWell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0898010112453327">National Wellness Institute, 1992</xref>). The TestWell assessment currently has four versions targeting different age groups: teen, college student, adult, and older adult. The assessment version for college students has 100 questions spanning 10 categories of Physical Fitness and Nutrition, Medical Self-Care, Emotional Management, Intellectual Wellness, Occupational Wellness, Spirituality and Values, Safety, Environmental Wellness, Social Awareness and Sexuality and Emotional Awareness.</p>
<p>Parallel to the development of the LAQ, the Wellness Evaluation of Lifestyle (WEL; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0898010112453327">Myers, Luecht, &amp; Sweeney, 2004</xref>), instrument founded in the works of Adler (1956), <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0898010112453327">Jung (1958)</xref>, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0898010112453327">Maslow (1954/1970)</xref> has its theoretical foundation in the Wheel of Wellness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0898010112453327">Myers, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0898010112453327">Witmer, Sweeney, &amp; Myers, 1998</xref>). This instrument measures 16 dimensions of healthy functioning factored down to five life tasks: Creative, Coping, Social, Essential, and Physical. The five life tasks have recently been revised to a 4F-WEL with four factors of Spiritual, Physical, Cognitive-Emotional, and Relational Wellness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0898010112453327">Hattie, Myers, &amp; Sweeney, 2004</xref>). The WEL has been through several revisions reflective of changes in the understanding and scope of wellness; the current version, WEL-S, includes 120 items appropriate for people aged 10 to 56+ years.</p>
<p>Other wellness instruments that have been developed are the following: Perceived Wellness Survey (PWS; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0898010112453327">Adams, Bezner, &amp; Steinhardt, 1997</xref>), Optimal Living Profile (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0898010112453327">Renger et al., 2000</xref>), and the Wellness Inventory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0898010112453327">Travis, 1981</xref>). The PWS is a 36-item assessment covering six domains of wellness: physical, intellectual, emotional, psychological, social, and spiritual. The Optimal Living Profile is a 135-question profile covering six aspects of wellness: environmental, spiritual, social, physical, emotional, and intellectual. The Wellness Inventory is a 120-item inventory measuring 12 dimensions of wellness: self-responsibility and love, breathing, sensing, eating, moving, feeling, thinking, playing and working, communication, sex, finding meaning, and transcending. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0898010112453327">Figure 1</xref> summarizes the dimensionality for these wellness assessments.</p>

<p>Another popular college health assessment is the American College Health Assessment-National College Health Assessment. The American College Health Assessment–National College Health Assessment II (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.achancha.org/reports_ACHA-NCHAII.html">http://www.achancha.org/reports_ACHA-NCHAII.html</ext-link>) measures a wide range of health issues: alcohol, tobacco, and drugs; sexual health; weight, nutrition, and exercise; mental health; personal safety and violence. This instrument stands out from the others because its focus is on health issues or challenges of the college population instead of dimensions of wellness. The NCHA was originally launched in the spring of 2000 as a survey to collect data campus wide on students’ health habits, behaviors, and perceptions. Group reports rather than individual student reports are how the assessment supports campus initiatives. Most other wellness assessments are geared for individual use (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0898010112453327">Roscoe, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>The previous wellness instruments have many similarities and some differences. As seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0898010112453327">Figure 1</xref>, there are similar components of wellness models and instruments in the domains of social/relational, emotional, physical, spiritual, and mental/intellectual: TestWell, WEL, PWS, OLP, and WA. Domain differences occur across occupational, environmental, and psychological dimensions from models and instruments: TestWell, PWS, OLP, and WA. One dimension not addressed or defined in the summary of wellness theory models is financial wellness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0898010112453327">Roscoe, 2009</xref>), and thus has been omitted in previous assessment tools. Many college students leave home without having been prepared to govern their own personal finances: rent, car loan, college tuition and books, clothing and personal items, food, and social activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0898010112453327">Cunningham, 2000</xref>). This lack of financial knowledge can make them extremely vulnerable to making poor financial choices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0898010112453327">Borden, Lee, Serido, &amp; Collins, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0898010112453327">Norvilitis &amp; Santa Maria, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0898010112453327">Norvilitis, Szablicki, &amp; Wilson, 2003</xref>). Many students are naïve to the psychological costs of high debt, which leads to stress and decreased well-being (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0898010112453327">Borden et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0898010112453327">Norvilitis &amp; Santa Maria, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0898010112453327">Roberts &amp; Jones, 2001</xref>). Students need to have the areas of money management, financial attitude, and behaviors evaluated and addressed as another aspect of their overall wellness.</p>

<title>Purpose</title>
<p>The creation of a comprehensive holistic wellness assessment that reflects dimensions of wellness pertinent to today’s young adults, and that is psychometrically sound and developmentally appropriate for college-aged students is needed to fill current gaps in the available assessment tools, which include financial wellness, a currently neglected dimension, and make it available to educators, researchers, and clinicians. The tool will allow college students to self-assess their current health status by evaluating dimensions of wellness. The Holistic Wellness Assessment (HWA) can be used for many purposes. Faculty working with curriculum in health and wellness courses can use the HWA to measure the results of the curriculums’ effectiveness with pre- and posttesting, as well as evaluate individual students’ progress when implementing health behavior changes and increasing their knowledge on specific aspects of wellness dimensions. Health services personnel can evaluate individual student outcomes of campus health services and programs. Counseling professionals can identify student’s self-knowledge of the dimensions of wellness in relationship to their own life practices in order to implement goals and objectives in the therapeutic process. Researchers can benefit from uses of the HWA to support outcomes related to health and wellness, as well as research interdisciplinary projects with environmentalists, physical and mental health professionals, clergy, and financial advisors. This instrument is particularly timely considering the increasing focus on preventative care and holistic orientations in today’s society and also because of the increased intensity of the debate about health care in the United States.</p>

<title>Method</title>
<sec id="section5-0898010112453327">
<title>Instrument Development</title>
<p>A preliminary item pool of 227 items rated on a 4-point ordinal-type response (<italic>no/never, seldom, often, yes/always</italic>) were developed by first a critical review and analysis of the extent literature, evaluation of other wellness assessment instruments, review of a variety of higher education textbooks on wellness, and gathering information from student feedback and student observation. This assessment was piloted on a separate sample (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0898010112453327">Brown &amp; Applegate, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>Following extensive analysis, the instrument was revised in three important ways. First, 58 new items plus 2 demographic questions were added that addressed different aspects of wellness omitted in the initial item set bringing the total number of items to 285. Second, the response scale was changed from a 4-point scale to a 6-point scale (<italic>no/never, seldom, sometimes, often, usually, yes/always</italic>) in an attempt to positively increase item variances by expanding the response range. The response scale was expanded by adding two additional scale points in the middle of the ordered response continuum: “sometimes” and “usually”; the scale end point anchors, <italic>no/never</italic> and <italic>yes/always</italic> remained constant in the newly revised instrument. The third major change was to randomize the order of the items to minimize the known effects of response set (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0898010112453327">Applegate, Lahey, &amp; Hoy, 2007</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0898010112453327">
<title>Design of the Study</title>
<p>The study design to establish the initial psychometrics of the HWA was the single-group design. The cross-sectional nature of this design allowed for the postclassification of the participants into different demographic groups facilitating comparisons of the instrument’s derived subscales.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-0898010112453327">
<title>Participants, Procedure, and Data Source</title>
<p>Participants for the study were recruited from multiple sections of a Holistic Health course, an Alcohol, Drug and Abuse course, and from a Health and Wellness course, all at the undergraduate level offered in various departments in a large Midwestern regional university over three semesters. Based on the university enrollments from the participating instructors there were 5,075 enrolled students. From this population 2,311 students accessed the online web and initiated the HWA. A total of 2,090 students completed the HWA instrument and only 2,086 of these students completed all or most of the demographic questions. While students attended class, the researcher introduced the research project inviting their participation in a research project focusing on the development of a holistic wellness assessment. Students who were interested in participating were directed to complete an anonymous-response online assessment about their health knowledge, behavior, and attitudes outside class and informed that they would receive extra credit points for their participation. The online assessment hosted by SurveySuite™ (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://intercom.virginia.edu/cgi-bin/cgiwrap/intercom/SurveySuite/ss_index.pl">http://intercom.virginia.edu/cgi-bin/cgiwrap/intercom/SurveySuite/ss_index.pl</ext-link>) was open for student participation at the beginning of the fall and spring semesters during the 2008-2009 academic year and again in the fall of 2009. Detailed explanation of the study was provided within the online environment and participation consent was implied when the student completed all or part of the assessment. Prior to participant solicitation, the university human subject institutional review board for the protection of human subjects approved this research protocol. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0898010112453327">Table 1</xref> presents the demographic breakdown for this sample.</p>

<title>Data Preparation</title>
<p>Following data extraction from the survey-hosting site, data were screened for missingness and out-of-range values although the online form precluded most out-of-range responses. Missingness analysis indicated that there was a very small amount of missing data and could reasonably be considered missing at random (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0898010112453327">Rubin, 1987</xref>). So to facilitate the next analysis step, missing data were imputed. Imputation parameters restricted the range of the imputed data consistent with the item response range (1-6). Imputation efficiency was very high, with greater than 99% relative efficiency.</p>

<title>Data Analysis</title>
<p>Exploratory factor analysis was used to examine the factor structure for the 285-item instrument from the complete sample of 2,090 respondents. Oblique rotation (Promax) was applied following the determination of the number of salient Eigen vectors (factors) to retain. After an interpretable factor structure was obtained, unit-weighted factor scores were examined for internal consistency reliability and contrasted groups’ validity across the demographic variables.</p>

<title>Findings</title>
<p>Exploratory principal factors analysis via scree plot and variance accounted for indicated two possible factor solutions: either a six-factor solution accounting for 60% of the common variance or an eight-factor solution, accounting for 64% of the common variance, should be retained for rotation. Following oblique rotation and study of the factor reference structure (semipartial correlations between the factor and the item), factor structure (factor-to-item correlation) matrices, and interfactor correlation matrices, the eight-factor (see the appendix) solution was felt to represent a more interpretable solution.</p>
<p>Pursuant to factor identification, items with salient factor loadings (&gt;.30) in the factor reference structure were examined for content and qualitative integration in order to name the factor. The factor reference structure reflects the semipartial correlations between the item and the factor after partitioning the effects of the remaining correlated factors from the factor of interest. Thus, these values reflect the relationship between the item and the part of the factor that is unique and not shared with the other factors. Although the factor reference structure guided item identification and qualitative labeling of the derived factors, the range of the factor loadings from the factor structure matrix are noted when the factor is introduced. The factor structure denotes the influence of the interfactor correlations on the item–factor loadings (correlations). <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0898010112453327">Table 2</xref> presents basic descriptive statistics for the eight derived factors. Factor 1, with 44 items (factor pattern range = .74-.55), was named Self-Regard (SR) and reflects items of intrapersonal perceptions of the individual as to how they feel about themselves and see themselves as illustrated by these two items: “I trust myself” and “I like myself.” Factor 2, with 41 items (factor pattern range = .63-.36), was named Self-Awareness and Responsibility (SA) and focuses on the interplay between the individual and their effect on others and the world as illustrated by these two items: “I seek the good in others” and “I respect others when resolving conflict.” Factor 3, with 38 items (factor pattern range = .60-.40), was labeled Sustainability (SU) and represents the individual’s environmental conservation and self-sustaining behaviors as illustrated by these two items: “My diet is low in sodium” and “I have my own water bottle instead of purchasing bottled water.” Factor 4, with 18 items (factor pattern range = .62-.47), is a Relational (RL) dimension that expresses an individual’s perception of how other people affect him or her as illustrated by these two items: “I have people in my life who are unconditionally there for me” and “I have strong social support.” Factor 5, with 18 items (factor pattern range = .56-.32), was Risk Prevention (RP) and focuses on risk impediment behaviors as illustrated by these two items: “I am physically safe in my relationships” and “I refrain from drinking and driving.” Factor 6, with 8 items (factor pattern range = .82-.51), was named Spirituality (SP) because it includes items regarding religious and spiritual beliefs and practices as illustrated by these two items: “I have a spiritual practice in my life” and “I am connected to a higher power.” Factor 7, with 17 items (factor pattern range = .58-.47), was Physical Health (PH) that represents items focusing on the individual’s diet and exercise as illustrated by these two items: “I actively move or exercise 3 or more times a week for at least 30 minutes” and “I eat whole grains.” The last factor which is Factor 8, with 7 items (factor pattern range = .52-.43), was named Health Maintenance (HM) and reflects personal and preventative health care practices as illustrated by these two items: “I have my cholesterol levels checked at least every 2 years” and “I do monthly breast (female) or testicular (male) self-exams.” Questions which had originally been in the domain of Financial Wellness were dispersed among these categories: Self-Regard, Self-Awareness and Responsibility, Sustainability, and Risk Prevention. An example of a financial question under Self-Regard is “I am comfortable with my level of debt.” Self-Awareness and Responsibility’s example is “I am quick to pay my share of expenses” while Sustainability’s example is “I have a monthly budget for myself and I live within those parameters.” Risk Prevention completes the domains with financial questions with the example, “I regularly save money.” Since oblique rotation was run, the interfactor correlations estimated from all the items are presented in the upper triangular matrix in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0898010112453327">Table 2</xref>.</p>

<p>Limitations for the study need to be considered when evaluating these findings. The narrow age band and homogeneity of the undergraduate student sample restricts generalizability to substantially younger and older populations. All the data collection was conducted via online assessment (online survey), thus, we cannot estimate if there was an administration venue (e.g., paper vs. online) response bias. Another limitation which needs to be considered is the demographic characteristics of the sample that reflected students who self-selected and, therefore, there is an unknown selection bias even within the undergraduate students who were recruited to participate. Finally, there is a need for replication and continued study/validation of the HWA.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Wellness theory dimensions classically cover the areas of Social, Emotional, Physical, Intellectual, and Spiritual with a few models covering Occupational, Psychological, and Environmental (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0898010112453327">Roscoe, 2009</xref>). In the area of health and wellness there have been many instruments developed to assess the range of components of wellness theory models. The HWA aligns with two categories, Spirituality and Physical, from the classic wellness theory but generally the HWA covers unique domains that are not covered by other assessments. Exploratory factor analysis revealed the two dimensions consistent with classic wellness model literature: spirituality or religiosity is equivalent with spiritual, and physical, and health care maintenance follow the same overall direction as the domain of physical from other models. Overall the HWA is assessing domains in either a different perspective or new domains all together. HWA’s Sustainability covers more than the typical area of environmental components; it includes questions from domains of physical, financial, and nutritional. The Relational factor looks at how others affect the individual not necessarily how the individual affects others, which is covered in Self-Awareness and Responsibility. The domain of Risk Prevention has questions from the original risk prevention category and also has financial questions.</p>
<p>Self-Regard and Self-Awareness and Responsibility scales derived in the HWA create new dimensions of wellness. Both categories contain questions from the original domains of emotional, mental, spiritual, and financial. Therefore, each of these factors needs to be studied for their unique place in the dimensions of wellness.</p>
<p>Financial wellness is an emergent wellness domain that has been overlooked in most models of wellness. Within the college student population, financial wellness is very relevant as students begin to become independently responsible for their own personal lives (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0898010112453327">Cunningham, 2000</xref>). The financial choices students make can have both short- and long-term effects on their credit ratings, stress levels, sense of well-being, and broad life logistics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0898010112453327">Borden et al., 2008</xref>). Traditionally health and wellness professionals think of risk behaviors as drug and alcohol abuse, unprotected sex and risky sexual behaviors, and violent behaviors. More recent, it is being understood, that poor financial management behaviors can have serious psychological costs and consequences for college students (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0898010112453327">Lange &amp; Byrd, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0898010112453327">Norvilitis et al., 2003</xref>). Financial knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors have a contributing factor in students overall health and wellness and questions regarding financial choices were integrated into the HWA and emerged in the Risk Prevention, Self-Regard, Self-Awareness and Responsibility, and Sustainability factors.</p>
<p>In summation, the HWA is grounded in the core concepts of wellness while integrating previously missing domain: financial wellness questions. The eight factors demonstrate high levels of internal consistency reliability with acceptable interfactor correlations and emergent evidence of validity. Further analysis of all the factored categories may potentially reveal a new model of wellness.</p>
