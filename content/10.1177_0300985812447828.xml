This report describes the histological and immunohistochemical characteristics of thyroid neoplasms and lists the concurrent conditions found in guinea pig cases submitted to Northwest ZooPath during 1998 to 2008. Of 526 guinea pig case submissions, 19 had thyroid neoplasms. The most common clinical findings included a palpable mass on the ventral neck and progressive weight loss. Neoplasms were removed as an excisional biopsy from 7 guinea pigs, and 3 of these animals died within a few days after surgery. Radiographic mineral density was detected in 2 masses. Five of the neoplasms were reported as cystic; 5 were black or a dark color. Histologically, the neoplasms were classified as macrofollicular thyroid adenoma (8), thyroid cystadenoma (1), papillary thyroid adenoma (3), follicular thyroid carcinoma (5), follicular-compact thyroid carcinoma (1), and small-cell thyroid carcinoma (1). Osseous metaplasia was present in 8 neoplasms, and myeloid hyperplasia was present in 1 neoplasm. All 19 neoplasms were positive for thyroid transcription factor 1 and thyroglobulin but negative for parathyroid hormone and calcitonin. Numerous concurrent diseases, including hepatopathies, cardiomyopathies, and nephropathies, were present and considered to be the cause of death in many cases. Research is needed to determine the appropriate modalities for antemortem diagnosis and treatment and whether thyroid disease plays a role in the pathogenesis of chronic degenerative diseases in guinea pigs.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>adenoma</kwd><kwd>adenocarcinoma</kwd><kwd><italic>Cavia porcellus</italic></kwd><kwd>guinea pig</kwd><kwd>immunohistochemistry</kwd><kwd>thyroid</kwd><kwd>neoplasm</kwd><kwd>tumor</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><p>The guinea pig is a popular companion animal species that is also maintained in many zoological collections.

Only lipomas, trichoepitheliomas, lymphoid neoplasms, and mammary gland neoplasms were more common than thyroid neoplasms. An additional enlarged thyroid gland-like mass was submitted but not included in this report because it was too autolyzed for classification. The median age of guinea pigs with thyroid neoplasms was 4.3 years; ages ranged from 2.5 to 6 years (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0300985812447828">Table 2</xref>). Seven of these were male and 10 were female; sex was not reported for 2 cases. Seven cases came from 3 different zoological collections (case Nos. 1, 3, 9, 11, 13, 16, and 18), and the other 12 were companion animals from 9 different veterinary hospitals located throughout the United States. Blood thyroxine (T<sub>4</sub>) concentration was reported by the submitting clinician to be normal 3 months before death in 1 case (case No. 10; T<sub>4</sub> = 1.9 μg/dL, no reference range reported) and elevated shortly before death in another (case No. 17; T<sub>4</sub> = 5.9 μg/dl vs T<sub>4</sub> = 2.0 μg/dl in a concurrently tested sample from a young unaffected conspecific). Seven of the thyroid neoplasms were collected as an excisional biopsy during surgery (case Nos. 2, 5, 7, 12, 15, 18, and 19), and the other 12 were collected at necropsy. One of the necropsy cases was submitted to Northwest ZooPath as a fresh, whole carcass (case No. 8), and the other necropsies were performed by clinicians who submitted selected tissues. Thyroid neoplasm was listed as the clinical diagnosis in 2 cases (case Nos. 7 and 12). The most common clinical findings reported by submitting clinicians included palpable subcutaneous mass(es) on the ventral neck (case Nos. 2, 3, 5, 6, 8, 12, 14, 15, 17, and 18) and progressive weight loss (case Nos. 1, 2, 4, 10–13, 16, and 19). Three of the 7 guinea pigs from which neoplasms were removed as an excisional biopsy died within a few days after the surgery (case Nos. 7, 18, and 19), and postoperative information is not available for the other 4 cases. Two cases (case Nos. 2 and 6) had radiographic evidence of small mineral densities within the mass (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0300985812447828">Fig. 1</xref>), and in 1 case (case No. 16), radiographs of the patient were interpreted to be “within normal limits” but were not available for further review.</p><fig id="fig1-0300985812447828" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p>Radiographic projection; guinea pig.

In dogs, nonfunctional thyroid follicular carcinomas are the most commonly diagnosed thyroid neoplasm, and the concurrent degenerative, neoplastic, and inflammatory diseases such as those found in this study do not usually occur. Conversely, functional nodular hyperplasia is the most common lesion in cats,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0300985812447828">2</xref></sup> and feline hyperthyroidism is associated with hypertension, heart disease, hepatic disease, neoplasia, inflammatory bowel disease, inflammatory pulmonary disease, diabetes mellitus, central nervous system disease (including seizures), renal polyuria/polydipsia, muscle weakness, and predisposition to arterial thromboembolism.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0300985812447828">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0300985812447828">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0300985812447828">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0300985812447828">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0300985812447828">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0300985812447828">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0300985812447828">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0300985812447828">35</xref></sup> The pathophysiology of hyperthyroidism-induced disease may involve changes in tissue oxygen and glucose consumption, altered microvascular blood flow, and thyroid hormone interference with neurotransmitters.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0300985812447828">25</xref></sup></p><p>Eight of the 19 guinea pig cases described in this study had histopathologic abnormalities of the myocardium, and 8 had lesions consistent with congestive heart disease (ie, pulmonary, hepatic, and other tissue congestion). By comparison, 70 of the 257 cases submitted to Northwest ZooPath with ≥4 tissues during this 10-year period had similar heart disease (unpublished data). Hyperthyroidism can induce heart disease in cats and could contribute to the formation of cardiac lesions in guinea pigs. The pathophysiology of hyperthyroidism-associated heart disease in cats includes both direct and indirect thyroid hormone effects. Hyperthyroidism is associated with increases in myocardial contractility, mitochondrial protein synthesis, sarcoplasmic reticulum calcium cycling, diastolic depolarization rate, and decreases in sinoatrial nodal cell action potential duration.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0300985812447828">1</xref></sup> These effects combine to enhance systolic performance, improve diastolic function, and increase heart rate. Indirect cardiovascular effects of thyroid hormone include an increased number of β<sub>1</sub>-adrenergic receptors and increased basal metabolic rate, which lead to reduced systemic vascular resistance and increased cardiovascular volume.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0300985812447828">1</xref></sup> The hypertension that occurs with hyperthyroidism in cats is somewhat paradoxical. The decrease in systemic vascular resistance is countered by increased cardiac output, activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, and increased sympathetic tone, which results in hypertension.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0300985812447828">1</xref></sup> The net effect of hyperthyroidism-associated changes is an increase in cardiac oxygen requirements with decreased myocardial oxygen delivery, which leads to progressive myocardial cell death, fibrosis, and failure.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0300985812447828">1</xref></sup> The clinical manifestations of hyperthyroidism-associated cardiovascular disease in cats include bounding femoral pulses; strong, apical cardiac impulse; heart murmur (high-flow or mitral valve regurgitation); gallop heart beats; tachyarrhythmias; systemic hypertension; diastolic and systolic dysfunction; and congestive heart failure manifested by pleural effusion and/or pulmonary edema.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0300985812447828">1</xref></sup> Hyperthyroidism also induces an increase in the number of β-adrenergic receptors in the hearts of cats, which enhances the cardiac response to catecholamines.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0300985812447828">29</xref></sup> The potential for these clinical signs should be assessed in clinical cases of suspected thyroid disease in guinea pigs.</p><p>Seven of the 19 guinea pig cases described in this study had histopathologic evidence of renal disease compared with 25 of the 257 cases submitted to Northwest ZooPath with ≥4 tissues during the same 10-year period (unpublished data). Hyperthyroidism occurs concurrently with chronic renal failure in cats, although it is unclear whether this is because both diseases are prevalent or because hyperthyroidism contributes to the pathogenesis of renal disease. Renal failure does become evident in many cats that have been treated for hyperthyroidism.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0300985812447828">10</xref></sup> The proposed pathogenesis for thyroid hormone–induced renal disease is primarily based on the cardiovascular effects of thyroid hormone that are described above. Increased cardiac output and hypertension could lead to renal damage, and glomerular filtration rate (GFR) can increase due to the loss of renal autoregulation that occurs with thyrotoxicosis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0300985812447828">10</xref></sup> It is interesting that this increase in GFR can lead to decreased serum creatinine together with an increase in blood urea nitrogen that results from thyrotoxic muscle catabolism.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0300985812447828">10</xref></sup> A hyperthyroid-associated increase in GFR can mask underlying renal insufficiency, and treatment of feline hyperthyroidism will unmask the condition.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0300985812447828">10</xref></sup> Renal disease could be associated with thyroid disease in guinea pigs, so those with clinical signs of hyperthyroidism should be evaluated for renal insufficiency, particularly if treated for hyperthyroidism.</p><p>Information about blood thyroxine (T<sub>4</sub>) concentration was provided by the submitting clinicians in 2 of the 19 submitted cases. The submitting clinician in case No. 10 reported that T<sub>4</sub> was normal in blood collected 3 months before death, and the concentration (1.9 μg/dl) was less than the published reference range (2.3–3.5 μg/dl) available at that time.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0300985812447828">3</xref></sup> Case no. 17 had a T<sub>4</sub> concentration (5.9 μg/dl) that was greater than 2 times the blood level of an unaffected young guinea pig submitted for testing at the same time (2.0 μg/dl). Case no. 10 also had progressive weight loss and a liver cyst, and case No. 17 had nephrosclerosis and atrophy of fat. It is not possible to determine whether the neoplasms in this report were functional without more thorough testing of thyroid hormones.</p><p>Antemortem diagnosis of hyperthyroidism is often not possible with a single measurement of blood T<sub>4</sub> concentration. The relationship between blood concentrations of thyroid hormones and thyroid disease is not always clear. Laboratory methods for measurement of thyroid hormones in dogs and cats require rigorous protocols for sampling, sample handling, and testing, so differences among values reported by different laboratories could be a result of different protocols.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0300985812447828">14</xref></sup> Reference ranges for T<sub>4</sub>, free T<sub>4</sub>, triiodothyronine (T<sub>3</sub>), and free T<sub>3</sub> have been reported for guinea pigs, and the range of concentrations found in healthy guinea pigs differs between reports.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0300985812447828">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0300985812447828">23</xref></sup> In addition to interlaboratory variability, circulating blood thyroid hormone concentrations are affected by nonthyroidal factors, including medications and chronic illness (ie, euthyroid sick syndrome). Many of the animals reported here had chronic illness, so blood thyroid hormone concentrations could have been falsely depressed, which would have added to the difficulty in making an antemortem diagnosis of hyperthyroidism. Free T<sub>4</sub> (by equilibrium dialysis) concentration is measured in dogs and cats with suspected thyroid disease because it is less affected by nonthyroidal factors than T<sub>4</sub> and T<sub>3</sub>. A T<sub>3</sub> suppression test or thyrotropin-releasing hormone test may be used to confirm a diagnosis of suspected thyroid disease in dog and cat cases with normal T<sub>4</sub> and T<sub>3</sub>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0300985812447828">14</xref></sup> Nuclear scintigraphy, which is also used to help diagnose thyroid disease in dogs and cats, was used to confirm a diagnosis of suspected hyperthyroidism in a guinea pig with clinical signs of hyperthyroidism, T<sub>4</sub> within reference ranges, and mildly elevated free T<sub>4</sub>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0300985812447828">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0300985812447828">22</xref></sup></p><p>Osseous metaplasia was present in 8 of the 19 thyroid neoplasms, including the 2 cases in which the submitting clinician reported radiographic mineral densities (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0300985812447828">Table 2</xref>). This suggests the possibility that plain radiography could be useful to help determine whether a ventral cervical mass is a thyroid neoplasm or other mass (eg, abscess). Radiography, however, is probably not useful to differentiate malignant from benign neoplasms because osseous metaplasia was present in both malignant and benign neoplasms in this study. This differs somewhat from thyroid neoplasm mineralization in humans, where ultrasonagraphic evidence of thyroid neoplasm mineralization has been associated with greater risk of metastasis to regional lymph nodes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0300985812447828">7</xref></sup></p><p>Even though palpable masses were identified in the ventral neck of 11 of the 19 cases, thyroid disease was listed as the working diagnosis in only 2 cases.

These deaths could have been a result of hemorrhage because the blood supply to the thyroid glands of guinea pigs is highly variable or because removal of functional neoplasms might unmask underlying disease.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0300985812447828">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0300985812447828">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0300985812447828">37</xref></sup> Surgical procedures were unilateral, and no parathyroid gland tissue was found in the samples that were submitted for histopathology, so it is unlikely that death resulted from complications associated with parathyroid gland removal. To reduce the risk of perioperative complications, patients with hyperthyroidism should be evaluated for concurrent illness, including heart disease and renal disease. Treatment with oral methimazole is recommended for cats and may be useful to determine whether underlying renal insufficiency will be unmasked when hyperthyroidism is controlled in guinea pigs.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0300985812447828">22</xref></sup></p><p>In summary, thyroid neoplasms were found in 19 of the zoo and pet guinea pig cases submitted to Northwest ZooPath between 1998 and 2008. Most of the thyroid neoplasms were identified as palpable masses on the ventral neck, one-third were malignant, and many contained osseous metaplasia that may be evident radiographically. The neoplasms could be functional, and an array of degenerative diseases, including cardiomyopathies and nephropathies, occur concurrently in guinea pigs with thyroid neoplasms. Research is needed to improve antemortem case management and to determine whether thyroid disease plays a role in the pathogenesis of chronic degenerative diseases in guinea pigs.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Dr Jörg Mayer for his assistance interpreting literature written in German, Dr Richard Nye for the radiographic image, Dr Adolf Maas for providing additional clinical data, and Roy Brown of Histology Consultation Services for excellent slide preparation.
