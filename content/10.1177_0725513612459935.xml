<p>From its title, one would expect this book to be tailor-made for the modular university curriculum which wreaks such damage on cumulative knowledge, wide reading and intellectual passion. From its title this looks like a book which will carefully extract – invent? – the theme of visibility as an absent-presence in all hitherto existing social theory, and then move on to provide a detailed programme about how the magically-produced concept can be made ‘operable’ for those whose vision extends no further than the empirical or the research grant. Fortunately, appearances are deceptive. Andrea Mubi Brighenti has greater ambitions. He wants to establish visibility as an ambiguous yet determining property in all social, technical and political arrangements.</p>
<p>What is visibility? Well, Brighenti begins by saying what it is not. ‘Visibility is not a quality that generally and uniformly inheres in the social: rather, it inheres in configurations, connections, events, forces, mechanisms, associations, regimes, strategies, practices, rhythms and situated activities’ (p. 38). What Brighenti is wanting to do here is deny any conceptual reification of visibility. Presumably the substantive point is that visibility is <italic>in</italic> contexts, it is contextual. However, this is also a rhetorical ploy. Brighenti’s important argument can only be made by means of a contrary reification of ‘the social’ as distinct from ‘configurations, connections, events, forces’ and so on and so on. This move is of course necessary for the narrative of the book. Here Brighenti is establishing the field his book will explore/occupy. Were Brighenti <italic>not</italic> to do this his argument could not be novel. Brighenti specifies his concept of visibility by now tying it to a ‘field’ with three dominant aspects. First, this field is relational ‘because it determines relationships between seeing and being seen or, more generally, between noticing and being noticed’. These relationships establish subject positions, ‘and one can only become a subject <italic>within</italic> such relationships’ (p. 39). Second, the field of visibility is ‘strategic because it can be, and indeed is, manipulated by subjects themselves in order to obtain real social effects’ (p. 39). Last, the field is ‘evental because it contains intrinsic margins of indeterminacy as to the outcomes of the various compositions of visibility relationships’ (p. 39).</p>
<p>The vision of this book is too focused on the problem of visibility. It forgets that appearance is not just visual – it is about politics too. Noticeably, Brighenti ignores Arendt’s intriguing point in <italic>On Revolution</italic> about how European visitors to 18th-century America consistently recounted how they saw not a single person who required charity. These visitors did not notice the slaves who were everywhere because they had no political discourse through which to notice the slaves. In other words, the failure to extend charity to the slaves had nothing to do with visibility but everything to do with politics. More precisely, the slaves were invisible because the <italic>imaginary</italic> of the visitors made it impossible to notice them. With the reference to the imaginary I am now referring to the work of Charles Taylor. This concept is about how men and women ‘imagine their social existence, how they fit together with others, how things go on between them and their fellows, the expectations which are normally met, and the deeper normative notions and images which underlie these expectations’. Taylor says: ‘we have a sense of how things usually go, but this is interwoven with an idea of how they ought to go’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0725513612459935">Taylor 2007</xref>: 171, 172). The imaginary gives us our taken-for-granted ‘background’ knowledge about how things do and ought to go on; it’s the set of understandings through which we make sense of the world and our place in it, the set of understandings making it possible for us to do anything together and which also guides us in what ought to be done. It’s the imaginary which makes things visible. Indeed it is the imaginary which makes it possible to notice slaves in America, as well as Brighenti’s ‘configurations, connections, events, forces, mechanisms, associations, regimes, strategies, practices, rhythms and situated activities’. These configurations and so on are all concepts inherent to an imaginary. They are emphatically not <italic>a priori</italic> visibilities. No one has ever <italic>seen</italic> a rhythm.</p>
<p>Visibility <italic>is</italic> important, but only because it is an issue which extends from out of a politics of the imaginary. Visibility is not the answer – it is just one part of the question. By extension, then, the best way for social theory to address questions of visibility is through a politics of the imaginary and not through a concept of visibility, however nuanced and subtle it might be. Andrea Mubi Brighenti seeks to establish visibility as a basic sociological category, but as reflection on the example from Hannah Arendt shows, it isn’t.</p>
