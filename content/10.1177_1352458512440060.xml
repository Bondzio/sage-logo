<abstract>
<p><bold>Background:</bold> The pathology of neuromyelitis optica (NMO), in contrast to multiple sclerosis, comprises granulocyte infiltrates along extensive lengths of spinal cord, as well as optic nerve. Furthermore, IFN-β treatment worsens NMO. We recently found that experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) induced with Th17 cells is exacerbated by IFN-β, in contrast to disease induced with Th1 where treatment attenuated symptoms.</p>
<p><bold>Objective:</bold> This study demonstrates the similarities between NMO and Th17 EAE and how neutrophils mediate pathology in Th17 disease.</p>
<p><bold>Methods:</bold> Levels of blood biomarkers in NMO were assessed by Luminex and ELISA. Effects of IFN-β on neutrophils were assessed by culture assays and immunofluorescence. EAE was induced by transfer of myelin-specific Th1 or Th17 cells and treated with Sivelestat sodium hydrate, a neutrophil elastase inhibitor.</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> We show Th17 cytokines, granulocyte chemokines, type 1 interferon and neutrophil elastase are elevated in patients with definitive NMO. In culture, we find that IFN-β stimulates neutrophils to release neutrophil elastase. In Th17 EAE, we demonstrate neutrophilic infiltration in the optic nerve and spinal cord which was not present in Th1 EAE. Blockade of neutrophil elastase with Sivelestat had efficacy in Th17 EAE but not Th1 EAE.</p>
<p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> The similarities between Th17 EAE and NMO indicate that this model represents several aspects of NMO. Neutrophils are critical in the pathologies of both Th17-EAE and NMO, and therefore blockade of neutrophil elastase is a promising target in treating NMO.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Neuromyelitis optica (NMO) and relapsing–remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) are both neuro-inflammatory diseases that lead to central nervous system (CNS) demyelination.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1352458512440060">1</xref></sup> NMO is characterized by the presence of severe inflammation in the optic nerves and spinal cord,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1352458512440060">1</xref></sup> and lesions are also found in the brain in 60–70% of patients.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1352458512440060">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1352458512440060">3</xref></sup> In addition, approximately 80% of patients with NMO develop auto-antibodies against Aquaporin 4 (AQP4), and the presence of AQP4-Ig is one clinical feature that is used to distinguish NMO from RRMS.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1352458512440060">4</xref></sup></p>
<p>One feature of the inflammatory cells that comprise NMO lesions is the presence of granulocytes, which are largely absent in RRMS lesions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1352458512440060">1</xref></sup> In NMO, IL-17 and IL-8 are elevated in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) compared with RRMS.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1352458512440060">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1352458512440060">6</xref></sup> In addition, the frequency of Th17 cells in the blood is elevated in NMO compared with RRMS.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1352458512440060">7</xref></sup> IL-17 signaling is known to upregulate chemokines that recruit and activate granulocytes, such as IL-8, G-CSF and Gro-α.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1352458512440060">8</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1352458512440060">10</xref></sup> The popular treatment for RRMS, beta-interferon (IFN-β), worsens NMO, increasing relapses and levels of AQP4 antibodies.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1352458512440060">11</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1352458512440060">14</xref></sup> We recently found that Th17-induced demyelination was exacerbated after IFN-β treatment.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1352458512440060">15</xref></sup> Overall, these data suggest that NMO is driven by the Th17 pathway, and that treatment with type 1 interferon exacerbates Th17-mediated disease.</p>
<p>In this study, we show that the signature of cytokines and chemokines and the cytopathology in the CNS are similar in patients with NMO and in mice with Th17-induced experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). We also demonstrate that inhibition of neutrophil elastase is effective in attenuating Th17-induced EAE. This finding implies that granulocyte enzymes are critical in the pathology of Th17 inflammatory CNS disease, and suggests that inhibition of neutrophil elastase could be a therapeutic strategy to treat acute relapses in NMO.</p>

<title>Clinical sample collection and blood analysis</title>
<p>Sixteen patients were diagnosed at the VU Medical Center in Amsterdam (VUMC) with NMO on or before 2006 and fulfilled the 1999 Wingerchuk criteria for NMO.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1352458512440060">16</xref></sup> All 16 patients had optic nerve and spinal cord inflammation, and none of the patients had brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) that fulfilled Barkhof/Tintore criteria for MS.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1352458512440060">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1352458512440060">18</xref></sup> Serum samples were obtained from these patients on a subsequent visit after diagnosis and were tested for the presence of NMO-Ig (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1352458512440060">Table 1</xref>). For comparison, sera from patients with definitive RRMS were also obtained from the VUMC (Supplementary Table). The study received approval from the Medical Ethics Board of the VUMC. In addition we obtained plasma samples from six patients with NMO which fulfilled the 2006 Wingerchuk criteria<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1352458512440060">19</xref></sup> of NMO and seven healthy volunteers from the Stanford Multiple Sclerosis Center (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1352458512440060">Table 2</xref>).

<title>Analysis of CNS-infiltrating cells</title>
<p>We isolated infiltrating cells from spinal cords or the brainstem and cerebellum from three or four perfused mice. We incubated CNS homogenates with collagenase (Roche) and DNAse (Sigma) for 1 h at 37°C and purified the cells by a Percoll gradient. FACS staining of CNS mononuclear cells was done using BD antibodies and protocols. Antibodies directed against the following mouse cell-surface antigens were used: I-Ab, GR1, CD11b and CD4. In addition, intracellular staining of cytokines such as IFN-γ and IL-17 was performed. Data were acquired using a FACScan and analyzed by FlowJo software (Tree Star, Inc.).

<p>IL-12p70, also known as IL-12, is a heterodimeric cytokine, comprising IL-12p40 and IL-12p35, and drives Th1 differentiation. IL-12p40 is a common subunit of both IL-12 and IL-23.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1352458512440060">22</xref></sup> We found that levels of IL-12p40 and IL-12p70 were not significantly different between the two groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1352458512440060">Figure 1G</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1352458512440060">H</xref>). IL-23 is implicated in the differentiation of Th17 cells,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1352458512440060">23</xref></sup> and we anticipated that levels IL-23 would be elevated in NMO. This is currently under investigation.</p>
<p>We also observed that the individuals with <italic>MRI&gt;3seg</italic> had elevated serum levels of the type I interferon IFN-β and the chemokine IP10 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1352458512440060">Figure 1I</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1352458512440060">J</xref>), the expression of which is driven by type I IFN and type II IFN.This suggests that NMO, like systemic lupus erythematosus and psoriasis, has a type I IFN signature.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1352458512440060">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1352458512440060">25</xref></sup></p>
<p>To verify that these definitive NMO patients (<italic>MRI&gt;3seg</italic>) were indeed different from MS patients, we compared levels of granulocyte chemokines from five of six of the definitive NMO (<italic>MRI&gt;3seg</italic>) serum samples with samples from 10 patients diagnosed with RRMS (see Supplementary Table). We found that patients with NMO had significantly elevated levels of CXCL5 and CXCL1 and a trend for elevated levels of CXCL8 compared with the patients with RRMS, suggesting that the Th17/granulocyte pathway is unique to patients with definitive NMO (Supplementary Figure 2).</p>
<p>Finally, we analyzed levels of neutrophil elastase in plasma from NMO spectrum patients (defined as being either NMO-Ig+ or having spinal cord lesions greater than three vertebral segments) compared with plasma from healthy volunteers (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1352458512440060">Table 2</xref>). Neutrophil elastase in blood can only be reliably tested in plasma, since neutrophils are activated in the processing of serum. Therefore, to make this measurement we obtained plasma from six patients with NMO and seven healthy volunteers from the Stanford Multiple Sclerosis Center (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1352458512440060">Table 2</xref>). We found that plasma from individuals with NMO spectrum diseases had elevated levels of neutrophil elastase compared with healthy controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1352458512440060">Figure 1K</xref>). These data demonstrate that neutrophils are activated in NMO, and this is highly suggestive that neutrophils play a major role in this disease.</p>
<p>Overall, these data indicate that patients with definitive NMO have a constellation of markers in their serum, which include signatures characteristic of a Th17 inflammatory condition, with granulocytic involvement driven by type I IFN.</p>

<p>We next assessed the cellular composition of infiltrating CNS cells in Th1 and Th17-induced EAE at the peak of disease by flow cytometry analysis. As expected, we saw a predominant infiltration of IL-17-secreting cells in Th17-induced EAE and a predominance of IFN-γ-secreting cells in Th1-induced EAE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1352458512440060">Figure 2B</xref>). Furthermore, mice with Th17 EAE had significantly more CD11b<sup>+</sup>/GR1<italic><sup>hi</sup></italic>MHCII<italic><sup>lo</sup></italic> cells in the CNS compared with Th1 EAE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1352458512440060">Figure 2C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1352458512440060">D</xref>).

To confirm the identity of the infiltrating cells, we examined the morphology of the cellular infiltrate by cytospin and Wright–Giemsa staining. We found that in Th17 EAE, infiltrating cells in the spinal cord were predominantly polymorphonuclear (PMN), which is a characteristic of neutrophils (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1352458512440060">Figure 2F</xref>). These PMNs were less prevalent in Th1 EAE spinal cords (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1352458512440060">Figure 2G</xref>).</p>
<p>The optic nerve and the spinal cord are preferentially affected in patients with NMO, whereas the cerebrum is mostly spared. In fact, we found that the optic tracts in Th17 EAE are heavily infiltrated compared with those in Th1 EAE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1352458512440060">Figure 2H</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1352458512440060">I</xref>). Quantification showed that the percentage of lesion volume in optic tracts is 60% in Th17 EAE compared with 20% in Th1 EAE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1352458512440060">Figure 2J</xref>). In addition, the predominant region of CNS infiltration in Th17 and Th1 EAE animals is in the spinal cord, whereas the cerebrum is much less infiltrated (Supplementary Figure 3A, B). This is somewhat contradictory to the report by Stromnes et al. which showed that EAE induced with Th17 has much more infiltration of the cerebrum than disease induced by Th1.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1352458512440060">26</xref></sup> This discrepancy could be due to the differences in the strains used in the studies; we are using C57BL/6 whereas Stromnes et al. used the C3H strain. However, both of our studies demonstrate that immune-cell trafficking to the CNS differs between diseases induced with Th1 or Th17; we find predominantly more optic nerve infiltration in Th17 EAE compared with Th1 EAE.</p>
<p>In contrast to patients with MS, approximately 80% of patients with NMO have auto-antibodies to AQP4, which are deposited in lesions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1352458512440060">4</xref></sup> When analyzing serum, we did not find that mice with Th17 EAE developed AQP4 antibodies (data not shown). However, IgG antibody staining of Th17 EAE lesions revealed large perivascular accumulations of antibodies in meningeal and parenchymal CNS lesions but not in non-inflamed tissue (Supplementary Figure 4A–C and E), which demonstrates that the blood–brain barrier is breached and suggests that auto-antibodies contribute to the pathology in this disease. We also found antibody deposition in the spinal cords of Th1 EAE, to a lesser extent, however, than the Th17 disease (Supplementary Figure 4D and E). The identity of the specificity of these antibodies is under investigation.</p>

<title>Type I IFN synergizes with complement to release neutrophil elastase from neutrophils</title>
<p>Since it is known that IFN-β exacerbates NMO symptoms and we previously found that IFN-β treatment worsens Th17 EAE, we questioned whether type I interferon has pro-inflammatory effects on neutrophils. Primary granules in neutrophils contain the proteolytic enzyme neutrophil elastase. This protease is highly destructive to tissues, and has been implicated in causing tissue damage in several inflammatory diseases including systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS), cystic fibrosis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and lupus. One mechanism by which neutrophils cause tissue damage is through the release of NETs which contain histones, nuclear DNA and neutrophil elastase.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1352458512440060">20</xref></sup> We cultured primary human neutrophils with media only, C5a only, IFN-β only, or both IFN-β and C5a together, and assessed the release of NETs by fluorescent microscopy.

However, culturing neutrophils with both C5a and IFN-β significantly increased NET release compared with media only (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1352458512440060">Figure 3A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1352458512440060">B</xref>).</p>

<title>Blockade of neutrophil elastase in Th1 and Th17 EAE</title>
<p>Overall, the data demonstrate that Th17 EAE models most aspects of the pathology of AQP4-Ig-negative NMO.

However, Sivelestat had differential effects on IL-17, IL-2 and IL-5 in these disease models. In Th1-induced EAE, treatment with Sivelestat did not affect the production of IL-17 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1352458512440060">Figure 4G</xref>) but, surprisingly, increased the production of IL-5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1352458512440060">Figure 4I</xref>). In Th17-induced EAE, IL-17 and IL-5 levels were lowered by Sivelestat treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1352458512440060">Figure 4G</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1352458512440060">I</xref>). In both Th1 and Th17-induced disease, IL-2 production was equal. However, only in Th17 EAE did treatment with Sivelestat reduce the amount of IL-2 produced by splenic T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1352458512440060">Figure 4H</xref>). Although absolute numbers of cytokine-producing cells infiltrating the spinal cord were significantly reduced in Sivelestat-treated Th17 EAE, we found no differences in the frequency of cytokine-producing CD4 T-cells (Supplementary Figure 8).</p>
<p>To directly test the effects of Sivelestat on T helper differentiation, we cultured spleen cells depleted of CD8 cells in Th1 and Th17 polarizing condition with various concentrations of Sivelestat or vehicle control. We found that Sivelestat had no significant effects on IL-17, IL-5 or IFN-γ production in these cultures (Supplementary Figure 9). This suggests that the effect Sivelestat had on these cytokines in EAE is not due to a direct effect on CD4 T cells or antigen-presenting cells.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Since the discovery of the IL-23/Th17 pathway in EAE, much attention has understandably been focused on the role of Th17 in multiple sclerosis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1352458512440060">29</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1352458512440060">31</xref></sup> However, our data, along with those of others, suggest that NMO is a Th17-driven demyelinating disease. In contrast, the majority of RRMS, except for a subset of IFN-β non-responders, may actually resemble a Th1-driven demyelinating disease.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1352458512440060">15</xref></sup> NMO lesions have an abundance of infiltrating granulocytes, containing both eosinophils and neutrophils, as opposed to what is seen in RRMS.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1352458512440060">1</xref></sup> Our exploratory biomarker study now shows that sera from patients with definitive NMO contain elevated levels of the Th17 cytokines IL-17A and IL-17F, the neutrophil chemo-attractants CXCL5 and CXCL8, and the neutrophil protease, neutrophil elastase. Other studies have shown that IL-5 and other Th2 cytokines were elevated in the blood and CSF of patients with NMO. Surprisingly, in our NMO cohort we did not observe elevated levels IL-5, but we did see marginally elevated levels of eotaxin. Our serum biomarker study limits us from determining the specific cellular source of these cytokines. IL-17A and IL-17F are hallmark cytokines of Th17 cells,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1352458512440060">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1352458512440060">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1352458512440060">29</xref></sup> and a recent study suggests that T cells are the source of the elevated IL-17A in NMO compared with RRMS.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1352458512440060">7</xref></sup> However, these cytokines can be produced by many cell types including astrocytes, microglia and neutrophils, which add to the possible sources of IL-17 and related cytokines in NMO.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1352458512440060">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1352458512440060">33</xref></sup></p>
<p>Type I IFN has an inflammatory role in NMO. Patients with NMO have exacerbations when treated with IFN-β, and we have found that IFN-β and IP10, which is a chemokine upregulated by type I and type II IFNs, are elevated the serum of patients with NMO. The mechanism by which type I IFN promotes symptoms in Th17-mediated autoimmunity is currently unknown. However, here we have demonstrated that type I IFN stimulates neutrophils to release neutrophil elastase through NET formation, and thus could contribute to the inflammatory effect of granulocytes in NMO.</p>
<p>The NMO phenotype has many features that are concordant with our observation with Th17-induced EAE. We previously demonstrated that IFN-β treatment exacerbated Th17 EAE. In the current study, we found that in Th17 EAE disease there are elevated levels of CXCL1, a strong chemo-attractant for neutrophils, and increased CNS-infiltrating neutrophils compared with Th1 EAE. Unexpectedly, we observed elevated IL-5 in Th17 EAE compared with Th1 EAE, another feature that has been previously reported in NMO. However, even with the elevated levels of IL-5, Th17 EAE did not reveal a significant amount of infiltrating eosinophils, which are seen in NMO lesions along with neutrophils.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1352458512440060">1</xref></sup></p>
<p>B cells and auto-antibodies have been linked to the pathogenesis of NMO.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1352458512440060">4</xref></sup> Both rituximab and plasmapheresis treatments are showing promise as therapies for NMO. We found IgG deposition in the perivasular lesions in Th17 EAE, which demonstrates that the blood–brain barrier is breached but also suggests that auto-antibodies may play a major role in this disease pathway. It has been shown that 80% of patients with NMO have auto-antibodies to AQP4; this is a feature of this disease that distinguishes it from conventional MS.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1352458512440060">4</xref></sup> However, we did not find evidence that AQP4-Ig develop during the early stages of the Th17 EAE model. Astrocytosis is another clinical feature of NMO;<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1352458512440060">1</xref></sup> however, we did not observe the loss of astrocytes in the spinal cords of mice with Th17 EAE (data not shown).</p>
<p>Similar to the observation in NMO, Th17 EAE has an elevated level of a granulocyte-attracting chemokine CXCL1. Moreover, the CNS infiltrates are largely granulocytic. We found that blocking granulocyte activity, by inhibiting neutrophil elastase, attenuated the progression of clinical symptoms in mice with Th17 EAE but not Th1 EAE. In infectious conditions neutrophils are the first immune cells recruited to the site of inflammation, where they release serine proteases to eliminate microbes and then die quickly thereafter.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1352458512440060">34</xref></sup> This suggests that blocking neutrophil elastase with Sivelestat or another competitive elastase inhibitor might be a therapeutic strategy for the acute treatment of relapses in patients with NMO. Treatment with an elastase inhibitor could decrease the duration and dose of corticosteroid treatments, and in doing so eliminate some of the harmful effects of steroids.</p>
