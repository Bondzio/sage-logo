<abstract>
<p>Scientists and researchers are currently focusing considerable attention on the hydrodynamic characteristics of semicircular breakwaters worldwide, particularly in Japan and the People’s Republic of China. A semicircular breakwater is a composite breakwater made of prestressed concrete and has several merits over a conventional rubble mound breakwater, e.g. it is technically advanced, economically viable and aesthetically pleasing. At low water levels, it serves as a rubble mound breakwater and, at high water levels, it acts as a composite breakwater in the emerged condition. It reduces the considerable magnitude of dynamic forces if constructed in front of a vertical wall (the main structure) under the submerged condition and also reduces coastal erosion along the shoreline. Many research studies are being carried out all over the world to evaluate the performance of a semicircular breakwater in the laboratory and in the field. The authors of this review paper have also conducted a large number of experiments to study the hydrodynamic characteristics of a semicircular breakwater and to optimize the parameters such as the rubble mound height, the water depth and the size of perforations. The experiments were conducted for both the emerged condition and the submerged condition subjected to regular and random waves with various wave heights and periods to find the suitability of a semicircular breakwater in the field, and the optimum parameters were recommended in their previous publications. Hence, a sincere attempt has been made in this review paper to present the ongoing research on semicircular breakwaters, which has been carried out all over the world to facilitate the studies of researchers and to provide related information to people working in the area of semicircular breakwaters.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Breakwaters are constructed to form an artificial harbour and are designed to withstand the dynamic action of waves and to dissipate their wave energy content. They also act as barriers and create a tranquility condition on the shore side for smooth conduct of the loading and unloading of passengers and cargo. Since these structures involve more investment, they should be properly aligned, designed and constructed. Evaluation of the wave-induced pressures and forces is one of the most important tasks in designing such a breakwater and in ascertaining its stability. In general, breakwaters are classified as sloping mound types (rubble mound breakwaters, concrete block breakwaters and rubble stone breakwaters armoured with concrete blocks), vertical types (monolithic concrete breakwaters, concrete block wall breakwaters, cellular block breakwaters and concrete caisson breakwaters), composite types, composite types armoured with concrete blocks and special types of breakwater (curtain wall breakwaters, steel pile breakwaters and floating breakwaters). The rubble mound breakwater is the most popular breakwater in the world. In the case of sloping conventional rubble mound breakwaters, swashing over the slope surface dissipates the incident wave energy, and the wave height is reduced as the wave approaches from the toe to the top berm because of considerable transmission and reflection from them. In the case of the vertical type, the maximum wave energy is reflected and only a small amount of energy is dissipated by its surface. However, in the case of the composite types of breakwater the energy is dissipated both by the semicircular caisson during run-up and run-down and by transmission through the rubble mound components depending upon whether the water level is high or low. Special types of breakwater can be of two kinds: the non-gravity type and the gravity type. Pneumatic-, floating- and pile-type breakwaters are examples of the non-gravity type, and the gravity type is the conventional breakwater with special features. In many cases, the design of a breakwater is difficult since construction takes place in a severe environment caused by high waves and poor ground conditions. Owing to advances in the design and construction, several new concepts of a breakwater are being introduced. One such concept is the semicircular breakwater (SBW) on which many researchers are focusing, especially in Japan and the People’s Republic of China.</p>
<p>The SBW has a semicircularly shaped hollow caisson founded on a rubble mound. The cross section of an impermeable and sea-side perforated SBW is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1475090212450119">Figure 1</xref>. It is cast as different elements and made of prestressed concrete. Since the structure is hollow, the weight and materials are reduced and it is suited to sites with poor ground conditions. As the caisson is a prefabricated structure, it can easily be transported, handled and placed at the site. In addition to the above, it has the following excellent hydraulic characteristics compared with other types of breakwater. It possesses a greater sliding stability against waves than conventional breakwaters have. The horizontal component of a wave force applied to a semicircular surface is smaller than that applied to an upright wall; the vertical component of the wave force is applied downwards along the wall. Since the structure is hollow and light in weight, the soil subgrade reaction is less and ideally suited to poor ground conditions. Its curved configuration is exceptionally scenery enhancing, and its curved structure provides increased member strength. By the provision of perforations, the energy is dissipated owing to the formation of the eddies and turbulence created inside the hollow chamber. When the SBW is fully submerged, it has the following advantages. It results in premature breaking of high waves, and hence waves with lower energy impinge on the beach. If a perforated SBW is placed in front of a structure experiencing a higher force and pressures due to waves, there will be a reduction in the above parameters on the structure because of the presence of the SBW and the provision of perforations in it. Placing a submerged perforated SBW at the entrance to a harbour minimizes the passage of sediments into the harbour.</p>

<title>Review of the literature</title>

<title>Previous work on emerged breakwaters</title>
<p>The world’s first SBW of length 36 m was constructed at Miyazaki Port in Japan during 1992–1993. Opening ratios of 0% and 25% were adopted for the front wall and the rear wall respectively and 10% for the bottom slab for this rear wave-dissipating type of SBW. Field demonstration tests have been conducted since 1991 using test breakwaters erected at Miyazaki Port and were scheduled to continue until 1995 in an effort to verify the stability and member safety of the SBW in an actual sea, as well as to establish practical design and construction methods. Since the port faces high waves, the breakwater adopted was of the rear wave-dissipating type. Sasajima et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1475090212450119">1</xref></sup> reported the concepts of the different types of SBW. The dissipation of incident wave energy due to the presence of an SBW is mainly due to reflection and arises because part of the energy is dissipated while the wave run over the curved front face of the breakwater. This resulted in looking into alternative means of dissipating the wave energy and reducing the wave run-up and over-topping. The broad classifications as per Sasajima et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1475090212450119">1</xref></sup> are the <italic>solid type</italic> having impermeable front and rear walls, the <italic>front wave-dissipating type</italic> having only a perforated front wall, the <italic>permeable type</italic> having perforated front and rear walls and the <italic>rear wave-dissipating type</italic> having only a perforated rear wall. In the impermeable type, a considerable amount of energy is dissipated when the waves run over the sea-side quadrant face of the SBW. The front wave-dissipating SBW causes energy dissipation by creating turbulence inside the wave chamber in addition to the run-up on the structure. In the case of the permeable type, improved energy dissipation is achieved. The wave over-topping is significantly dissipated by the perforated rear wall in the rear wave-dissipating type of SBW.</p>
<p>From their model tests on a solid type of SBW subjected to regular waves, Sundar and Raghu<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1475090212450119">2</xref></sup> concluded that the reflection coefficient <italic>K</italic><sub>r</sub> for a solid SBW varied from 0.5 to 0.9 for waves with a steepness <italic>H</italic>/<italic>L</italic> up to 0.12 for relative water depths and <italic>h</italic><sub>w</sub>/<italic>L</italic> ranging from 0.1 to 0.4. The results also indicated that the variation in <italic>K</italic><sub>r</sub> with <italic>H</italic>/<italic>L</italic> was less than its variation with <italic>h</italic><sub>w</sub>/<italic>L</italic>. The measured dynamic pressures on the seaward face were reported to be lesser at still water level (SWL) and greater at locations below SWL compared with their corresponding theoretical values from the semiempirical formula obtained by Goda.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1475090212450119">3</xref></sup> This trend in the variation in the pressures was found to occur for intermediate water depths, whereas a reverse trend in their variation was observed for deepwater conditions. Jia<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1475090212450119">4</xref></sup> obtained a numerical solution for incident Stokes waves passing the submerged obstacles and extended the method of calculation of the wave run-up on a slope for estimation of over-topping. Gunaydin and Kabdasli<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1475090212450119">5</xref></sup> investigated the performance of solid and perforated U-type breakwaters subjected to both regular waves and irregular waves for different immersion depths. They concluded that the results of irregular-wave tests are higher than those of regular-wave tests for both the solid model and the perforated model. Vijayalakshmi et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1475090212450119">6</xref></sup> investigated the regular-wave interaction in terms of physical model tests and also numerical modelling with two circular cylinders placed one inside another in such a way that the inner cylinder was impermeable and the outer cylinder was perforated. They concluded that the wave run-up on the porous cylinder is almost equal to the incident wave height. Liu et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1475090212450119">7</xref></sup> studied the hydrodynamic performance of a breakwater which consists of a perforated front wall, a solid back wall and a submerged horizontal porous plate installed between them based on an analytical solution. They concluded that, with suitable geometric porosity of the front wall and horizontal plate, the reflection coefficient would always be rather small if the relative wave-absorbing chamber width exceeds a certain small value. In addition, the wave force and moment on the horizontal plate decrease significantly with an increase in the plate porosity.</p>
<p>Liu et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1475090212450119">8</xref></sup> examined the hydrodynamic performance of the breakwater with an upper submerged horizontal porous plate and a lower submerged horizontal solid plate using the eigenfunction expansion method and calculated the reflection, transmission and energy-loss coefficients and also the wave forces acting on the plates. They concluded that the transmission coefficient will be always small if the dimensionless plate length exceeds a certain moderate value. Tanimoto and Takahashi<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1475090212450119">9</xref></sup> compared the forces on a vertical caisson and a semicircular caisson. The results demonstrated that the average intensities of the wave forces on the vertical wall caisson varies greatly with the height of the rubble mound foundation, while the horizontal force component and the vertical force component on the semicircular caisson are almost constant and equal to 0.7γ<italic>H</italic><sub>max</sub> and 0.4γ<italic>H</italic><sub>max</sub> respectively. It was concluded that the basic and generalized Goda formula derived for vertical composite breakwaters could be applied successfully to calculate the design wave forces on the caisson of an SBW. It was also concluded that the new composite breakwaters discussed are not breakwaters just struggling against the waves but are breakwaters harmonizing with the waves.</p>
<p>Aburatani et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1475090212450119">10</xref></sup> reported field tests on an SBW built at Miyazaki Port, Japan. The wave pressures exerted on the outer surface of the caisson and the stresses generated on structural members were recorded and analysed. From their analysis, it was reported that the wave pressure data confirmed a reduction in the horizontal force component due to the occurrence of a phase difference in the wave pressures on the circumference. In addition, it was stated that the sliding resistance increased because of the simultaneity between the horizontal wave force component and the vertical downward force component.</p>

<title>Previous work on submerged breakwaters</title>
<p>Detailed literature on the hydrodynamic performance of the conventional rubble mound submerged breakwater is discussed in the following paragraphs. Xie<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1475090212450119">11</xref></sup> reported a new calculation method to estimate the wave forces acting on a submerged SBW; this was verified with the results of seven related physical model tests and adopted in the design of the south estuary jetty of the Yangstze river estuary in the People’s Republic of China. It is cast as different elements and made of prestressed concrete. As the semicircular caisson (the top component of the composite breakwater) is a prefabricated structure, it can be easily transported, handled and placed at the site. In addition to the above, it has excellent hydraulic characteristics compared with other types of breakwater. For example it has greater sliding stability against waves, the horizontal component of the wave force applied to the semicircular surface is smaller than that applied to the upright wall, it is light in weight (since the structure is hollow), the soil subgrade reaction is less and ideally suited to the poor ground conditions and the curved structure provides increased member strength. The measured values of the equivalent sliding force were rather smaller than those calculated. A front wave-dissipating SBW of length 527 m was completed in September 1997 for Tianjin Port in the People’s Republic of China. It was reported by Xie<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1475090212450119">12</xref></sup> that the engineering cost of the SBW was 21.4% lower than that of the conventional rubble mound structure.</p>
<p>Ranasinghe and Turner<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1475090212450119">13</xref></sup> presented instances of 10 different submerged structures and they subdivided those structures into shore parallel structures (breakwaters), multi-functional structures and natural reefs. In their work they reported net erosion for seven sites of the 10 sites chosen and found that the response of such structures resulted in mixed erosion and accretion on the shoreline. Because of the rare adoption of submerged structures for beach protection, the shoreline response to submerged breakwaters is not fully understood. Therefore they suggested that the characteristics affecting the shoreline response to submerged structures must be carefully examined. Ting et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1475090212450119">14</xref></sup> investigated whether the effect of porosity in the submerged breakwaters provided a non-breaking wave transformation. They selected eight model geometries each with six different porosities, ranging from 0.421 to 0.912, and found that the width of the model has little effect on wave reflection and transmission when the model heights are constant. The influence of the porosity became significant as the height of the model increased. Sevket Cokgor et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1475090212450119">15</xref></sup> studied wave transmission in slightly submerged breakwaters for different porosities and crest height-to-water-depth ratios. The similarity between a long shore bar and a dynamically stable submerged breakwater was also studied in one set of the experiments, and it was found that both performed in similar ways owing to parallel geometric conditions. Sidek et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1475090212450119">16</xref></sup> conducted a series of tests to study the effect of the porosity of submerged breakwater model structures with three different porosities ranging from 0.40 to 0.80 and found that transmission increased with increasing model porosity. Jeng et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1475090212450119">17</xref></sup> studied the interaction between water waves, a submerged breakwater, a vertical wall and a sandy seabed as a laboratory experiment and concluded that the wave-induced pore pressure beneath the submerged breakwater was greater than that at the toe. Chen et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1475090212450119">18</xref></sup> performed experiments on wave transformation between a submerged permeable breakwater and a seawall including variations in the wave profile, the piling-up of water and the wave run-up and found that the wave height transformation behind the submerged breakwater varied spatially owing to the transmitted wave reflected from the seawall.</p>

<title>Recent research on SBWs</title>
<p>Armono and Hall<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1475090212450119">19</xref></sup> studied the possibility of using hemispherical artificial reefs in an array placed over a rubble mound breakwater. They concentrated on various parameters affecting the transmission characteristics such as the wave steepness, the reef proportions, the submergence depth and the reef configurations and conducted two-dimensional tests in their flume with the models being subjected to regular waves and irregular waves. They conducted experiments for seven different configurations and one such configuration is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1475090212450119">Figure 2</xref>. The water depths were varied from 144 mm to 500 mm for irregular waves and from 350 mm to 600 mm for regular waves. The wave heights were varied from 50 mm to 200 mm with an increment of 50 mm and the corresponding wave periods were from 1 s to 2.5 s with an increment of 0.5 s. They found that 60% of the incoming wave energy was reduced because of the provision of hemispherical artificial reefs. Multiple linear regression analysis was performed and validated with experimental data. The value of the coefficient of correlation arrived at in terms of <italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> = 0.847 indicates the accuracy of the multiple linear regression analysis model.</p>

<p>Yuan and Tao<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1475090212450119">20</xref></sup> studied the wave force acting on SBWs under submerged, alternately submerged and emerged conditions with a numerical model based on the hybrid method of the boundary element method and the finite difference method, and fluid motion was described by the velocity potential. They compared their data from the numerical model with experimental data. The details of the above configurations are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1475090212450119">Figure 3</xref>. They found that the model proved to be reliable for simulating the wave forces acting on an SBW. With the help of this numerical model, they analysed the properties of the wave forces acting on an SBW and obtained some useful results. For use in practical applications, a new simplified formula, based on the numerical results, was derived to calculate the wave forces acting on the SBW. They also verified this simplified formula by both experimental data and numerical results. Regardless of whether the top of the breakwater is submerged or not, the results of this formula were in good agreement with the experimental data and numerical results. They suggested that the simplified formula was reliable and convenient to apply in engineering practice.</p>

<p>Liu and Li<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1475090212450119">21</xref></sup> studied various hydrodynamic characteristics of a submerged perforated SBW, such as the reflection and transmission coefficients, the horizontal and vertical forces and also the hydrodynamic pressure distribution along the semicircular caisson, by the multi-pole method. They found that the reflection coefficient decreased significantly with increasing value of the porous effect parameter, suppressing the seabed scour in front of the breakwater and thereby ensuring the safe navigation of vessels near the structure. They also found that, in comparison with an impermeable breakwater, a perforated breakwater may work well, resulting in a smaller transmission coefficient, which is a key point of the breakwater, as well as absorbing the wave energy. They concluded that perforating the semicircular arc reduced the horizontal and vertical wave forces acting on the breakwater. The maximum wave pressure difference occurring at the sea-side top are of a semicircular arc nature.</p>

Experiments were conducted for a horizontal sandy bottom and a sloping sandy bottom. They observed that the reflection coefficient mainly relied on the dimensionless submergence parameter. Two semiempirical parameterizations were proposed to predict the reflection coefficients for submerged vertical breakwaters and SBWs and it was found that, when the breakwater crest is at the mean water level, the reflection coefficient was about 0.53 for both breakwaters. They believed that the results of their study will be useful to coastal engineers for preliminary feasibility and desk design of submerged vertical breakwaters and SBWs.</p>

They concluded that the effect of perforations played a vital role compared with the effects of the water depth and the rubble mound height. A detailed description of their research work on sea-side perforated and fully perforated SBWs is explained in the following paragraphs. The experimental studies involved measurement of the reflection characteristics, the transmission characteristics, the run-up, the hydrodynamic forces and the pressures on the SBWs. The tests were performed for emerged and submerged SBWs. The sea-side perforated and fully perforated SBW models were subjected to the action of regular waves and random waves. In the case of emerged SBWs, tests were conducted for three different <italic>h</italic><sub>w</sub>/<italic>h</italic><sub>t</sub> ratios of 0.6, 0.7 and 0.8 with water depths of 0.40 m, 0.47 m and 0.54 m by keeping a constant <italic>h</italic><sub>r</sub>/<italic>h</italic><sub>t</sub> ratio of 0.18 with a rubble mound height of 0.1 2 m. Similarly, for the submerged condition, for a constant <italic>h</italic><sub>r</sub>/<italic>h</italic><sub>t</sub> ratio of 0.18, tests were conducted for three different <italic>h</italic><sub>w</sub>/<italic>h</italic><sub>t</sub> ratios of 1.0, 1.2 and 1.4 with water depths of 0.67 m, 0.80 m and 0.94 m. To study the effect of the rubble mound height on the hydrodynamic performance in the SBW model, tests were conducted for three different <italic>h</italic><sub>r</sub>/<italic>h</italic><sub>t</sub> ratios of 0.18, 0.29 and 0.36 with rubble mound heights of 0.12 m, 0.22 m and 0.32 m and the water depth kept constant at 0.54 m for the emerged condition. All the tests were conducted for both regular waves and random waves. The models were subjected to the action of regular waves of heights <italic>H</italic> ranging from 0.03 m to 0.24 m and periods <italic>T</italic> ranging from 0.8 s to 2.0 s with an interval of 0.1 s. For each period, tests were performed with at least three different wave heights. The run-up values, the hydrodynamic pressures and the horizontal and vertical forces on the model together with the variations in the wave elevation in front of the model at the three different locations as stated earlier were acquired simultaneously through the same personal computer that is used to drive the wave maker. The data were acquired with a sampling interval of 0.05 s for a total duration of 60 s.</p>
<p>The SBW models were also subjected to the action of random waves described by the Pierson–Moskowitz spectrum for a peak wave period <italic>T</italic><sub>p</sub> ranging from 0.8 s to 2.0 s at intervals of 0.1 s. For each <italic>T</italic><sub>p</sub>, at least three significant wave heights <italic>H</italic><sub>s</sub> ranging from 0.03 m to 0.24 m were considered for the tests. The sea-side perforated SBW model has perforations on its sea side and the fully perforated SBW has perforations on both the quadrants of the semicircular caisson. The purpose of providing perforations on the sea side is to dissipate the energy of the waves by creating turbulence inside the chamber, thus reducing the pressures and forces on such structures and the purpose of providing perforations on both sides is to reduce the pressure and force on the model by permitting waves to pass through the model. Three models were considered for investigating this type of SBW. The diameters of the perforations used were 15 mm, 20 mm and 25 mm, covering percentages of perforations of 7%, 11% and 17% respectively of the area of the sea-side quadrant face. The perforations were made with a centre-to-centre distance of 50 mm. The percentage of perforations provided in the rear wave-dissipating SBW constructed at Miyazaki Port in Japan is 25% for the rear sidewall to minimize the disturbance caused on the harbour side by the over-topped waves where its sea side is impermeable. The perforations in the SBW at Miyazaki Port are circular in shape. Taking the above into consideration, perforations with a circular shape were adopted for the experimental studies and a range of diameters of perforations were considered from 15 mm to 25 mm. In the case of the fully perforated type the same percentages were also maintained.</p>

<title>Effects of the perforations and the water depth</title>
<p>The variations in the reflection coefficient <italic>K</italic><sub>r</sub> with <italic>h</italic><sub>w</sub>/<italic>L</italic> for the SBW0, SBW7, SBW11, SBWf7, SBWf11 and SBWf17 models (where the numeral after SBW indicates the percentage of perforations for an SBW with perforations on the sea side and the f + numeral after SBW indicates the percentage of perforations for a fully perforated SBW (i.e. an SBW with perforations on both sides)) for <italic>h</italic><sub>w</sub>/<italic>h</italic><sub>t</sub> = 0.6, 0.7 and 0.8 for a constant <italic>h</italic><sub>r</sub>/<italic>h</italic><sub>t</sub> = 0.18 due to regular waves show that <italic>K</italic><sub>r</sub> increases with an increase in <italic>h</italic><sub>w</sub>/<italic>L</italic> for all the <italic>h</italic><sub>w</sub>/<italic>h</italic><sub>t</sub> ratios tested and for all the models of sea-side and fully perforated SBWs tested. When waves of shorter wavelength run over the curved surface, they feel the presence of perforations on the caisson for a shorter distance; because of this the energy dissipated because of turbulence is less and hence the reflection is greater for higher <italic>h</italic><sub>w</sub>/<italic>L</italic>. When a wave has a long period, it runs over a curved surface for a greater distance, the energy dissipated is greater and hence there is less reflection. The reflection coefficient <italic>K</italic><sub>r</sub> decreases with an increase in perforations up to 11% and it increases with a further increase in perforations to 17%. For the SBW models with up to 11% perforations, the energy is dissipated irrespective of the wave period whereas, for the model with 17% perforations, waves of smaller periods dissipate less energy and hence there is greater reflection for this model. Even long-period waves dissipate less energy in the case of SBW17 because of its size of perforations compared with models with up to 11% perforations.</p>
<p>It is observed that <italic>K</italic><sub>r</sub> decreases with an increase in <italic>h</italic><sub>w</sub>/<italic>h</italic><sub>t</sub>. For <italic>h</italic><sub>w</sub>/<italic>h</italic><sub>t</sub> = 0.6, only a smaller height of the semicircular portion of the caisson is exposed to waves, i.e. the effect of the curvature is less pronounced, thus resulting in less dissipation and more reflection. This trend is reversed for higher <italic>h</italic><sub>w</sub>/<italic>h</italic><sub>t</sub>, i.e. for a higher-water-depth condition; in this case, the waves are exposed to a greater area of perforations, which leads to greater dissipation of energy, thereby resulting in less reflection. In addition, the effect of the curvature also plays a role in dissipating more energy by permitting waves to run over a longer distance. In particular, for <italic>h</italic><sub>w</sub>/<italic>h</italic><sub>t</sub> = 0.8, partial over-topping of waves is also permitted, which causes a reduction in <italic>K</italic><sub>r</sub>. However, the rate of reduction in the reflection coefficient due to the effect of the water depth is not that significant, compared with the effect of the perforations.</p>
<p>It should also be noted that the values of <italic>K</italic><sub>r</sub> increase when the perforation ratio increases from 11% to 17% in the case of a sea-side perforated SBW and shows the reverse trend for a fully perforated SBW (i.e. <italic>K</italic><sub>r</sub> decreases from a perforation ratio of 11% to a perforation ratio of 17%). This is because an increase in the perforation ratio from 11% to 17% causes a decrease in energy dissipation with a higher percentage of perforations in the case of the sea-side perforated SBW, whereas the scenario is different in the case of the fully perforated SBW. Although the perforation ratio increases, openings on the shoreward side of the breakwater permit a higher amount of energy through transmission, and <italic>K</italic><sub>r</sub> is reduced in SBWf17 compared with that in SBWf11. This is one reason why SBWf17 was not recommended, namely because of the high transmission of energy, which will definitely affect the tranquillity condition of the harbour. Similarly, the variations in the average reflection coefficient with <italic>h</italic><sub>w</sub>/<italic>L</italic> for the SBW0, SBW7, SBW11, SBW17, SBWf7, SBWf11 and SBWf17 models for <italic>h</italic><sub>w</sub>/<italic>h</italic><sub>t</sub> = 0.6, 0.7 and 0.8 for a constant <italic>h</italic><sub>r</sub>/<italic>h</italic><sub>t</sub> ratio of 0.18 due to random waves also indicate a similar trend to that of regular waves. However, energy dissipation is slightly higher in the case of random waves, because these waves are formed owing to the superposition of waves of different wave heights.</p>

<title>Effect of the rubble mound height</title>
<p>The effect of the rubble mound height on the reflection characteristics of the emerged sea-side perforated SBW models were studied for three different <italic>h</italic><sub>r</sub>/<italic>h</italic><sub>t</sub> ratios of 0.18, 0.29 and 0.36 with a constant water depth <italic>h</italic><sub>w</sub> of 0.54m. In this case, the rubble mound heights <italic>h</italic><sub>r</sub> were changed from 0.12 m to 0.32 m. The variation in <italic>K</italic><sub>r</sub> for various SBW models subjected to regular waves due to the effect of the rubble mound height clearly indicates that the rate of reduction in the reflection coefficient is significant from <italic>h</italic><sub>r</sub>/<italic>h</italic><sub>t</sub> = 0.18 to 0.29 and is less significant when <italic>h</italic><sub>r</sub>/<italic>h</italic><sub>t</sub> is in the range from 0.29 to 0.36. It is understood that, for the higher <italic>h</italic><sub>r</sub>/<italic>h</italic><sub>t</sub> ratio of 0.36, the rubble mound action is predominant. The rate of reduction due to the increase in <italic>h</italic><sub>r</sub>/<italic>h</italic><sub>t</sub> is less in the case of a sea-side perforated SBW compared with an impermeable SBW, since the combination of the rubble mound height and the perforations plays a dominant role in the dissipation of energy in the former type of breakwater. Similar to this, the variations in the average reflection coefficient with <italic>h</italic><sub>w</sub>/<italic>L</italic> for the SBW0, SBW7, SBW11, SBWf7 and SBWf11 models for <italic>h</italic><sub>r</sub>/<italic>h</italic><sub>t</sub> = 0.18, 0.29 and 0.36 for a constant <italic>h</italic><sub>w</sub> of 0.54m due to random waves indicate a similar trend to that of regular waves. It is evident that the effect of the rubble mound height plays a predominant role rather than the effects of the perforations and the water depth.</p>

<title>Emerged SBWs: run-up characteristics</title>
<sec id="section11-1475090212450119">
<title>Effects of the perforations and the water depth</title>
<p>The variation in the dimensionless run-up <italic>R</italic><sub>u</sub>/<italic>H</italic><sub>i</sub> decreases with an increase in <italic>h</italic><sub>w</sub>/<italic>L</italic> because, for long-period waves, more run-ups occur on the caisson. In the case of shorter-period waves (larger <italic>h</italic><sub>w</sub>/<italic>L</italic>), most of the energy contained in the incident waves is reflected as discussed earlier and hence less energy will be available for the run-up. This explains the phenomenon of the decrease in the run-up with an increase in <italic>h</italic><sub>w</sub>/<italic>L</italic>. The results also demonstrate that <italic>R</italic><sub>u</sub>/<italic>H</italic><sub>i</sub> decreases with an increase in <italic>h</italic><sub>w</sub>/<italic>h</italic><sub>t</sub> because, as <italic>h</italic><sub>w</sub>/<italic>h</italic><sub>t</sub> increases, the effect of the curvature becomes more pronounced and hence there is less run-up. This can be explained as follows. For higher <italic>h</italic><sub>w</sub>/<italic>h</italic><sub>t</sub>, although the distance travelled over the caisson is greater, as the run-up is a vertical projection it will be less. In addition, for higher <italic>h</italic><sub>w</sub>/<italic>h</italic><sub>t</sub>, a larger area of the structure is exposed to waves, which leads to greater energy dissipation and less run-up. <italic>R</italic><sub>u</sub>/<italic>H</italic><sub>i</sub> also decreases with an increase in the percentage of perforations up to 11%. A further increase in the perforations to 17% results in an increase in the run-up whereas, in the case of fully perforated SBWs, the run-up values are reduced with an increase in perforations, even up to 17%, and thus permit more transmission.</p>
<p>The rate of reduction in the dimensionless run-up is calculated by taking SBW0 as the reference and then making the calculations for sea-side perforated and fully perforated SBWs. The percentage of reduction in the dimensionless run-up compared with that for an impermeable type of SBW (SBW0) varies from 19% to 40% for sea-side perforated SBWs and from 35% to 68% in the case of fully perforated SBWs for lower <italic>h</italic><sub>w</sub>/<italic>h</italic><sub>t</sub> values. These reductions vary from 48% to 60% for sea-side perforated SBWs and from 47% to 76% for fully perforated SBWs for higher <italic>h</italic><sub>w</sub>/<italic>h</italic><sub>t</sub> values. For <italic>h</italic><sub>w</sub>/<italic>h</italic><sub>t</sub> = 0.8, the free board is only 13 cm; some of the waves have longer wave periods and heights, over the top of the crest in the case of an impermeable SBW (SBW0), and hence a higher reduction in the run-up is observed for perforated SBWs. Among the three water depths tested, <italic>h</italic><sub>w</sub>/<italic>h</italic><sub>t</sub> = 0.7 exhibits a considerable reduction in the run-up, which will reduce the force experienced by the caisson. When the effect of the perforations is taken into account, SBW11 and SBWf11 cause higher reductions in the case of sea-side and fully perforated SBWs respectively. A similar reduction is also observed for random waves.</p>

<sec id="section12-1475090212450119">
<title>Effect of the rubble mound height</title>
<p>In this case, a constant water depth of 0.54 m is maintained and the height of the rubble mound is varied. From the results it is inferred that the variation in the dimensionless run-up due to regular waves and random waves decreases with an increase in the rubble mound height. The reason may be that the increase in the rubble mound height dissipates more wave energy, and less wave energy is available to run over the semicircular caisson. The rate of reduction in the dimensionless run-up is similar to that noted earlier and confirms the variation in <italic>K</italic><sub>r</sub>.</p>

<title>Effects of the perforations and the water depth</title>
<p>In the case of an SBW perforated on both the quadrants, the transmission of waves takes place. The transmission coefficients <italic>K</italic><sub>t</sub> which are obtained from the experiments conducted and which are due to regular waves and random waves are well within 50% of the incident wave height whereas, for an SBW with 17% perforations, they exceed 50% of the incident wave height and will affect the tranquillity condition of the harbourage area. This means that increasing the percentage of perforations beyond 11% of the exposed area is not encouraged and it results in the reverse trend. The transmission coefficient <italic>K</italic><sub>t</sub> increases and the loss coefficient <italic>K</italic><sub>l</sub> decreases with an increase in the percentage of perforations. It is also observed that, the higher that <italic>h</italic><sub>w</sub>/<italic>h</italic><sub>t</sub> is, the higher is the transmission. However, the reduction in <italic>K</italic><sub>l</sub> for the fully perforated SBW models is less significant. From the three models tested with different <italic>h</italic><sub>w</sub>/<italic>h</italic><sub>t</sub> ratios, SBWf11 gives the optimum results from both a reflection viewpoint and a transmission viewpoint.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section15-1475090212450119">
<title>Effect of the rubble mound height</title>
<p>In general, increasing the perforation ratio increases the transmission, and for SBWf17 the energy transmitted exceeds more than 50% of the incident wave energy, which will affect the tranquillity condition of any harbour. Considering the effect of the rubble mound height for all the cases of SBWs perforated on both the quadrants, the rate of reduction is significant when <italic>h</italic><sub>r</sub>/<italic>h</italic><sub>t</sub> is increased from 0.18 to 0.29 and is insignificant for <italic>h</italic><sub>r</sub>/<italic>h</italic><sub>t</sub> from 0.29 to 0.36. It is understood that, when <italic>h</italic><sub>r</sub>/<italic>h</italic><sub>t</sub> is increased from 0.29 to 0.36, the rubble mound action is more predominant than that of composite action and hence <italic>h</italic><sub>r</sub>/<italic>h</italic><sub>t</sub> = 0.29 is an optimal value from the experiments conducted.</p>

<title>Emerged SBWs: comparison of the reflection characteristics of SBWs with those of a field breakwater</title>

The rear wave-dissipating SBW is seen as an impermeable SBW except that the leeward quadrant dissipates the energy of over-topped waves owing to the provision of perforations, which minimizes the disturbance on the harbour side. It is evident that the comparison of <italic>K</italic><sub>r</sub> for the impermeable SBW is in good agreement with that for the breakwater at Miyazaki Port. Further, it is observed that, for higher <italic>H</italic><sub>s</sub>/<italic>h</italic> ratios, the rates of reduction for SBW7 and SBWf7 compared with that for the breakwater at Miyazaki Port are about 4% and 33% respectively. The corresponding values for the model with SBW11 and SBWf11 are about 26% and 52% respectively, whereas the above reductions for SBW17 and SBWf17 are about 20% and 59% respectively. In all the cases, <italic>K</italic><sub>r</sub> decreases with an increase in <italic>H</italic><sub>s</sub>/<italic>h</italic>, where <italic>H</italic><sub>s</sub> is the significant wave height and <italic>h</italic> is the difference between the highest water level and the lowest water level.

<title>Forces on the semicircular caisson</title>
<sec id="section18-1475090212450119">
<title>Effects of the perforations and the water depth</title>
<p>The shoreward horizontal force [<italic>F</italic><sub>h</sub>] <sub>non</sub> and the vertical force [<italic>F</italic><sub>v</sub>] <sub>non</sub> exerted on the semicircular caisson indicate that the horizontal force component is found to decrease with an increase in <italic>h</italic><sub>w</sub>/<italic>L</italic> irrespective of the type of SBW. This is because long-period waves exert more force on the caisson and short-period waves transfer less force. An increase in <italic>h</italic><sub>w</sub>/<italic>h</italic><sub>t</sub> increases the forces on the semicircular caisson because, the higher the water depth, the larger is the area of the SBW model exposed to wave action, and hence the increase in <italic>h</italic><sub>w</sub>/<italic>h</italic><sub>t</sub> causes an increase in [<italic>F</italic><sub>h</sub>]<sub>s non</sub>. The percentage of reduction is about 55–76% for sea-side perforated SBWs for all <italic>h</italic><sub>w</sub>/<italic>h</italic><sub>t</sub> tested and this percentage of reduction in the dimensionless forces varies from 75% to 95% in the case of SBWs perforated on both the quadrants, when compared with SBW0. Hence it is understood that the effect of perforations plays a major role in the reduction in the forces on the semicircular caisson. It is observed that [<italic>F</italic><sub>v</sub>]<sub>s non</sub> is much higher than [<italic>F</italic><sub>h</sub>]<sub>s non</sub>. For SBW7, [<italic>F</italic><sub>v</sub>]<sub>s non</sub> is about 2.8–4 times [<italic>F</italic><sub>h</sub>]<sub>s non</sub>; for SBW11, it is 4–5 times [<italic>F</italic><sub>h</sub>]<sub>s non</sub>; for SBW0, it is about 1.6–2 times, [<italic>F</italic><sub>h</sub>]<sub>s non</sub>. The dimensionless vertical force for fully perforated SBWs is also about 2–4 times higher than the dimensionless horizontal force. For this reason, more energy is dissipated in the case of perforated SBWs. It should be noted that the vertical force adds stability to the structure since it acts vertically in a downward direction and towards the centre of the breakwater.</p>

<title>Submerged SBWs</title>
<sec id="section21-1475090212450119">
<title>Reflection characteristics</title>
<p>The results indicate that the reflection coefficient decreases with an increase in <italic>h</italic><sub>w</sub>/<italic>L</italic> for all the <italic>h</italic><sub>w</sub>/<italic>h</italic><sub>t</sub> values tested and for all the models of impermeable, sea-side and fully perforated SBWs tested. This is because, when the waves of shorter length run over the submerged model, the presence of the model does not influence the energy dissipation process of waves and hence there is less reflection for higher <italic>h</italic><sub>w</sub>/<italic>L</italic> values. In the case of waves of long period, the energy dissipated is greater and hence there is more reflection. The reflection coefficient decreases with an increase in perforations up to 11% and it increases with a further increase in perforations to 17% for sea-side perforated SBWs, which indicates that there is a limit to the percentage of perforations to be provided in a model. For fully perforated SBWs, an increase in the percentage of perforations results in a decrease in reflection, since more waves are transmitted owing to the increase in the percentage of perforations. In the case of random waves, for lower relative water depths, the reflection coefficients are slightly higher and greater energy dissipation occurs owing to the uneven wave heights. Here also SBW17 shows the reverse trend. Considering the effect of the water depth, for regular waves, the reflection coefficient decreases with an increase in <italic>h</italic><sub>w</sub>/<italic>h</italic><sub>t</sub>. This arises because, when <italic>h</italic><sub>w</sub>/<italic>h</italic><sub>t</sub> increases, the influence of the waves on the SBW model is reduced, resulting in less reflection. In the case of random waves, an increase in <italic>h</italic><sub>w</sub>/<italic>h</italic><sub>t</sub> from 1.0 to 1.2 increases the reflection coefficient, and a further increase in <italic>h</italic><sub>w</sub>/<italic>h</italic><sub>t</sub> to 1.4 decreases the reflection coefficient. This is due to random waves of various wave heights and, for <italic>h</italic><sub>w</sub>/<italic>h</italic><sub>t</sub> = 1.2, the SBW model feels the effect of the waves. For <italic>h</italic><sub>w</sub>/<italic>h</italic><sub>t</sub> = 1.4, the difference in elevation between the water surface and the top of the model is 0.27 m; the influence of waves is insignificant in the SBW model and hence there is more transmission, resulting in less reflection and less loss.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section22-1475090212450119">
<title>Transmission characteristics</title>
<p>The variation in the transmission coefficient decreases with an increase in the relative water depth in the case of the sea-side perforated SBW (with percentages of perforations from 7% to 17%) for <italic>h</italic><sub>w</sub>/<italic>h</italic><sub>t</sub> = 1.0 and is found to be less than for an impermeable SBW. This is because energy dissipation is much less owing to the curvature, and hence smooth transmission of waves is observed for an impermeable SBW. It should be noted that, for <italic>h</italic><sub>w</sub>/<italic>h</italic><sub>t</sub> = 1.0, the crest of the SBW model and the water depth are the same. In the case of the sea-side perforated SBW, the provision of perforations creates turbulence, resulting in energy dissipation, and affects the transmission of waves. For the fully perforated SBW, the transmission increases with an increase in the percentage of perforations. Transmission increases from <italic>h</italic><sub>w</sub>/<italic>h</italic><sub>t</sub> = 1.0 to <italic>h</italic><sub>w</sub>/<italic>h</italic><sub>t</sub> = 1.2. For <italic>h</italic><sub>w</sub>/<italic>h</italic><sub>t</sub> = 1.4 a greater amount of wave energy is transmitted owing to the larger difference in elevation above the model, leading to a less pronounced effect of the perforations. The variation in the transmission coefficient increases with an increase in the relative water depth and arises because more dissipation is observed with long waves, and less dissipation for shorter waves. A similar trend is also observed for random waves, but the energy dissipation is slightly greater owing to the various wave heights, resulting in less transmission than for regular waves.</p>

<p>The loss coefficient increases with an increase in the relative water depth for <italic>h</italic><sub>w</sub>/<italic>h</italic><sub>t</sub> = 1.0 and shows a reverse trend for the other two cases of <italic>h</italic><sub>w</sub>/<italic>h</italic><sub>t</sub> = 1.2 and <italic>h</italic><sub>w</sub>/<italic>h</italic><sub>t</sub> = 1.4 for both regular waves and random waves.

<title>Dynamic pressures on SBWs</title>
<p>At the bottom location of the model, the pressure decreases with an increase in the percentage of perforations for both sea-side perforated and fully perforated SBWs except for SBW17 in the sea-side perforated SBWs and for SBWf11 in the fully perforated SBWs, which both show the reverse trend. The maximum magnitudes of the dynamic pressure are observed to be 0.43 times, 0.32 times and 0.19 times the static pressure for impermeable SBWs, sea-side perforated SBWs and fully perforated SBWs respectively. For other pressure port locations, the maximum dynamic pressure of SBW11 is more than those of the other models in that category. However, in case of the fully perforated SBW models the pressure decreases with an increase in the percentage of perforations. At the middle position of the pressure port, the maximum magnitudes of the dynamic pressure are observed to be 0.58 times, 0.44 times and 0.28 times the static pressure and at the top position (near surface of the model) these values are 0.53 times, 0.52 times and 0.35 times the static pressure for impermeable SBWs, sea side perforated SBWs and fully perforated SBWs respectively. The results also indicate that an increase in the water depth decreases the pressure except for a pressure port location near the water surface. In a location nearer to the water surface, it occurs owing to the intermittence effect. Since the top surface of the model is submerged into water to a depth of 0.13 m, the influence of the percentage of perforations on the variation in the dimensionless pressure is insignificant at the bottom pressure port location. However, variation is observed in the other pressure port locations and is significant, especially at the top pressure port location. The maximum dynamic pressures for the bottom pressure port location are observed to be 0.37 times, 0.31 times and 0.15 times the static pressure, for the middle pressure port location the values are 0.52 times, 0.39 times and 0.25 times the static pressure and for the top pressure port location the values are 0.73 times, 0.53 times and 0.29 times the static pressure for impermeable SBWs, sea-side perforated SBWs and fully perforated SBWs respectively. Similar observations are noted for <italic>h</italic><sub>w</sub>/<italic>h</italic><sub>t</sub> = 1.4; in this case, the top surface of the model is submerged into water to a depth of 0.27 m and hence the effects of the water depth and the perforations are less pronounced.</p>
<p>In the case of random waves, the maximum dynamic pressures observed are higher than for regular waves. These values for the impermeable SBW were 1.04 times, 1.95 times and 1.35 times the static pressure in the bottom, middle and top locations respectively of the pressure port for <italic>h</italic><sub>w</sub>/<italic>h</italic><sub>t</sub> = 1.0. The corresponding values for the sea-side perforated SBW are 0.85 times, 1.38 times and 0.89 times the static pressure respectively and for the fully perforated SBW they are 0.49 times, 0.88 times and 0.64 times the static pressure respectively. In the case when <italic>h</italic><sub>w</sub>/<italic>h</italic><sub>t</sub> = 1.2, the dimensionless pressure increases for the bottom to top pressure port locations. The effect of the water depth is insignificant and a small variation is found between the results for <italic>h</italic><sub>w</sub>/<italic>h</italic><sub>t</sub> = 1 and those for <italic>h</italic><sub>w</sub>/<italic>h</italic><sub>t</sub> = 1.2. However, a lower pressure is observed for <italic>h</italic><sub>w</sub>/<italic>h</italic><sub>t</sub> = 1.4 irrespective of the percentage of perforations and whether for the sea-side perforated case or the fully perforated case, since the SBW model was 0.27 m below the free water surface. Hence, the model is subjected to less pressure. The present authors have compared the other port locations also to understand the effect of the perforations on the water depth and found that a similar trend is observed. Only one such comparison is discussed in this paper so that readers can understand this effect.</p>

<title>Forces on the semicircular caisson</title>
<p>The horizontal force component is found to decrease with an increase in <italic>h</italic><sub>w</sub>/<italic>L</italic> irrespective of the type of SBW. This is because long-period waves exert more force on the caisson and short-period waves transfer less force. Increasing the size of the perforations dissipates more energy in the case of the fully perforated SBW and hence the force decreases accordingly. This is applicable for both the horizontal force and the vertical force. An increase in <italic>h</italic><sub>w</sub>/<italic>h</italic><sub>t</sub> increases the forces on the semicircular caisson from <italic>h</italic><sub>w</sub>/<italic>h</italic><sub>t</sub> = 1.0 to <italic>h</italic><sub>w</sub>/<italic>h</italic><sub>t</sub> = 1.2 and a further increase to <italic>h</italic><sub>w</sub>/<italic>h</italic><sub>t</sub> = 1.4 decreases the forces on the caisson. The energy dissipation is observed to be more for <italic>h</italic><sub>w</sub>/<italic>h</italic><sub>t</sub> = 1.0 and in this case the water depth and height of the model are the same. Moderate energy dissipation is observed for <italic>h</italic><sub>w</sub>/<italic>h</italic><sub>t</sub> = 1.2. Similar trends are observed for both the horizontal force and the vertical force and for both regular waves and random waves. The magnitude of the dimensionless horizontal force is found to be much less than the vertical force experienced by the model. The magnitude of the maximum dimensionless vertical force is almost 4 times the horizontal force for both regular waves and random waves and for all <italic>h</italic><sub>w</sub>/<italic>h</italic><sub>t</sub> tested.</p>

<title>Comparison of the transmission performance of an SBW with that of a rubble mound breakwater</title>
<p>Structures such as fully perforated breakwaters (perforated on both the quadrants of the SBW) will transmit wave energy to the lee side. The transmission characteristics of such breakwaters are mainly governed by parameters such as the crest free board, the percentage of perforations and the wave conditions. The literature available on the hydrodynamic characteristics of SBWs is rather scanty. Hence, the experimental results of the fully perforated SBWs are compared with the results on a conventional rubble mound breakwater, which permits transmission through the porosity available. The experiments were performed by Dhinakaran et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1475090212450119">4</xref></sup> for six different water depths; of these, three water depths are below the crest level of the breakwater, one is at the crest level and two water depths are above the crest level, resulting in <italic>R</italic><sub>c</sub> values ranging between 0.27 m and −0.27 m. The upper bound and the lower bound are obtained from the data considered and are given by 15% higher or lower than the mean line. The variation in <italic>K</italic><sub>t</sub> with respect to <italic>R</italic><sub>c</sub>/<italic>H</italic><sub>s</sub> only for fully perforated SBWs from the present study is presented together with the results of the work by van der Meer<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1475090212450119">31</xref></sup> in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-1475090212450119">Figure 5</xref>. From the comparison, it is understood that the <italic>K</italic><sub>t</sub> values for SBWf7 and SBWf11 are in between the lower bound and the upper bound for conventional breakwaters. For the emerged condition, i.e. for positive <italic>R</italic><sub>c</sub>/<italic>H</italic><sub>s</sub>, the SBW is found to experience more transmission than a rubble mound breakwater does whereas, for the submerged condition, i.e. for negative <italic>R</italic><sub>c</sub>/<italic>H</italic><sub>s</sub>, <italic>K</italic><sub>t</sub> is found to be less. From the above results, under the submerged condition, the SBW permits less transmission than does the rubble mound breakwater and indicates that an additional amount of energy is dissipated by perforations in the semicircular caisson which exhibits characteristics of a composite breakwater.</p>

</fig>
<p>However, in the case of SBWf17, although it permits more transmission for the emerged condition (positive <italic>R</italic><sub>c</sub>/<italic>H</italic><sub>s</sub>), <italic>K</italic><sub>t</sub> has almost the same magnitude as that for conventional breakwaters for the submerged condition (negative <italic>R</italic><sub>c</sub>/<italic>H</italic><sub>s</sub>). It should also be noted that, for <italic>R</italic><sub>c</sub>/<italic>H</italic><sub>s</sub> = 0, the energy transmitted by the SBW is slightly more than the maximum limit of <italic>K</italic><sub>t</sub> obtained for conventional rubble mound breakwaters. It is understood that an SBW is said to be more stable than is a rubble mound breakwater owing to the curvature provided by the semicircular caisson of the SBW.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1475090212450119">18</xref></sup> In the case of a rubble mound breakwater the probability of the sliding of stones is high and hence there are more possibilities of failure. However, in the case of an SBW, this condition will not occur. Hence it is recommended that fully perforated SBWs can be used very successfully for the submerged condition as a shore defence structure.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>The conclusions arrived at on the basis of detailed experimental investigations carried out to study the reflection, transmission, run-up characteristics, hydrodynamic forces and pressures on sea-side and fully perforated SBW models due to the action of regular and random waves for the emerged condition and the submerged condition by various researchers are given in following.</p>
<sec id="section28-1475090212450119">
<title>Emerged SBWs</title>
<p>The conclusions for emerged SBWs are as follows.</p>
<list id="list1-1475090212450119" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>The perforated SBW models reduces the wave energy primarily by energy dissipation.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>A percentage of perforations of up to 11% decreases the reflection coefficient and the run-up for the sea-side perforated SBW and shows the reverse trend for 17% perforations. The increase in the rubble mound height results in significant reductions in the reflection coefficient, the transmission coefficient and the run-up from <italic>h</italic><sub><italic>r</italic></sub>/<italic>h</italic><sub>t</sub> = 0.18 to <italic>h</italic><sub><italic>r</italic></sub>/<italic>h</italic><sub>t</sub> = 0.29 and these reductions are less significant for a further increase in <italic>h</italic><sub>r</sub>/<italic>h</italic><sub>t</sub> to 0.36.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The effect of the water depth on the reflection and the run-up characteristics of sea-side perforated SBW models is less significant than the the effect of perforations and the effect of the rubble mound height. The vertical forces are very much higher than the horizontal force for all the perforated SBW models tested and it is noteworthy that the vertical force acting on the semicircular caisson adds stability to the breakwater, since it is acting towards the centre of the breakwater.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The optimum value for the percentage of perforations in the case of a fully perforated SBW is 11% from the reflection viewpoint and the transmission viewpoint. For 17% perforations, the tranquility condition of the harbour becomes affected and hence this is not recommended. From the detailed experimental investigations conducted, it is recommended that the total height of the model in the field can be equal to 1.25 times the water depth, and the height of the rubble mound to be adopted can be equal to 0.29 times the total height of the model. These values can be adopted for both the sea-side perforated case and the fully perforated case in order to attain a better performance of the SBW.</p></list-item>

<sec id="section29-1475090212450119">
<title>Submerged SBWs</title>
<p>The conclusions for submerged SBWs are as follows.</p>
<list id="list2-1475090212450119" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>A submerged perforated SBW with a suitable percentage of perforations may work well, reducing the transmission coefficient and the reflection coefficient owing to higher energy dissipation. It also reduces the total horizontal wave force and the vertical wave force acting on the breakwater.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Of the three different <italic>h</italic><sub>w</sub>/<italic>h</italic><sub>t</sub> values tested, from both the reflection characteristics viewpoint and the transmission characteristics viewpoint, the case with <italic>h</italic><sub>w</sub>/<italic>h</italic><sub>t</sub> = 1.2 shows a better performance and experiences the maximum horizontal force and the maximum vertical force; because of this, main structures such as a vertical breakwater will be subjected to the least force. The magnitude of the vertical force is equal to almost 4 times the horizontal force in all the fully perforated SBW models tested and it is noteworthy that the vertical force acting on the semicircular caisson adds stability to the breakwater.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The hydrodynamic pressure decreases with an increase in the relative water depth and an increase in the percentage of perforations. These results are similar to the results obtained for forces. An increase in <italic>h</italic><sub>w</sub>/<italic>h</italic><sub>t</sub> up to 1.2 dissipates more energy, and a further increase in <italic>h</italic><sub>w</sub>/<italic>h</italic><sub>t</sub> to 1.4 shows the reverse trend. Hence it is suggested that <italic>h</italic><sub>w</sub>/<italic>h</italic><sub>t</sub> = 1.4 will not be feasible in the field, and for this reason it is not recommended. From the comparison of the results on the pressure to study the effect of the perforations on the water depth, it is concluded that the variation in the magnitude of pressure due to the effect of the perforations is less significant.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The optimum value for the percentage of perforations in the case of a fully perforated SBW is 11% from the experiments conducted in terms of the hydrodynamic performance. From the detailed experimental investigations it is recommended that the total height of the model to be constructed in the field can be equal to 1.2 times the water depth.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>In the case of a hemispherical artificial reef submerged breakwater, the wave height reduction is found to be influenced by the wave steepness, the depth of submergence and the geometry of the reef. About 60% of the incoming wave energy was reduced by the provision of such a hemispherical artificial reef.</p></list-item>
