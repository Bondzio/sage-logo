<abstract>
<p>The main objective of this study was to determine whether motivational and volitional variables identified in the health action process approach (HAPA) model can be used to successfully differentiate people with multiple sclerosis (MS) in different stages of change for exercise and physical activity. Ex-post-facto design using multiple discriminant analysis was used. Participants were 215 individuals with MS. The outcome variable was measured by the Physical Activity Stages of Change Instrument, along with motivational and volitional measures (severity, action self-efficacy, outcome expectancy, risk perception, perceived barriers, intention, maintenance self-efficacy, action and coping planning, and recovery self-efficacy). Participants in the precontemplation, contemplation, and action groups can be maximally separated by two significant canonical discriminant functions, volition and motivation. The action group can be differentiated from other groups based on high group mean (centroid) score on the volition function, and the precontemplation group can be differentiated based on low group means on both the motivation and volition functions. The contemplation group can be differentiated based on high centroid score on the motivation function. Research findings of this study support the concept of stage-matching exercise and physical activity intervention. The HAPA framework can be used to design health promotion behavioral interventions for people with MS in vocational rehabilitation.</p>

<p>According to the Healthy People 2020 document, one of the greatest threats to public health in the United States is obesity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0034355212439898">U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, 2010</xref>). Individuals with disabilities are known to have high prevalence and incidence of secondary conditions including overweight and obesity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0034355212439898">Lynch &amp; Chiu, 2009</xref>). Secondary conditions are health problems, if left untreated can worsen disability caused by a primary impairment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0034355212439898">Ipsen, Seekins, &amp; Ravesloot, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0034355212439898">Kinne, Patrick, &amp; Doyle, 2004</xref>). Secondary conditions can also adversely affect employment outcomes of people with disabilities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0034355212439898">Ipsen et al., 2010</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0034355212439898">Ipsen (2006)</xref> examined the relationship between employment and health behaviors using data from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System. She found that exercise/physical activity increased the probability of employment of people with physical disabilities. Based on the findings of their programmatic research in health and disability, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0034355212439898">Ipsen et al. (2010)</xref> indicated that many secondary conditions including physical deconditioning, fatigue, sleep problems, weight problems, pain, depression, and social isolation respond well to health promotion behavioral interventions.</p>
<p>However, previous studies of exercise and physical activity behavior of people with chronic illness and disability have been criticized for lacking a sound theoretical basis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0034355212439898">Tulloch et al., 2009</xref>), leading to the current interest in applying health behavior change theories to improve our understanding of exercise and physical activity behavior of people with disabilities. Some of the more popular theories include social cognitive theory, the transtheoretical (stages of change) model, theory of planned behavior, self- determination theory, and protection motivation theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0034355212439898">Tulloch et al., 2009</xref>). These theories have found to be useful in identifying potentially important and modifiable exercise determinants for people without disabilities. However, there is a lack of research using these theories individually or collectively to study health-promoting behavior of people with disabilities including multiple sclerosis (MS). The health action process approach (HAPA), which integrates the health self-efficacy theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0034355212439898">Bandura, 1997</xref>), the planned behavior theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0034355212439898">Ajzen &amp; Fishbein, 1980</xref>), and the transtheoretical stages of change theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0034355212439898">Prochaska, DiClemente, &amp; Norcross, 1992</xref>) to predict engagement in health-promoting behavior, appears to have great potential as a motivational model for exercise and physical activity self-management for people with disabilities.</p>
<sec id="section1-0034355212439898">
<title>The HAPA Model and Intervention Matrix</title>
<p>The HAPA model was developed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0034355212439898">Ralf Schwarzer (1992)</xref> in Germany. Specifically, the model incorporated the stages of change theory by identifying individuals who have no intention to perform (preintenders [precontemplation]), people who intend to perform (intenders [contemplation]), and those who are already performing the target health behavior (actors [action and maintenance]). Schwarzer indicates that the adoption, initiation, and maintenance of health-promoting behaviors (e.g., exercise and physical activity) can be conceptualized as a process composed of a motivation phase and a volition phase. In the motivation phase, the focus is on encouraging the preintender to form an intention to engage in health-promoting behaviors over risky or unhealthy behaviors. The concepts of self-efficacy and outcome expectancies presented in Banduraâs social-cognitive health theory are seen as major predictors of behavioral intentions. Risk awareness is also hypothesized to be associated with intentions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0034355212439898">Schwarzer, 2008</xref>). However, to be effective, messages using fear or threat must be framed in a way that allows individuals to feel they have the abilities, skills, and coping resources to engage in a target health-promoting behavior. The motivation phase in the HAPA model is useful for describing what people choose to do, whereas the volition phase helps to describe how hard people will try and how long they will persist in a determined action.</p>
<p>In the volition phase, the emphasis is on helping people move from intention to action and maintenance behaviors. Based on the theory of planned behavior, the HAPA model posits that it is the volitional or self-regulatory processes that mediate between the intention and action. The volitional/self-regulatory processes can be further divided into action planning and coping planning and is hypothesized to be strongly influenced by action self-efficacy because the number and quality of action plans and the optimal use of resources are dependent on oneâs perceived competence and experience. To shape a target health-promoting behavior (e.g., exercise and physical activity), the intention has to be transformed into detailed instructions of how to perform the desired action such as what exercise equipment to buy, when and how often to exercise, and when and where to exercise. Once an action has been initiated, the behavior has to be protected from being interrupted or terminated due to incompatible competing demands (e.g., a demanding work schedule, health complications), and maintenance self-efficacy determines the amount of effort that will be expanded and maintained. Coping planning will enable the individual to reengage in health-promoting behavior after any interruption of the behavior. Furthermore, both situational barriers and opportunities will affect volitional behavior. If situational cues are overwhelming, metacognitive skills and internal coping dialogues will not be sufficient to bridge the gaps between intention and action. Finally, actions are not only a function of intentions and cognitive control but are also influenced by the perceived and the actual support in the environment. The HAPA model has been validated in a series of studies and the results indicated that HAPA constructs are predictive of exercise, drinking, and diet behavior and can be used to design health promotion behavioral interventions for patients in cardiac rehabilitation and people with other chronic conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0034355212439898">Schwarzer, Lippke, &amp; Luszczynska, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>Based on the HAPA model, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0034355212439898">Schwarzer et al. (2011)</xref> developed an intervention matrix to help rehabilitation health professionals to conceptualize stage-specific health promotion interventions for people with chronic illness and disability. They suggested that in the motivational phase, the preintenders could benefit from interventions that help them develop self-efficacy and deal with any unrealistic risk perception and outcome expectancies, whereas intenders would not need to be confronted as they have already set goals and have moved beyond the preintender stage. Conversely, intenders would benefit from interventions related to planning and from interventions that translate their intentions into direct action. For actors, interventions that target planning strategies aim at preventing relapse, or interventions that reinforce the maintenance of their health-promoting behavior are indicated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0034355212439898">Schwarzer et al., 2011</xref>). The stages are not rigid in nature and allow for a variety of approaches, while the assessment of stages can be measured without adherence to specific time frames (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0034355212439898">Schwarzer et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0034355212439898">Sutton, 2000</xref>). The HAPA intervention model assumes that one set of social-cognitive and behavioral variables can be important in helping to move people from the preintender to intender stage, whereas a different set of variables may have stronger influence for moving individuals from the intender to the actor stage. The HAPA constructs and variables associated with each stages of change in the HAPA intervention matrix are presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0034355212439898">Table 1</xref>.</p>

<p>Specifically, the HAPA intervention matrix specifically indicates motivational constructs (motivational self-efficacy, risk perception, outcome expectancies, and goal setting) as the focus of health promotion interventions indicated for individuals in the preintender stage. Interventions addressing issues related to the volitional constructs such as action planning, coping planning, and maintenance self-efficacy are most suitable for individuals in the intender stage. Other volitional constructs such as action planning, coping planning, recovery self-efficacy, and action controlârelated interventions are the best strategies that meet the cognitive mind-set of individuals in the actor stage.</p>

<title>Purpose of the Study</title>
<p>There are about 400,000 people with MS living in the United States (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0034355212439898">National Multiple Sclerosis Society [NMSS], 2012</xref>). Research has indicated that physical activity (e.g., yoga, exercise, and stretch) can ameliorate MS symptoms and secondary health problems associated with an inactive lifestyle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0034355212439898">Bombardier, Wadhwani, &amp; LaRotonda, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0034355212439898">Motl, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0034355212439898">Motl &amp; McAuley, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0034355212439898">Motl, McAuley, &amp; Snook, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0034355212439898">A. Stuifbergen, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0034355212439898">A. K. Stuifbergen &amp; Rogers, 1997</xref>). However, how well people with MS manage their secondary conditions depends more on what they do than on what is done to them. Individuals with MS need to pay attention to their medical management, exercise, diet, stress level, and alcohol consumption, using multiple coping strategies. Unfortunately, making behavior change is notoriously difficult because maladaptive behaviors are well-rehearsed automatic behaviors. Learning and practicing adaptive health promotion self-management techniques can be challenging. Therefore, behavior changes necessary for adaptive self-management are unlikely to occur in the absence of significant motivation.</p>
<p>The HAPA model, which integrates the health self-efficacy theory, the planned behavior theory, and the stages of change model, has been found to predict engagement in health-promoting behaviors including exercise and physical activity and may be useful for developing health promotion behavioral interventions for people with MS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0034355212439898">Chiu, Lynch, Chan, &amp; Berven, 2011</xref>). However, the HAPA intervention matrix has not been validated for people with MS and other disability groups. The purpose of this study was to determine whether motivational and volitional variables identified in the HAPA model can be used to successfully differentiate people with MS in different stages of change for exercise and physical activity.</p>

<title>Participants</title>
<p>Participants were 215 individuals with MS, recruited from the NMSS and the neurology clinic of a university teaching hospital in the Midwest. The inclusion criteria for participation are a MS diagnosis, age between 18 and 65, and living in the community. Ages of the participants ranged from 19 to 67 years, with a mean of 47.38 years (<italic>SD</italic> = 10.19). Most of the participants were women (<italic>n</italic> = 185, 86.0%), married (<italic>n</italic> = 152, 70.7%), and White (<italic>n</italic> = 187, 87.0%). Participants were relatively well-educated with 34.0% having some college education, 34.4% having graduated from college, and 21.4% having completed graduate school education. About 39.1% of the participants had been retired due to MS and 12.1% were unemployed, while 32.6% were employed full-time. Sixty-four (29.8%) participants were professionals, 19 were managers (8.8%), and 33 (15.3%) were in clerical or sales occupations. Ninety-three (43.3%) of the participants reported being treated for secondary health conditions (e.g., overweight, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, and diabetes).</p>

<title>Minimal Record of Disability (MRD)</title>
<p>The MRD was developed by the International Federation of Multiple Sclerosis Societies (1984) to operationalize the construct severity of MS by evaluating MS symptoms and performance of activity of daily living. It is composed of 23 items and two subscales: (a) the Incapacity Status Scale (ISS), 16 items (e.g., âstair climbing,â âspeech and hearing,â and âmood and thoughâ), has a focus on functional disability in activities of daily living (ADL) and (b) the Environment Status Scale (ESS), 7 items (e.g., âwork status,â âpersonal residence or home,â and âtransportationâ), has an emphasis on social impairment resulting from the illness. ISS items are rated on a 5-point Likert-type scale ranging from 0 (<italic>no disability</italic>) to 4 (<italic>most disability</italic>). ESS items are rated on a 6-point Likert-type scale ranging from 0 (<italic>no disability</italic>) to 5 (<italic>totally lost</italic>). The ISS with its focus on ADL was used to operationally define MS severity in the current study. Moderate intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC) were found between the MRD and the Kurtzke Functional System (KFS), ranging from .26 with the KFS sensory scale to .69 with the KFS pyramidal function scale (Solari et al., 1993). In addition, high concordance (ICC = .84) was found between the MRD and the Expanded Disability Status Scale. Cronbachâs alpha coefficients for the ISS and ESS in the present study were computed to be .90 and .90, respectively.</p>

The CESD-10 consists of 10 items (e.g., âI felt depressedâ), and the test items are rated from the perspective of how often the respondent felt this way during the past week using a 4-point Likert-type scale of 0 (<italic>rarely or none of the time, less than 1 day</italic>), 1 (<italic>some or a little of the time, 1â2 days</italic>), 2 (<italic>occasionally or a moderate amount of time, 3â4 days</italic>), and 3 (<italic>all of the time, 5â7 days</italic>). The total score can range from 0 to 30. A score of 10 or above is indicative of depressive symptoms. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0034355212439898">Miller, Anton, and Townson (2008)</xref> reported an ICC of .85 (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .05). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0034355212439898">Andresen et al.

The HRPS is composed of six items (e.g., ânot exercising regularly [e.g., walking briskly for 30 min at least 3 times a week]).â HRPS items are rated on a 5-point Likert-type scale ranging from 1 (<italic>not at all risky</italic>) to 5 (<italic>extremely risky</italic>). The total score can range from 6 to 30.

<p>Multiple discriminant analysis (MDA) was used to determine the ability of the HAPA motivation and volition indicators to discriminate among participants representing the three levels of stages of change to engage in exercise/physical activity in this study. The direct method was used to enter the discriminating variables into the discriminant function.

<p>For the motivational constructs, the actor group had the highest action self-efficacy (<italic>M</italic> = 54.30, <italic>SD</italic> = 9.02) compared with the preintender (<italic>M</italic> = 45.39, <italic>SD</italic> = 9.95) and intender (<italic>M</italic> = 46.64, <italic>SD</italic> = 8.77) groups. Both intenders and actors had similarly high outcome expectancies (<italic>M</italic> = 50.40, <italic>SD</italic> = 8.73; <italic>M</italic> = 53.17, <italic>SD</italic> = 8.03) and risk perceptions scores (<italic>M</italic> = 50.14, <italic>SD</italic> = 9.71 ; <italic>M</italic> = 52.89, <italic>SD</italic> = 8.36) compared with the preintenders (<italic>M</italic> = 43.54, <italic>SD</italic> = 10.84). Both preintenders and intenders had higher perceived barrier scores (<italic>M</italic> = 54.81, <italic>SD</italic> = 10.09; <italic>M</italic> = 54.51, <italic>SD</italic> = 9.72) than participants in the actor group (<italic>M</italic> = 45.05, <italic>SD</italic> = 7.48).</p>
<p>For the volition constructs, participants in the actor group had the highest action and coping planning and maintenance and recovery self-efficacy scores, followed by the participants in the intender group and then by the preintender group.

<sec id="section23-0034355212439898">
<title>MDA</title>
<p>MDA was used to determine whether preintenders, intenders, and actors could be differentiated based on their motivational and volitional score patterns. The main reason for using MDA in this study is to identify factors or attributes that are able to separate or distinguish the predefined groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0034355212439898">Klecka, 1980</xref>). Specifically, a series of linear combination of attributes (i.e., canonical discriminant functions) contributing maximally to group separation is identified and substantively interpreted to provide meanings for the group differentiation. There is no definitive rule of thumb for computing the sample size for MDA. A conservative recommendation is to have 5 to 10 times as many observations for each discriminating variable per group. To meet this criterion, we combined the action, maintenance, and recovery self-efficacy variables as the exercise self-efficacy variable, and the action planning and coping planning variables as the planned behavior variable. Specifically, severity of MS, exercise self-efficacy, outcome expectancies, risk awareness, perceived barriers, and planned behavior were used as the discriminating variables, and the stages of change for exercise/physical activity variable were used as the group membership (dependent) variable.</p>
<p>Two significant discriminant functions were calculated. For the combination of both discriminant functions (1 through 2), the Wilksâs Lambda was computed to be .55, Ï<sup>2</sup>(12, <italic>N</italic> = 215) = 124.91, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001. After the first function is removed, the test of Function 2 is still significant, Wilksâs Lambda = .92, Ï<sup>2</sup>(5, <italic>N</italic> = 215) = 16.97, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01. The effect sizes for the discriminant functions are (.64)<sup>2</sup> = .41 and (.28)<sup>2</sup> = .08, respectively. The two functions accounted for about 41% and 8% of the total relationships between predictors and groups. The first discriminant function accounted for 89% of the between-group (explained) variance in the solution, whereas the second discriminant function accounted for 11% of the variance.</p>
<p>To interpret the meanings of the discriminant functions, the structure matrix (correlations between the two canonical discriminant functions and the discriminating HAPA variables) was rotated by the varimax method. The rotated structure matrix was examined to help define the discriminant functions. The correlations between the discriminating variables and the first significant canonical discriminant function were highest for (a) Planned Behavior (.79), (b) Exercise/Physical Activity Self-Efficacy (.70), and (c) Perceived Barriers (â.70). Based on the simple structure concept used in factor analysis, severity of MS (â.34) could also be a variable that is loaded on Function 1. Basically, the function represents less severity of disability, lower perceived barriers for exercise/physical activity, higher self-efficacy for exercise/physical activity, and higher action planning and coping planning ability for exercise/physical activity and can be characterized as represented by volitional factors with severity and perceived barriers as moderating variables. In Function 2, two motivational factors outcome expectancies (.76) and risk awareness (.61) were highly related to this function. The group centroids (group means) along the significant discriminant functions (the distance of each group from the center of the canonical function) indicated that the actor group was located at the positive end of the continuum on Function 1-Volition (0.83) and in the middle of the continuum on Function 2-Motivation (â0.07). The intender group was located at the positive end of the continuum on Function 2-Motivation (0.39) and in the middle of the continuum on Function 1-Volition (â0.53). The preintender group was located on the negative extreme of the continuum of both Function 2-Motivation (â0.39) and Function 1-Volition (â1.07). The results indicated that the HAPA motivational and volitional variables can maximally separate the preintender, intender, and action groups, with the preintender group maximally separated from the rest of the two groups based on low centroid scores on both motivational and volitional functions, the intender group was separated from the rest of the two groups based on high centroid score on the motivational function and moderate centroid score on the volitional function, and the actor group was separated from the other two groups based on high centroid score on the volitional function and moderate centroid score on the motivational function.</p>
<p>Classification functions for each stage of change group were then generated from the discriminant functions. The classification functions permit the input of an individualâs raw score for each of the HAPA variables to estimate the probability of the membership in each of the stage of change groups. Each individualâs subtest scores were entered as a separate classification function for each of the intender group levels. The individual was predicted to belong to the group for which the highest probability estimate was obtained. Overall, 68% of the participants were accurately classified, which is a significant improvement over the base rate (chance) prediction of 47% (i.e., the sample size [<italic>n</italic> = 102] of the largest group divided by the total sample [<italic>N</italic> = 215] and multiplied by 100). A classification function accuracy of 87% was achieved for the actor group, 51% for the preintender group, and 52% for the intender group, indicating that the discriminant functions are better at predicting the membership of the actor group than the preintender and intender groups. Finally, the jackknife procedure was used to assess the external validity of statistical results of discriminant analysis. The overall classification accuracy was reduced from 68% to 63%. The shrinkage (minimum error rate) of only 5% in accuracy suggested the MDA results can be replicated in other samples.</p>

The purpose of this study was to determine whether motivational and volitional variables identified in the HAPA model can be used to successfully differentiate people with MS in different stages of change for exercise and physical activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0034355212439898">Schwarzer et al., 2011</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0034355212439898">Schwarzer et al. (2011)</xref> suggest that people can be classified into preintender, intender, and actor groups based on their readiness for engagement in health-promoting behaviors. The HAPA intervention model hypothesizes that different sets of social-cognitive and behavioral variables will be important for different stages of change groups.</p>
<p>In the current study, the actor group was found to have the lowest severity of disability scores, whereas the preintender and intender groups shared similarly high severity scores. The results suggested that functional limitations and social impairments can prevent people with MS from engaging in health-promoting behavior such as exercise and physical activity. Therefore, physical therapy, occupational therapy, and rehabilitation psychology interventions to improve physical and social functioning may be an important requisite step to help increase the motivation of people with MS to exercise/physical activity. In terms of motivation, participants in the actor group perceived themselves as having high action self-efficacy, outcome expectancies, and risk awareness and low barriers for exercise/physical activity. Individuals in the intender group also indicated high outcome expectancies and risk awareness but low on action self-efficacy and high on perceived barriers for exercise/physical activity. The preintender group was low on action self-efficacy, outcome expectancies, and risk awareness and high on perceived barriers. According to the HAPA intervention matrix, only members of the preintender group are considered in need of interventions in motivational variables. However, it appears that the intender group will still need interventions to strengthen their self-efficacy beliefs and to reduce their perceived barriers for exercise/physical activity in order to move to the volition stage. In terms of volition, the actor group did have the highest scores on action and coping planning and maintenance and recovery self-efficacy, and the intender group also had higher scores than the preintender group on these volition variables. The results support the need to strengthen performance in volition variables to help people in the intender group to move to the actor group. For the actor group, it is important to focus on preventing individuals from relapsing to physical inactivity, and the enhancement of maintenance and recover self-efficacy will be important for people in the actor group. In terms of quality of life, individuals with MS who are engaging in exercise/physical activity behavior fare better and have higher health-related quality of life and life satisfaction than people in both the preintender and internder groups. Apparently, having intention but no action does not improve health-related quality of life and life satisfaction.</p>
<p>Importantly, MDA results indicated that HAPA motivational and volition variables can significantly differentiate the preintender, intender, and action groups consistent with the expectations of the HAPA intervention matrix, providing strong empirical evidence to support the usefulness of the HAPA framework for conceptualizing behavioral interventions for people with MS in different stages of readiness to promote engagement in exercise/physical activity and other health-promoting behaviors. Our research findings underscore the importance of social-cognitive variables in enhancing motivation to engage in health-promoting behavior and the importance of planned behavior (i.e., action and coping planning) in bridging the gaps between intention and action. The HAPA model can be used as a research framework to develop cognitive and behavioral measures and evidence-based interventions to promote exercise/physical activity and other health-promoting behaviors of people with MS using randomized clinical trials.</p>

<title>Limitations</title>
<p>There are several limitations that should be considered when applying or interpreting the results of this study. First, a convenience sample was used for this study, and the participants completed the research instruments through an online survey. It is possible to have sampling bias because people who have access and skills in using the Internet may constitute a unique group of individuals with MS. Moreover, individuals who know how to use community resources are more likely to join the local chapter of the NMSS; therefore, they may be different from people who are less aware of community resources. Second, the numbers of items for a variable was considered for the length of survey. To save participant time and energy, the study used several 2- to 3-item short forms, which may cause measurement problems. Third, all of the measures used in this study were self-report, which may not correspond to objective indicators. Finally, the HAPA model was more successful in predicting the action group and less successful in predicting the precontemplation and contemplation groups suggesting there may be additional factors (e.g., social support, health promotion resources, protection motivation, and empowerment) that may need to be included in the motivational and volitional phases of the HAPA model.</p>

<title>Implications for Rehabilitation Counseling Practice</title>
<p>The importance of preventing and managing secondary conditions to improve community participation and quality of life of people with disabilities including individuals with MS has been underscored by rehabilitation and health researchers. Being healthy is critical to the ability of people with MS to fully participate in the community including independent living and competitive employment. Rehabilitation counselors, with their training in medical aspects of disabilities and psychosocial interventions for people with disabilities, are uniquely qualified to conduct theory-driven research, develop and validate health promotion interventions, and deliver efficacious and effective health promotion services for people with disabilities within the state-federal vocational rehabilitation program. One of the most well-known health promotion programs developed specifically for people with disabilities is the <italic>Living Well With a Disability</italic> health promotion program. It is a consumer-directed, goal-focused health promotion program that helps individuals to develop foundations for lifestyle change. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0034355212439898">Ravesloot, Seekins, and Young (1998)</xref> evaluated the effectiveness of the <italic>Living Well</italic> program with 35 people with disabilities. The result showed that participants in the treatment group decreased 37% in reported limitations due to secondary conditions. Similarly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0034355212439898">Ravesloot et al. (2005)</xref> investigated the effectiveness of a similar health promotion intervention for adults with mobility impairments. They recruited 188 participants and used an interrupted time series, staggered baseline, quasi-experimental design with random assignment to treatment start date. They found reductions in limitations from secondary conditions, symptom days, and health care utilization over the intervention period. Effects on secondary conditions lasted for 12 months. In addition, overall cost savings of US$807 per person (total for sample US$151,716) were projected from reductions in health care utilization of the study sample. Similarly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0034355212439898">Zemper et al. (2003)</xref> tested the efficacy of a holistic wellness program for 43 adults with spinal cord injuries. The intervention program included physical activity, nutrition, lifestyle management, and prevention of secondary conditions. When they compared the within-group baseline with the final results, they found that the intervention group had fewer and less severe secondary conditions, and had significant improvement of health-related self-efficacy and health behaviors.</p>
<p>Although initial validation of several behavioral health promotion intervention programs for people with disabilities appear to be promising, it is important to note that the manner by which people with disabilities including people with MS manage their physical and mental health depends more on what they do themselves than on what is done to or for them. However, learning and practicing adaptive physical activity self-management techniques can be challenging, and the behavior changes necessary for physical activity self-management are unlikely to occur in the absence of significant motivation. Interventions such as the <italic>Living Well</italic> program provides a foundation for developing evidence-based interventions, and the HAPA framework allows us to improve and refine our physical activity self-management training for people with MS. It appears that the use of the HAPA framework and a motivational interviewing format to encourage the development of self-initiated health behaviors (e.g., physical activity, stress management, healthy diet, and social activity) and personal responsibility and commitment to a healthy lifestyle may be effective for people with MS. It is also important to incorporate low-impact activity training such as swimming, walking, aerobic, and alternative training such as yoga, tai chi, and qigong to strengthen action self-efficacy beliefs in health promotion interventions for people with MS. The HAPA framework provides the blueprint for developing the contents of a motivational based health promotion intervention program for people with MS. Efficacy of such HAPA-based motivational intervention can be validated using randomized controlled trials.</p>
<p>In conclusion, the phase approach used by the HAPA model to increase motivation and exercise/physical activity self-efficacy to engage in physical activity and other health-promoting behavior can potentially augment health promotion interventions already developed for people with disabilities. The empirical support for using the HAPA framework to promote exercise/physical activity behavior can probably generalize to other health-promoting behaviors such as diet, stress reduction, smoke cessation, and drinking in moderation.</p>
<p>Using the HAPA model, rehabilitation counselors could help individuals with disabilities to engage in health-promoting behavior such as exercise and physical activity. Increasing physical activity could lead to positive emotional responses to adversity and stress caused by disabilities or chronic illnesses. The ultimate goal of health promotion interventions, within the rehabilitation counseling field, is to help individuals to develop motivation and learn skills that are needed for the behavioral change. The HAPA framework provides with the necessary tools to identify the specific stages where the individual mind-set is in his or her continuum of behavioral change, from those who are contemplating about change to those who are already engaged in the target behavior. The advantage of this approach is that by knowing where the person is at in the behavior change continuum, rehabilitation counselors can develop stage-matched interventions tailored to facilitate the transition from one stage to the next one.</p>
