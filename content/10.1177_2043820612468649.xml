There are many productive moments here that we could, in turn, affirm and extend. In what follows, we choose to build on some of the points raised by way of a deeper engagement with one of the authors, Elizabeth Grosz, that a number of the respondents have evoked, implicitly as well as explicitly, in their response to our text and, in particular, Grosz’s arguments on art as of the chaotic and of the animal.</p><p>Grosz’s main text here is her book <italic>Chaos, Territory, Art </italic>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-2043820612468649">2008a</xref>), which is predicated upon a lecture Grosz gave at the ‘New Constellations: Art, Science and Society’ conference in Sydney, Australia, in 2006. In a set of arguments heavily indebted to Deleuze and Guattari, she outlines what, for her, are both the commonalities and the differences between science, philosophy and art. All of these, she writes, are particular ways of framing chaos. Chaos is not the fundamental stuff of the universe; rather, there is a rhythmic, irreducibly durational universe of invisible, inaudible forces whose order is not experientially discernible. These are inhuman; they cannot be lived. Instead, they are manifest through processes of composition – interpreted as framings proffered by, for example, music, art and architecture – that lay them out for sensory consumption. Thus, we partake of the universe through chaos.</p><p>On the topic of framing chaos, however, Grosz has more to say than this. These framings are of the animal and the environment because they are a living with chaos, of intensifying sensation beyond the necessity for survival itself. Eschewing a definition of art as that belonging to the highest order of a human sensibility, Grosz writes that,</p><disp-quote><p>Man, that all-too-human creature, is what the animal has created and continues to inform; and the animal is the source and force that enables the most human of all productions—art, science, philosophy—to be seen, not as the culmination of logos, but as the animal gift, the animal impetus, that the human has inherited and must make, however provisionally, his own (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-2043820612468649">2008b</xref>: 46).</p></disp-quote><p>Can we consider animals artistic?<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-2043820612468649">1</xref></sup> For Grosz, certainly,</p><disp-quote><p>[I]f by that we understand that they intensify sensation (including the sensations of their human observers), that they enjoy this intensification, and that it entails a provisional stability such as the constitution of a territory implies (2008a: 69–70).</p></disp-quote><p>Territory here is, ‘the slowing down, the provisional formalisation of elements of chaos … the congealing of a block of space-time, and a rhythm, the emergence of a periodicity’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-2043820612468649">Grosz, 2008a</xref>: 47). Territory,</p><disp-quote><p>is an external synthesis, a bricolage, of geographical elements, environmental characteristics, material features, shifted and reorganised fragments from a number of <italic>milieus</italic> (chaos itself is nothing but the <italic>milieu</italic> of all <italic>milieus</italic>) that create both an inside, an outside, a passage from the one to the other, and a space that is annexed, outside, contestatory, a resource: a cohesion inside, a domain outside, doorways from one to the other and energy reserves to enable them to reconfigure or reorchestate themselves (Grosz, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-2043820612468649">2008a</xref>: 47).</p></disp-quote><p>Importantly, such animal artistry pertains from a sexuated mode of reproduction that increases biological difference and that can be traced back to a morphological bifurcation evinced, for example, by the cyanobacteria that co-inhabit and help to create the thrombolite. Morphological bifurcation, wherein cellular materials and their associated capacities are differentially located in the cell and then sundered as reproduction of the cell occurs, is</p><disp-quote><p>one of the earliest upheavals in the evolution of life on earth and undoubtedly the most momentous invention that life has brought forth, the very machinery for guaranteeing the endless generation of morphological and genetic variation, the very mechanism of biological difference itself (Grosz, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-2043820612468649">2008a</xref>: 6).</p></disp-quote><p>A maximal biological diversity is thus predicated on the division of species into beings that differ from each other with regards to their reproductive capacity. Following Darwin, she also notes, however, that sexual selection carries with it an excess beyond the requirements of reproduction. There is ‘art in the natural world,’ Grosz maintains, ‘from the moment there is sexual selection, from the moment there are two sexes that attract each other’s interest and taste through visual, auditory, olfactory, tactile and gustatory sensations’ (2008a: 7). And, we hope that our writing on the artistic deployment of artistic bowerbirds has usefully illustrated this line of argument.</p><p>The matter of morphological bifurcation can, however, offer another line of inquiry into aesthetics, one which Clarke (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-2043820612468649">2012</xref>) nicely marks in his response. As he points out, there is an abyssal moment in our text wherein we move from a consideration of sexual selection to symbiosis and accretion as productive of diversity, a term that no longer sits quite so comfortably in the lexicon of the ‘animal’, nor, as Clarke (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-2043820612468649">2012</xref>) observes, does it speak to a rhythmic periodicity. From a thrombolite persepective, genetic material becomes a means of expression – that is, they put content to work – not only via their role within morphological bifurcation but also via accretion. To be specific, the sticky, unsheathed DNA material extruded by microorganisms becomes a crucial means of cementation and the production of a graduated chemicophysical <italic>milieu</italic>. In order to sketch out this line of inquiry, we turned away from a Deleuzo-Guattarian territorial artfulness toward a Deleuzian reworking of expressivity via an acknowledgement of a ‘biological transcendental aesthetic’ (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-2043820612468649">Protevi, 2010</xref>). That is, a biological, or enactive, cognition, wherein ‘sense making’ is no longer to be apprehended as a transcendental <italic>analytic</italic>, and where aesthetics must be comprehended as a higher level of emergent complexity. Instead, biological sense making proffers the a priori, but always concrete, genesis, of organic time and space (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-2043820612468649">Deleuze, 1994</xref>: 98). This is a ‘golem geography’, one might say, that looks to the enabling role of the material at hand.</p><p>Thinking on the responses to our text, and in particular Clarke’s point that we eschew an ontologised politics, there is another line of inquiry that can be usefully brought to bear here. As noted above, Grosz valorises a sexuated framing of biological difference. And she finds inspiration for this in the work of Lucé Irigaray and the specificity, and non-substitutability, of the maternal body. She notes, for example, that for Darwin, ‘the very machinery for generating biological difference is sexual difference. This informs Irigaray’s work, and it makes a very convincing and powerful argument for the ontological status of sexual difference’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-2043820612468649">Kontturi and Tiainen, 2007</xref>: 249). And, we might add, for a feminist politics of and for the body, insofar as it is this difference that is so often glossed by philosophic, as well as geographic, work on bodies, corporeality and aesthetics.</p><p>Yet if we look to Irigaray’s (1991) work on Nietzsche, we find her posing the need for a form of reproduction that does not arise solely from differently sexed bodies. Her solution is a Darwinian-inspired, elemental genealogy. For while Irigaray argues that ‘sexual difference is given, not constructed’ she contends ‘it must also be lived, created, invented’ (Grosz, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-2043820612468649">2011</xref>: 148). To make this claim, Irigaray is influenced by Darwin’s theory of sexual selection, where ‘the origins of life prompt speculation about what elemental context (air? water? rock?) we might imagine giving rise to them’ (Deutscher, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-2043820612468649">2011</xref>: 71). For Deutscher, this is suggestive of an, ‘a “prior” to sexual difference’ (Deutscher, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-2043820612468649">2011</xref>: 71). And yet there is a reciprocity here, a mutual co-constitution of matter, elements and life which Irigaray draws attention to as she discusses the ‘tomb robbing earthworm’ (Irigaray, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-2043820612468649">1991</xref>: 10), itself an asexual hermaphrodite. As Deutscher asks, ‘what is the earthy element, if not enabled to its incessant and vital circulation by the earthworm?’ (2011: 71)</p><p>To posit, such an elemental genealogy is not to discount the arguments on sexuated difference for which Irigaray is best known but to extend an understanding of difference towards differentiating matter as a predicate to, but not necessarily coincident with, the sexuated: put succinctly, we find an engendering of bodies that are not necessarily gendered. Within Irigaray’s discussion of matter and difference, we can draw out an emphasis on bodies, human or otherwise, as temporal ‘amorphes’ in continuous ‘gestation’, functions of the intensity of becoming rather than of finite singular being (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-2043820612468649">1993</xref>: 193; see also Olkowski, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-2043820612468649">2000</xref>, and Ziarek, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-2043820612468649">1998</xref>). Following up this matter-based difference, we can, perhaps, productively turn back to Deleuze (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-2043820612468649">1994</xref>), and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-2043820612468649">Deleuze with Guattari (2004)</xref>, to take up their ideas of organic sense making and organic expression. This is to implicate aesthetics and an artistry within a constant sense of becoming, as Grosz does, but, importantly, this is not a becoming predicated upon sexuated difference but across and down chemical concentration gradients.</p><p>This is, perhaps, another abyssal move, but one that does not depart from an understanding of the conditions for aesthetics and artistry being predicated on ‘nature as a dynamic open-endedness’ (Kontturi and Tiainen, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-2043820612468649">2007</xref>: 225). It is a move that, to be sure, refuses to pin back the aesthetic for careful scrutiny, and the enunciation of proper procedures for such an examination. We would hope, instead, that this response reads as a continuation of our contemplation on thresholds, one that acknowledges the <italic>here</italic> from which questions are propelled, but with the acknowledgement also that their line of flight serves to signal in some fashion the makings of an <italic>elsewhere</italic>.</p></body><back><notes><title>Note</title><fn-group><fn fn-type="other" id="fn1-2043820612468649"><p>1.

For Guattari, indeed, art is a privileged site of challenge to capitalism as an ordering principle that neutralises difference; in ecological terms, this is the organisation of subjectivity around money and material production for its own sake, a subject that sees the world as a separate object as resource. Art has the capacity to produce ‘unprecedented, unforeseen and unthinkable qualities of being’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-2043820612468649">Guattari, 1995</xref>: 106).</p></fn></fn-group></notes><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="bibr1-2043820612468649"><citation citation-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Clarke</surname><given-names>N</given-names></name></person-group> (<year>2012</year>) <article-title>Sex, politics and inhuman artistry</article-title>. <source>Dialogues in Human Geography</source> <volume>2</volume>(<issue>3</issue>). <comment>doi: 10.1177/2043820612468641</comment></citation></ref><ref id="bibr2-2043820612468649"><citation citation-type="book"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Deleuze</surname><given-names>G</given-names></name></person-group> (<year>1994</year>) <source>Difference and Repetition</source>. <publisher-loc>Patton P (Trans.).
