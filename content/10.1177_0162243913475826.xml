<abstract>
<p>Stem cell researchers labor in unpredictable circumstances, beset by uncertainties allied to the study of cellular signaling behaviors. STS research, based primarily on the work of Star (1985), has demonstrated that medical scientists often approach these vicissitudes using a type of phronesis that aims to better qualify the causes of experimental ambiguities, while also identifying optimistic reference points to help guide future research. Knowledge of this type of phronesis is extended by this article, which examines the composition of the three most popular citations allied to the regenerative cellular biology/human-induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSC) literature. When analyzed, these papers afford evidence that the adducement of positive signals begins with sorting and categorizing. This article finds that, when representing the outcomes of this cataloging for peer-review consumption, the authors concerned predicated their observations in a perspicacious rhetoric, which serves to reinforce positive-leaning ascriptions by couching them in images of virtue, fortitude, and due diligence. The research findings presented herewith suggest that adducements of this kind may be anchored in a representational practice that could be described as “modal splicing.” This article contributes to the STS literature by observing connections between modal splicing, perspicacious representation, and knowledge affirmations in hiPSC contexts.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The DNA signatures of human-induced Pluripotent Stem Cells or hiPSCs are thought to harbor miraculous secrets, including an elusive cipher for the unhindered “eternal regeneration” of human body tissue that has yet to be fully unraveled (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0162243913475826">Rosenthal 2003</xref>, 273; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0162243913475826">Lanza and Rosenthal 2004</xref>, 92-99; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0162243913475826">Department of Health and Human Services 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0162243913475826">Mostoslavsky 2011</xref>, 28-29; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0162243913475826">Martins-Taylor and Xu 2011</xref>, 22; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0162243913475826">Ren et al. 2012</xref>). Although there are missing pieces to this genetic puzzle, clinical trials of medicinal hiPSC products have been tendered in the United States, and Europe, among specialisms as diverse as dermatology, injury medicine, sensory research, organ substitution, coronary care, and cancer palliation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0162243913475826">Kemp 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0162243913475826">Lysaght, Jaklenec, and Deweerd 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0162243913475826">Mason and Manzotti 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0162243913475826">Mostoslavsky 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0162243913475826">Maxson et al. 2012</xref>, 148). As hiPSC research begins to consolidate early gains, accrued within a relatively brief historical window of thirteen to fourteen years (c. 1998–2011),<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0162243913475826">1</xref>
</sup> there are concerns that further progress may be impeded by some important epistemic anomalies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0162243913475826">Mostoslavsky 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0162243913475826">Martins-Taylor and Xu 2011</xref>). There is, for instance, a fuzziness to stem cell signaling that can make their behaviors difficult to predict; rendering the symbioses between stems cells and other cell types in the biological “niche” resilient to explanation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0162243913475826">Fuchs, Tumbar, and Guasch 2004</xref>, 769; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0162243913475826">Wen, Sun, and Xi 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>Molecular analysts and cellular biologists allied to hiPSC research, and its application as regenerative medicine (Lysaght, Jaklenec, and Deweerd 2008, 305-307), are working with tissue engineers to remove these and other obstacles to cellular reprogramming, including a variety of cell asymmetries implicated in cancer morphology and “tumorigenesis” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0162243913475826">Reya et al. 2001</xref>, 105; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0162243913475826">Mostoslavsky 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0162243913475826">Martins-Taylor and Xu 2011</xref>). Medicinal products that incorporate regenerative cell reprogramming must be free of tumorigenesis risk, if they are to be considered viable candidates for safe therapeutic use (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0162243913475826">Reya et al. 2001</xref>). HiPSC scientists are committed to upholding this guarantee, even if their work to date provides an incomplete solution to the biological riddle of cancer. Were this formula to be found via hiPSC research, such an acquisition would represent the attainment of “<italic>Sophia</italic>”; as an unimpeachable knowledge state in which “eternal certainty” and “imperishable” truths are held aloft from the fray of incomplete “contingent” and “finite” knowledge that is the sum of most human discovery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0162243913475826">Long 2002</xref>, 36, 38). In Book VI of the <italic>Nicomachean Ethics</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0162243913475826">Long 2002</xref>, 38), Aristotle advises that knowledge accrued in “finite conditions” by dint of scientific perseverance or “episteme”, and technical valor or “techne”, ought to be categorized as “phronesis” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0162243913475826">Long 2002</xref>, 35, 46, 54). Modern interpretations of Aristotelian phronesis suggest that this framing represents a shorthand for a type of moral acuity epitomized by “practical wisdom” and “prudence” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0162243913475826">Hofmann 2002</xref>, 135, 8; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0162243913475826">Long 2002</xref>). Phronesis is best acquitted, as a moral and practical resource, when we are required to persevere with unpredictable (and uncertain) contingencies that arbitrarily test “virtue, habit, ethical intuition, and choice” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0162243913475826">Long 2002</xref>, 35). The types of phronesis most scientists might expect to encounter as part of their laboratory career involve intensive labors with indeterminate natural phenomena that are undertaken mostly for altruistic purposes, to advance the betterment of humanity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0162243913475826">Long 2002</xref>). In these conditions, the idea of “doing good” is translated into an ontology of “professional virtues,” which include “due diligence,” technical rigor, conceptual efficacy, accuracy, fastidiousness, modesty, transparency, precaution, truthfulness, asceticism, sagaciousness, and representational limpidness. “Perspicacity” binds these moral attributes together under one synonym.</p>
<p>We are accustomed to regarding peer-reviewed scientific papers that have passed the scrutiny threshold as model texts, steeped in moral authority—and perspicacity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0162243913475826">Long 2001</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0162243913475826">2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0162243913475826">Flyvbjerg 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0162243913475826">Hofmann 2002</xref>). Writing for peer review can afford a type of cathartic engagement that allows the scientist (as author) to extract a narrative of virtue—written in perspicacious rhetoric—from the reactions they witnessed and the actions they performed. The discursive and aesthetic aspects inherent to erudition of this kind have been the subject of extensive study in Science and Technology Studies (STS), particularly in relation to the way scientists narrativize worthwhileness and positivity as part of this process of virtue ascription (see for instance, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0162243913475826">Woolgar 1980</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0162243913475826">1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0162243913475826">Pinch 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0162243913475826">Star 1985</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0162243913475826">1989</xref>; Lynch and Woolgar 1998; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0162243913475826">Bowker and Star 1996</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0162243913475826">1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0162243913475826">Flyvbjerg 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0162243913475826">Owen-Smith 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0162243913475826">Roth 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0162243913475826">Ribes and Bowker 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0162243913475826">Pickersgill 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0162243913475826">Knaapen et al. 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0162243913475826">Mellor 2010</xref>). Virtue ascription, predicated in perspicacious rhetoric, seems to require extremely deft formulation (see for illustration, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0162243913475826">Star 1985</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0162243913475826">1989</xref>; and from the linguistic literature, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0162243913475826">Myers 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0162243913475826">Hyland 1998</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0162243913475826">2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0162243913475826">Mushin 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0162243913475826">Jasanoff 2008</xref>). Scientists’ prose can speak volumes about the extent of this competency, and the “intuitive feel” that they have for the phronesis of their discipline. This eloquence is especially called-upon during the narrativization of worthwhileness and attendant “positives” in ambiguous scientific conditions—such as stem cell research—which seem hindered by “taxonomical” and “diagnostic” opacities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0162243913475826">Star 1985</xref>, 406; also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0162243913475826">Pickersgill 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>The (virtuous) prose scientists instantiate under these conditions can often attune with the “glass half full” axiom, noted by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0162243913475826">Star (1985)</xref>, and allied commentators in the STS Field. This article explores the possibility that two further dimensions may be added to existing work concerned with the representational dynamics of “positively inscribed positivism” (see especially <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0162243913475826">Star 1985</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0162243913475826">1989</xref>). The first of these dimensions may be summarized by the maxim that for “positivity to be accepted as meaningful, it must be written using perspicacious rhetoric, emphasising due diligence.” When rendering observations, perspicacity is conveyed to the reader through the written instantiation of “tropes” or thematic/symbolic catalysts that serve to convey impressions of diligence to the reader (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0162243913475826">Franzosi 1998</xref>). These tropes, and the narratives they evoke, are verbally embedded within modal tableau or “mosaics” that have interesting origins. A “modal fragment” is an embellishment of opinion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0162243913475826">Halliday 1970</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0162243913475826">Hyland 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0162243913475826">Mushin 2001</xref>). Texts in which authors refer to their own and others’ opinions; and/or offer their own adducement of a topic incline toward a type of modal rhetoric that is pieced together from sentences, sentence subclauses, and small word fragments—creating the mosaic appearance, mentioned above (Ibid.). For a mosaic to take form, its inscribers must first become adept at “sorting” and “categorizing” the various pieces. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0162243913475826">Hyland (1998)</xref> has demonstrated that this skill of sorting and splicing is essential to the rhetorical craftsmanship of science writing. This article contends that these twin practices are an essential aspect of the rhetorical craftsmanship of perspicacity, and the semiotics of virtue representation, which undergird the “glass half full” tradition in scientific communication.</p>
<sec id="section2-0162243913475826">
<title>Focus</title>
<p>Some working illustrations of the modal schematics behind perspicacious rhetoric and virtue representation can be found within the three most popular citations emanating from regenerative cellular biology. Scientometric rankings of citation popularity identify this (now mostly historicized body of work) in the following order of descent<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0162243913475826">2</xref>
</sup>: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0162243913475826">Reya, Morrison, Clarke and Weissman (2001)</xref>, cited on 1, 959 occasions; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0162243913475826">Jain (2005)</xref> cited on 1,040 occasions; and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0162243913475826">Tomasek et al. (2002)</xref> cited on 781 occasions. Although small in scale, this publication “cluster” encompasses considerable epistemic scope, illustrating the “experimental zeitgeist” of stem cell researchers during an early phase in their history. These digests examine stem cell metamorphism and the enigmatic dimensions of cancer morphology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0162243913475826">Reya et al. 2001</xref>), the latent ambivalences associated with tumor feeding and tumor starvation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0162243913475826">Jain 2005</xref>), and the mysteries of wound contracture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0162243913475826">Tomasek et al. 2002</xref>). Although related solely by citation rank, this trio of scientific works qualifies for further representational analysis as a cluster because of their scientometric impact, intellectual significance, and literary eloquence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0162243913475826">Myers 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0162243913475826">Hyland 1998</xref>). Certainties and known things are given ontological priority within a discourse order and sorting praxis that seems to figuratively “conjecture confidence.” This outcome is achieved, in the main, through the implementation of rhetorical schemas that emphasize confident integers, over those impugning doubt, rehearsing what might be construed as a form of ontological “overplay and underplay” in accordance with the “glass half full” axiom (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0162243913475826">Star 1985</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0162243913475826">1989</xref>).</p>
<p>Sorting becomes “splicing” when this happens, with spliced observations carefully reassembled into artful, symbolic “frames” that primarily accentuate confident assertions and positives, along with adducement for this optimism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0162243913475826">Tannen 1993</xref>). When splicing is conducted over 6,000–8,000 words, the results form an intricate “modal mosaic,” held together by means of narration (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0162243913475826">Mushin 2001</xref>). “Sorting out” can be seen as the clay foundation for this mosaic that once laid, yields distinctive “representational effects,” dominated by those which allude to perspicacious intent. The remainder of this article examines the instantiation of these representational effects, which appear to allude to tropes of certainty, confidence, and positivity first; and perspicacity and virtue; and fortitude and resolve, second. In so doing, the analysis is guided by curiosity as to how these effects might be achieved, and in what ways they might be best investigated?</p>
</sec>

<sec id="section3-0162243913475826">
<title>Methodological Overview</title>
<p>One response to the latter question might be to advocate narratological analysis or “story method” as a qualitative means of dissecting tropes about stem cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0162243913475826">Franzosi 1998</xref>). Corpus linguistic software could equally serve as an efficient method for “frequency analyzing” popular choices of phraseology, mooted by the texts in question (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0162243913475826">Mushin 2001</xref>). While befitting distinct advantages, representational tropes have a point of inception, in word preference selection, word ordering, and word placement, which neither method addresses as effectively as modal analysis.</p>
<p>When speakers of the English language use modals, they are in essence practicing “cognate cataloguing,” separating, pairing, and grouping information intuitively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0162243913475826">Halliday 1970</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0162243913475826">Hyland 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0162243913475826">Mushin 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0162243913475826">Verstraete 2001</xref>). Linguists, such as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0162243913475826">Hyland (1998)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0162243913475826">Mushin (2001)</xref>, have devised parsing techniques that help separate intuitive modal categorizations that would otherwise appear seamless, imperceptible, and indistinct in prose (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0162243913475826">Martin 1989</xref>, 3-14). These categorizations can be regarded as providing representation with its essential linguistic symmetry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0162243913475826">Mushin 2001</xref>). Among the many at our disposal, “evidentiality” and “epistemological stance” appear to be the two most frequently used modal categories in English parlance, where the former refers to exoteric data; and the latter to the esoteric instantiations of that data, formulated as opinion and conjecture (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0162243913475826">Mushin 2001</xref>, 17-83). The setting and placement of these information types matter equally in modal analysis to the assessment of their intonation and implicatory register (Ibid.).</p>
<p>Much can be gleaned about categorizing practices by examining the way social actants map “evidential” and “epistemic” modals in talk and text (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0162243913475826">Halliday 1970</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0162243913475826">Hyland 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0162243913475826">Mushin 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0162243913475826">Verstraete 2001</xref>). As a technique, “modal mapping” can be used <italic>to see how</italic> specific modal conjunctions either reflect, or support and enable “sorting out” at a broad thematic level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0162243913475826">Halliday 1970</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0162243913475826">Hyland 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0162243913475826">Martin 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0162243913475826">Verstraete 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0162243913475826">Mushin 2001</xref>, 17-83). Modal maps, as mosaic structures, are compiled from spliced sentences. Spliced inferences are positioned, placed, and affixed by their users to form simple and complex frames (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0162243913475826">Mushin 2001</xref>). These frames augment rhetoric much as mosaics do their attendant images, using very small reflective fragments that coalesce to form a single aesthetic, which can then be read as a whole. In so doing, modal evaluation also reminds us of the fractal nature of composition and sorting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0162243913475826">Star 1985</xref>, 406). Previous inquiry suggests that modals appear in pairs and that these partnerships can be very closely juxtaposed—one sentence or phrase on top of, or next to, the other, creating a succinct two-, three-, or four-sided “frame” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0162243913475826">Myers 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0162243913475826">Halliday 1970</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0162243913475826">Hyland 1998</xref>; Martin 1998; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0162243913475826">Mushin 2001</xref>, 17-83). Larger three- and four-sided frames achieve a layered affect, and thus may be thought of as akin to modal “sandwiches.”</p>
<p>The next section of the article provides an analysis of “modal framing” with a view to assimilating a stronger sense of its predication in the texts used by stem cell scientists to describe the uncertain aspects of their work. Fragments from a broader study of representational mechanisms in stem cell science are examined for this purpose. Scientometric data were initially used to identify the <italic>Thompson-Reuters Web of Knowledge </italic>“Top Ten” in cellular biology, as constituted in 2010 and 2011 (in date order: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0162243913475826">Reya et al. 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0162243913475826">Kisiday et al. 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0162243913475826">Tomasek et al. 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0162243913475826">Sato et al. 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0162243913475826">Fuchs, Tumbar, and Guasch 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0162243913475826">Barry and Murphy 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0162243913475826">Kogler et al. 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0162243913475826">Perrier et al. 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0162243913475826">Jain 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0162243913475826">Wilson and Trumpp 2006</xref>). The three most prolific articles in this data set are given specific attention.</p>
<p>In what follows, it is possible to observe an active “sorting-splicing and representing” process in texts that seek to catalogue and map the known and indeterminate aspects of stem cell morphology, as they impact cancer medicine; and wound healing/dermatological repair. An initial coding exercise suggested that at least four types of modal reference were functional in each text. When discussing the uncertain facets of stem cells, scientists used the modal classifiers of “uncertainty” (uc) and “certainty” (c) to signify modal splicing of exoteric and esoteric stem cell observations, already classified as unknown, unreliable, indistinct, inadequate, or ambivalent knowledge or definitive, confident, construals of fact. Notably, these factual construals were often associated with positive developments in the specialty. Canonical modals of “evidentiality” (evi.) and “epistemics” (epi.) were frequently used to “frame” this sorting out process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0162243913475826">Mushin 2001</xref>, 17-83). The textual fragments illustrated forthwith highlight some of the most interesting and sophisticated uses of this ensemble, to produce perspicacious/virtuous representations of their subject matter, signaling, among other qualities, positivity, confidence, reassurance, fortitude, and worthwhile endeavor.</p>

<title>The Rendering of Symbolic Perspicacity in Articles 1-3</title>

As part of this effort, <italic>ISI</italic> has assembled a statistical “league table” of scientific works published in the fields of hiPSC experimentation and regenerative cellular biology. In 2010 and 2011, <italic>ISI</italic> identified the most popular articles in this niche as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0162243913475826">Reya et al.

<p>Citation prominence of this kind usually accrues because the publication in question possesses “seminal qualities,” for example, by arbitrating “breakthrough” empirical science or instantiating new theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0162243913475826">Frank 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0162243913475826">Small 2004</xref>, 71-76; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0162243913475826">Hackett 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0162243913475826">Pendlebury 2008</xref>). The documentary cluster (considered herewith) appears to be remarkable in terms of the detailed adducement each article provides of stem cell ambiguities and how scientists within the field were (and are) attempting to overcome their biological capriciousness. Aesthetic approximations, such as the description of what a given type of stem cell looks like, and how it can be seen to behave under the microscope, instill conviction into an overarching narrative (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0162243913475826">Franzosi 1998</xref>). A sense of personal proximity between the scientist-as-author and the reader is carefully created through the symbolic reenactment of the laboratory labor process. This reenactment metaphorically “transports” the reader back to the moment of the original experiment, placing them shoulder to shoulder with the research team. Discursive ploys such as those described above can be seen as rhetorical means for textually cultivating perspicacity, virtue, and limpidness. When successfully achieved, the use of these “aesthetic resources” imbues scientists’ written words with an imaginative schema that serves to engender sense making of virtue, worthwhileness, verisimilitude, moral rigor, and technical valor among potential readers. As fragments 1-3 illustrate, positive aspersions can be seen to grow out of this “symbolic soil.”</p>
<p>
<italic>Fragment 1</italic> is taken verbatim from Reya et al. It primarily examines the transgenic potential of marrow bone cells—or their ability to manufacture cells normally found outside of the blood system. Discussion of this remarkable capacity, about which understanding is currently limited, is largely composed of positively accentuated epistemic observations and hypothetical reasoning. Epistemic modal inferences are highlighted in the foregoing analysis with <underline>underlining.</underline> Recourse to certainty and uncertainty are indicated by (c) and (uc). Reya et al.’s sense making of positivity is mostly conveyed by their preference for communicating in the present rather than the past tense, by means of a “hopeful tone.” Stem cell behavioral sequences are described with limpid acuity, in their smallest forensic detail. This style of depiction is an important source of perspicacious representation, which effects empathy between the reader and the scientist. As readers, we are encouraged to believe that every dimension is being observed and every investigatory avenue is being pursued, in order to dispatch behavioral anomalies. Reya et al. “splice” these representations together by situating a piece of <italic>evidence</italic> next to an observation of <italic>epistemic</italic> value. By symbolically splicing them in this way, sorting establishes a system of ontological placement in which exoteric “evidence” hold priority status; ranking first, while “theory” ranks second and other forms of conjecture and esoterica ranking third. As a corollary to this, <italic>Fragment 1</italic> illustrates a type of splicing in which fact appears coupled to certainties on a regular basis; while uncertainties tend to go hand in hand with hypothesis and conjecture:

</bold> “<underline>If</underline> the signalling pathways that normally regulate stem cell self-renewal lead to tumorigenesis when dysregulated, then are stem cells themselves the target of transformation in certain types of cancer?(<bold>uc 1; epi 1</bold>).

<underline>:</underline> “Genomics <underline>may</underline> provide a powerful means for identifying drug targets in cancer cells (<bold>epi 1</bold>).

</bold> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0162243913475826">Jain 2005</xref>, 58) surveys “solid tumour” morphology and the vascular efficacy of cancerous growths. <bold>
<italic>Article 2</italic>
</bold> asserts, in so doing, that the veracity of tumours may be reduced through vascular therapeutics—a departure from the conventional wisdom which has long since maintained “That certain antiangiogenic agents can also transiently “normalize” the abnormal structure and function of tumor (sic.) vasculature to make it more efficient for oxygen and drug delivery.” Jain contends that the established practice of attacking tumours and damaging their vascular architecture may have a regressive impact upon drug treatment. The morphology (physical form) and vascular etiology (functioning) of cancers are depicted in tandem with knowledge of the effects that conventional drug related interventions have upon the configuration of their blood and oxygen delivery systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0162243913475826">Jain 2005</xref>, 58-9). A historiography is related in which the conventional wisdom—that tumours should be starved of vital blood and oxygen resources by “inhibiting vessel formation”—is contrasted with new hypotheses suggesting that the delivery of chemotherapy is more effective in tumours with healthy vascular systems.</p>
<p>
<bold>
<italic>Fragment 2 </italic>
</bold>begins with a description of tumour vascular morbidity arising from conventional drug therapies. In so doing, it follows a similar ontological precept to that which may be found in Reya et al, with the notable exception that Jain makes more of the attendant “negatives” inherent to the science. Notwithstanding, Jain approaches these hazards utilising words such as “destroy” “damaging,” “interfering”, “render,” and “antagonize,” signaling that these hazards are being dealt with assertively. There is an implied positivity attached to Jain’s symbolic depiction of cancer scientists’ fortitude and their unswerving resolve to dispatch an unpredictable foe. Jain achieves this perspicacious representational effect by firstly pairing modals that depict positives and certainties. He then switches, when necessary, to modals that positively adduce the chances of resolving fissures, negatives and uncertainties in the science base. Jain uses a blend of evidence-led and epistemically-led modalities to separate “positive positives” from “negative positives”. Jain’s prose leaves a strong impression of demonstrative phronesis and an effusive potential for new discoveries:

</bold> “These clinical data <underline>support </underline>the earlier predictions of Teicher, <underline>who postulated</underline> that combined administration of antiangiogenic and cytotoxic (chemo- and radiation) therapies <underline>would yield</underline> maximal benefit <underline>because such</underline> combinations <underline>would</underline> destroy two separate compartments of tumors—cancer cells and endothelial cells (<bold>evi 1 + c 1 + epi 2 + evi 2</bold>).

<italic>Fragment 3 </italic>is taken from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0162243913475826">Tomasek et al. (2002</xref>, 349). It primarily examines stem cell pluripotency in relation to “the modulation of fibroblastic cells,” which is described as “enigmatic” in its etiology or cell behavior “not least owing to its transient appearance in association with connective-tissue injury.” Tomasek et al. begin by locating the research within existing knowledge of this cell type. The notion of enigma is center-stage within their opening assertions. As they augment this storyline, Tomasek et al. strongly emphasize what has been observed of “connective tissue” performance in the past; particularly its mechanical dexterity, coupled with an ability to exert “tension even at rest” or stimulate “wound contraction.” Renewing “connective tension” in cases of tissue damage is revealed as a primary concern of the discipline (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0162243913475826">Tomasek et al. 2002</xref>, 349). The text then becomes focused on the contingencies of myofibroblasts—the complications they give rise to; their place in the mechanical “engineering” schema of skin, bones, cartilage, and muscle; the undisputable “laws” in which these bodily systems are couched (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0162243913475826">Tomasek et al. 2002</xref>, 350); as well as the hypotheses and observations generated by previous studies and knowledge of the differences between “myofibroblasts” and “fibroblasts.” The narrative continues with a detailed biographic profile of the myofibroblastic cell—augmenting a vivid representation of its characteristics and “behavioral profile.” Writing in a similar stance to Jain, Tomasek et al., emphasize the uncertainties inherent to the study of fibroblasts and “gap junctions” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0162243913475826">Tomasek et al. 2002</xref>, 351). Evidential modalities are used to support an evaluative mode of storytelling in <italic>Fragment 3</italic>. The topics of cellular tension, contracting in wound healing, and malfunctions in burns cases are addressed in the latter half of the article, where a positively accentuated discussion of knowledge gray areas takes place. A phronetic depiction of these knowledge puzzles ensues, as illustrated by the following passages of text:
<disp-quote>
<p>
<bold>
<underline>Paragraph 4:</underline> </bold>“The <underline>notion</underline> that granulation tissue contraction depends on force that is generated in this is <underline>very old</underline>. The <underline>traditional view</underline> has been that the mechanism of contraction was <underline>mainly due</underline> to collagen shortening (<bold>epi 1 + c 1</bold>). <underline>However</underline>, several observations <underline>had indicated</underline> that granulation-tissue cells <underline>could be</underline> important for force generation (<bold>epi 2 + evi 1 + c 2</bold>). Modified fibroblasts with smooth-muscle (SM)-like features (myofibroblasts) were <underline>first observed</underline> in granulation tissue of healing wounds (<bold>evi 2 + c 3</bold>), which led to the suggestion that these cells have a role in the production of the contractile force that is involved in this process (<bold>epi 3 + c 4</bold>). The presence of myofibroblasts in most fibro-contractive diseases (for example Dupuytren’s disease) and even in developing and specialized normal tissues (for example, lung septa) has extended <underline>this possibility</underline> to several situations (<bold>epi 4 + evi 3</bold>). <underline>It has subsequently</underline> <underline>been shown</underline> that most myfibroblasts express <sup>X</sup>-SM-actin (the actin isoform typically found in vascular SM cells) and that the expression of <sup>X</sup>-SM-actin and collagen type-I in these cells is co-ordinately regulated by transforming growth factor B1 (TGF-B1) (<bold>evi 4 + c 5</bold>). <underline>All these observations</underline> indicate that the myofibroblasts has a role in the synthesis of ECM and in force generation (<bold>evi 5 + c6</bold>), which results in ECM reorganization and wound contraction (<bold>evi 6 + c 7</bold>)”. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0162243913475826">Tomasek et al. 2002</xref>, 350)</p>
<p>
<bold>
<underline>Paragraph 7:</underline>
</bold> “Although myofibroblasts are <underline>clearly</underline> present in granulation tissue during wound closure and in pathological contracture tissues, <underline>questions have arisen</underline> as to whether they are essential for collagen / granulation tissue contraction (<bold>evi 1 + c1 + epi 1 + u 1</bold>). <underline>It is clear</underline> that tractional forces that are generated by fibroblasts as they migrate on a compliant substratum can reorganize collagen matrices (<bold>evi 2 + c2</bold>). <underline>In fact,</underline> in free floating collagen lattices the resulting reduction in lattice diameter <underline>is due entirely</underline> to fibroblast tractional forces (<bold>evi 3 + c 3</bold>). <underline>It has been proposed</underline> that tractional forces generated by fibroblasts migrating into granulation tissue are sufficient to result in wound closure (<bold>epi 2 + evi 4 + c 4</bold>), <underline>which makes</underline> the involvement of a specialized contractile cell unnecessary (<bold>epi 3</bold>). Although tractional forces that are generated by fibroblasts <underline>might be sufficient</underline> to initiate wound closure (<bold>epi 4 + evi 5 + c 5</bold>), the subsequent appearance of resistance in the surrounding tissue i<underline>nduces</underline> the DIFFERENTIATION of myofibroblasts (<bold>evi 6 + c 6</bold>), and only then can contraction be considered to start (<bold>evi 7 + c 7</bold>). Other studies <underline>have questioned whether</underline> granulation tissue, and thereby myofibroblasts, <underline>are even</underline> necessary for wound closure in animals that have relatively immobile skin, such as pigs and humans (<bold>epi 5 + uc 2</bold>) . The ability of some models of immobile skin to contract without granulation tissue <underline>might reflect</underline> traction and contraction processes <underline>that can</underline> compensate for each other (<bold>epi 6</bold>). <underline>It now seems likely</underline> that both traction and contraction are important at different stages in wound healing (discussed below), and questions <underline>now</underline> <underline>should focus</underline> on the detailed mechanisms (<bold>epi 7</bold>)”.

<underline>Paragraph 32:</underline>
</bold> “So, <underline>how is</underline> the contractile force that is generated by myofibroblasts translated into a shortened collagen matrix that no longer requires active cell contraction to maintain a tissue tension (<bold>epi 1+ u 1</bold>)? <underline>So far</underline> the mechanism for this <underline>has been </underline>ascribed simply to collagen cross-linking (<bold>evi 1 + c 1</bold>), but the permanency of this covalent bonding is irreconcilable with the dynamic nature of the process (<bold>evi2 + u 2</bold>). Matrix shortening and increased stiffness <underline>indicates</underline> that the resident cells have locked a tension into the collagen structure, but in an interstitial, incremental manner (<bold>evi 3 + c 2</bold>). This represents a ‘slip and ratchet’ theory for contracture, but it can only realistically occur as a localized, dynamic and incremental process that is not consistent with massive breakdown, re-assembly and cross-linking (<bold>evi 4 + u 3</bold>). Related concepts in which collagen fibrils slip past one another locally and are then re-linked whereas adjacent fibrils are, in their turn, unbonded and slipped have been proposed (<bold>epi 2 + u 4</bold>). It is noteworthy that in granulation tissue of a normal healing wound or in fibrocontractive diseases, collagen type I is replaced to a great extent by collagen type III (<bold>evi 5 + c 3</bold>), which is known to be present in remodelling tissues (for example during development) or in normal tissues that are subject to mechanical stress (for example arteries) (<bold>evi 6 + c 4</bold>)”.

<title>Key Observations of the Data</title>
<p>Fragments 1-3 are shown here as illustrations of the rhetorical practices framed in Articles 1-3. They are indicative, rather than exhaustive, drawing attention to the ontological nature of modal splicing practices, which tend (as predicted by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0162243913475826">Star 1985</xref>) to “organize” and “sort” their largely taxonomical subject matter into categorizations that prioritize evidentiality over theory; and confident/certain observations over those of ambiguous, indeterminate, conjectural, and hypothetical provenance (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0162243913475826">Hyland 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0162243913475826">Mushin 2001</xref>). These sorting and splicing practices underwrite the positive rhetorical accentuation of discoveries in Articles 1-3. By so doing, they initiate the inscription of (phronetic) representational effects, emphasizing virtue, worthwhileness, perspicacity, and fortitude. These representations, among others, are cemented on the “bricks and mortar” of single modal ascriptions (for instance, one per sentence) and didactic modal pairings that splice knowledge into two-, three-, and four-sided frames (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0162243913475826">Tannen 1993</xref>).</p>
<p>Within the fragments considered, when two or more modalities align to create two-sided frames, they often do so using a pairing arrangement of “evidentiality + certainty”. This particular form of modal didacticism is an important conveyer for the communication of “positive signifiers,” which help amass confidence in the science at hand among readerships, while also forging impressions of taxonomical efficacy and legitimacy. Single and didactic (or two-sided) modal frames were expanded in each fragment, when the authors so required. Notably, these extra splices served to either explore ambivalences in greater depth or justify a taxonomical adducement. In both instances, this “search” was performed in the hope of finding something reassuring, concrete or verisimilitudinal in an otherwise confusing picture. When expedited, this practice most often leveraged triple or quadruple <italic>polydidactic </italic>forms of modal placement (or three- and four-side frames).</p>
<p>Single, didactic and polydidactic forms of modal splicing categorize knowledge differently. As might be expected, single and didactic splicing “sorts out” easily delineable types of knowledge, yielding a representation effect of clarity, sharp separation, and limpid observation. By itself this is an exceptionally important lever for perspicacious impression building within “virtue prose.” Thus, it may be conjectured that the simpler the splice, the more perspicacious, morally intense, confident and clear-sighted the scientist appears to be. More complex polydidactic modal placements seem to be instantiated where certain and uncertain attributions cannot be as easily delineated and separated. In these more ambivalent circumstances, polydidactic modal splicing played a reassuring role, helping to identify positive signals, even if they are in trace form. Longer polydidactic expurgations were seemingly also conjectured when scientists needed to affirm a positive assertion. In both senses, polydidactic modal splicing was a significant source of confidence building and sense-rendering of worthwhileness, mooted in Articles 1-3.</p>

<title>Concluding Remarks</title>
<p>Articles 1-3, use the modal “literary technology” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0162243913475826">Myers 1992</xref>) described above to textually endow upbeat renditions of phronetic virtue in which physical, technical, cognitive, and conceptual resources are combined to “overcome” the ambivalent proclivities of stem cells. The first purpose of modal splicing and switching is to sort, sift, and ontologically frame these ambivalences by separating them from far less discordant knowledge certainties, about which positive things can be said. Their second purpose is to create “tropes”—or thematically linked impressions—that are illustrative of virtuous scientific conduct, creating images of diligent, unbiased, neutral, morally apt, demonstrative, perspicacious, and incisive detective work (see for instance, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0162243913475826">Star 1985</xref>).</p>
<p>Successful image making of “perspicacious phronesis” is perhaps the most subliminal means scientists have at their disposal to demonstrate efficacy and compliance. This is especially true among subscribers to the “standard model” scientific rule book (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0162243913475826">Rosa 1998</xref>). As the “orthodox paradigm” in science, standard model realism is believed to have spent much of its history cultivating a mode of truth-telling that asserts moral rectitude by first appealing to transparency of conduct, then to verbal thrift and epistemological temperance. Standard model positivism of the type emulated by stem cell scientists draws upon perspicacity as an important source for this legitimation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0162243913475826">Star 1985</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0162243913475826">1989</xref>). Story aids perspicacious representation by binding all other available syntactic resources into a sequentially staged narrative of virtue that follows a classical Labovian form (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0162243913475826">Patterson 2008</xref>). This article suggests, moreover, that perspicacious tropes primarily perform visual roles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0162243913475826">Gooding 2009</xref>), conjuring images of thoroughness and authenticity that court the reader into believing that they are interacting with entirely translucent and truthful textual accounts of scientific phronesis, conducted to advance the betterment of humanity. Once agreed, this “bargain” between reader and scientists-as-author facilitates the presentation of positive-leaning rhetoric that shows the glass as half full.</p>
<p>While limited to three fragments, the research to which this article relates suggests that positive positivism may be an important “mother tongue” of the stem cell laboratory that has helped scientists to legitimize their work among peer review audiences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0162243913475826">Myers 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0162243913475826">Hyland 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0162243913475826">Mushin 2001</xref>). STS theorists have shown consistently that modern science publishing seems to favor aesthetically and semantically confident versions of laboratory stories that emphasize solidity, certainty, and positivity, preferring wars won to battles lost (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0162243913475826">Knorr-Cetina 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0162243913475826">Pinch 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0162243913475826">Star 1985</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0162243913475826">1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0162243913475826">Mellor 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0162243913475826">Gross, Harmon, and Reidy 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0162243913475826">Gross 2006</xref>). In agreement with these theorists, I find that to become a published scientific author, social actants must acquire the literary skills needed to satisfy this requirement. Most often these skills develop experientially, over the course of a career in scientific publishing. As a result, the successful scientific author may be unaware of the extent to which they have become literate in rhetoric of positivity that attests Aristotelian notions of “prudence”. Past STS inquiry has shown that this literacy becomes especially significant during the preparation of manuscripts for peer review and eventual publication, when demonstrations of “uncertainty taming,” positively instantiated positivism, perspicacity, virtue, valor, and fortitude, become associated with (moral) scientific authority, rigor, and due diligence.</p>
