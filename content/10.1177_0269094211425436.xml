<p>Development zones are the important carriers of China’s promoting industrialization and attracting international investment in the past 30 years and act as the primary means of city expansion. In this article, we analyse the low efficiency of land use problem existing in China’s current development zones. Comparing with the general old city update phenomenon, we make a detailed illustration on the feasibility and comparative advantage of redevelopment of development zones. On this basis, combining with the investigation practice, we propose the basic redevelopment models of development zones and analyse the typical redevelopment cases of development zones in Xi’an, Shanghai, Changzhou, Hangzhou and Nanjing.</p>

<sec id="sec1-0269094211425436" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title>
<p>In 1984, the Government set up the first batch of economic and technological development zones in China. Since then, the number and scale of development zones have been expanding remarkably, with different types and levels appearing. Development has evolved from a discrete focus on the individual zone to an approach integrated with the regional or metropolitan perspective. Also, in the large dense coastal metropolitan areas, especially the Yangtze River Delta, a high degree of connection among the development zones has produced clusters, which have become the main areas of economic growth, foreign investment and city expansion during the past 20 years. Nowadays, with the increasing scarcity of land in China, it is imperative to change the patterns of economic growth and use of space. Promoting the rational redevelopment of existing space in development zones is an important way to achieve the transition to ‘smart growth’.</p>
<p>An earlier paper in <italic>Local Economy</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0269094211425436">Wuttke, 2011</xref>) discussed the overall spatial and administrative context of the redevelopment of Chinese development zones, with specific reference to Guangdong Province. The present article focuses on the issues of urban form and design raised by this type of redevelopment. We try to identify the potential and comparative advantage of redevelopment of development zones as distinct from the general renewal of old towns. Based on the analysis and our practical investigations, we set out the basic modes of redevelopment of development zones, using casesfrom Xi’an, Shanghai, Changzhou, Hangzhou and Nanjing as illustrations.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec2-0269094211425436"><title>The necessity for redevelopment of China’s development zones</title>
<p>Relying on exploiting the competitive advantage of the ‘three lows’ (low wages, low taxes, and low land prices), development zones became the main sites for international industry transfer. Not only did the rapid development and expansion of development zones in China support urbanization and expansion of urban space in China during the last 20 years, but they also brought about a series of economic, environmental and social problems.</p>
<sec id="sec3-0269094211425436"><title>Low productivity, low land-use efficiency</title>
<p>In the early days, land use in development zones was relatively extensive. A period of adherence to the conceptions of ‘big plazas, wide roads, big pools and green space’ and ‘garden factory’, together with the development organizations’ occupation of more land than they needed, led to low productivity and inefficient land use in built areas of development zones. Also, for these reasons, the development zones exhibited a series of problems, such as a high rate of idle land, low employment density, low building density and floor area ratio, low output per unit area compared with that of the city, and soon.</p>
<p>In 2007, Nanjing city’s built-up land per capita (including satellite towns) was 134 m<sup>2</sup>; that of the main city area was 65 m<sup>2</sup> and of the new urban area (mainly comprising the three new national development zones), 183 m<sup>2</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0269094211425436">Nanjing Bureau of Planning, 2009</xref>). In other words, land use in the new urban area is much more extensive than in the main city. Meanwhile, as shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0269094211425436">Table 1</xref>, there is idle land to a varying degree in all of the four national development zones in Nanjing.

</sec>
<sec id="sec4-0269094211425436"><title>The locational context of the development zones is changing, resulting in a mismatch with existing functions</title>
<p>Most of the earliest development zones located in urban fringe areas or even outer suburbs, but many have become part of urban space because of the rapid expansion of urban areas and urbanization of rural areas. This particularly applies to the start-up blocks of development zones on the edge of the main city. These start-up blocks are the transitional and convergent zones of old and new urban space, and have become cores of new urban space or city gateway areas. Affected also by changes in traffic conditions, these blocks have been unsuited to continue functioning as industrial areas and are facing the need for reconstruction in order to give full play to their location value. For instance, the start-up areas of Nanjing Jiangning Economic and Technological Development Zone and Xi’an New and High-Tech Industrial Development Zone have become inappropriate for industrial use, and are experiencing a process of replacement and update.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec5-0269094211425436"><title>‘Premature aging’ of development zones due to the low construction standards of the early period</title>
<p>The construction of development zones in China took the form of ‘rolling development’. With the notable exception of the Suzhou Industrial Park, in which construction is in strict accordance with the principles of a high quality initial plan and high construction standards, the majority began development crudely. Construction standards, particularly for infrastructure and supporting public services, were relatively low at the initial stages, and cannot meet current development needs. Many low quality and small-scale enterprises have located in the start-up areas of development zones. These characteristics have been compounded by the later ending of tax incentives, and most of the projects are faced with the problem of lack of re-investment capability, leading to ‘premature aging’. These areas must be further exploited to fully realize the value of their space and avoid decline.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec6-0269094211425436"><title>The construction areas of development zones are in a unique position, and their redevelopment plays a crucial role in optimizing city structure</title>
<p>As mentioned previously, the construction areas are currently the meeting-point and gateway of the main city and the new urban areas, and this means that the strategic repercussions of their redevelopment will definitely be able to affect the overall city structure. Adaptation of their functions can effectively integrate the old city area with the new urban areas, and help to realize the overall optimization of urban spatial structure. The benefits of their redevelopment to the city as a whole are obvious. Otherwise, they could become what could be called ‘special zones in the city’ or ‘factory towns’, analogous to the current ‘urban villages’ (former rural villages absorbed by the city which have become residential slums), and evolve into new ‘tumours’, threatening the overall optimization of urban space. The industrial land in start-up areas of Nanjing Jiangning Economic and Technological Development Zone has already become very inconsistent with the surrounding urbanized space.</p>
<p>These emerging problems must be addressed through rational redevelopment.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="sec7-0269094211425436"><title>The feasibility of redevelopment of China’s development zones</title>
<p>Compared with the general renewal of old city areas, the redevelopment of development zones possesses many unique advantages that they cannot match.</p>
<sec id="sec8-0269094211425436"><title>The relatively large area of development zones means that redevelopment can be on a large scale</title>
<p>Since the launch of reform and opening up, the expansion of urban construction areas has mainly been due to the expansion of development zones. Taking Nanjing for example, since 2000, the city’s average annual growth of urban built-up land has reached nearly 40 km<sup>2</sup>. The new urban areas, with the development zones as the main part, are experiencing the fastest expansion of urban space. The built-up land of new urban areas has expanded from 56 km<sup>2</sup> in 2000 to 161 km<sup>2</sup> in 2007, with an average annual growth of 15 km<sup>2</sup>. This growth rate is much faster than that of the main city, at 9 km<sup>2</sup> per year. Since the expansion of urban construction land in new urban areas is mainly due to the growth of industrial land, with provision of supporting public facilities and services relatively lagging behind, their attraction of urban population is relatively weak. The population of new urban areas in China grew from 39 m in 2000 to 91 m in 2007, an increase of about 52 m and an average annual increase of about 7.4 m. This population growth is far smaller than that of main city areas (13 m) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0269094211425436">Nanjing Bureau of Planning, 2009</xref>). Therefore, the redevelopment of development zones will greatly expand the capacity to attract population and industry.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec9-0269094211425436"><title>The redevelopment constraints of construction areas in development zones are relatively small, and the risk of conflicts is relatively low</title>
<p>Development of China’s old city areas is mainly focused on the original historical city areas. Redevelopment and renovation of these areas involves the resettlement and replacement of the original inhabitants, protection of historical remains, and other similarly complex problems and therefore a variety of goals and interests must be balanced. Also, such redevelopment has commonly provoked a variety of social conflicts that make for very difficult problems. By comparison, development zones have had a relatively short history, and their redevelopment involves a relatively small number of interests. Redevelopment involves few issues of historical protection or problems related to population resettlement, and therefore the social cost of redevelopment is relatively low and economic benefits are relatively easy to achieve.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec10-0269094211425436"><title>The land characteristics of high value and low cost in the construction areas of development zones suggest relatively high economic benefits to redevelopment</title>
<p>Although the construction areas of development zones have been recognized as urban space, the land price is currently still the same as that of the urban fringe areas. These areas can be the prime potential locations of new urban space with intrinsic value. According to the benchmark land price system published in 2009, the price of first-class industrial land located in the main city area is 2200 yuan per m<sup>2</sup>, while the price of industrial land with the same conditions in Nanjing Jiangning Economic and Technological Development Zone is only 530 yuan per m<sup>2</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0269094211425436">Nanjing Bureau of Land, 2009</xref>). In accordance with city development trends in the new round of urban planning, the start-up areas are redesignated as zones of high value-added commercial office space, and some of them have even been planned as the centres of new urban areas or as city sub-centres. The redevelopment of these blocks offers enormous business opportunities, and these blocks will become the ‘golden lands’ of new urban space.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec11-0269094211425436"><title>The clarity of land property rights in development zones is conducive to their smooth development through market mechanisms</title>
<p>Under the new land regime requiring that city land should be transparently paid for, most land ownerships in development zones are transferred by way of sale agreement or public bidding, and the boundaries of property units are relatively clear. Consequently, land redevelopment can follow a standardized and ordered market economy process. By contrast, land ownerships in the old urban areas are very complex, with the coexistence of free transfer land, sold land, state-owned land, collective land and historic land with unclear ownership. As a result, property units are numerous and varied, and modes of operation are relatively complex. Taking Nanjing for instance, the area enclosed by Qinhuai Road, Sheng Tai Road, Liyuan Road, North Road and Shuanglong Road in Jiangning Economic and Technological Development Zone is about 1.1 km<sup>2</sup>, and there are 57 property units. By contrast, in an equally-sized area of the city centre, in Xinjiekou and its surrounding blocks, there are 97 property units. We can see that land management in development zones is easier than in the old city area.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="sec12-0269094211425436"><title>The main types of redevelopment of China’s development zones</title>
<p>Currently, the redevelopment modes of construction areas in development zones can be divided into two types. One is the redevelopment of start-up areas based on the increasingly central position of their location. In these cases, we need to start refreshing their functions, and promote the conversion of industrial zones to urban areas. The other type is the redevelopment of construction areas because of their inefficient land use. In these cases, we should enhance the exploitation of industrial land, and improve the density of investment and output, therefore lowering the proportion of idle land andfurther optimizing the efficiency of industrial land use.</p>
<p>We now present five typical cases of successful redevelopment of development zones.</p>
<sec id="sec13-0269094211425436"><title>Redevelopment of a first round start-up area in Xi’an new and high-tech industrial development zone</title>
<p>Xi’an New and High-Tech Industrial Development Zone is located in the famous scientific and cultural district which forms the southern suburb of Xi’an city. The exploited area has now reached 35 km<sup>2</sup>. After 10 years of construction and development, many high-level companies have been stationed here. Meanwhile, with the continuous improvement of functions, some of the former industrial land use has been replaced by more high-end industrial or service functions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0269094211425436">Figure 1</xref>), forming a modern technological urban area bringing together the functions of industry, technology, housing, commerce and trade.

</sec>
<sec id="sec14-0269094211425436"><title>Redevelopment of Shanghai Caohejing New Technology Development Zone</title>
<p>Caohejing New Technology Development Zone in Shanghai (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0269094211425436">Figure 2</xref>) was approved as a National Economic and Technological Development Zone by the State Council in 1988. With a planned area of 5.984 km<sup>2</sup>, it is a typical compact zone. Currently, it has acquired four major industries: microelectronics, optoelectronics, computer software and new materials. Through the renewal of part-blocks, it has improved its productivity and land use efficiency, and the current floor area ratio has reached 1, which is much higher than in the typical development zone, where it is about 0.6.

</sec>
<sec id="sec15-0269094211425436"><title>Redevelopment of Changzhou New and High-Tech Industrial Development Zone</title>
<p>Changzhou New and High-Tech Industrial Development Zone was approved in 1992. Its redevelopment area, located outside the planned north outer ring of Changzhou city, is about 1.2 km<sup>2</sup>. The surrounding areas have residential and industrial functions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0269094211425436">Figure 3</xref>). The initial planned function of this area was mainly industrial production. The surrounding blocks on the main roads, including Tongjiang Road, are adapted to commercial and business functions. As the earliest area exploited in this development zone, this area’s industrial sites were built and put into use as early as the late 1990s, while only a few of the commercial and business sites initially planned were built up before 2000. Subsequently, relevant departments began the urban design of blocks along Tongjiang Road, and identified their business and commercial features, then took positive measures to promote the construction and development of these blocks. Meanwhile, there are more obvious trends of transformation appearing in the area, and the phenomenon of mixed use is increasingly prominent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0269094211425436">Luan et al., 2007</xref>).

</sec>
<sec id="sec16-0269094211425436"><title>Redevelopment of the start-up area in Hangzhou Xiaoshan Economic and Technological Development Zone</title>
<p>After 2000, redevelopment of the start-up area of Hangzhou Xiaoshan Economic and Technological Development Zone took place along both sides of the central spine road, and this area is being gradually renewed by building flats, hotels, business offices and the like. Behind the buildings are the original factories built in the 1990s (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0269094211425436">Figure 4</xref>). In a similar manner, many coastal development zones are currently promoting this approach of ‘attracting investment without land’, which means to improve the efficiency of existing industrial land. This is also an important mode of redevelopment of development zones.
<fig id="fig4-0269094211425436" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><p>Hangzhou: Juxtaposition of new buildings and former factories</p><p><italic>Source:</italic> Photographed by the author.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0269094211425436-fig4.tif"/></fig></p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec17-0269094211425436"><title>Redevelopment of the start-up area in Nanjing Jiangning Economic and Technological Development Zone</title>
<p>The start-up area of Jiangning Economic and Technological Development Zone is located at the intersection of the main city area and Jiangning district to the south, on both sides of the Shuanglong Road which is the most important transport axis between the main city area and Jiangning district, and the northern part of Baijiahu Street. The start-up area is about 2.1 km<sup>2</sup>, bounded by Qinhuai New River, Sheng Tai Road and Li Yuen North Road. The construction of these areas started in 1992, and relevant industrial projects then began to locate there. Construction was finished by 2003, forming the current layout pattern which was dominated by industrial uses along Shuanglong Road (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0269094211425436">Figure 5</xref>).The structure of land use is shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0269094211425436">Table 2</xref>. After 2005, because of the fall in efficiency of some enterprises and the improvement of location conditions of the start-up area, the guideline of ‘retreating from secondary to tertiary industry’ began to be taken into consideration. At the same time, the start-up area was re-planned to implement redevelopment, which meant accepting commerce and trade as the main functions of the area.

<p>Now that the exploitation of the start-up area is maturing, new approaches to planning are starting to define new orientations. New plans are encouraging the use of blocks in the central area, near the Qin Huai River and close to the residential area, to start the project of ‘retreating from secondary to tertiary industry’. During this process, these plans also encourage reshaping of the original functions, drawing on the impetus of the construction of the Nanjing South High Speed Rail Station, to create the Dongshan new urban area with five centres, for commercial, business, administration, culture and sports (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0269094211425436">Figure 5</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0269094211425436">Figure 6</xref>). The start-up area of Jiangning Economic and Technological Development Zone is planned as the business and commercial centre at district level, together with the old city centre of Jiangning District. Currently, there are four main streams of work on the redevelopment of the start-up area. First, to implement further research on block redevelopment and improve the relevant planning and urban design. Second, to promote the implementation of some projects. Because some enterprises in the industrial area have entered into decline, or have been subject to various external influences, some blocks in this area have started or completed updating, such as the reconstruction of Auchan located southwest of the intersection of Qinhuai Road and Shuanglong Road, demolition of the Wangwang factory, etc. Third, to transform and upgrade the infrastructure, such as subway stations, basic public service facilities and management of surrounding water environment, etc. Finally, to start the project planning and land assembly, which is thenecessary precondition for large-scale redevelopment. A group of high-end service projects have already come together through planning, and the Government is promoting the reservation of industrial land and idle land for them.

<sec id="sec18-0269094211425436" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title>
<p>In China, the redevelopment of start-up and construction areas in city development zones is still in the initial stage. There are many difficulties in the redevelopment process, such as finding an appropriate way to adapt an old factory to a new use such a business office or laboratory, deciding on the distribution of the added land value between the factory owner, the new developer and the Government, the issue of job-home separation created by the redevelopment, the high cost of constructing and supplying new public services, and so on. So the basic modes and policy mechanisms of redevelopment still need to be explored and understood in depth from both the theoretical and practical points of view. In this article, we have made a preliminary analysis of theredevelopment of development zones from the overall perspective of China’s city redevelopment phenomenon. The analysis should be improved and expanded on the basis of further research.</p>
