A gross and histologic survey was performed of humeral head cartilage lesions of 155 dogs ranging in age from 1 week to 19 years. The humeral head and cartilage lesion size were measured for each dog. Cartilage lesions were classified as fibrillation, fissures, erosion, and/or eburnation. The area of each lesion was multiplied by a severity score (fibrillation and fissures 1, erosion 2, and eburnation 3) to create a combined score for each humeral head. Correlations between this combined lesion score and age, humeral head size, body weight, and body condition score were assessed using a Bonferroni-corrected alpha of .01. Twenty-six humeral heads were also evaluated histologically. Of the 155 dogs, 80 (52%) had gross lesions of the articular cartilage. The presence and severity of the articular cartilage lesions were positively correlated with age, humeral head size, body weight, and body condition score. The average age of dogs with cartilage lesions was 8.8 years, and 77/105 (74%) of adult dogs had cartilage lesions. Fifty dogs were 3 years of age or younger; 3 of those had cartilage lesions, 1 of which was osteochondrosis. These data indicate that cartilage erosion of the caudal humeral head in dogs is a common degenerative lesion acquired in adult large breed dogs; osteochondrosis dissecans does not precede the lesion in the vast majority of cases.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>canine</kwd><kwd>dogs</kwd><kwd>joints</kwd><kwd>osteoarthritis</kwd><kwd>osteochondritis dissecans</kwd><kwd>osteochondrosis</kwd><kwd>shoulder</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><p>Degenerative joint disease (DJD, also known as osteoarthritis) is common in adult large breed dogs.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0300985812452584">19</xref></sup> Cartilage lesions such as fissures, fibrillation, erosion, and eburnation are often found in the hip, shoulder, and stifle joints of dogs at necropsy, even without a clinical history of lameness.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0300985812452584">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0300985812452584">19</xref></sup> Cartilage lesions of the hip and stifle joints are typically attributed to joint instability and subsequent DJD, but similar lesions on the caudal humeral head are often attributed to osteochondrosis dissecans (OCD) rather than DJD, even in adult dogs. The purpose of this study was to determine whether cartilage lesions of the caudal humeral head develop in adult dogs (as expected with DJD) or appear during the growth period and persist throughout life (as expected with OCD).</p><sec id="section1-0300985812452584" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>Every dog submitted to the University of Tennessee College of Veterinary Medicine for complete necropsy during a 12-month period (2010) was evaluated for humeral head lesions. The length and width of the humeral heads and the length and width of grossly visible cartilage lesions were measured. The character of the lesions (fissures, fibrillation, erosion, or eburnation) was evaluated grossly. The breed, sex, weight, and body condition score were also recorded at the time of necropsy. The age of the dog was taken from the necropsy submission form. Selected humeral heads (26 dogs, selected to represent the range of gross lesions) were decalcified in 15% formic acid and processed routinely for histologic evaluation.</p><p>The gross size of each cartilage lesion was multiplied by a severity score (1 for fissures or fibrillation, 2 for erosion, and 3 for eburnation) to calculate a combined lesion score for each humeral head. A nonparametric paired samples test (Wilcoxon signed ranks test) was used to compare right to left humeral head size and lesion score, before taking the average of the 2 side measures. The nonparametric Spearman’s rank correlation was used to assess the association between the averaged lesion score and other continuous variables (such as age, weight, and body condition score). The effect of sex on lesion severity was tested using the nonparametric Mann–Whitney test. Because of the increasing chance of committing a Type I error with multiple testing, a Bonferroni alpha correction was used for each set of statistical tests. A Pearson chi-square test was used to determine if breed size was independent of age.</p></sec><sec id="section2-0300985812452584"><title>Results</title><p>A total of 309 humeral heads from 155 dogs were examined (one dog was an amputee). Of the dogs, 80 (52%) had gross lesions; 77 (96%) of the affected dogs were over 3 years of age. There was no significant difference between the severity of lesions of the right and left humeral heads and lesion severity did not differ significantly by sex.

None of the gross lesions in adult dogs resembled OCD, and of the 13 adult humeral heads examined histologically, none had histologic lesions of OCD (ie, the cartilage lesion only involved the superficial cartilage without any deep cartilage necrosis). The cartilage lesions were typically on the caudal humeral head (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0300985812452584">Fig. 5</xref>). Deeper lesions, such as deep erosions and eburnation were often surrounded by more superficial erosions or fibrillation. Histologically, the lesions were characterized by fissures, fibrillation, and/or erosion with loss and clustering of superficial chondrocytes and decreased cartilage matrix staining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0300985812452584">Fig. 6</xref>). None of the lesions in adult dogs had deep areas of cartilage necrosis or fibrocartilage proliferation characteristic of OCD.

Of these, 2 were consistent with early DJD (fissures and fibrillation), and 1 (from an 18-month-old Newfoundland) was consistent with mild (1 mm diameter) OCD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0300985812452584">Figs. 7</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0300985812452584">8</xref>).</p><p>To ensure that the low number of OCD lesions in the 50 younger dogs was not due to breed differences, all dogs were categorized as small, medium, or large breed, based on breed or adult weight. Using these categories, the 50 dogs 3 years of age or younger were 36% (18/50) small breed, 10% (5/50) medium breed, and 54% (27/50) large breed. The 105 dogs over 3 years of age were 30% (31/105) small breed, 10% (11/105) medium breed, and 60% (63/105) large breed. The difference in the percentages of small breed dogs between the 2 groups was not statistically significant (<italic>P </italic>= .716).</p><p>In both younger and older groups of dogs, the average age and weight of affected dogs was slightly higher than unaffected dogs. In dogs 3 years of age or younger, the average age of affected dogs was 1.6 years versus 1.2 years for unaffected dogs; the average weight of affected dogs was 31.7 kg versus 12.9 kg for unaffected dogs.

If the lesions had begun as OCD, then they would be present at all ages, rather than appearing in middle-aged and older dogs. In addition, they would be characterized by deep cartilage necrosis, rather than superficial fibrillation and erosions. Studies that have followed the development of humeral head cartilage lesions in research beagles<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0300985812452584">12</xref></sup> and food-restricted Labrador Retrievers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0300985812452584">17</xref></sup> have reported a similar association of cartilage erosion with age.

No attempt was made in this study to measure joint laxity or glenoid concavity.

One dog (an 18-month-old Newfoundland) had a 1 mm diameter OCD lesion, which was unlikely to have caused clinical lameness; the eventual outcome of such small lesions is unknown. The rarity of significant OCD lesions in this study is likely a reflection of the small percentage of dogs affected compared to the overall canine population. While OCD may be common in young, large breed, dogs with shoulder lameness, these compose a very small proportion of the entire canine population. Conversely, DJD of the shoulder is very common in dogs, especially middle-aged and older large breed dogs. In this study 77/105 (74%) of adult dogs had cartilage lesions consistent with DJD.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="conflict" id="fn1-0300985812452584"><label>Declaration of Conflicting
