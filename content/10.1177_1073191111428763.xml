<abstract>
<p>In the current investigation, the authors examined the diagnostic construct validity of the <italic>Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory–2–Restructured Form</italic> (MMPI-2-RF) in a patient sample. All participants were diagnosed via the <italic>Structured Clinical Interview for</italic> DSM-IV Axis I Disorders (SCID-I/P). The data set used in this study was composed of 544 patients—67 with bipolar disorder, 407 with major depressive disorder, and 70 with schizophrenia. Multivariate analyses revealed a pattern of mean scale differences among patient groups that was mostly consistent with the prominent features of each diagnostic group; logistic regression analyses identified a number of scales that were strong, unique predictors in the differentiation between pairs of diagnostic groups. The higher order scales (H-O)—the Emotional/Internalizing Dysfunction (EID) and Thought Dysfunction (THD) scales were most useful in differentiating between patient groups. For differentiating bipolar disorder patients from the other diagnostic groups, the Activation (ACT) Specific Problem scale was most useful. Although not all hypothesized scale differences emerged; overall, the pattern of results provides support for the diagnostic construct validity of the MMPI-2-RF scales.</p>

<body>
<p>The original Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory (MMPI; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1073191111428763">Hathaway &amp; McKinley, 1943</xref>) was developed primarily as a differential diagnosis tool by using an empirical keying methodology to identify test items that differentiated various diagnostic groups from a group of individuals without mental disorders. After nearly a decade of research, however, it was evident that the MMPI had failed this original purpose; this failure was attributed primarily to problems with the discriminant validity of these original clinical scales (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1073191111428763">Tellegen et al., 2003</xref>). Despite this evidence of poor individual scale discriminant validity, MMPI researchers continued to examine issues related to differential diagnosis. The authors of these earlier investigations focused mostly on differentiating between psychotic and “neurotic” forms of psychopathology (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1073191111428763">Zalewski &amp; Gottesman, 1991</xref>, for a meta-analysis of these earlier studies). More recently, many investigators have turned their attention to the capacity of the MMPI and its successor, the MMPI-2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1073191111428763">Butcher et al., 2001</xref>) to differentiate among patients diagnosed with three major and distinct forms of Axis I mental disorders—major (unipolar) depression (MD), bipolar disorder (BD), and schizophrenia (SC; e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1073191111428763">Bagby et al., 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>Researchers reporting outcomes from several studies examining individual scale differences among these diagnostic groups have found that whereas the MMPI-2 clinical and content scales are useful in differentiating between patients with MD and SC (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1073191111428763">Ben-Porath, Butcher, &amp; Graham, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1073191111428763">Munley, Busby, &amp; Jaynes, 1997</xref>), the scales are less effective in differentiating patients with BD from patients with SC and from patients with MD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1073191111428763">Bagby et al., 2005</xref>); an outcome most likely associated with the particular phase of illness in which an individual with BD finds himself or herself when completing the MMPI-2. For instance, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1073191111428763">Lumry, Gottesman, and Tuason (1982)</xref> reported that patients with BD produced altered MMPI clinical profiles in accordance with their mood state (i.e., manic/hypomanic vs. depressed) and as a result, unipolar and bipolar depression might be hard to differentiate when the latter patients are in the midst of the depressed phase of their illness. Similarly, when patients with BD are actively manic/hypomanic their clinical presentation may include disordered thought processes and delusional ideation (i.e., BD with psychotic features), which makes a differential diagnosis with SC a challenging endeavor.</p>
<p>Of course, the capacity of any omnibus instrument designed to assess a wide range of psychopathology is only as good as the discriminant validity of its individual scales and improved scale validity leads to improved capacity for differential diagnosis. It is in this regard that we believe the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory–2–Restructured Form (MMPI-2-RF; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1073191111428763">Ben-Porath &amp; Tellegen, 2008</xref>), which is a recently developed 338-item version of the MMPI-2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1073191111428763">Butcher et al., 2001</xref>) may offer enhanced capacity for differential diagnosis compared with the MMPI-2. In the development of the MMPI-2-RF the authors of this instrument emphasized individual scale distinctiveness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1073191111428763">Tellegen &amp; Ben-Porath, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1073191111428763">Tellegen et al., 2003</xref>). The 338 items are configured into scales that assess various components of personality and psychopathology. These scales are organized in a hierarchical structure, which corresponds well to contemporary models of personality and psychopathology (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1073191111428763">Krueger &amp; Markon, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1073191111428763">Krueger, Markon, Patrick, Benning, &amp; Kramer, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1073191111428763">Sellbom, Ben-Porath, &amp; Bagby, 2008</xref>). At the broadest level are three higher order (H-O) scales, representing Emotional/Internalizing (EID), Thought Dysfunction (THD), and Behavioral/Externalizing (BXD) forms of psychopathology. The nine Restructured Clinical (RC) scales occupy the middle level of the hierarchy; the Specific Problem (SP) scales are at the lowest level. The SP scales are grouped into four domains—Somatic/Cognitive, Internalizing, Externalizing, and Interpersonal. Outside this hierarchical model of psychopathology are the Interest and Personality Psychopathology Five–Revised (PSY-5R) scale sets and the Validity scales, which are designed to detect protocol validity. A detailed description of how these specific scales were developed is reported in the MMPI-2-RF Technical Manual (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1073191111428763">Tellegen &amp; Ben-Porath, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>Although the MMPI-2-RF has been introduced relatively recently, investigators have reported results from several studies that have demonstrated that the RC scales, which appear on both the MMPI-2 and MMPI-2-RF, have superior discriminant validity compared with their original clinical scale counterparts, as well as other MMPI-2 scales that have been offered as proxies for the RC scales (e.g., Content scales, PSY-5 scales; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1073191111428763">Forbey &amp; Ben-Porath, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1073191111428763">Handel &amp; Archer, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1073191111428763">Sellbom &amp; Ben-Porath, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1073191111428763">Sellbom, Ben-Porath, &amp; Graham, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1073191111428763">Sellbom, Graham, &amp; Schenk, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1073191111428763">Simms, Casillas, Clark, Watson, &amp; Doebbeling, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1073191111428763">Tellegen et al., 2003</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1073191111428763">2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1073191111428763">Wolf et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1073191111428763">Wygant et al., 2007</xref>; see, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1073191111428763">Tellegen, Ben-Porath, &amp; Sellbom, 2009</xref>, for a review). In addition, the MMPI-2-RF Technical Manual (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1073191111428763">Tellegen &amp; Ben-Porath, 2008</xref>) and some recent empirical research (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1073191111428763">Forbey, Lee, &amp; Handel, 2010</xref>) demonstrate promising convergent and discriminant validity for many of the SP scales, supporting the distinctive nature and the potential for the scales to provide incrementally additive utility in differential diagnosis. Investigators conducting these studies, however, have focused almost exclusively on correlation-based analyses, including internal reliability, concurrent validity, and individual scale correlations among the RC scales.</p>
<p>Our goal in the current study was to extend this earlier correlational work by examining the construct (diagnostic) validity of a full array of MMPI-2-RF scales designed to assess psychopathology, including the H-O, RC, and selected SP scales. To this end, we sought to assess the capacity of the MMPI-2-RF scales to distinguish patients with BD, MD, and SC. Evidence of meaningful diagnostic group differences have the potential to provide the assessing clinician with assurance that the MMPI-2-RF scales can be used to describe accurately the diagnostic profiles of their patients and provide researchers with reasonable confidence that the scales are assessing different and distinct forms of psychopathology. Equally important, however, is that by indicating various scales show meaningful content-based differences between pairs of diagnostic groups, the process of establishing discriminant validity is demonstrated.</p>
<p>In the context of hierarchical structure of psychopathology scales, we organized our analyses in such a way so as to examine the validity of these MMPI-2-RF scales at each level of the hierarchy, with separate analyses performed for the 3 H-O, the 9 RC, and the 23 SP scales (i.e., the 9 internalizing, the 4 externalizing, the 5 somatic/cognitive, and the 5 interpersonal scales).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1073191111428763">1</xref></sup> Based on scale descriptions provided by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1073191111428763">Ben-Porath and Tellegen (2008)</xref>, the extensive validity data presented in the MMPI-2-RF Technical Manual (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1073191111428763">Tellegen &amp; Ben-Porath, 2008</xref>), and the empirical literature on the validity of the RC scales (see e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1073191111428763">Tellegen et al., 2009</xref>, for a review) and other MMPI-2-RF scales (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1073191111428763">Forbey et al., 2010</xref>), several hypotheses were generated for each set of scales.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1073191111428763">2</xref></sup> For the H-O scales, it was hypothesized that (a) the group of patients with BD would score higher on the externalizing scale (BXD) compared with the patients with MD and patients with SC, (b) the patients with MD would have higher scores on the internalizing scale (EID) compared with the patients with BD and SC, and (c) the patients with SC would score higher on the THD scale relative to the patients with BD and MD.</p>
<p>For the RC scales, it was predicted that (a) the patients with BD would score higher on the Hypomanic Activation scale (RC9) compared with the patients with MD and SC, (b) the patients with MD would score higher on Demoralization (RCd) and Low Positive Emotions (RC2) compared with the patients with BD and SC, and (c) the patients with SC would score higher on the Ideas of Persecution (RC6) and Aberrant Experiences (RC8) scales relative to the patients with BD and MD.</p>
<p>For the SP internalizing scales, it was predicted that (a) the patients with MD would score higher on the Helplessness/Hopelessness (HLP), Self-Doubt (SFD), Inefficacy (NFC), Stress/Worry (STW), and Anxiety (AXY) scales compared with the patients with BD and SC; for the SP externalizing scales, it was predicted that (b) the patients with BD would score higher on the Aggression (AGG) and Activation (ACT) scales compared with the patients with MD and SC; for the SP interpersonal scales, it was predicted that (c) the patients with MD would score higher on the Interpersonal Passivity (IPP), Social Avoidance (SAV), and Shyness (SHY) scales relative to the patients with BD and SC, and (d) that the patients with SC would score higher on the Disaffiliativeness (DSF) scale compared with the patients with BD and MD.</p>

<title>Participants and Procedures</title>
<p>MMPI-2-RF scores were derived from MMPI-2 test protocols drawn from a clinical research database maintained at a large provincial mental health and addiction center in Canada. All patients had been diagnosed with the <italic>Structured Clinical Interview</italic> for DSM-IV Axis I Disorders (SCID-I/P; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1073191111428763">First, Spitzer, Gibbon, &amp; Williams, 1997</xref>) as part of a psychological evaluation. Detailed assessments were conducted over 1 to 2 days. Usually, a battery of self-report measures, including the MMPI-2, was completed first, followed by the SCID-I/P.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-1073191111428763">3</xref></sup> MMPI-2 patient protocols were selected from this database and assigned to one of three groups—BD, MD, or SC—based on their SCID-I/P diagnosis. Invalid MMPI-2-RF profiles were identified and removed (<italic>n</italic> = 53) from the sample on the basis of nonresponding or inconsistent responding (i.e., CNS-r &gt; 18 raw [<italic>n</italic> = 16]; VRIN-r &gt; 79<italic>T</italic> [<italic>n</italic> = 14], or TRIN-r &gt; 79<italic>T</italic> [<italic>n</italic> = 23]; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1073191111428763">Ben-Porath &amp; Tellegen, 2008</xref>) prior to analyses.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-1073191111428763">4</xref></sup> The final sample was composed of 544 patients, including 67 (32 men, 35 women) with BD, 407 (199 men, 208 women) with MD, and 70 (44 men, 26 women) with SC.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-1073191111428763">5</xref></sup> These were primary diagnoses and each group was independent (i.e., none of the primary diagnoses were comorbid disorders in the other groups). There were no patients in any of the three groups with “hybrid” diagnoses, such as schizoaffective disorders or severe mood disorders with psychotic features. As part of the research ethics protocol, patients were not obligated to disclose racial or ethnic information and we, therefore, did not formally collect or code this information.</p>
<p>The patients with MD were significantly older (<italic>M</italic> = 39.51 years; <italic>SD</italic> = 11.12) than the patients with BD (<italic>M</italic> = 34.90 years; <italic>SD</italic> = 10.57; <italic>t</italic>[472] = 3.17, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01) and the patients with SC (<italic>M</italic> = 36.67 years; <italic>SD</italic> = 10.22; <italic>t</italic>[475] = 1.99, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05); however, the effect sizes for these differences were small (i.e., Cohen’s <italic>d</italic> &lt; .50). There were no significant differences in the distribution of men and women across patient diagnostic groups, χ<sup>2</sup>(2, <italic>N</italic> = 544) = 4.90, <italic>p</italic> &gt; .05. We chose, therefore, not to use sex or age as covariates in any of the subsequent statistical analyses.</p>

<title>Group Differences</title>
<p>A series of multivariate analyses of variance (MANOVAs) were conducted to compare mean scale score differences between the diagnostic groups (BD, MD, and SC). Significant differences among the groups on individual scales were tested further using univariate <italic>F</italic> tests. Bonferroni corrections were applied to adjust for Type I error within sets of common variables (i.e., H-O, .05/3 or <italic>p</italic> ≤ .02; RC, .05/9 or <italic>p</italic> ≤ .01; SP–Internalizing, .05/9 or <italic>p</italic> ≤ .01; SP–Externalizing, .05/4; SP–Somatic/Cognitive, .05/5 or <italic>p</italic> ≤ .01; SP–Interpersonal, .05/5 or <italic>p</italic> ≤ .01). A priori post hoc pairwise comparison differences between groups were assessed using the Scheffe procedure, with alpha set at <italic>p</italic> ≤ .01. All statistical tests were supplemented with effect size estimates (Cohen’s <italic>d</italic>), with <italic>d</italic> values of .20, .50, and .80 reflecting small, medium, and large effect sizes, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1073191111428763">Cohen, 1988</xref>).</p>
<p>For all three H-O scales, the MANOVA was significant, Pillai’s trace = .21, <italic>F</italic>(6, 1080) = 21.07, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01, η<sup>2</sup> = .10 (with Bonferroni correction). <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1073191111428763">Table 1</xref> provides the means, standard deviations, and statistical tests of difference with associated effect size estimates. Pairwise group comparison results were largely consistent with our a priori hypotheses. The patients with MD scored higher on the EID scale compared to the patients with either BD or SC, the patients with SC scored higher on the THD scale than the patients to either BD or MD, and the patients with BD scored higher on the BXD scale than the patients with MD. Contrary to our hypotheses, however, the patients with BD did not score higher on BXD compared with the patients with SC.</p>

<title>Elevation Frequencies</title>
<p>To provide some the information that may prove useful in the applied clinical context, we examined the percentage of individuals within each diagnostic group who reached an elevated score (i.e., 65<italic>T</italic> or higher) on each MMPI-2-RF scale. These results are displayed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1073191111428763">Table 3</xref>. The relative frequency of elevations using a cut of ≥ 65<italic>T</italic> was consistent with MANOVA results as well as with most hypotheses. The EID scale was associated with substantially greater elevation frequency in the MD patient group relative to the BD and SC patient groups. The H-O scale THD and RC6 were elevated at a higher frequency in the SC patient group relative to the MD and BD patient groups. Clear separation of the group patients with BD from the other two patients groups emerged from SP scales and not the H-O and RC scales; BD was about 2 to 4 times more likely to have an ACT elevation relative to the MD and SC patient groups.</p>

<title>Logistic Regression Analyses</title>
<p>We conducted logistic regression analyses for two reasons. First, we were interested in whether increased diagnostic differentiation occurred as we moved further down in the hierarchy. Second, we wanted to examine all scales within a diagnostic prediction model in which overall scale covariation was considered. In other words, we wanted to determine the unique (relative to other MMPI-2-RF scales within the same set) predictive utility of each scale.</p>
<sec id="section9-1073191111428763">
<title>Hierarchical scale set comparisons</title>
<p>We conducted a hierarchical logistic regression analysis for each pairwise diagnostic comparison (BD vs. MD, BD vs. SC, and MD vs. SC). For each of these analyses, we entered the 3 H-O scales in the first block, 9 RC scales in the second block, and 18 SP scales in the third block.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-1073191111428763">6</xref></sup> For each of the three, pairwise diagnostic comparisons, results from the three-step hierarchical logistic regressions indicated that at Step 1, the H-O scales always significantly differentiated the pairwise diagnostic group comparison; at Step 2, the RC scales always added significant incremental utility to H-O scales; and at Step 3 the SP scales always added additional incremental prediction to the H-O and RC scales. For the <italic>BD versus MD</italic>—Step 1: χ<sup>2</sup> = 23.56, <italic>df</italic> = 3, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001; Step 2: Δχ<sup>2</sup> = 35.66, <italic>df</italic> = 9, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001, Δω′ = .27; Step 3: Δχ<sup>2</sup> = 33.21, <italic>df</italic> = 18, <italic>p</italic> = .016, Δω′ = .26; for the <italic>BD versus SC</italic>—Step 1: χ<sup>2</sup> = 19.78, <italic>df</italic> = 3, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001; Step 2: Δχ<sup>2</sup> = 20.54, <italic>df</italic> = 9, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001, Δω′ = .39; Step 3: Δχ<sup>2</sup> = 36.09, <italic>df</italic> = 18, <italic>p</italic> = .007, Δω′ = .51; for the <italic>MD versus SC</italic>—Step 1: χ<sup>2</sup> = 106.94, <italic>df</italic> = 3, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001; Step 2: Δχ<sup>2</sup> = 51.59, <italic>df</italic> = 9, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001, Δω′ = .33; Step 3: Δχ<sup>2</sup> = 40.97, <italic>df</italic> = 18, <italic>p</italic> = .002, Δω′ = .29. As indicated by the effect size estimate for the chi-square statistic, omega prime (ω′), the majority of these increments were meaningful at a moderate level (ω′ = .10 is considered small, .30 moderate, and .50 as a large effect size; see, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1073191111428763">Cohen, 1988</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-1073191111428763">
<title>Individual-scale predictors</title>
<p>We next examined the relative unique prediction of MMPI-2-RF scales. Because individual weights (i.e., odds ratios) within scale sets are less meaningful when conducting hierarchical regression due to item overlap between scales (and thus, excessive multicollinearity) as one moves up and down the scale hierarchy, we conducted logistic regression analyses to determine which scales <italic>within each scale set</italic> contributed uniquely to the differentiation between diagnostic groups. For each diagnostic pair comparison, we conducted five separate regressions for each scale set (i.e., H-O, RC, Internalizing SP, Externalizing SP, and Interpersonal SP scales). The individual scale weights and odds ratios for each scale set for each diagnostic pairwise prediction is displayed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-1073191111428763">Table 4</xref>.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Our main goal of this investigation was to examine the diagnostic construct validity of the MMPI-2-RF scales by examining the pattern of scale score differences among patients carefully diagnosed with BD, MD, and SC. The unique predictive performance of these scales to distinguish between pairs of diagnostic groups was also examined. Multivariate analyses revealed a general pattern of mean scale differences among patient groups that were largely consistent with the distinctive diagnostic features of each patient group. Outcomes from logistic regression analyses, which systematically examined the capacity of these scales to distinguish between different pairs of patient groups, indicated that various scales were able to differentiate significantly between pairs of diagnostic groups in a meaningful manner. We believe that these results provide support for the diagnostic convergent and discriminant validity of the MMPI-2-RF.</p>
<p>Although there were a few instances where the results did not conform to our predictions, in most of these instances one or more of the other scales, typically at another level of the scale hierarchy, did perform as expected. For example, at the highest level of the hierarchy we predicted that the H-O scale THD would be higher in the patients with SC versus the patients with BD, but this hypothesis was not confirmed. At a lower level of the scale hierarchy, however, the RC6 scale was able to differentiate between these patient groups. In the above instance, moving down the scale hierarchy improved the diagnostic utility; in other instances, however, moving up the hierarchy enhanced prediction. For example, we predicted that the patients with MD would score higher on the internalizing specific scales HLP, SFD, NFC, STW, and AXY, than patients with BD, but these hypotheses were not confirmed; however, at the RC level, patients with MD did score higher on RC2 and lower on RC9 compared with the patients with bipolar depression. These findings likely illustrate that the type of symptoms targeted by the scales, and those that actually differentiate the various disorders, vary from broader (e.g., psychotic symptoms; RC6) to more specific (e.g., history of or current hypomania; ACT).</p>
<p>Although systematically moving down the hierarchy of psychopathology did not always result in greater diagnostic specification, simultaneous use of scales at all levels of the hierarchy did depict, overall, a meaningful pattern of scale elevations. Importantly, the scale profile created by the MMPI-2-RF scales is consistent with evidence from recent psychopathology research. For example, high scores on RCd and RC2, which collectively include symptoms of depressed mood, unhappiness, life dissatisfaction, and anhedonia, were notable in the groups of patients with MD. Depressed mood and, in particular low positive emotionality, are defining characteristics of depression (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1073191111428763">Brown, Chorpita, &amp; Barlow, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1073191111428763">Sellbom et al., 2008</xref>). Similarly, the patients with SC had especially high scores on the THD and RC6 scales (relative to other scales), which are cardinal features of this disorder. It is also noteworthy that elevation on the scales assessing indecisiveness and disabling fearfulness (i.e., NFC and BRF) also appears to be associated with SC, which is consistent with other recent research, supporting a link between psychosis and fearfulness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1073191111428763">Russell et al., 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>Overall, in addition to providing evidence of construct validity, we believe that our findings also provide more pragmatic information for interpretation of MMPI-2-RF profiles in clinical practice. Based on the diagnostic differentiations examined in the current article, the H-O scales appear quite useful in differentiating broad and relatively unique forms of psychopathology—internalizing, externalizing, and thought dysfunction. For example, patients with MD typically have clinically significant elevations on EID and RCd, RC2, suggesting that these scales are clear and mostly unique indicators of a depressive disorder. The presence or absence of an ACT scale elevation (or even above average score in a depressed patient) could suggest current (or past) symptoms of mania. Although it was not possible in the current study to provide more specification of the most recent episode for all BD patients, it is clear that an elevated ACT scale score is associated with substantial increase in the likelihood of a BD diagnosis. An elevated THD scale score is associated with the greatest likelihood of an SC diagnosis. When coupled with RC6 and NFC and BRF, it confers further probability of the presence of an SC diagnosis. Replication with additional samples is clearly needed, however, to increase clinicians’ confidence in these scale/diagnosis associations. One limitation of the current investigation, which might compromise its generalizability, is that we did not have access to full comorbidity information for all patients and it is possible that the presence of other symptoms unrelated to the primary diagnosed disorder may have influenced some of these results. This is a particularly strong possibility for the sample of patients with MD, a condition associated with high rates of comorbidity with several anxiety disorders (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1073191111428763">Brown, Campbell, Lehman, Grisham, &amp; Mancill, 2001</xref>). Future investigations examining the diagnostic construct validity of the MMPI-2-RF comparing patients with MD and patients with various anxiety disorders are needed to explore if these patient groups produce differential scale elevations in a manner consistent with these disorders. For example, at the RC scale level, one would expect relatively higher scale elevations for patients with MD on RC2 compared with the patients with anxiety disorders, whereas MD patients would score lower on RC7 compared with the patients with anxiety disorders (see, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1073191111428763">Naragon-Gainey, Watson, &amp; Markon, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Another limitation is that only a small proportion of the bipolar patients could be diagnosed with their most recent episode as manic/hypomanic (<italic>n</italic> = 27), whereas other patients were depressed only, mixed, or unknown. Although depressive symptomatology in unipolar versus bipolar depressed patients might manifest behaviorally in a similar manner, there is empirical research to support different neurobiological referents for the two disorders, which would justify examining them as distinct groups (regardless of the most recent episode for patients with bipolar depression; e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1073191111428763">Kempton, Geddes, Ettinger, Williams, &amp; Grasby, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1073191111428763">Videbech &amp; Ravnkilde, 2004</xref>). Nonetheless, exploration of scale elevations across mood state (i.e., depressed vs. hypomanic/manic) in bipolar patients in clearly identifiable different phases of their illnesses is needed to clarify more definitely the distinction that we believe can be made with MMPI-2-RF scales.</p>
<p>Although it is tempting to provide specific scale cut scores and clinical scale profiles that could possibly assist the clinician in cases involving differential diagnosis, at this juncture, our efforts are focused mostly on construct validation and we believe it to be premature to offer any more specific recommendations than that provided here until our research can be replicated, preferably using larger groups of patients with BD and SC. We do think, however, that our findings provide further evidence of the validity of the MMPI-2-RF scales and, in this regard, should provide the clinician with some confidence that the scales are performing well and are descriptively accurate.</p>
