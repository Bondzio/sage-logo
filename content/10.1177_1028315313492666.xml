<p>After the Special Issue on Internationalization of the Curriculum and the Disciplines, we have a regular Issue 3. It contains five articles, two of them focused on internationalization of higher education in Canada, two on teacher education and one on maximizing the benefits of international education collaborations. The opening article by Rhonda Friesen addresses faculty engagement—an increasingly important aspect of internationalization strategy in universities. As was also clear from the Special Issue, faculty are key actors in implementing and guiding internationalization processes, but we know little about their views, their needs, and their abilities to do so. Rhonda Friesen’s article demonstrates clearly the distance between faculty perceptions of internationalization and those who design internationalization strategies in Canada. This is a frequently overlooked issue in other contexts.</p>
<p>The other articles in this issue also address matters not always at the forefront of the study of internationalization although they are relevant for its further development. They remind us that we must pay attention to a broad range of issues, not all of them immediately obvious, if we are to make further progress to internationalize education across the world. They emphasise, individually and collectively, the importance of collecting and analyzing data on performance, challenging some of our long-held beliefs and assumptions and continually seeking better ways to approach what we do.</p>
<p>On April 5 a symposium “<italic>At the Forefront of International Higher Education</italic>” was held to honor the career of Philip G. Altbach, Monan Professor of Higher Education and director of the Boston College Center for International Higher Education. Philip has been a member of the Editorial Advisory Board of this Journal from its start, and has been one of the key people guiding the field of international higher education for many years. His free newsletter, <italic>International Higher Education</italic>, available in several languages both online and in print, is an important source of information on developments in international higher education, including internationalization. His many books and articles are frequently used by those studying international higher education. The recent publications by his center: <italic>The Global Future of Higher Education and the Academic Profession: The BRICS and the United States</italic> (written with Gregory Androushchak, Yaroslav Kuzminov, Maria Yudkevich, and Liz Reisberg) and: <italic>Paying the Professorate: A Global Comparison of Compensation and Contracts</italic> (written with Liz Reisberg, Maria Yudkevich, Gregory Androushchak, and Iván Pacheco) are illustrative of his rich and valuable academic production. This is further demonstrated by the recent book: <italic>A Half-Century of Indian Higher Education: Essays by Philip G Altbach</italic>, edited by Pawan Agarwal Adviser, Higher Education, Planning Commission of India, a compendium of 34 writings of Philip Altbach on Indian higher education. We as editors of the journal, and on behalf of our readers, honor and thank Philip for his valuable contributions to the study of international education.</p>
