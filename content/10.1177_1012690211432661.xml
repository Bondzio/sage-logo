<abstract>
<p>By creating and posting their own stories on the Internet, sportswomen are able to challenge the persistent, sexist, mainstream and alternative (skateboarding) media (re)presentations of female athletes. A Foucauldian discourse analysis of 262 posts of the Skirtboarders’ blog – a Montreal-based, Canadian female skateboarding crew’s Internet project – explores the ways in which a group of sportswomen circulate alternative discourses of femininity. In these (re)presentations, the Skirtboarders embrace various femininities and, at the same time, reject binaries (male/female) without explicitly claiming a feminist agenda or attaching themselves to other oppositional discourses. This indicates a third-wave feminist sensibility. The Skirtboarders reproduce some normative discursive fragments commonly found in media (re)presentations. Furthermore, they post links to mainstream and alternative media coverage of their crew, which at times reflects the ‘problems’ of historical media coverage (sexualization, marginalization and trivialization). However, most of their online productions portray them as polygendered skaters (action shots, skating activities and lifestyle) and are thus radically different. The Skirtboarders’ discursive portrayals of female skateboarders are therefore uniquely alternative to other media (re)presentations but at the same time, paradoxical.</p>

<p>Media discourses are an important means of investigating issues of identity, including gender, as they arguably contribute to how women understand themselves and their bodies – especially in relation to men’s bodies. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1012690211432661">Azzarito (2010)</xref> suggests ‘. . . through the media the feminine body is defined and circumscribed as a complement to and/or in opposition to the masculine body in specific, narrow and heteronormative ways’ (p. 264). Media discourses produce and circulate statements that may ascribe femininity to sportswomen<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1012690211432661">1</xref></sup> in a way that (hetero)sexualizes and trivializes their accomplishments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1012690211432661">Kane and Maxwell, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-1012690211432661">Messner and Cooky, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr101-1012690211432661">Wensing and Bruce, 2003</xref>). This may impact the ways that girls and women construct their identity(ies) as sports participants and as feminine subjects. Drawing on Foucault (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1012690211432661">1969</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1012690211432661">1971</xref>), <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-1012690211432661">MacKay and Dallaire (2009)</xref> suggest that:<disp-quote>
<p>discourse links the exercise of power to the acceptance of certain truths about sportswomen (and sportsmen) as gendered bodies. The repetition of particular statements about female and male athletes establishes truths about who and what they are, in the same way that the absence of discursive recognition of women in sports makes them invisible. (p. 26)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The adaptation of Foucault’s discourse theory in sports studies (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1012690211432661">Chapman, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1012690211432661">Cole, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1012690211432661">Duncan, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-1012690211432661">Markula, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-1012690211432661">Markula and Pringle, 2006</xref>), and more specifically in sports media analyses (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr80-1012690211432661">Pirinen, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr112-1012690211432661">Wright and Clarke, 1999</xref>), shows that media texts normalize, discipline and classify women’s bodies. Sports studies scholars argue that the discursive (hetero)sexualization and trivialization of sportswomen in media (re)presentations are the primary means by which masculine dominance is reproduced in sport (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1012690211432661">Kane and Maxwell, 2011</xref>). This unfair media coverage (substantially different in quantity and quality to men’s media coverage) is alleged to diminish women’s athletic accomplishments, discourage women from participating in sports, and suggest that women who participate in sport are socially acceptable only if they adopt and reproduce the dominant discourses of femininity circulated in and through media texts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1012690211432661">Bernstein, 2002</xref>). Despite the documented emergence of counter-discourses, the overall results of recent studies examining (re)presentations of sportswomen in both mainstream<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1012690211432661">2</xref></sup> and alternative<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-1012690211432661">3</xref></sup> media confirm the persisting asymmetrical coverage of women and men that ultimately contributes to gender inequity in sport (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1012690211432661">Crossman et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1012690211432661">Kane and Buysse, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1012690211432661">Kian et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1012690211432661">King, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-1012690211432661">Messner and Cooky, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr99-1012690211432661">Thorpe, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>Girls and women are exposed to dominant discourses of femininity circulating in and through sport media texts (including lifestyle sport media texts – see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr99-1012690211432661">Thorpe, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr106-1012690211432661">Wheaton and Beal, 2003</xref>). Dominant discourses about sportswomen (including skateboarding women – <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1012690211432661">Beal and Wilson, 2004</xref>) focus on: gender marking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1012690211432661">Koivula, 1999</xref>), establishing heterosexuality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr112-1012690211432661">Wright and Clarke, 1999</xref>), emphasizing female stereotypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1012690211432661">Christopherson et al., 2002</xref>), infantilizing women (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1012690211432661">Koivula, 1999</xref>), non-sports related aspects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1012690211432661">Eastman and Billings, 2000</xref>), comparisons to men’s performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1012690211432661">Donnelly et al., 2008</xref>) and ambivalence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr101-1012690211432661">Wensing and Bruce, 2003</xref>). However, these disciplinary mechanisms ‘do not produce a simple dominating discourse’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr84-1012690211432661">Pringle and Markula, 2005</xref>: 472). Michel <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1012690211432661">Foucault (1978)</xref> warned us that discourses are deployed in ways that are difficult to decipher, partly because ‘a multiplicity of discursive elements . . . can come into play in various strategies’ (p. 100). A disciplinary practice does not shape ‘all its subjects into a single uniform mass, it separates, analyses, differentiates, carries its procedures to the point of necessary and sufficient units’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1012690211432661">Foucault, 1977</xref>: 170). Therefore, women (and men) who interact with sport media texts do not necessarily embody the dominant discourses that such media circulate. Instead, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr99-1012690211432661">Thorpe (2008)</xref> suggests in her examination of how young women construct themselves through mass and niche snowboarding media, ‘the effect of these images depends on the discursive lens through which men and women read them’ (p. 224).</p>
<p>Women may challenge these discourses by creating their own sport and gender (re)presentations on the Internet. This article examines a blog<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-1012690211432661">4</xref></sup> produced by the Skirtboarders – a female skateboard crew based in Montreal, Canada – to explore how these young women (re)present gender and sport performances compared to mainstream and alternative (skateboarding) media texts. Computer mediated sport or ‘cybersport’ offers a new source for constructing meaning about sporting identities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1012690211432661">Kinkema and Harris, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1012690211432661">Leonard, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-1012690211432661">McDaniel and Sullivan, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-1012690211432661">Meân, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr105-1012690211432661">Wheaton, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr110-1012690211432661">Wilson, 2007</xref>). Part of the reason is that traditional forms of sports media are produced by organizations and with technologies that hinder dialogue between the users and the producers at the time of production. Furthermore, traditional media have gatekeepers who filter ideas, leaving users to construct meaning from texts after they are produced. Conversely, the Internet has a certain reversibility that allows users to produce their own texts and interact with texts produced by others, thus blurring the lines between user and producer and offering the promise of ruptures in subjectivity by challenging dominant discourses circulated by other media platforms.</p>

<title>Researching the Internet</title>
<p>Sport sociologists are just beginning to examine the ways in which the Internet has been used for social resistance and social movement projects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-1012690211432661">Millington and Wilson, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr82-1012690211432661">Plymire and Forman, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr89-1012690211432661">Scherer and Jackson, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr109-1012690211432661">Wilson, 2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr110-1012690211432661">2007</xref>). Although some authors describe ‘anti-jock’ cybergroups that critique hypermasculine sport cultures (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr108-1012690211432661">Wilson, 2002</xref>) and suggest that the action of sports-related social movements is enhanced by their use of the Internet (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1012690211432661">Knight and Greenberg, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1012690211432661">Lenskyj, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr88-1012690211432661">Sage, 1999</xref>), no feminist work has yet examined gender constructions and social movements in cybersport (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr110-1012690211432661">Wilson, 2007</xref>). Yet cyberdiscourses should not be neglected if we want to understand discourses of gender in sport media (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1012690211432661">Kian et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1012690211432661">Leonard, 2009</xref>). Other feminist researchers have heavily invested in this relatively new medium (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1012690211432661">Blair et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1012690211432661">Bury, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1012690211432661">Consalvo and Paasonen, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-1012690211432661">Passonen, 2005</xref>). Cyberfeminists’ (feminists critically examining the Internet) early engagement is due in part to the ability of computer-mediated communication to circumvent and render irrelevant physical markers of race, gender, sexuality, ability and age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1012690211432661">Baerg, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1012690211432661">Barlow, 1996</xref>). This ‘dream of disembodiment’ produced debates about the potential of this transformation to allow women new forms of freedom. After decades of ambivalence towards technology, cyberfeminists claimed many women were now finding a wealth of new opportunities, spaces and lines of thought in the world of telecommunications. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr81-1012690211432661">Plant (2002)</xref> suggested, women were quickly realizing that ‘there is more to cyberspace than meets the male gaze’ (p. 835).</p>
<p>While cyberfeminists were keen to point out the opportunities that the Internet afforded women, they also were careful to explain that social, economic and political power relations did not disappear online (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-1012690211432661">Paasonen, 2005</xref>). Therefore, although cyberfeminists elucidated the contribution of women’s engagement with the Internet to individual empowerment in many Westernized and first-world locations, they argued that the improvement in the material and political positions of women as a result of Internet practices is questionable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1012690211432661">Gajjala et al., 2010</xref>). However, the Internet does offer women the <italic>possibility</italic> of reconfiguring relations of power. Not all relations of power (especially those related to gender) are reflected electronically on the Internet. Nor is the Internet an alternative world, as some cyberfeminists suggest. The evidence of the continuity between online and offline life contradicts the idea that the Internet is separate from the ‘real’ world (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr111-1012690211432661">Wilson and Atkinson, 2005</xref>). Instead, the Internet is ‘a phenomenon <italic>of</italic> this world, [a set] of practices and narratives that have effects <italic>in</italic> this world . . .’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-1012690211432661">Paasonen, 2005</xref>: 5, emphasis in original). The outcomes of Internet usage as a technology, as with any technology, are thus not predetermined.</p>

<title>Skirtboarder identity as performance</title>
<p>In this article, the Skirtboarders’ gender identity is regarded as a performance produced and framed in discourse. Discourse connects knowledge with the exercise of power.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>This form of power applies itself to immediate everyday life which categorizes the individual, marks him by his own individuality, attaches him to his own identity, imposes a law of truth on him which he must recognize and which others have to recognize in him. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1012690211432661">Foucault, 1983</xref>: 212)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Discourse then produces ‘truths’ concerning identity, information and beliefs promoted and legitimized by institutions (including media organizations). Identity can thus be contested with the production of alternative forms of knowledge. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr100-1012690211432661">Weedon (1997)</xref> referred to this as reverse discourse; although we prefer the term ‘alternative’ discourse, defined as opposing the status quo but not necessarily by using the same vocabulary as dominating discourses or producing the opposing social effects.</p>
<p>We draw on Foucault as well as Butler (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1012690211432661">1991</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1012690211432661">1993</xref>) and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr100-1012690211432661">Weedon (1997)</xref> to understand the fluidity, complexity and multiplicity of identities constructed through discourse to analyze how the Skirtboarders (re)present their gendered skateboarding performances on their blog. Butler (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1012690211432661">1991</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1012690211432661">1993</xref>) explains that identities are performative and produced through regulatory practices. In this perspective, one comes to accept the ‘truth’ about one’s identity through the repetitive practices defined by discourse. Thus, gender is a performance through which we display the discursive norms of what it means to be a woman or man. In this sense, gender is always an action, though not the action of a subject who might be said to pre-exist discourse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1012690211432661">Butler, 1990</xref>). Subjectivity/identity is not defined in language according to an essential identity. Rather, discourse pre-exists the subject. Discourse produces subjectivity/identity since we learn modes of thinking about ourselves through language (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr100-1012690211432661">Weedon, 1997</xref>). Yet, our gender subjectivity is not merely a matter of how we ‘recognize’ the gender ‘truths’ produced in discourse, but is also confirmed in how we ‘enact’ or perform them. These gender-producing discourses circulate in numerous sites, including the media. As indicated above, media discourses about femininity play a powerful role in producing girls’ and women’s understanding of themselves and construction of gender identities. The Skirtboarders’ blog is such a site where the gender identities of female skateboarders are reproduced and circulated by the media subjects themselves. This is unique in the skateboarding world, where male skaters represent the standard in media (re)presentations while female skaters are sexualized, trivialized and marginalized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1012690211432661">Beal and Wilson, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>Studies examining gender identity (re)presentation in skateboarding media were pre-empted by research exploring issues of gender identity in lifestyle sports<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-1012690211432661">5</xref></sup> more generally (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr98-1012690211432661">Thorpe, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr104-1012690211432661">Wheaton, 2004b</xref>), and on gender identity in skateboarding in particular (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1012690211432661">Beal, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1012690211432661">Donnelly, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1012690211432661">Kelly et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr83-1012690211432661">Pomerantz et al., 2004</xref>). The earliest participants in lifestyle sporting activities (in the 1960s and 1970s) were originally seeking an alternative lifestyle (and often times resistant) to the mainstream that gave them a particular social identity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr103-1012690211432661">Wheaton, 2004a</xref>). Since then, some of these ‘lifestyle’ practices (such as snowboarding, skateboarding and surfing) have been promoted by commercial enterprises and have become part of the mainstream, which ultimately increased access to these activities but arguably diluted their resistant functions. This shift is reflected in debates about the importance of ‘authenticity’ in lifestyle sport subcultures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1012690211432661">Beal and Wiedman, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1012690211432661">Beal and Wilson, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr102-1012690211432661">Wheaton, 2003</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr103-1012690211432661">2004a</xref>).</p>
<p>Although each lifestyle sport has its own history, identities and stages of evolution, some aspects of their ethos, philosophy and commoditization are similar. Lifestyle sports are an interesting phenomenon for feminist researchers because of the increasingly central role they play in the cultural identities of young women. This could partly confirm suggestions that some aspects of lifestyle sports make them friendlier to girls and women than traditional sport – for example, they are cooperative, anti-competitive, a means of self-expression and self-control and free of rules and hierarchal structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1012690211432661">Beal, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1012690211432661">Heino, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr86-1012690211432661">Reinhart, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr98-1012690211432661">Thorpe, 2005</xref>). Girls and women could also be taking an interest in these activities because the changing global economy and commodification of lifestyle sports has provided them with heavily marketed goods to consume. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1012690211432661">Heywood (2008)</xref> claims that although these global market shifts have opened up new possibilities for gender expression and identity construction, they have also limited the potential for sport to serve as a politically transformative space in relation to gender because participants become complicit with discourses of neoliberalism. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr99-1012690211432661">Thorpe (2008)</xref> echoes this claim by stating that some female snowboarders are ‘aware of their commodity value and have no qualms about marketing their sexuality to boost their public profile and image and reap the financial benefits’ (p. 211).</p>
<p>Other researchers suggest that lifestyle sports have been sexist since their inception and that women are still considered (albeit to a lesser extent than in the past) as ‘intruders’ in masculine territories like skate parks, beaches and cliff jumping areas and in lifestyle sport culture more generally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1012690211432661">Kelly et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1012690211432661">Laurendeau, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr104-1012690211432661">Wheaton, 2004b</xref>). These contradictory positions reflect the complexity of girls’ and women’s participation in skateboarding, which is often based on a desire to resist dominant discourses (e.g. of femininity), yet is still constrained by them (e.g. skateboarding is still a male preserve). In their analysis of skater girl discourse, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1012690211432661">Kelly et al. (2005)</xref> highlight this complexity when they argue that even though the skater girls they interviewed saw themselves as participating in an ‘alternative’ girlhood through their skateboarding performances and identification as ‘skater girls’, becoming a ‘skater’ often meant embracing the culture’s masculine norms. Therefore, they concluded that ‘skater girls’ and ‘skater women’ are not necessarily engaging in and (re)presenting alternative discourses at all times in their skateboarding performances.</p>
<p>Mainstream media underrepresents, sexualizes and trivializes skateboarding women in the same way that it (re)presents female athletes from traditional sports. Such forms of marginalization are even worse in alternative skateboarding media (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1012690211432661">Beal and Wilson, 2004</xref>). This confirms skateboarding women’s doubly-marginalized status in the sports world and in the skateboarding world. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1012690211432661">Donnelly (2008)</xref> further suggests that even media (re)presentations focusing on female skateboarders rely on legitimation by men (considered the skateboarding experts) and focus on injury, which reinforces rather than challenges ideologies of gender difference. Therefore, the Skirtboarders interact with the discourses of masculinity and femininity circulated by mainstream and alternative (skateboarding) media (re)presentations of female athletes, and this interaction shapes the women’s gender performances and ultimately their self-(re)presentation on their blog.</p>
<p>In light of the above discussion, this article aims to understand the discourses Skirtboarders draw on and deploy in producing their own sport coverage. The analysis consists of an investigation of a series of Internet (specifically Web 2.0) texts produced by the Skirtboarders in order to uncover the texts’ possibilities, the young women’s (re)construction of their bodies and resistance to the normative categories of femininity that sport scholars have identified. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1012690211432661">Lauretis (1987)</xref> proposed: ‘that the construction of gender is the product and the process of both (re)presentation and self-(re)presentation’ (p. 9). This study focuses on an analysis of blogged texts in an effort to put Lauretis’s assertion to the test by looking at how a specific group of sportswomen self-(re)present on their blog and how they are (re)presented by others in mainstream and alternative media texts (which the Skirtboarders reproduce or link to their blog).</p>

<p>The crew became an official entity in 2002 when a group of female skateboarders registered the Internet domain name ‘<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://Skirtboarders.com">Skirtboarders.com</ext-link>’. Their website is a collaborative project by and for the Skirtboarders. The blog was added in 2007 and constitutes the main feature of this Internet endeavor. According to Mathilde, a founder of both the crew and the Internet site, ‘the Skirtboarders crew is a bunch of friends of all ages who skate together in Montréal and gather as often as possible’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr97-1012690211432661">The Side Project, 2008</xref>). The 17 primarily white<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-1012690211432661">6</xref></sup> women (aged 18–32) profiled on the blog travel to skate, make videos (they produced the first Canadian all-female skateboarding film in 2007), socialize together, meet new people and share stories (including photos and videos) on their blog. The blog is produced in French and English, however, the Skirtboarders write most of their posts in French then translate them to reach a wider audience. Featured in the Canadian media several times since starting the blog, including television, newspapers, skateboarding websites and magazines, they have also attracted international media attention from Transworld Skateboarding magazine, Mexican and Swedish magazines and newspapers as well as numerous skateboarding websites, including women’s skateboarding websites.</p>
<p>The Skirtboarders produce both the written and visual (re)presentations displayed on the blog. Three members post the majority of the blog entries (elected by the group to perform this task on behalf of the group), although no administrator (gatekeeper) decides who can and cannot post. Therefore, all of the young women can post their material uncensored, or change what they have to say or how they visually (re)present themselves. This differentiates their web project from most media coverage. Anyone who visits the blog can comment on blog entries (without having to sign in). Most respondents are Skirtboarders commenting on posts by other crew members. However, a considerable number of respondents present themselves as young women who either skateboard or hope to skateboard in the future and consider the Skirtboarders as role models. The Skirtboarders also cross-post their stories and videos on numerous social networking sites (including Facebook and Twitter) and video sharing sites (including Vimeo and YouTube) where they have gained an extensive following (including almost 10,000 Facebook fans). Young women who engage with the Skirtboarders through the Internet come from Quebec and elsewhere in Canada or from other countries such as Sweden, Mexico, the USA, UK and Vietnam.</p>
<p>What makes the Skirtboarders blog an interesting case for analysis? Through this blog (and their discursive self (re)presentation), these young women have been able to share their experiences as female skateboarders with a large (international) community, to meet other women who skateboard in Montreal or other locales (e.g. Sweden, Mexico, California) with whom they engage in exchanges (through trips or sharing information online) and to attract mainstream media attention that they arguably would not have received without the blog. Most of all, the site is interesting because the Skirtboarders have managed to self-produce and distribute (re)presentations of female skateboarders in their own way; that is, without bending to mainstream media conventions (e.g. modeling their coverage after other female skateboard media coverage primarily intended to sell a product – see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1012690211432661">Beal and Wilson, 2004</xref>). This being the case, what gender discourses do the Skirtboarders circulate on their blog?</p>

<title>Research protocol</title>
<p>All posts (262) on the Skirtboarders’ website, including photos, videos and comments, from March 2007–May 2010 were included in this study to understand the Skirtboarders’ constructions of their gender subjectivities. The six stages of discourse analysis described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr107-1012690211432661">Willig (2001)</xref> were employed to analyze the data drawing on Foucault’s discourse theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1012690211432661">1969</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1012690211432661">1971</xref>). These include 1) identifying how sportswomen (specifically skateboarding women) were constructed in each text; 2) locating the discursive constructions (of the Skirtboarders) within wider discourse; 3) closely examining the contexts within which the blog posts were being deployed; 4) determining which subject positions the blog posts offer; 5) examining the relationship between discourse and practice; and 6) exploring the relationship between discourse and subjectivity. To achieve this, each blog entry was studied first of all simply to experience the unquestioning and status quo reading of the entry (that of an ordinary, undiscerning reader). As most of the Skirtboarders are francophones, the French texts were studied first and the English texts were compared to the French texts to establish whether the two linguistically different texts were consistent in meaning. Next, each entry was examined a second time with a critical eye; this time written and visual texts were revisited at different levels, questions were raised about statements producing femininity and possible alternate constructions of the texts were imagined. The photographs were the most noticeable aspects of the blog posts. For each post, at least one photograph (and often 5–10 photographs) accompanied the text.</p>
<p>The texts were compared to other texts about female athletes that we have studied in the past (to establish what was included and what was excluded) and to the descriptions of female skateboarding media (re)presentations by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1012690211432661">Beal and Wilson (2004)</xref>. The social context of the statements was also considered (e.g. the source and the circumstances) (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr87-1012690211432661">Rose, 2007</xref>). The discursive constructions were coded using a priori themes based on the research questions and the relevant literature (e.g. the seven discursive categories that emerge in mainstream media portrayals of female athletes identified earlier and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1012690211432661">Daniels’s [2009]</xref> descriptions of ‘polygenderism’). Particular emphasis focused on identifying whether the Skirtboarders reproduced dominant discourses of femininity (for example, if they referenced their sexuality, body or appearance) or whether they offered alternatives to these discourses (for example, if they refrained from referencing female [hetero]sexuality, body or appearance and from using sex appeal to ‘sell’ their blog). These themes were continually refined and others were added; therefore, the final composition of the themes exceeded the initial categorization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr95-1012690211432661">Smith-Maguire, 2008</xref>). We coded the data on the understanding that although we had some notion of what we were looking for, other themes would emerge from the materials and the themes used to start the coding process would evolve as we reached a better understanding of the Skirtboarders’ blog, the Skirtboarders themselves and their users (through the analysis of comments) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr95-1012690211432661">Smith-Maguire, 2008</xref>).</p>

<sec id="section5-1012690211432661">
<title>Political self (re)presentations or ‘just skateboarders’</title>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-1012690211432661">McRobbie (1999)</xref> suggests that scholars might try looking for resistance in ‘the more mundane, micrological level of everyday practices and choices about how to live . . .’ (p. 72). In this analysis of the Skirtboarders’ blog, the daily experiences of the bloggers were studied to understand whether they are producing alternative discourses on femininity via the Internet. Interestingly, although the Skirtboarders explicitly state on the jacket of their film that they want to challenge certain aspects of skateboarding culture and (re)presentation (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1012690211432661">Figure 2</xref>), they do not identify themselves as feminists nor state any specific political goal of promoting certain forms of femininity on their blog.</p>
<p>On the film jacket, the Skirtboarders juxtapose the text (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1012690211432661">Figure 2</xref>) with a picture of a skateboarder in a skirt (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1012690211432661">Figure 3</xref>), which contradicts the text. However, when they state that there are no skirts in this film, they mean it, and no skirts are paired with a skateboard on their blog either. Therefore, although it may initially appear from the film jacket that the Skirtboarders consciously and explicitly created their film in order to challenge mainstream and alternative media (re)presentations of sportswomen, specifically young women who skateboard, an analysis of the blog reveals something else. The findings suggest that the Skirtboarders self (re)present on their blog, much of the time, as ‘just skateboarders’ rather than as female skateboarders on a mission to promote and express gender politics. For example, Mathilde, the leader of the crew, remarked in a television interview that the Skirtboarders started taking photos and making videos of themselves skateboarding, and posting them on the Internet, because they perceived that women skateboarders were absent from mainstream and alternative media texts. However, she was quick to say that the crew started this web project because they wanted to (re)present themselves skateboarding and have fun doing it (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-1012690211432661">Pigeon, 2009</xref>). Her comments do not suggest that they turned to the Internet because they wanted to ‘talk back’ to anyone.</p>
<p>Regardless of the Skirtboarders’ affirmed group goals, they engage in gender politics in multiple ways. First, they mention in interviews with mainstream media sources that the majority of crew members began skateboarding with boys (brothers, neighbors, etc.) and self-identified, at least at one time, as ‘tomboys’ (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-1012690211432661">Pigeon, 2009</xref>). Daniels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1012690211432661">2009</xref>: 39) states:<disp-quote>
<p>No matter how skilled the tomboy may be at the culturally normative male activities in which she engages and for which she has been accepted by her male and female playing cohort in the past, she learns that she is an intruder in the games and sports and that there are negative consequences to her trespassing on this masculine territory.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Second, the Skirtboarders mention in media interviews (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-1012690211432661">Pigeon, 2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-1012690211432661">2009</xref>) that the crew formed because they found that as more women joined the group, they had more fun skateboarding. They suggest that the Skirtboarders’s primary strength is power in numbers, which can be read as an indication that they counteract feelings of trespassing the male skateboarding world by physically ‘taking over’ skate parks. Third, the fact that the blog was created and is continually produced by women for women, and features only female sport performances (the male partners of crew members have rarely appeared, and never as ‘skaters’, but always as ‘partners’ throughout the three-year period studied), says something about the Skirtboarders’ gender politics. Finally, the group’s name is a comment on femininity as it relates to skateboarding.</p>
<p>Despite this apparent feminist agenda, the ways in which the Skirtboarders (re)present themselves in their blog posts seem to lack a feminist consciousness and may even be labeled by some as postfeminist.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-1012690211432661">7</xref></sup> However, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr83-1012690211432661">Pomerantz et al. (2004)</xref> argue that such a classification might stop us from ‘hear[ing] all the ways in which girls are quietly but powerfully changing the face of girlhood through localized and specific gender struggles’ (p. 549). Indeed, scholars suggest that younger women have developed new feminisms that complicate the contradiction between persistent sexism and increased opportunities (particularly economical) for women. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1012690211432661">Heywood and Drake (1997)</xref> describe third-wave feminism as ‘a movement that contains elements of the second-wave critique of beauty culture, sexual abuse and power structures’ while also recognizing ‘the pleasure, danger and defining power of those structures’ (p. 3). Third-wave feminists have grown up having had opportunities (e.g. in sport) and tend not to experience gender in the same way as older generations. Unlike women involved with second-wave struggles, they do not necessarily take up discourses as either/or but rather ‘embrace contradiction, hybridity, and multiple identities’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr99-1012690211432661">Thorpe, 2008</xref>: 212) and are ‘passionately engaged in social change agendas, but that these occur in marginal, virtual or underground places’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1012690211432661">Harris, 2001</xref>: 139). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1012690211432661">Heywood (2008)</xref> further argues that young sportswomen are working on advancing key feminist issues and goals using ‘third wave’ perspectives in less conspicuous spaces, without attaching themselves to the word <italic>feminist.</italic> She calls this ‘stealth feminism’. It is possible that the Skirtboarders are ‘stealth feminist’ bloggers who are looking to (re)present gender in a different way altogether, where maleness and femaleness are not discernable and fluidity marks their bodies as ‘polygendered’.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1012690211432661">
<title>Polygendered, gender-neutral or stereotypically feminine?</title>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1012690211432661">Butler (1993)</xref> argues that the performative dimension of identity refers to the ‘reiterative power of discourse to produce the phenomena that it regulates and constrains’ (p. 2). She (1990) contends that gender identity should be seen as non-essentialist and fluid, as the way we behave at different times and in different situations, rather than who we are. By de-constructing the way we think about gender, we might move closer to a new equality where individuals are not required to construct themselves as either masculine or feminine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1012690211432661">Butler, 1990</xref>). In discussing the discursive production of the category ‘women’, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1012690211432661">Butler (1990)</xref> explains that:<disp-quote>
<p>. . . the action of gender requires a performance that is <italic>repeated</italic>. This repetition is at once a reenactment and re-experiencing of a set of meanings already socially established; and it is the mundane and ritualized form of their legitimation. (p. 140)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Through the reproduction of the actions discursively associated to the category ‘women’, a woman’s femaleness is ‘established, instituted, circulated and confirmed’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1012690211432661">Butler, 1991</xref>: 18). Also, because identity involves repeated performance, it is unstable, open to challenge and resistance. Taking Butler’s notion further, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1012690211432661">Daniels (2009)</xref> calls for recognition and a celebration of the polygendered nature of individuals (especially girls and women). She claims that we are all, to some extent polygendered, meaning that we embody ‘a mix of those characteristics, interests, behaviours and appearances that have been traditionally used to sort females and males into exclusive categories called feminine and masculine’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1012690211432661">Daniels, 2009</xref>: 1–2). She encourages people to grant others (and ourselves) the ability to express themselves (and ourselves) and self-identify in whatever ways they (we) feel comfortable in terms of masculinity and femininity. Polygenderedness is thus about surpassing the binary discursive constructions that limit how males and females should act out their gender.</p>
<p>The Skirtboarders exemplify ‘polygenderedness’ regularly in photos, videos and the ways in which they write about themselves on their blog. For instance, in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1012690211432661">Figure 4</xref>, the image of the skateboarder could be a woman or a man. There is no accompanying caption specifying that the skateboarder is, indeed, a woman. What is certain, though, is that the person is a skateboarder. Reading and analyzing this photo is complex and depends on the viewer’s perspective. For example some viewers might see the skateboarder in the photo as a man, while others might see a woman. Still others might not read any gender in this photograph (a gender-neutral athlete) but assume that the subject is a man since skateboarding culture is still controlled by men (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1012690211432661">Beal and Wilson, 2004</xref>). The complex reading of the Skirtboarders’ photos reflects <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1012690211432661">Fiske’s (1989)</xref> argument that all media texts are polysemic (‘producerly’) – they contain both dominant messages and ‘opportunities to speak against them’ (p. 23). The Skirtboarders’ photos are polysemic, but since the Skirtboarders rarely post photos of men, viewers must ultimately accept that the skateboarder shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1012690211432661">Figure 4</xref> is a woman. Arguably, though, the complexity in reaching a conclusion about whether the skateboarder in this photo is male or female suggests that this photo (re)presents a polygendered (or gender neutral) skateboarder. However, the Skirtboarders do not post photos like this one (or <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1012690211432661">Figure 1</xref>, which is comparable) because they want to <italic>be</italic> men. They do not judge themselves against male skateboarders at any point on their blog. They rarely write about men’s skateboarding and do not post any pictures or videos of men skateboarding. In one regard, however, the Skirtboarders seem to reproduce dominant discourses about men being the more skilled athletes. In a post about a skateboarding competition in Sweden, Julie states that the best 30 skaters in Sweden are men (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1012690211432661">Levesque, 2009</xref>). For the most part, though, they do not even acknowledge that men skateboard and they certainly do not compare themselves to men in any way, shape or form.</p>

<p>In addition to the general sense that the Skirtboarders do not explicitly identify crew members’ genders in their blog, they rarely establish heterosexuality either. This challenges Jennifer <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1012690211432661">Hargreaves’s (1994)</xref> suggestion that the potential of alternative (re)presentations that differ from those created by and circulated through mainstream media is limited by ‘a powerful heterosexual code’ (pp. 165–166). Occasional textual or photographic references are made to one of the crew members’ husbands or boyfriends, especially in posts about Skirtboarder social events (e.g. Christmas dinner) attended by family. However, for the most part, they do not write about or advertise (in photos or videos) their romantic relationships with men or women. Discursive constructions of heterosexuality occur when they write about or show crew members with their babies. For example, in one post, the following was written by Mathilde: ‘La vita è bella in the Poulin-Filion family! Rébecca, her boyfriend Fred and her daughter Maëlle have been living in Sardinia (Italy) for a few months now’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-1012690211432661">Pigeon, 2007a</xref>). Interestingly, this type of description usually appeared when the husbands or boyfriends accompanied the Skirtboarders on skateboarding trips to care for their baby (also occasionally (re)presented). Therefore, the men stood on the sidelines, so to speak. In some cases, a Skirtboarder was (re)presented with her baby and no mention was made of her partner. In these instances, the lack of a clear link between motherhood and heterosexuality raises the possibility that the Skirtboarder’s baby has only one parent or two mothers (who may or may not be another Skirtboarder). For the most part, they do not talk about or show images of romantic relationships with men or women, which suggests that they rarely establish heterosexuality.</p>
<p>The Skirtboarders also rarely emphasize female stereotypes, compare themselves with men’s performances or post-ambivalent materials, all techniques found in mainstream media (re)presentations of sportswomen. In fact, they often challenge female stereotypes in the blog. For example, in videos they spit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-1012690211432661">Pigeon, 2007b</xref>) and fart (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1012690211432661">Julien, 2009</xref>) while taking a break from skateboarding. Blog users and other Skirtboarders have commented on these videos sarcastically, such as ‘very elegant anne-so’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr113-1012690211432661">Yannick, 2007</xref>, regarding Anne-Sophie’s spitting) or in astonishment, such as ‘An-So it’s not possible that such a stench can come out of something as girly as you [our translation]’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1012690211432661">Frederique, 2009</xref>, regarding Anne-Sophie’s farting). In addition to challenging female stereotypes in videos, they frequently flaunt their opposition to characteristics and behaviors stereotypically associated with femininity (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-1012690211432661">Figure 5</xref>).</p>

<p>In some (albeit fewer) photographs, the Skirtboarders are shown with long hair, long painted nails, jewelry (earrings) and tight jeans, which can be read as an emphasis on femininity. In fact, Mathilde is rarely seen in photos without dangling earrings (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-1012690211432661">Figure 6</xref>). However, in this same photo, Mathilde is wearing a loose t-shirt, has no bra straps showing and is on a skateboard. These latter visual cues may lead some users of the blog to think that Mathilde is a male skateboarder with dreadlocks rather than a woman with long hair. This contradiction suggests that sportswomen can both resist dominant discourses and reproduce them at the same time. Several sport scholars (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1012690211432661">Chapman, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1012690211432661">Guthrie and Castelnuovo, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1012690211432661">Johns and Johns, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-1012690211432661">Markula, 2003</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-1012690211432661">2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr90-1012690211432661">Shogan, 1999</xref>) have come to similar conclusions about sportswomen’s interactions with dominant discourses. However, in the Skirtboarders’ case, the circulation of paradoxical discourses in which young women embrace various femininities (including sexualized versions), and at the same time reject binaries (male/female), reflects a third-wave feminist sensibility. Indeed, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr99-1012690211432661">Thorpe (2008)</xref> notes that whereas second-wave feminist researchers have argued that the sexualization of female athletes reduces women to docile bodies for the consumption of the male gaze, young women today often applaud sports media (re)presentations of feminine physical attractiveness and do not view ‘feminine’ and ‘sporting’ as mutually exclusive identities, but rather as inextricably intertwined.</p>

<p>Additionally, some photos depict the Skirtboarders wearing bikinis and striking poses that could be read as (harmfully) stereotypically feminine. However, the ‘reading’ of these photographs can vary. Some users might read the photo of Margaux and Anne-Sophie posing in bikinis with a hose (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-1012690211432661">Figure 7</xref>) as a mockery stereotypical feminine soft-pornography photos where women hose themselves off to appeal to the male gaze (see for instance <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.thedirtysnatch.com/tag/wenatchee/page/10/">http://www.thedirtysnatch.com/tag/wenatchee/page/10/</ext-link>). Users’ readings of the Skirtboarders as ‘mocking’ typical (re)presentations of femininity rather than unreflectively reproducing them might derive from the context in which the photos appear. They form part of blog posts in which the Skirtboarders challenge stereotypes of sportswomen in other ways (for example, skateboarding, eating large amounts of food with their hands and making faces while eating, etc.).</p>

<p>The discourses that frame these images can be difficult to interpret and may be read in numerous ways depending on the reader’s frame. The varied ‘reading’ of the photographs suggests that the Skirtboarders self-representations have a certain ‘polygenderedness’ (or gender neutrality in some cases) about them and whether these images challenge or reproduce dominant discourses is debatable. Furthermore, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1012690211432661">Foucault (1969)</xref> suggests that some statements belong to more than one discourse. This could be the case here. However, we would stress that the majority of the blog photos are action shots of the Skirtboarders skateboarding (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-1012690211432661">Figure 8</xref>) rather than pictures of the women off the field of play, which is atypical of mainstream media and alternative coverage of sportswomen and confirms that these women (re)present themselves as skateboarders.</p>

<title>Reproduction of dominant discourses</title>
<p>While the Skirtboarders offer alternatives to part(s) of dominant discourses, they do repeat ‘truths’ about femininity that are prevalent in media (re)presentation of sportswomen. This discursive contradiction points to the inconsistent positions confronting sportswomen (especially ‘stealth feminists’). When they reflexively try to construct themselves on the Internet, some of the discourses they adopt can be paradoxical; this confirms how difficult it is for the Skirtboarders to fully resist dominant discourses of femininity that (hetero)sexualize and trivialize sportswomen’s accomplishments. This is especially true since these skateboarding women do not claim to be producing a blog to ‘talk back’ to existing sport media in the way other women post YouTube videos to ‘state the truth’ and contest dominant discourses of obesity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-1012690211432661">MacKay and Dallaire, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>The Skirtboarders rarely juxtapose their own descriptions or images with others that undermine or trivialize their crew members’ success. Some photos (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-1012690211432661">Figure 9</xref>) show some members of the crew in bikinis while others are wearing pants and a t-shirt. This photo can be read as ambivalent – the women are trying to appear like athletes with their skateboards but, at the same time, expose their bodies for other skateboarders and/or blog users to see. However, the photo can also be read as resisting female stereotypes, since the bikini-clad women are wearing skateboarding shoes and fashion sunglasses and hats characteristic of skateboarding culture, and are posing at the top of a skateboarding ramp. Furthermore, these ‘ambivalent’ photos (such as <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-1012690211432661">Figure 7</xref>) were taken at their final skateboarding session in Montreal before leaving on a trip to Mexico. Therefore, these photos are arguably action shots or depictions of skateboarding lifestyle activities leading up to travel to hot climates where it might make sense to skateboard in a bikini.</p>

<title>Mainstream and alternative media (re)presentations on <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://Skirtboarders.com">Skirtboarders.com</ext-link></title>
<p>Although the Skirtboarders rarely (re)present themselves in ambivalent ways on their blog, they have been (re)presented frequently in the mainstream and alternative media (including skateboarding media) as a result of their blog. The Skirtboarders include all mainstream and alternative media (re)presentations of themselves on their blog, and these (re)presentations convey significant ambivalence. For example, in a Crux magazine article, Margaux Walker is photographed in skateboarding shoes and with a skateboard, but is heavily made-up, bejeweled and definitely not in skateboarding action (see <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.skirtboarders.com/blog/crux-magazine-margaux-walker/">http://www.skirtboarders.com/blog/crux-magazine-margaux-walker/</ext-link>). Most of the story talks about Margaux’s skateboarding and the Skirtboarders, but includes not one photo of her actually skateboarding. This is not surprising given the findings of previous research. However, it is interesting because the Skirtboarders do not (re)present themselves in such ways at any point on their blog. It is also remarkable that the Skirtboarders rarely comment on these (re)presentations on the blog (e.g. they rarely express their approval or disapproval of how they are (re)presented by others).</p>
<p>Admittedly, discursive techniques commonly used in sports media coverage to establish gender as the dominant frame for differentiating between athletes did emerge in the blog posts. For example, the Skirtboarders wrote about or showed (in photos and videos) non-sports related aspects of their lives. Posts about partying were noted, along with posts about travelling (although always associated with skateboarding). However, the posts were all related to the Skirtboarders skateboarding <italic>lifestyle.</italic> Therefore, one could argue that these posts were not, in fact, reproducing discourses in mainstream media that attempt to trivialize sportswomen’s performances, but rather elements that cannot be separated from the sport itself. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr103-1012690211432661">Wheaton (2004a)</xref> suggests that participants in ‘lifestyle sports’ such as skateboarding describe their activity as a way of life that extends beyond sport participation only. ‘Participants [seek] out a lifestyle that [is] distinctive, and that [gives] them a particular and exclusive social identity’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr103-1012690211432661">Wheaton, 2004a</xref>: 4). Posts that were not explicitly about skateboarding as an activity arguably had something to do with this skateboarding lifestyle ‘identity’.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>Although the micro-level forms of resistance that appeared in the Skirtboarders’ blog are unlikely to support a significant change in the current discursive regime that dominates (re)presentations of sportswomen (and skateboarding women) in mainstream media, the Skirtboarders’ new (and less sexist) (re)presentation may give reason for some optimism, despite the paradoxical character of the blog. Even though the Skirtboarders generally resist the dominant discourses of femininity circulating in mainstream and alternative media (re)presentations through their different (and potentially ‘polygendered’ [or gender neutral]) self (re)presentations, the analysis revealed ambivalence in some of their photos (for example, the bikini photos) and in their links to mainstream media (re)presentations of themselves. This is not abnormal – discourses are not always coherent. Skirtboarders do not explicitly claim to have a political agenda on the blog, yet they nonetheless make a political statement through the discourses they circulate. Therefore, without professing to be feminists, the Skirtboarders produce, circulate and use feminist materials to expand girls’ and women’s space in the Internet skateboarding landscape. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1012690211432661">Hardin et al. (2005)</xref> suggest that the emergence of female-only sports media texts ‘signals an emergent discourse about women and sport that has the potential to make ‘‘gender trouble’’ in ways that will chip away at male hegemony’ (p. 115).</p>
<p>Perhaps some of the distinctive features of lifestyle sports, including skateboarding, allow the Skirtboarders to (re)present themselves through a ‘polygendered’ lens. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr103-1012690211432661">Wheaton (2004a)</xref> interrogates whether lifestyle sports offer more egalitarian and empowering gender identities than other sports, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1012690211432661">Beal (1992)</xref> draws an important comparison between skateboarding techniques and traditionally feminine behavior. Furthermore, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1012690211432661">Beal and Wilson (2004)</xref> suggest that skateboarders in general display an ambivalent attitude towards the commercialization and (re)presentation of their lifestyle in the mainstream media, and often attempt to distinguish themselves from the mainstream in order to preserve authenticity in their communities.</p>
<p>This project has generated a deeper understanding of the new ways in which women are acting out their gender identities through new media texts. The Skirtboarders illustrate how young women can transform their own experiences and actively engage in the technological decision-making processes that affect the construction of their subjectivities. Although the Skirtboarders’ (re)presentations appear as ‘potential beginnings of an altered subjectivity, an altered identity’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1012690211432661">Holland et al., 1998</xref>: 18), the women did not explicitly attach political meaning to these altered identities in their blog. This analysis supports <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1012690211432661">Kelly et al.’s (2006)</xref> findings on what girls are leaning online about femininity; while challenging dominant discourses of femininity at the collective level, young women are not necessarily attaching themselves to feminist and other oppositional discourses. Therefore, the Skirtboarders might be enacting a third-wave feminist politic that suggests an awareness of gender inequity in mainstream and alternative (skateboarding) media and a desire to (re)present themselves differently without claiming to be feminists.</p>
