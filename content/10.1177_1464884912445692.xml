<p>Most news organizations have begun to realize opportunities on the Web. Many are experimenting with blogs and news groups. And a few are leveraging social media to offer greater levels of interaction with their audiences than ever. But with the rapid pace of change and new platforms and competitors launching, little attention has been placed on standards of excellence. We seem to be in a trial-and-error mode, and, in most cases, errors are minor and can be rectified with a quick correction or an apology. It’s an exciting time of innovation. But some situations have occurred that have not been easily satisfied or wished away, costing reputations and jobs in the process, and doing a disservice to audiences and the field of journalism.</p>
<p>In David A. Craig’s <italic>Excellence in Online Journalism: Exploring Current Practices in an Evolving Environment</italic>, we are introduced to a framework for assessing excellence, using best practices gleaned from interviews with more than 30 professionals. Craig introduces four developing standards of excellence: speed and accuracy with depth in breaking news; comprehensiveness in content; open-endedness in story development; and the centrality of conversation. He does this through an ethical lens, focusing on the theory of Notre Dame philosopher <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1464884912445692">Alasdair MacIntyre (2007)</xref>, linking excellence in journalism as it relates to the practice of the profession.</p>
<p>A practice, according to MacIntyre, is the work of a social system, not of an individual, and has <italic>telos</italic> or goals, as well as internal goods (knowledge, fostering community), standards of excellence (speed and accuracy), virtues (perseverance, courage and honesty) and external goods and institutions (profit, status, power, companies). Craig is careful to remind us that many of the challenges of online journalism are not new. Speed and accuracy have always been in conflict, and there are examples in which newspapers got the story wrong in seeking a scoop (e.g. the ‘Dewey Defeats Truman’ headline in 1948). But the scale to which speed affects accuracy and the ramifications of mistakes can be exponentially magnified in a digital media environment.</p>
<p>Comprehensiveness in content refers to the wide range of ways a story can be told. Beyond text, photos and video, graphics can become interactive and engage databases. Source information can be published or synthesized. Links can provide endless access to background information and archives. And each of these methods can vary in style and voice depending on the medium or publication. A new layer of judgment is necessary to determine the best way a story should be told, and Craig offers a fair assessment of the strengths and weaknesses of each.</p>
<p>When a story ends is in question as well. Stories can develop over time and materials can remain online indefinitely as resource material or historical accounts. Public contributions, like CNN’s iReports, can add a new depth and interest to stories. But this requires balancing respect for the public as valid contributors with the resources necessary to assemble and curate these items.</p>
<p>Beyond providing eyewitness accounts and personal photos and videos, the public is frequently participating in online dialogues about news events and information, either on professional news sites or through their own blogs, Facebook profiles, on Twitter or other platforms. Craig reminds us that fostering conversation is central to the earliest mission of American journalism. With philosophical roots in the arguments of John Milton and John Stuart Mill, the ideal of an open marketplace of ideas was never actually achieved due to the limitations of the media. However, in many recent cases, the work of the masses through online media has been used to overthrow governments (e.g. as witnessed in the Arab Spring revolutions) and to communicate a dissatisfaction with proposed legislation (e.g. the success of online blackouts in protest of SOPA). Bringing readers into the dialogue has not been an easy transition, but many news organizations are finding ways to successfully engage the public, while retaining standards of excellence.</p>
<p>The most valuable feature of the book is the presentation of numerous case studies. From the discussion of the photo tweeted by a ferry passenger of the plane that landed in the Hudson River in 2009, to the ways that the <italic>Washington Post</italic> covered the inauguration of Barack Obama, to ways that the <italic>Austin American-Statesman</italic> used social media to cover the Fort Hood shooting, the examples in the book represent a broad range of organizations and situations that have exercised excellence in engaging online tools.</p>
<p>Craig’s final takeaway is that students hoping to work in journalism must be prepared to operate in an environment that’s not ‘either-or’ in regard to a professional/amateur delineation, but to participate as ‘both-and’, in what is more of a range of journalistic behaviors than a strict dichotomy. There is room for all voices as long as consistently applied standards of ethics and excellence drive the practice of professional journalism.</p>
