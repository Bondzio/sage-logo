<title>1. Introduction</title>
<p>In the UK, as may be expected in a developed country, the news media comprise the internet, radio and television as well as newspapers. Newspapers in the UK are socially diverse: a “tabloid” newspaper is traditionally one printed in a smaller format than the larger “broadsheets.” This distinction also describes a difference in editorial emphasis. “Tabloids” (or “red tops”) tend to prioritise celebrity and sports stories, whereas “broadsheets” (often read by professionals) tend to concentrate on current affairs. In recent years many traditional “broadsheets” have actually adopted the smaller format, but the editorial distinction remains. Newspaper titles in the UK are numerous, and still sell in large numbers. There are 12 national daily newspaper titles in the UK and the title with the largest circulation is <italic>The Sun</italic>, a right-of-centre “tabloid” newspaper which averaged 2,957,680 copies sold per day in April 2009. The biggest selling “broadsheet” is the <italic>Daily Telegraph</italic> (817,692/day in April 2009). Altogether, the top ten biggest selling national newspapers sold an average of 10,405,398 copies per day in April 2009 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0963662511401782">ABC, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>The media is an important public source of information on nutrition and health (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0963662511401782">Fernandez-Celemin and Jung, 2006</xref>). The primary goal of broadcasters and publishers is to entertain and inform. Media coverage regarding food and health is determined by a variety of factors including novelty, controversy and personal interest. The reporting of food related risk (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0963662511401782">Carslaw, 2008</xref>) often attracts disproportionate publicity in relation to actual risk and has been reviewed elsewhere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0963662511401782">Forsyth, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0963662511401782">Harrabin et al., 2003</xref>). As far as can be ascertained, there has been no systematic evaluation of dietary health claims in the media.</p>
<p>Previous research on media reporting of health claims has mainly focused on pharmaceuticals. A quantitative analysis of all media coverage for the drug trastuzumab (Herceptin) from 1998 to 2006 in the UK found that it was characterised by uncritically positive reporting, and three newspaper articles went so far as to claim that this chemotherapy agent has no side effects at all (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0963662511401782">Wilson et al., 2008</xref>). A survey of 500 stories making claims about health care products or procedures over 22 months in the USA found that only 28% adequately covered the benefits and 33% the hazards of the treatment, only 35% were rated as satisfactory for discussing methodology and quality of evidence, and only 38% satisfactorily put the intervention into the context of existing alternatives (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0963662511401782">Schwitzer, 2008</xref>). Similar findings have been reported by equivalent surveys in Canada (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0963662511401782">Cassels et al., 2003</xref>) and Australia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0963662511401782">Smith et al., 2005</xref>). The media can have a significant influence over health risk behaviour decisions made by the public (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0963662511401782">Chapman et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0963662511401782">NHS Information Centre, 2009</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0963662511401782">Grilli et al. (2002)</xref> found that favourable publicity was associated with greater use, and unfavourable coverage with lower use. Similarly, “disease awareness campaigns” funded by the pharmaceutical industry in mainstream media have been shown to increase prescription of the sponsor’s medication for the condition being advertised (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0963662511401782">’t Jong et al., 2004</xref>). We hypothesised that the evidence base for dietary health claims may be subject to similar biases. It has been proposed that dietary advice to the public should be based on evidence that is either convincing or probable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0963662511401782">Smit et al., 2009</xref>). The present study therefore set out to evaluate the evidence base for dietary health claims reported in UK newspapers.</p>

<title>2. Methodology</title>
<sec id="section8-0963662511401782">
<title>Sample</title>
<p>The ten top selling UK-wide newspapers in the UK were identified from published circulation figures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0963662511401782">ABC, 2009</xref>). One week in 2008 (2–8 November) was randomly selected and hard copies of all newspapers were obtained and perused.</p>
<p>Articles, which could be features, news reports or comment pieces relating to nutrition, in the main body or in any additional supplements, were identified. Examples of article titles include: “Slimming news” and “Diet that fights kidney disease.” The criterion for inclusion was that: the article had to make a “health claim” about a food or drink which could be interpreted by the reader as advice. A health claim is defined as a “claim that states, suggests or implies that a relationship exists between a food category, a food or one of its constituents and health” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0963662511401782">EC Regulation, 2006</xref>). For example, “red wine causes breast cancer” would constitute a dietary health claim (hereafter referred to as a “claim”) in the same way as “don’t drink red wine – it causes breast cancer” would. However, “oranges contain vitamin C” would not constitute a claim unless a claim about the effect of the vitamin C was made, for example “oranges contain vitamin C which prevents a cold.” Articles or claims regarding dietary supplements were excluded from the study since these were not considered to form part of a diet. If the same claim was made more than once within the same article, it was counted as a single claim; different claims found within an article were treated as individual claims, and similar claims found within different articles or different newspapers were also treated as individual claims.</p>
<p>The dimensions of identified articles were taken to calculate the area covered. This included any corresponding images associated with the article.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-0963662511401782">
<title>Measures</title>
<p>The claims identified were researched using NCBI Entrez PubMed (available online: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/</ext-link>). Key terms were determined for each claim and searches were then conducted to identify the evidence for the claim. If an article provided evidence to support its claim, this was further investigated by searching for the original research and checking the accuracy of the reporting of the findings. In addition reference was made to recent reports that systematically reviewed relationships between food and health (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0963662511401782">WCRF/AICR, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0963662511401782">WHO, 2003</xref>). The evidence for the claim was graded using two grading systems, the Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network (SIGN) grading system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0963662511401782">Harbour and Miller, 2001</xref>), and the World Cancer Research Fund’s (WCRF) scale (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0963662511401782">WCRF, 1997</xref>). These are two of the most prominent systems for grading scientific evidence, balancing the conflicting requirements of ease of use with rigour. The SIGN scale has more categories and is more demanding in its requirements for higher grades of evidence than the WCRF scale. Each provides a means to discriminate between different study designs and quality. However, neither is completely error-free and they should be considered to give more of an indication of relative evidence quality rather than a definitive declaration. For example, the appraiser must decide on risk of bias, confounding or a chance result. However, taken together, these tools represent robust and widely recognised measures of relative evidence quality.</p>
<p>Where it was impossible to grade a claim, the evidence was labelled as “unclassifiable.” The initial identification, collation and analysis of articles were carried out primarily by the first author. The conclusions were then cross-checked by the senior author who is an expert in nutrition.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-0963662511401782">
<title>Analysis</title>
<p>The number of claims graded to each level of evidential support was compared by day of the week of publication, newspaper title, and whether the claim was published in a “broadsheet” (the <italic>Telegraph</italic>, <italic>Times</italic> and <italic>Guardian/Observer</italic>) or “tabloid” (the <italic>Mirror</italic>, <italic>Mail</italic>, <italic>Express</italic>, <italic>Star</italic> and <italic>Sun/News of the World</italic>) title.</p>
<p>Additionally we tested for relationships between level of evidential support and the size of each article. Statistical tests were Fisher’s exact tests, χ<sup>2</sup> tests and non-parametric tests for trend where appropriate. The two grading systems were compared using Spearman’s rank correlation.</p>

Fewer articles and claims appeared on Thursday and Friday than other days (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0963662511401782">Figure 1</xref>).

<p>Using the SIGN evidence grading system (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0963662511401782">Table 1</xref>), 72 claims (65%) were found to rank at level 4 i.e. the claim was based upon expert opinion or lower grade evidence (see Discussion). If an acceptable basis in evidence for setting dietary guidelines is defined as a grading of 1 or 2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0963662511401782">Smit et al., 2009</xref>), 30 claims (27%) fall into this category. Only 12 claims (11%) fell in the highest quality category. There was a close relationship between ratings of quality on the two datasets (Spearman’s ρ = 0.77, <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.00005). Using the WCRF grading system similar results were found: 69 claims (62%) were rated to have an insufficient evidence base. Seventeen claims (15%) were based on convincing evidence and 24 claims (22%) fell into the combined middle probable/possible evidence categories.</p>

<title>4. Discussion</title>
<p>The United Kingdom is typical of many developed countries: there is high literacy, much of the population’s daily information is obtained via the mass media, and obesity represents an unprecedented public health emergency which is best understood as a dietary problem of the whole population. In this context, it might be expected that dietary advice dispensed by newspapers would reflect the seriousness of the situation, with simple advice to eat appropriate foods in appropriate quantities incorporated into articles with good evidence supporting any specific claims. This is not what we found. The results indicated that most claims made in UK newspapers during the week studied had no credible scientific basis. It is worthwhile considering why such misreporting occurs. Newspaper journalists commonly source news from individuals and organisations seeking to raise awareness of a single issue or event. To this end, many press releases are produced by public interest groups, trade bodies, public relations companies working for industry, government departments, universities, journals and charities to broadcast their respective views and advice, and these are often reproduced uncritically. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0963662511401782">Kitzinger (1999)</xref> described the complexity of the situation and concluded that there are many separate problems of the reporting of risks in the media, that these were under-researched, that this should be remedied, and that caution should be exercised in the construction of any general theory of risk in the media. Food risks were investigated by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0963662511401782">Lupton (2004)</xref>, who examined food risks in the Sydney press and found that there was an emphasis on stories focusing on the links between poor diet and obesity, as well as a tendency for the press to highlight personal responsibility for health control through diet. Whilst encouraging personal responsibility may not be regarded as detrimental, it relies upon clear public understanding of current dietary advice, preferably based on systematic reviews of the scientific evidence.</p>
<p>It has been demonstrated that incongruent claims may contribute to public confusion regarding authoritative dietary advice. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0963662511401782">Lupton and Chapman (1995)</xref> showed that in focus groups of 49 Australian residents discussing public response to a cholesterol controversy, a strategy of following an “everything in moderation approach” was generally adopted in cases of confusion about dietary advice, regardless of official advice. This was recently supported by a major survey by the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0963662511401782">WCRF (2009)</xref> of 2,404 UK residents, which reported that 52% of respondents believed that scientists are “always changing their minds” about healthy living advice and 27% of all respondents said that because health advice always seems to be changing, the best approach is to “ignore it all and eat what you want.” Thus misreporting by the media may be causing preventable harm to the population.</p>
<p>The adequate communication of risk to the public remains problematic. There is a “knowledge gap” propagated by a distorted public perception of risk (where perceived food risk is often inversely associated with actual risk) and a reluctance to accept scientific uncertainty and therefore that safety is relative (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0963662511401782">Sanders and Bazalgette, 1991</xref>). Additionally, there is a “trust gap,” associated with incidents such as the 2008 melamine crisis in China, where melamine was added to formula milk with considerable health consequences (50,000 were hospitalised) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0963662511401782">Guan et al., 2009</xref>). Such events can spark public outrage and dread and could be related to a lack of public confidence in the regulatory systems for food safety as well as conspiracy beliefs. Notably, public risk communication problems are self-amplifying since they lead to greater public interest in food safety and thus increased media interest.</p>
<p>What steps could be taken to improve the veracity of newspaper reporting? Various strategies have already been attempted in this area: the Royal Statistical Society gives training programmes on interpreting scientific evidence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0963662511401782">RSS, 2010a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0963662511401782">b</xref>) and, in line with a recommendation of a recent government report, has just appointed a national coordinator for science journalism training (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0963662511401782">DBIS, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0963662511401782">RSS, 2010c</xref>). Another option is to improve newspaper literacy in relation to health. Trials of media literacy programmes in young women facilitating critical appraisal of portrayals of the female body in mainstream media have been shown to reduce eating disorder risk factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0963662511401782">Ridolfi and Vander Wal, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0963662511401782">Wade et al., 2003</xref>). Since the science of health claims is of interest to the general public, relevant to health risk behaviour, and an area where the public are often misled, then critiquing misleading coverage may be an appropriate subject for school-age education, and an appropriate target for health promotion activity.</p>
<sec id="section16-0963662511401782">
<title>Limitations</title>
<p>We investigated only one randomly selected week of claims, and though this week generated enough claims for the effect of sampling variation to be small, we do not know whether this week was typical. However, the week of our study was not one of the weeks of the year when atypical coverage might be expected, especially on the topic of food, such as Christmas or Easter. There are reasons to suppose that it was not a typical week because that was the week of Barack Obama’s election victory in the US and Lewis Hamilton’s success in the Formula 1 World Championship. These large stories may have displaced some nutrition articles. We note that there was a (small but statistically significant) positive relationship between the amount of space given to a claim and its evidential support (non-parametric test for trend Z = 2.62, P = 0.01). This would mean that in a week of a special event when space might be particularly at a premium, longer articles containing dietary health claims (which are expected to be of higher quality) may be selectively not published, potentially affecting the overall measured quality of our sample. However, even the claims given the greatest space were still likely to be poorly evidenced (upper quartile for area of claim, 52% poorly evidenced, lower quartile 88% poorly evidenced). Therefore, even if the week of our study was grossly atypical we would not expect a study of a typical week to find no problem of inadequately evidenced dietary health claims being reported as fact in newspapers.</p>
<p>PubMed was the only electronic database used to search for studies, which could have resulted in some studies being missed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0963662511401782">Avenell et al., 2001</xref>). A further weakness is that we were not blinded to the origin of the particular claim.</p>
<p>Newspapers were selected for study because, unlike other media such as television, radio and the internet, newspapers are published irreversibly, in a form easily compiled and with readily available circulation figures, allowing us to select the most popular titles. We acknowledge we may have missed some claims made during that week using this approach, but feel that this represents a good use of the resources we had available.</p>
<p>With regards to claims graded as “expert opinion” using the SIGN grading system, this was a broad indicative category encompassing claims for which the only evidence that could be found was the opinion of “experts” (self defined or otherwise). Clearly this category covered a wide range of levels of expertise, however if “experts’ claims” were found to be substantiated by higher quality evidence the grade of the claim was increased accordingly. Since this category was the lowest category detailed by the SIGN grading system, claims based upon other low quality evidence such as biological hypothesis, laboratory experimental data or in some cases no evidence at all were also allocated to this grading.</p>

<sec id="section17-0963662511401782">
<title>Recommendations for future research</title>
<p>Developments of this study could include improvements in methodology and size, the testing of specific generated hypotheses and expansion into related areas. Methodological improvements could include asking experts to independently assess the evidence base for each claim while blinded to the source of each claim, increasing the size of the study by increasing the duration of the sampling period and/or the number of titles examined. Other areas to be investigated include annual fluctuation, trends over time, the impact of major news items and investigation of any systematic distortions in newspaper claims, as has recently been shown in an academic setting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0963662511401782">Greenberg, 2009</xref>). Furthermore, the approach of systematically examining claims made in the mass media could be broadened to include non-dietary health claims, and be expanded beyond newspapers to other media outlets.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section18-0963662511401782">
<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>In our one week sample most dietary health claims reported in UK newspapers have an insufficient evidence base to justify the claims made.</p>
