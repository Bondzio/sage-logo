<p>Stephanie Carvin’s <italic>Prisoners of America’s Wars</italic> is an important book on an understudied subject – the treatment of persons captured by America’s armed forces in the course of military operations – from (to the knowledge of this reviewer) a heretofore unexplored ‘political’ angle. Stating ‘the law cannot and should not be left to lawyers alone’ (p. 10), Carvin approaches this subject as a phenomenon bringing together elements of international relations, domestic politics, and the exercise of military power by a democracy. Not just any democracy, however: Carvin delves into America’s view of its own unique purpose and destiny. Her analysis of how these elements intertwine, and how this conditions American policymaking and ways of fighting wars, provides an important and valuable perspective on a complex subject.</p>
<p>Through historical analysis, Carvin traces how the above factors condition American treatment of persons captured during military operations (importantly, this is not limited to ‘prisoners of war’). This dual approach – historical in presentation of narrative, political in terms of its analysis of each armed conflict – is important for several reasons that commend this book to analysts and scholars of international law or geopolitics. Starting with the treatment of prisoners in pre-Revolutionary War conflicts, and covering a wide range of past American military actions (to include both sides’ treatment of prisoners in conflicts involving Native Americans), Carvin builds a case that culture and politics affected the American interpretation of the laws of war from the days of the colonies. The dual approach also provides an important perspective on the evolution of traditions, norms, and treaty texts into the law of war. The modern law of war developed through 19th- and 20th-century armed conflicts, and is in the process of being re-shaped in the post-9/11 era. By going beyond diplomatic conferences in Geneva and The Hague to include efforts by soldiers and policymakers to understand and implement the law of war, Carvin drives home the importance of studying myriad influences on the development of international law.</p>
<p>The historical-political approach also provides a strong foundation for the book’s treatment of issues likely foremost in the mind of the contemporary reader: Abu Ghraib and Guantanamo Bay. Carvin explains that the US military experienced an internal revolution with regard to understanding and implementation of the law of war following Vietnam. This war left many American military lawyers convinced that better education of, and appreciation for, the law of war was necessary across all ranks. These efforts bore fruit a generation later during the first Gulf War, described by General Schwarzkopf as ‘the most legalist war’ in American history (p. 104).</p>
<p>However, Carvin is able to draw a stark contrast between the treatment of prisoners in the first and second Gulf Wars. While acknowledging important differences between the two – there was no insurgency during Gulf War I, for example – Carvin also argues that US troops were left operating in a legal vacuum in the second conflict. The law of war was not immune from military or policy developments; indeed, disputes over international law and its implementation (both within the United States and between Washington and foreign capitals) became a central feature of the ‘war on terror’. Carvin’s book represents a key contribution to the literature addressing these disputes for its insightful analysis of the contrasting views of the Bush administration’s ‘new sovereigntists’ (who argued the United States was not bound by ‘undemocratic’ tenets of international law), and their opponents in the United States and abroad (who countered that international law provides geopolitical ‘rules of the road’). Carvin provides a balanced assessment of the perspectives of both sides, but contends the former erred in dismissing international law without putting an alternative concept of law or practice in its place. This, she argues, left American troops confronting complex questions of law in Afghanistan and Iraq without effective guidance from Washington, and was an enabling factor in scandals involving abuse of civilians and detainees by soldiers and members of private military firms.</p>
<p>Carvin’s book closes with a series of challenges to the United States, and the broader international legal community, to re-engage with the laws of war, particularly its provisions regarding treatment of prisoners captured during military operations. These challenges can, and should, provoke debate in the United States and elsewhere. Regardless of one’s perspective on Carvin’s conclusions, however, in providing a work of extensive historic and analytic scope, and by nimbly avoiding the polemics too frequently associated with differing perspectives on the law of war, Carvin’s work stands as an example for other scholars to follow.</p>
