<title>Introduction:</title>
<p>Dyspnea is common in lung cancer and may be partially attributable to increased ventilatory drive due to muscle weakness. The sympathetic component of this pathway might be mitigated by β-blockers.</p>

<sec id="section2-0269216311415454">
<title>Methods:</title>
<p>A retrospective review of new patients with stage III–IV non-small lung cancer or any small cell lung cancer was undertaken to assess the impact of β-blocker use on dyspnea and fatigue.

<sec id="section3-0269216311415454">
<title>Results:</title>
<p>Of 348 patients assessed, 202 met eligibility criteria. The median age was 67, 55.4% were female, 18.8% had chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and 5.9% had active coronary artery disease. Over 60% of patients scored 4/10 or higher on their dyspnea and fatigue scores. While dyspnea and fatigue were moderately associated, no association was found between β-blocker use and either symptom. Recorded dosages of β-blockers were low.

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Advanced lung cancer is accompanied by several disease-related symptoms with debilitating effects, such as dyspnea and fatigue.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0269216311415454">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0269216311415454">2</xref></sup> These symptoms diminish quality of life and the current treatment is inadequate and often induces undesirable side effects.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0269216311415454">2</xref></sup> New interventions are desperately needed by this population.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0269216311415454">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>Dyspnea in lung cancer patients is often multifactorial. It may result directly from the cancer, through airway obstruction, pleural effusion, pericardial effusion, pulmonary embolus, or superior vena cava syndrome. However, many patients experience dyspnea with no identifiable cause.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0269216311415454">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0269216311415454">4</xref></sup> Studies have attributed the dyspnea in these cases to anxiety or co-morbidities, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), asthma, or congestive heart failure, but this fails to address many cases without such co-morbidity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0269216311415454">4</xref></sup> A comprehensive explanation for dyspnea in patients without obvious co-morbidity remains elusive, and an improved understanding of the biological mechanisms of dyspnea and fatigue would help target new interventions. Current approaches used to treat dyspnea operate from a symptomatic rather than functional approach, with opioids currently the most effective pharmacologic agent.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0269216311415454">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0269216311415454">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0269216311415454">5</xref></sup> The mechanism by which they alleviate respiratory distress in unknown, but is thought to involve de-sensitization of central blood gas receptors.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0269216311415454">4</xref></sup> Anxiolytics, such as benzodiazepines, are often used to manage the anxiety brought on by dyspnea.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0269216311415454">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0269216311415454">5</xref></sup> While dyspnea can be managed through such agents, their side effects, as well as the lack of a proper disease model, make their use less than ideal.</p>
<p>Physiological parallels may exist between dyspnea in patients with lung cancer and dyspnea in other chronic diseases, such as heart failure and emphysema. It is known that active muscles signal the central nervous system to increase lung ventilation proportional to their metabolic needs.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0269216311415454">6</xref></sup> The monitors of muscular activation and metabolism, known as ergoreceptors, both drive and are driven by sympathetic nervous system (SNS) activity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0269216311415454">6</xref></sup> Patients with advanced lung cancer frequently suffer from cachexia, a catabolic state known to induce muscle breakdown.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0269216311415454">7</xref></sup> Fatigue and a compromised performance status may also contribute to deconditioning. It is known that in heart failure, weakened or metabolically disadvantaged muscles induce greater ventilatory drive signals for the same amount of work via ergoreceptor feedback.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0269216311415454">6</xref></sup> Similarly, muscle weakness is associated with emphysema, and exercise training can improve dyspnea in some instances.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0269216311415454">8</xref></sup> In addition, since catecholamine levels in patients with cancer have been shown to be elevated, in theory this could exacerbate increased ergoreceptor feedback.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0269216311415454">9</xref></sup> Together the increased ventilatory feedback of weak muscles and elevated catecholamine levels in cancer patients suggest the contribution of SNS signaling to dyspnea in advanced lung cancer patients.</p>
<p>In this model of dyspnea driven by ergoreceptor feedback and SNS activation in patients with cancer, it is reasonable to hypothesize a role for β-adrenergic blockade to counteract the increased ventilatory drive signaling of weakened muscles. Although the concept of using β-blockers to relieve respiratory problems is contradictory to their bronchoconstrictive properties, evidence exists to support their use in other models of chronic dyspnea, such as congestive heart failure, and there is no evidence of harm from cardioselective β-blockers in emphysema.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0269216311415454">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0269216311415454">11</xref></sup> If a relationship between β-blocker use and decreased dyspnea and fatigue was established, it is possible that β-blockers might provide the basis for an effective therapy targeting the underlying mechanisms of dyspnea, rather than simply masking its effects. This study reports on a retrospective review of the association between β-blocker use and patient-reported symptoms of dyspnea and fatigue in patients with newly diagnosed advanced lung cancer.</p>

<title>Methods</title>
<p>This study was approved by the Hamilton Health Sciences Research Ethics Board. A retrospective chart review was conducted of patients with stage III or IV non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) or small cell lung cancer (localized or extensive) seen at the Juravinski Cancer Centre in Hamilton, Ontario, between July 2007 and June 2008. To be eligible, patients needed to have completed an Edmonton Symptom Assessment System (ESAS) score within two weeks of their initial consultation with a medical or radiation oncologist. The ESAS is a patient-completed, validated cancer scoring system implemented in Ontario by Cancer Care Ontario (CCO) in 2007 for completion by lung cancer patients at each clinic visit.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0269216311415454">12</xref></sup> Patients rate the severity for nine common cancer-related symptoms on a scale from 0 to 10, with 10 indicating the ‘worst possible’ symptom. The intent is to encourage dialogue between healthcare workers and patients, leading to increased detection and treatment of the symptoms. In the latter half of 2007, monthly completion rates exceeded 59% for all lung cancer patients in our health region.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0269216311415454">13</xref></sup></p>
<p>Data were abstracted on the ‘breathlessness’ score representing dyspnea and the ‘tiredness’ score representing fatigue from the ESAS completed nearest to and within two weeks of the initial consultation with a medical or radiation oncologist. These data were obtained from CCO’s Interactive Symptom Assessment and Collection Tool database.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0269216311415454">14</xref></sup> No ESAS values are collected prior to consultation at the cancer center and subsequent values were not collected, as results would be influenced by varying cancer treatments. Other data on patient demographics, tumor histology, and β-blocker use, as well as co-morbidities which could affect dyspnea such as coronary artery disease, COPD, and pulmonary emboli were abstracted from an electronic patient database that contained medical and radiation oncology consultation notes. As this was retrospective, the accuracy of co-morbid diagnoses relied upon the clinicians’ histories. Any β-blocker use was recorded based on cardioselectivity, name, dosage, and dosing frequency. Post hoc, patients were divided into two groups: the high-dose group, receiving greater than or equal to half of the maximum recommended daily dose of a given β-blocker, and the low-dose group, receiving less than half. The original indications for β-blocker use in each patient were not available. Hemoglobin scores recorded at the time of consultation or within four weeks of consultation were included. Data abstraction was performed by one author (PC), with clarification of problem cases resolved in consultation with a second author (JRG).</p>
<sec id="section7-0269216311415454">
<title>Sample size</title>
<p>Based on informal review, approximately 20% of lung cancer patients were estimated to be using β–blockers at their first clinical consult. It was also estimated that an effect size of 0.5 standard deviations would be clinically significant.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0269216311415454">15</xref></sup> Thus, a two-sided, two-sample <italic>t</italic>-test would have over 80% power to detect a clinically significant difference of 0.5 standard deviations (absolute value of 1.5 on the 10-point scale) with group sizes of 41 and 164 (205 total patients). Since it was known that roughly 60% of patients completed the ESAS at each visit, and roughly 350 potentially eligible patients are seen yearly for a new consult, it was determined to review all patients seen for initial consultation with a medical or radiation oncologist within one year. The period from July 2007 to June 2008 was selected based on the implementation date of the ESAS.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-0269216311415454">
<title>Statistical methods</title>
<p>Patient characteristics were summarized using descriptive statistics. Patients were classified according to β-blocker use at the time of initial consultation. As the ESAS symptom score is a 10-point score, the breathlessness and tiredness symptom scores for each patient were evaluated in a number of ways. The primary comparison used was the Wilcoxon rank sum test, a non-parametric version of the two-sample <italic>t</italic>-test with symptoms measured as their raw values. Secondary comparisons included univariate and multivariate linear regression, which assumes the symptoms are approximately normally distributed. For the multivariate analysis, a forward stepwise selection procedure was performed to create an optimal model of predictors and β-blocker use was tested after adjusting for variables included in the optimal model. Finally, a Fisher’s exact test was performed, which compared whether the proportion of patients with an ESAS score of 4 or higher (which was a priori defined as a clinically significant symptom score) was different between the two groups. For cohort description, the frequency of patients by symptom severity was presented by grouping patients with symptom scores of 0, 1–3, 4–6, and 7–10.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>There were 348 new patients with lung cancer seen for an initial consultation between July 2007 and June 2008.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Over 60% of patients in this study reported clinically relevant ESAS scores of 4 or higher for both breathlessness and fatigue symptom scales, indicating the severity of these symptoms and importance of better understanding of their causes. Despite the high prevalence of dyspnea amongst patients with lung cancer, it remains poorly addressed by healthcare workers.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0269216311415454">16</xref></sup> Interventions for dyspnea are limited and tend to be administered late in the course of the disease,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0269216311415454">17</xref></sup> with symptoms substantially impairing patient quality of life and causing great distress for caregivers.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0269216311415454">16</xref></sup> Better and earlier treatment is sorely needed.</p>
<p>Although our study did not find a statistically significant association between β-blocker use and altered ESAS scores for dyspnea or fatigue, there are important findings. Consistent with the existing literature, there was an observed association between COPD and dyspnea and fatigue<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0269216311415454">18</xref></sup> and between anemia and fatigue.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0269216311415454">19</xref></sup> A moderate association between dyspnea and fatigue was observed amongst lung cancer patients, as found by others.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0269216311415454">20</xref></sup></p>
<p>It is unclear whether one may cause the other or whether these two symptoms share a common pathophysiology. However, muscle changes associated with cachexia could contribute to both of these symptoms.</p>
<p>Although we did not find a relationship between β-blocker use and dyspnea in this data set, there are possible explanations. If ergoreceptors and sympathetic activity play a role in dyspnea, it is also possible that relatively high doses of β-blockers may be required to interfere with this circuit. Unfortunately, of the 29 patients with β-blocker dose given, 28 had a dose that was less than half of the maximal daily dose. As vital signs are inconsistently recorded in patient charts, we cannot use heart rates to determine whether individual patients were sufficiently beta-blocked. It is known that patients with heart failure are frequently underdosed.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0269216311415454">21</xref></sup> It is thus possible that our results express a finding of insufficient doses rather than an absence of β-blocker effect on dyspnea or fatigue.</p>
<p>Patients were also screened for β-blocker cardioselectivity (β<sub>1</sub> or β<sub>2</sub> antagonist) in order to potentially detect a difference between β-blocker type. While it is conceivable that non-cardioselective β-blockers could negatively impact dyspnea, they were employed in only two of 38 patients. Thus, any negative contribution is likely to be minimal and a comparison between classes was not possible.</p>
<p>Our finding of COPD in 18.8% of patients is similar to other data<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0269216311415454">22</xref></sup> but less than half of the frequency of obstructive defects found by Dudgeon et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0269216311415454">23</xref></sup> when undertaking spirometry in a lung cancer population. Although COPD was still associated with dyspnea and fatigue, it may have been under recognized or underreported in our population, and thus undertreated. This suggests a possible role for screening spirometry in the lung cancer population.</p>
<p>As noted above, exploratory analysis revealed a moderate association between shortness of breath and fatigue as recorded by the ESAS, including amongst patients treated with β-blockers. Intuitively, the association between dyspnea and fatigue is not surprising. However, in patients with heart failure who are receiving β-blockers, dyspnea is improved while exercise capacity is not.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0269216311415454">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0269216311415454">25</xref></sup></p>
<p>The lack of a differential effect in our data set could be consistent not only with the relatively low β-blocker doses employed in our patients, but also with an incomplete relationship between baseline fatigue levels and maximal exercise capacity.</p>
<sec id="section11-0269216311415454">
<title>Limitations</title>
<p>Data quality obtained by a retrospective review of consultation notes is well known to be imperfect, with many patients lacking definitive medication lists, doses, and dosing frequency. Dose and frequency of dosing were absent from the consultation notes for nine of the 38 patients (24%) reported to be taking β-blockers, obscuring the characterization of β-blocker therapy on dyspnea. Patients who ceased taking β-blockers prior to their initial consultation would not have been captured, nor could compliance be assessed. β-blockers themselves may be associated with fatigue and dyspnea in some patients,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0269216311415454">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0269216311415454">27</xref></sup> and so physicians may have been reluctant to initiate or compelled to stop β-blockers in the period prior to our data collection, although this would bias the results in favor of β-blockers. Similarly, we do not account for any antagonism from inhaled beta-adrenergics.</p>
<p>ESAS scores were collected during a time period when the ESAS was newly introduced at the cancer center and only 68% of those in our overall data set completed the ESAS. It is possible the population examined may not be representative of all patients, suggested by the fact that most of our patients were female (55.6%). Lastly, the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status, a reflection of the burden of disease, was inconsistently recorded and could not be considered.</p>
<p>If cachexia and muscle weakness are important contributors to dyspnea, their presence or magnitude may be relatively modest at the time of first consultation at our center. Our study had no way of measuring the presence of these conditions. Similarly, dyspnea is multifactorial. While we attempted to capture co-morbidities, factors directly related to the cancer, such as pleural effusions or lymphangitic carcinomatosi<bold>s</bold>, could have contributed most to dyspnea and fatigue in our population. If weakness, ergoreceptors, and sympathetic activity do contribute to dyspnea and fatigue in a specific subpopulation, we would be unable to discern this in the current data set.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Dyspnea and fatigue confer a significant burden on patients with lung cancer. Despite the possible role ergoreceptors may play in dyspnea in this population, our study was unable to find an association between β-blocker use and decreased levels of dyspnea or fatigue. This may be attributable to several factors related to a retrospective data set. In addition, our data raise the question of whether β-blockade is sufficient among treated patients; low doses may be unlikely to interfere with an ergoreceptor pathway. Further research on β-blockers is recommended, and a prospective cohort might allow better assessment of dosing and β-blocker selectivity.</p>
<p>The recognition that COPD may be under recognized among patients with dyspnea in our clinics has led to further investigation by a specialized dyspnea clinic for the lung cancer population.</p>
