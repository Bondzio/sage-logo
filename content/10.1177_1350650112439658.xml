<abstract>
<p>Friction of rubber is known to behave non-linearly, depending on contact pressure and sliding speed. The surface of a rugby ball made of natural rubber with regular pimples was investigated, and the coefficient of friction between finger skin and rubber surface was determined at normal forces of 0.4–40 N and sliding speeds of 0.001–3.2 m/s. The kinetic coefficient of friction asymptoted to the static coefficient at small speeds. The coefficient of friction exhibited force strengthening and weakening, as well as velocity strengthening and weakening. The maximal coefficient of friction amounted to 3.55 at a normal force of 1 N and a sliding speed of 70 mm/s. When throwing a ball, the coefficient of friction is static and in the force weakening regime at the beginning of the acceleration phase, then moves to the velocity strengthening regimes once finger sliding sets in and finally crosses over to the force strengthening and velocity weakening regimes before the fingers leave contact with the ball.</p>

<p>Velocity and force dependencies of the coefficient of friction (COF) are well-known phenomena. In the velocity strengthening regime, the COF increases with sliding speed; in the velocity weakening regime, the COF decreases with sliding speed; in the force strengthening regime, the COF increases with normal load; and in the force weakening regime, the COF decreases with normal load.</p>
<p>The following section gives a short overview of the mathematical models of the four different dependencies and regimes.</p>

<p>Non-linear frictional behaviour is known from composites (velocity weakening<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1350650112439658">4</xref></sup>) and polymers such as polytetrafluoroethylene and polyethylene (velocity strengthening) and Nylon 6-6 (velocity weakening) at <italic>v</italic> &lt; 10 mm/s and at room temperature.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1350650112439658">5</xref></sup></p>

</p>
<p>This indicates that the rubber friction is governed by the deformation losses of the material and thus by the visco-elastic properties of the rubber.</p>
<p>Bureau et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1350650112439658">10</xref></sup> suggested a logarithmic function for the velocity strengthening regime at sliding speeds smaller than 0.1 mm/s of a poly methyl methacrylate block sliding on soda lime glass. However, Bureau et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1350650112439658">11</xref></sup> generalise that velocity weakening applies to sliding speeds smaller than 0.1 mm/s.</p>

<p>No function or model of the force strengthening regime was found in literature.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec4-1350650112439658"><title>Master surface including all four regimes</title>
<p>To the best of the author’s knowledge, the only master surface showing all four regimes in a single surface was provided by Lindner et al.,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1350650112439658">8</xref></sup> investigating the friction between a rubber compound and a wet road surface. They determined the COF over a speed range of 5–500 mm/s and over a force range of 60–120 N.</p>
<p>Tomlinson<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1350650112439658">17</xref></sup> investigated the friction between the human finger and different materials including rugby ball surfaces. Her results indicate force weakening in brass, nylon, PVC, HDPE and acetal, and force strengthening in polypropylene in the force range 2–10 N. Tomlinson<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1350650112439658">17</xref></sup> did not measure the velocity dependency, and sliding speed ‘of the finger moving on the surface was controlled by asking the participants to count slowly to five from the start to the finish of the slide’. This resulted in speeds 8–20 mm/s in dry surface conditions. Although Tomlinson<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1350650112439658">17</xref></sup> and Tomlinson et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1350650112439658">18</xref></sup> recorded the speed and spin of a thrown ball leaving the hand, they did not determine the actual relative sliding speed of the fingers with respect to the ball.</p>
<p>Friction in ball sports is directly connected to handling the ball, speed and precision of the game. The better the grip, the faster the game becomes, the more exciting it is for the spectators and the larger are the performance differences of elite players (in terms of reaction time, running speed, precision of catch and following team strategy and tactics) compared to lower speed. The precision of throwing was measured by Tomlinson<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1350650112439658">17</xref></sup> and Tomlinson et al.,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1350650112439658">18</xref></sup> which correlated with the friction coefficients determined.</p>
<p>Rugby is played in two different forms: rugby league and rugby union football. The main differences between the two forms are that league football has fewer, clearer and simpler rules, and the game is faster with fewer interruptions, which makes it more interesting for spectators but also more athletically demanding for players. The number of players is different as well, with 13 in league football, and 15 in union football. The material of rugby balls is regulated by the laws of the game.</p>
<p>Rugby league:<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1350650112439658">19</xref></sup> ‘ … oval air inflated ball, the outer casing of which shall be leather or other material approved by the International Board and nothing shall be used in its construction which might prove dangerous to the players’.</p>
<p>Rugby union:<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1350650112439658">20</xref></sup> ‘Leather or suitable synthetic material. It may be treated to make it water resistant and easier to grip’.</p>
<p>The rugby union law specifically mentions the grip, whereas the rugby league does not refer to the surface properties of the ball. Standard rugby balls are made of rubber compound with a structured surface (pimples of different shapes and sizes).</p>
<p>The mass of the union ball is 410–460 g and its dimensions are: length 280–300 mm, end-to-end circumference 740–770 mm and width circumference 580–620 mm.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1350650112439658">20</xref></sup> The mass of the league ball is 380–440 g, and its dimensions are: length 270–290 mm, end-to-end circumference 730–750 mm, and width circumference 580–610 mm.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1350650112439658">19</xref></sup> Union balls are slightly less pointed than league ones.</p>
<p>The aim of this study is to explore and investigate the force and velocity dependence of the COF between finger and a rugby ball surface at variable normal loads and sliding speeds in order to understand the influence of load and speed on the grip. In particular, the aim was to map the COF on a large range (varying at least over a factor of 100), of sliding speeds and normal loads in order to provide a three-dimensional master surface of the COF and to discuss the applicability of this master surface to improving the grip when playing rugby.</p>

<sec id="sec6-1350650112439658"><title>Ball surface</title>
<p>The surface tested was an experimental pimple design developed by Gray-Nicolls/Steeden. The surface was designed for rugby league balls. The ball material was identified as natural rubber with FT-Raman spectroscopy. The surface consisted of a regular pimple pattern (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1350650112439658">Figure 1</xref>) with pimple density 50.28%, diameter 1.19 mm and height 0.53 mm. All friction tests were conducted parallel to the pimple rows.
<fig id="fig1-1350650112439658" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p>Pimple pattern of the surface tested; the arrows indicate the test direction; horizontal scale bar: 10 mm.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1350650112439658-fig1.tif"/></fig></p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec7-1350650112439658"><title>Friction tests</title>
<p>The tests were carried out on a portable Kistler force plate (type 9260AA, Kistler, Winterthur, Switzerland; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1350650112439658">Figure 2</xref>). The measurement mode was set to the recording range with the highest sensitivity in the software (Bioware, Kistler, Winterthur, Switzerland), corresponding to 0.032 N for normal force and 0.016 N for shear force. The force plate was calibrated with defined masses and spring balances in the <italic>z</italic>- and <italic>y</italic>-directions (normal and horizontal directions, respectively). The centre of pressure (COP) was calibrated along the symmetry axis of the force plate (along the <italic>y</italic>-axis) in the mid-section of the force plate by applying forces of different magnitudes and angles with a ballpoint pen at 10 mm increments. The COP positions calculated by the software were compared to the actual location of the COP, and an error map was obtained which allowed correcting the COP locations provided by the software.
<fig id="fig2-1350650112439658" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p>Experimental setup; 1 = rubber sheet, 2 = force plate, 3 = clamp, arrow = direction of finger motion.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1350650112439658-fig2.tif"/></fig></p>
<p>The pimpled rubber sheet was clamped to the force plate and the vertical and horizontal forces data were recoded at 1 kHz. Both rubber sheet and finger skin were cleaned with alcohol before testing. For consistency purposes, only the right index finger of a single test person (male, 47 years) was used for testing. The finger was placed on the rubber sheet by increasing the normal force first, followed by a slow increase in friction force such that the finger started to slide very slowly at the point of impending slippage. Subsequently, the sliding speed was rapidly increased until reaching the maximally possible velocity. The tests were carried out at different initial normal forces in order to cover a wide force range. The influence of finger temperature (rising with sliding distance) was determined by sliding the finger at different constant speeds and loads by fitting the data with a linear regression equation and comparing the data shortly after beginning of the slide to the data shortly before the end of the slide. The difference in the COF was statistically not significant.</p>
<p>A total of 50 tests was performed, distributed over 10 days. The five tests per day covered the range from minimal to maximal load. It was impossible to keep the load constant per test, as the finger tended to press harder at faster sliding speeds. Only tests with steady sliding were processed and any test exhibiting stick–slip behaviour was discarded. All tests were randomly carried out in the same parallel directions distributed over the rubber sheet. After the tests, there was no sign of wear on the rubber sheet.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec8-1350650112439658"><title>Basic data processing</title>
<p>The COF was calculated from the ratio of friction to normal force. The initial data of each test were removed once the COF reached a maximum before the point of impending slippage, determined from the movement of the COP. The sliding speed was calculated from fitting the time series of COP data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1350650112439658">Figure 3</xref>) with a higher order polynomial fit (Matlab R2008b, MathWorks, Natick, MA, USA) and calculating the first derivative from the fit equation. After completing data processing, the data were truncated to a force-velocity area ranging 0.4–40 N and 0.001–3.2 m/s.

The data were analysed with different fit functions including the ones suggested in literature (e.g. logarithmic velocity weakening and power-law force weakening) for small velocity and force windows (e.g. 6–8 N in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-1350650112439658">Figure 5</xref>, 0.4–0.6 m/s in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-1350650112439658">Figure 6</xref>).

<p>The COF showed both force strengthening and weakening as well as both velocity strengthening and weakening. The transition from strengthening to weakening was represented by a peak sharper in the force dependency (on a logarithmic force scale; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-1350650112439658">Figure 6</xref>) than in the velocity dependency (on a logarithmic velocity scale; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-1350650112439658">Figure 5</xref>).</p>
<p>The peak COF, ranging between 3.5 and 3.6, was found at a normal force of 1 N and a sliding speed of 70 mm/s (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-1350650112439658">Figures 7</xref> to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-1350650112439658">9</xref>).

<p>The COF shows large fluctuations, especially at the force strengthening segment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-1350650112439658">Figure 6</xref>), stretching over a COF range of up to 1.

The mean COF of the four surfaces in dry conditions, obtained by Tomlinson<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1350650112439658">17</xref></sup> and Tomlinson et al.,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1350650112439658">18</xref></sup> ranged 1.1–1.8.

<p>Fuss and Troynikov<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1350650112439658">21</xref></sup> investigated the directional friction of five different rugby ball surfaces with a KES_FB4 surface testing machine (Kato Tech Co.

The velocity and the average normal force of the KES_FB4 friction probe were 1 mm/s and 0.5 N.

<p>Ramalho et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1350650112439658">22</xref></sup> did not find any force weakening or strengthening effect in the COF of skin against glass (from 0 to ∼60 N at a speed of ∼40 mm/s).

Both Tomlinson’s results<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1350650112439658">17</xref></sup> and own results described above demonstrate a non-linear COF behaviour as a function of the normal force.

Tomlinson et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1350650112439658">23</xref></sup> discussed possible reasons of the inapplicability of a power law. The main reason seems to be that the finger contact area does not continuously increase with normal force, but rather reaches a steady state at normal loads of 2–7 N,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1350650112439658">17</xref></sup> depending on the softness of the skin and subcutaneous fat. The deviation of the force weakening results from the traditional power law required to adopt a different empirical model according to equation (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="disp-formula7-1350650112439658">7</xref>).

<sec id="sec16-1350650112439658"><title>Implications for the grip of rugby balls</title>
<p>The term ‘grip’ can be defined by: the better the grip, the less easily does a ball slip off the player’s hands under the same conditions. This would naturally be achieved by maximising the friction force. There are two ways of how to increase the friction force: improving the COF and leave the normal force unchanged, or keeping the COF and increase the normal force. In the latter case, the conditions do change and would affect the movements of a player on the field. Thus, it is desired to maximise the COF. The highest COF (3.5) would result at a normal force of 1 N and a sliding speed of 70 mm/s (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-1350650112439658">Figure 9</xref>). However, when throwing a ball, the fingers are still stationary and do not slide over the surface of the ball. Consequently, static conditions apply.</p>

<p>If the friction forces are evenly distributed over 10 fingers, then the resultant forces of <italic>F<sub>A</sub></italic> and <italic>F<sub>C</sub></italic> at each finger required to reach the aforementioned speeds are 5.2, 9.15 and 3.13 N, respectively (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1350650112439658">Table 1</xref>). The corresponding static friction coefficients and normal forces are determined from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-1350650112439658">Figure 9</xref>. The static COFs are around 1.8, 1.65 and 2.2, and the normal forces are 2.89, 5.55 and 1.42 N. These normal forces are the minimum requirement for preventing slippage and can well be higher. The magnitude of the normal forces indicates that at the beginning of a throw, the forces are in the force weakening regime. It is unclear when exactly the fingers start to slide. According to Tomlinson et al.,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1350650112439658">18</xref></sup> ‘in the process of providing spin to the ball, the fingers leave contact with the ball surface, one after another. Starting firstly with the thumb and finishing finally with the little finger’. From their <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-1350650112439658">Figure 8</xref>,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1350650112439658">18</xref></sup> it becomes clear that sliding of the fingers is initiated by flexing them consecutively, i.e. the middle finger remains stationary, whereas the index starts to slide and finally leaves contact with the ball. It is estimated that the entire sliding process lasts for about 15 ms from thumb to little finger (6 ms thereof shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-1350650112439658">Figure 8</xref> of Tomlinson et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1350650112439658">18</xref></sup>). Considering that the time required for accelerating the ball is 0.15 s (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1350650112439658">Table 1</xref>; calculated from speed data by Tomlinson et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1350650112439658">18</xref></sup>), sliding takes place approximately in the last 10% of the throwing action. At small sliding speeds, the COF is in the force weakening and velocity strengthening regimes. The maximal sliding speed of the fingers relative to the surface of the ball is unknown; however, it can be estimated as follows: from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-1350650112439658">Figure 8</xref> of Tomlinson et al.,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1350650112439658">18</xref></sup> the index finger seems to move by about 30 mm within 6 ms. The average speed would then be 5 m/s. The surface speed at the end of the acceleration phase is 1.5 m/s (<italic>ωr</italic>). The sliding speed of the finger then amounts to 3.5 m/s. Considering this average speed and the unloading of the fingers before leaving contact, the COF is located in the force strengthening and velocity weakening regimes of the COF master surface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-1350650112439658">Figure 9</xref>).</p>

<p>The friction coefficient between finger skin and pimpled rubber surface of a rugby ball is highly non-linear and exhibits force strengthening at smaller forces, force weakening at higher forces, velocity strengthening at slower speeds and velocity weakening at faster speeds.</p>
<p>The kinetic COF asymptotes to the static coefficient at small speeds.</p>
<p>The maximal COF amounts to 3.55 at a normal force of 1 N and a sliding speed of 70 mm/s.</p>
<p>When throwing a ball, the COF is static and in the force weakening regime at the beginning of the acceleration phase, then moves to the velocity strengthening regimes once finger sliding sets in and finally crosses over to the force strengthening and velocity weakening regimes before the fingers leave contact with the ball.</p>
