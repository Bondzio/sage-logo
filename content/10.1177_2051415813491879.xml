<p>The middle of the year already and once again we all (well most of us) find ourselves in sunny Manchester for the BAUS Annual Meeting and I am sure this years meeting will be the latest in a series of great successes. One of the great benefits of the annual meeting is the chance to meet and catch up with friends and colleagues from around the country, and indeed Europe and the rest of the world. Banter is often exchanged, drinks bought and memories of previous meetings shared but one of the most important aspects of reunions is that clinical gems and advice can be transferred from colleague-to-colleague and thus disseminated around the Urological community. Meetings, however, can often seem few and far between, especially when there is a burning message in desperate need of delivery, enter the <italic>JCU</italic> no martial arts or high pitched feline wails, just good old fashioned educative information!</p>
<p>One such warning is that reported in a letter from Brian Waymont from Wolverhampton who reports on a “Never Event” arising during flexible cystoscopy which I am sure will be of great use to us all – please do not miss out on this vital warning.</p>
<p>Also in this issue is the third and final of our MPS commissioned articles on the role of the expert witness and I know from welcome feedback that this has been a well received series, much appreciated by readers and I am grateful to the MPS for their valued input to our journal.</p>
<p>The CME series continues with characteristically increasing strength and in this issue, Asif Muneer lays bare the secrets of Andrology, again a must read.</p>
<p>To compliment the above we have a whole collection of original articles of the highest quality, ranging from the oncological through female urology and paediatric urology, something for everyone as always. I would, perhaps draw your attention to the article by Modgil et al : “Is percentage theatre utilisation data an accurate predictor of cost-effectiveness and performance in urology?” I was fascinated when I first read this and am convinced of, not only its great value but also of its future role in the assessment of health care delivery. I am sure that you will all agree with this and the fact the <italic>JCU</italic> is exactly the right vehicle for this paper.</p>
<p>Thank you to all of those involved in making this issue of such great quality, the authors, the peer reviewers, the production team at SAGE and mostly to you, the readers for your continued support, comments and suggestions.</p>
<p>Enjoy Manchester !</p>

<p>CALIBER is a nationally funded randomised trial that will look at whether intravesical chemotherapy can ‘chemoresect’ small recurrences in patients with low risk non muscle invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC) and thus reduce the morbidity and cost of surgical treatment in this group. The trial design has been kept simple to enable any department treating NMIBC to participate. No previous clinical trial experience is necessary and we are particularly keen to mentor new consultants interested in clinical research.</p>
<p>Anyone interested in participating can contact Hugh Mostafid via <email>Hugh.Mostafid@nhs.net</email></p>
