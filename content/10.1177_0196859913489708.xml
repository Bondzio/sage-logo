<abstract>
<p>There are few studies of the manner in which media portray the mental state of mass killers. There are also no formally tested frameworks or models for understanding how such portrayals contribute to the stigma of mental illness. In this article we analyzed the initial depictions of a high-profile mass killer applying discourse analytic methods to representations of the Tucson shooter, Jared Loughner, in the New York Times. We identified fourteen items that focused on Loughner and his actions that were published over the 1st week after the shooting prior to any authoritative assessment of his mental state. This study sought to deconstruct this portrayal of the killer as “mad”, and to show how the four cultural mechanisms of language in use, culture, social practices, and institutions contributed to that construction. Those cultural mechanisms underpinned links observed in the items between Loughner’s behavior, his putative mental illness, and the mass murders. This seamless interplay between the cultural mechanisms as related intertextually enabled the differing representations of Loughner as mad, dangerous, and fearsome. We argue that such a portrayal is a significant contributor to stigmatizing understandings of mental illness and people’s fear of mental disorders.</p>

<p>Mr Loughner’s spellbinding mug shot—that bald head, that bright-eyed gaze, that smile—yields no answer to why, why, why, why, the aching question cried out in a subdued Tucson synagogue last week. Does the absence of hair suggest a girding for battle? Does the grin convey a sense of accomplishment, or complete disengagement from the consequences of his actions?</p>

<p>Journalists filing reports about a mass killing, as exemplified by the epigraph, have to both identify “what happened” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-0196859913489708">Tuchman, 1978</xref>) and to tell the story in ways that offer readers some means of understanding the killer’s actions. In doing so they may choose among frames such as “drug war,” “terrorist attack,” or “it’s the action of a mad individual” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0196859913489708">Fiske, 1987</xref>) and their initial framing may be confirmed or rendered moot by information from an appropriate authority. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0196859913489708">Laurie Penny (2011)</xref> provided a personal account of such meaning-making when reflecting on the British media’s response to the slaughter of up to 80 innocent people in Norway (July 7, 2011). The initial interpretation of that event saw it as the work of “Islamist terrorists” but, the very next day, the killer was identified as Anders Breivik a “White Christian European,” and the killings were then described as the work of “a ‘madman,’ a ‘psycho,’ a ‘lone nutter’.” That framing persisted despite the Norwegian Intelligence Service insisting Breivik was “evil not mad” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0196859913489708">Penny, 2011</xref>). Penny argued, as did <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0196859913489708">Barry (2011)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0196859913489708">Rapley, McCarthy, &amp; McHoul (2003)</xref>, that processes for making sense of events are of particular importance when an event, such as a mass killing, threatens to subvert the everyday moral order (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0196859913489708">Harre, 1986</xref>). Interpreting a mass killing as the work of a madman appears to place the killer “outside the realm of political and personal responsibility” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0196859913489708">Penny, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>Research shows that, in English-speaking countries: United States, Australia, United Kingdom, and New Zealand, the “madman” frame is the preeminent “explanation” for mass killings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0196859913489708">Barnett, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0196859913489708">Blood &amp; Holland, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0196859913489708">Cross, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0196859913489708">Nairn &amp; Coverdale, 2006</xref>). However, we could only find four studies that attempted to unpick that routine association of mental illness and murderous violence through an analysis of the initial coverage of a mass killing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0196859913489708">Barnett, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0196859913489708">Nairn &amp; Coverdale, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0196859913489708">Philo et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0196859913489708">Rapley et al., 2003</xref>). In both <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0196859913489708">Barnett (2005)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0196859913489708">Rapley et al. (2003)</xref> psychiatric statements about the alleged offender’s mental state were challenged by others who sought to establish that the offender was bad not mad. Earlier work, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0196859913489708">Nairn &amp; Coverdale, 2006</xref>) has demonstrated how representations of the event and the killer provided by journalists and their sources drew on common sense elements of madness talk that encouraged readers to assume the killer was disturbed, prior to any acknowledgement that he suffered from a mental disorder. To extend this small body of work on initial portrayals of mass killers, our intention is to describe how early reports of a high-profile killer (Loughner) constructed him as possibly mad and to discuss implications of these portrayals for people who live with mental illnesses and those who work with them. After sketching the widely available discursive resources that speakers and writers draw on in portraying a person as mad, disturbed or troubled, we describe the event and the source of the analyzed coverage. Mental health professionals are greatly concerned by the damages that can follow from stigmatization of mental illnesses because stigmatization can subvert recovery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0196859913489708">Byrne, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0196859913489708">Link, Streuning, Rahav, Phelan, &amp; Nuttbrock, 1997</xref>), threaten funding for services (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0196859913489708">Corrigan, Watson Warpinski, &amp; Garcia, 2004</xref>), and promote fear of the sufferers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0196859913489708">Angermeyer &amp; Matschinger, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0196859913489708">Link, Phelan, Bresnahan, Stueve, &amp; Pescosolido, 1999</xref>).</p>

<title>Theoretical Background</title>
<p>Coverage, in which mental illness, mental disorder, or mental health problems are associated with acts of extreme violence, simultaneously utilizes and reinvigorates a membership categorization device (MCD) of the “mad” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0196859913489708">Eglin &amp; Hester, 1999a</xref>). In use, MCDs concurrently summarize expectations based on membership of a particular category and encourage interpretations of behavior that justify the categorization. For example, if a person is identified as belonging to the category “mad” or “mentally ill” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0196859913489708">Nairn, 2007</xref>) it is anticipated that they will act in violent, criminal, and unpredictable ways and, as a corollary of that categorization, a person who acts in violent, criminal, and unpredictable ways is readily seen as mad (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0196859913489708">Eglin &amp; Hester, 1999b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0196859913489708">Rapley et al., 2003</xref>). A person may be categorized as “mad” because an authority so labels them, or because their appearance and actions towards others is seen as warranting the categorization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0196859913489708">Cross, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0196859913489708">Foucault, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0196859913489708">Nairn, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0196859913489708">Rapley et al., 2003</xref>). This “mad” MCD captures a widely held public view that anyone with a mental disorder is likely to be violent and unpredictable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0196859913489708">Appleby &amp; Wessely, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0196859913489708">Angermeyer &amp; Dietrich, 2006</xref>) and its immediate consequence is that those committing horrendous crimes are considered likely to have a mental illness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0196859913489708">Appleby &amp; Wessely, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0196859913489708">Steadman &amp; Cocozza, 1977</xref>).</p>
<p>The “mad” MCD, whether the person so categorized is male or female, is grounded in the long history of people’s interpretations of forms of deviance named as insanity or madness. These interpretations draw on characters and situations made available through the telling of earlier stories (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0196859913489708">Fabrega, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0196859913489708">1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0196859913489708">Fiske, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0196859913489708">Foucault, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0196859913489708">James, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0196859913489708">Lemke, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0196859913489708">Nairn, Coverdale, &amp; Claasen, 2006</xref>). Those stories and interpretations constitute a repository that may be glossed as “intertextual knowledge” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0196859913489708">Fiske, 1987</xref>) that can orient writers or readers in their crafting or understanding of a story. When analyzing those resources <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0196859913489708">Nairn (2005)</xref> had identified five family clusters he named as: “Animality,” “Damaged Goods,” “Incomplete,” “Out of Control,” and “Possessed.” Each of these provided speakers, writers, and readers with particular interpretative and explanatory possibilities. Writers using “Animality” resources represented a person’s madness through identification with animal-like characteristics. “Damaged Goods” resources interpreted the “mad” behavior as occasioned by damage to the brain or the person’s human nature. Madness may be depicted as arising from some important (mental) lack (“Incomplete”) and, when using “Out of Control” resources, a person’s behavior is represented as showing that they have lost the ability to function as a self-controlled individual (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0196859913489708">Gaines, 1992</xref>). “Possessed” resources underpin portrayals of the mad as having been “taken over” by something (evil).</p>
<p>Studies of portrayals of mental illness or madness in various media (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0196859913489708">Angermeyer &amp; Matschinger, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0196859913489708">Appleby &amp; Wessely, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0196859913489708">Blood, Putnis &amp; Pirkis, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0196859913489708">Camp, Webster, Coverdale, Coverdale, &amp; Nairn, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0196859913489708">Corrigan et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0196859913489708">Coverdale, Nairn, &amp; Claasen, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0196859913489708">Cross, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0196859913489708">Day &amp; Page, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0196859913489708">Hyler, Gabbard, &amp; Schneider, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0196859913489708">Philo, Henderson, &amp; McLaughlin, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0196859913489708">Shain &amp; Philips, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0196859913489708">Signorielli, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-0196859913489708">Wahl, 1995</xref>), catalogue many diverse imaginings of mental illness/madness and, less explicitly, identify resources on which those imaginings rely. Explaining the potency of particular imaginings, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0196859913489708">Cross (2004)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0196859913489708">Nairn (2007)</xref> both emphasized synergies between factual and fictional portrayals. Factual depictions foreground the known—what is presumed to be self-evident (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0196859913489708">Corner, 1996</xref>)—and what has been discovered, creating a framework within which interpretative elements are seen as immediately obvious inferences. Fictional depictions mimic factual depictions in differing ways, and utilize elements of the known or “everyday” in creating a web of facticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-0196859913489708">Tuchman, 1978</xref>) that supports credible, embodied, representations of actions, motives, and feelings, of the “mad” person (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0196859913489708">Camp et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0196859913489708">Fuery, 2004</xref>). Such embodiments of “madness” may be cued in factual accounts. Intertextuality is the technical term for describing storytellers’ and listeners’ reliance on resources used in earlier stories when representing and interpreting happenings and experiences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0196859913489708">Hall, 2001</xref>). Hall (p. 328) explains that our recycling of resources in this way leads to an “accumulation of meanings across different texts [or stories]” so that representations of specific events, situations, and groups become overdetermined increasing the probability they will be categorized and experienced in particular ways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0196859913489708">Nairn, Coverdale, &amp; Coverdale, 2011</xref>). Research has shown that the constant revivifying of the intertextual commonsense about madness employed in news stories and other media productions contributes to the public’s fear of those with a mental disorder (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0196859913489708">Angermeyer &amp; Matschinger, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0196859913489708">Byrne, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0196859913489708">Link et al., 1999</xref>).</p>

<title>Method</title>
<p>On January 8, 2011, outside a Tucson supermarket, a young man, Jared Loughner, fired 31 shots killing 6 and wounding 13 people, among whom was Representative Gabrielle Gifford. For our analysis of the representations of Loughner we focused on the first week of the coverage (8 January-15 January) in <italic>The New York Times</italic>, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0196859913489708">Britannica Online, 2012</xref>), as these reports preceded any formal assessment of his mental state. All published items from <italic>The New York Times</italic> relating to Loughner’s killings over that 1st week of reporting were collected. Relevant articles were identified through reading the daily print editions, and by searching <italic>The New York Times</italic> website using combinations of the terms: Loughner, gunman, suspect, Tucson shootings, Gifford, and Arizona. The search located 14 items including eight straight news stories describing the event, Loughner’s preparations and other details, three offering background information about Loughner, one reviewing legal implications of Loughner’s mental state (as constructed), one editorial in which representations of Loughner were central, and one “end of week” review of the coverage. These items are listed—identified by headline and online date of publication—in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0196859913489708">Table 1</xref> together with the identified writers, the page on which each appeared and their length. When an item is discussed it is identified by author and the date of publication, for example, “in Arizona Court, Subject Waives Bail: Ruled a danger” is (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0196859913489708">Lacey, 2011b</xref>). News items that discussed issues related to the killings while lacking the focus on Loughner were examined but not subjected to the same close readings. Examples of such peripheral items were: “Warnings rarely precede attack, experts say” Jan 12th, and “Tucson shootings raise questions on how to handle troubled students,” Jan 14. We chose to give priority to online items as a greater proportion of the items were located online as opposed to print editions.</p>

<p>The selected items were subject to discourse analyses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0196859913489708">Fairclough, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0196859913489708">Fairclough, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0196859913489708">Nairn &amp; Coverdale, 2006</xref>) which is a method that focuses on patterns of language use (vocabulary, images, narrative fragments, and visual elements), relating them to known genealogies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0196859913489708">Nairn, 2005</xref>). This required careful, critical reading by all authors to identify relevant elements and the patterns they form. All disagreements were discussed by the three authors in order to reach consensus. Two of the authors (JHC, RN) are experienced in such analyses and have utilized these skills in widely published work on media and mental illness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0196859913489708">Camp et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0196859913489708">Nairn, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0196859913489708">Nairn, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0196859913489708">Nairn &amp; Coverdale, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0196859913489708">Nairn &amp; Coverdale 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0196859913489708">Nairn et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-0196859913489708">Wilson, Nairn, Coverdale, &amp; Panapa, 1999a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-0196859913489708">Wilson, Nairn, Coverdale, &amp; Panapa, 1999b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr80-0196859913489708">Wilson, Nairn, Coverdale, &amp; Panapa, 2000</xref>). As described in reported analyses of newspaper articles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0196859913489708">Allen &amp; Nairn, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0196859913489708">Barnett, 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0196859913489708">Nairn &amp; Coverdale, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-0196859913489708">Wetherell, 1998</xref>), these methods assume the constructed nature of media depictions enabling researchers to identify cultural mechanisms such as language in use, culture, social practices, and institutions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0196859913489708">Nairn, et al., 2011</xref>) that support those constructions. In this analysis we looked for all possible interpretations that might explain Loughner’s actions. In the light of earlier work identifying common sense associations between mental illness and unpredictable violence we were concerned to see whether and how these were utilized here (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0196859913489708">Nairn, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0196859913489708">Nairn, et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-0196859913489708">Wilson, et al., 1999a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-0196859913489708">Wilson, et al., 1999b</xref>). As numerous individuals contributed to the production of individual items, we have focused on how Loughner is constructed rather than assign responsibilities for particular aspects of the published materials.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>Across all the articles, there was strong evidence of a focus on Loughner’s personal history as explanatory for his behavior. In writing their reports, the journalists drew on three discrete streams of “evidence”: Loughner’s products, particularly his online ramblings, statements from authorities such as law enforcement personnel and former teachers, and accounts from classmates, friends, neighbors, and employers in which they described their experiences of him in ways that embodied their interpretations of his behavior. Loughner’s behavior was pervasively interpreted as ”mad/weird/disturbed” whereas an alternative interpretation of drug abuse was merely mentioned without the provision of supporting evidence. To this assemblage of ‘evidence’ journalists added personal interpretations as exemplified by the statement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0196859913489708">Becker, Kovaleski, et al., 2011</xref>): “Here he is, a talented saxophonist with a prestigious high school jazz band and there he is, a high school dropout. Here he is, a clean-cut employee for an Eddie Bauer store, and there he is, so unsettling a presence that tellers at a local bank would feel for the alarm button when he walked in.” Two hypotheses dominated the offered explanations. The first was that this was a purely criminal act for which Loughner felt a sense of accomplishment, and the second was that he was completely disengaged from the consequences of his own actions. Both linked abnormalities of Loughner’s behavior with mental illness. We found it helpful to organize the findings from our analyses in relation to the four cultural mechanisms of language in use, culture, social practices, and institutions that underpinned the links between Loughner and mental illness in accounting for this mass murder.</p>
<sec id="section4-0196859913489708">
<title>Language in Use</title>
<p>Language in use is the means by which events, situations, and experiences are constructed to make sense to people (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0196859913489708">Berger &amp; Luckmann, 1971</xref>). Drawing items from the lexicon of madness, the reporting over the first 2 days painted a picture of Loughner as erratic, odd, unusual, emotionally underdeveloped, alienated, reclusive, disturbed, paranoid, troubled, and mentally ill or “mad.” Two early headlines exemplified this: “Arizona Suspect’s Recent Acts Offer Hints of Alienation” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0196859913489708">Lipton et al., 2011</xref>) and “Suspect’s Odd Behavior Caused Growing Alarm” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0196859913489708">Johnson et al., 2011</xref>). Clearly the dominant explanations of the event were established very quickly, as if the writers were drawing on readily available cultural stereotypes. Unsurprisingly, the tales and interpretations writers chose to include in each of those articles were consistent with the interpretative thrust of the headline. For example, Don (a classmate) said Loughner was: “a troubled young man and emotionally underdeveloped,” who, according to Don, compared a young woman who read a poem about having an abortion to a terrorist for killing the baby. Don also said that no one in the class “would even sit next to him” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0196859913489708">Lipton et al., 2011</xref>). Another student said he found Loughner’s behavior to be “so eccentric—including inappropriate remarks and unusual outbursts—that he wondered if he might be on hallucinogens.” A further student (Grant), who was not a classmate, described him as a “kind of rare bird, very shy.” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0196859913489708">Lipton et al., 2011</xref>). An instructor, Ben, described a pattern in Loughner’s behavior that included: “explosive responses,” “hysterical laughter,” “bizarre nonsequiturs,” and “aggressive outbursts” making Ben become “concerned about the safety of students and the school” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0196859913489708">Johnson et al., 2011</xref>). One notable exception, however, was provided by a former classmate (Mr. Cates) who described Loughner as “really into school. He really loved the acquisition of knowledge” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0196859913489708">Johnson et al., 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>Stories from later in the week offered apparent confirmation of these early generally negative portrayals. Police documents released by Pima Community College described Mr. Loughner as “creepy,” “very hostile,” “very suspicious,” and “as someone who had a ‘dark personality’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0196859913489708">Lacey, 2011c</xref>). The same article reported that he: “sang to himself,” “spoke out of turn,” made a bizarre posting on YouTube that linked the college to genocide and the torture of students, and reported that he had had many contacts with the campus police. Another article (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0196859913489708">Haberman, 2011</xref>) reported Loughner had made web postings that explained; “English grammar was not merely usage that enjoys common acceptance but rather, nothing less than a government conspiracy to control people’s minds.” The writer interpreted this as Loughner taking “steps closer to the dark side.” The Tucson Police released records showing that Loughner and a member of his family had at least “nine contacts with law enforcement between 1994 and 2010” including an arrest for possession of drug paraphernalia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0196859913489708">Lacey, Becker, &amp; Oppel, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>The articles portrayed a young man (ages 18-22 years) who had lost control and had been disturbing people in various ways, effectively setting up an expectation that he might become violent. That concern was exemplified by comments of his former algebra teacher who said he was afraid for the safety of the students and the school, and kept glancing at him out of the corner of his eye because “I was afraid that he was going to pull out a weapon” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0196859913489708">Johnson et al., 2011</xref>). An older woman in the same class had reportedly sent an email suggesting she was scared that he was either on drugs or disturbed; “Hopefully he will be out of the class very soon and not come back with an automatic weapon” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0196859913489708">Johnson et al., 2011</xref>).</p>
</sec></sec>
<sec id="section5-0196859913489708">
<title>Culture</title>
<p>Culture is the manner in which people in an organized group, society, or nation interact with their social and physical environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0196859913489708">Reber &amp; Reber, 2001</xref>). One of the cultural values in the United States is to be popular in the sense of belonging or being recognized as behaving appropriately and effectively. Thus when Don, a classmate, said “no one would sit by him in class” he marked Loughner as an outsider (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0196859913489708">Lipton et al., 2011</xref>). Friends and acquaintances said “he [Loughner] was left isolated by his increasingly erratic behavior” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0196859913489708">Johnson et al., 2011</xref>). One journalist summarized Loughner’s social trajectory: “His recent years have been marked by stinging rejection—from his country’s military, his community college, his girlfriends, and, perhaps, his father” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0196859913489708">Becker, Kovaleski, et al., 2011</xref>). One of the common elements of these comments, and those in “Language in use,” was his lack of popularity, his inappropriate participation, and his lack of respect for others’ ideas. As noted earlier, the end of week review (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0196859913489708">Becker, Kovaleski, et al., 2011</xref>) contrasted Loughner’s previously successful participation against the inappropriate actions that made him “unsettling” and had bank tellers reaching for their alarms when he came in. Another cultural value in the United States is the relatively unfettered right to bear arms. Yet, the photo that Loughner put on his Myspace page in which a handgun sits on his U.S. history text, is the first piece of evidence the journalist presented in elaborating the statement “[Loughner] had become increasingly erratic . . . so that others around him began to worry” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0196859913489708">Lipton et al., 2011</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0196859913489708">
<title>Social Practices</title>
<p>Social practice is the umbrella term for the approved ways in which people act upon and with each other and with their world, often through language (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0196859913489708">Edwards, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0196859913489708">Fairclough, 1992</xref>). The examples of interest here relate to how people have conversations, how participants in a school class are expected to behave, and how these social practices were violated. Loughner’s violations of these social practices, as already noted, evoked fear in those who knew him which caused him to become isolated. A further example concerned his class reading of a poem that was mostly about him going to the gym to work out that included a line about touching himself in the shower while thinking about girls (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0196859913489708">Johnson et al., 2011</xref>). A friend, Mr. Gutierrez, exemplified the way in which aberrant social behavior is interpreted. Talking of his friend he said: “The dream world was what was real to Jared, not the day-to-day of our lives.” adding “that dream world could be downright strange,” “normal people don’t talk about that stuff” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0196859913489708">Becker, Johnson, et al., 2011</xref>). On the other hand there were references to how Loughner was methodical (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0196859913489708">Lacey, 2011a</xref>), and to how a judge had once described him as capable and “very polite with nothing to indicate the type of behavior that was to come” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0196859913489708">Lacey, 2011b</xref>).</p>
<p>Another social practice is the use of mental health clearances as protective measures for students and others in an organization. The 1st day’s article reported that Pima Community College had told Loughner’s parents that he needed a mental health clearance before he would be allowed back (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0196859913489708">Lipton et al., 2011</xref>). That directed Loughner to a mental health service institution to provide an authoritative categorization of his behavior. Finally, and most importantly, as social practices are approved ways of acting, they embody normative expectations of people’s behavior and, when those are violated, the violations must be explained. In this task, elements of the “mad” lexicon such as “Out of Control” are often used.</p>

<title>Institutions</title>
<p>Institutions are the structural parts of a society organized to meet the needs of a society and its members (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0196859913489708">Marshall, 1998</xref>). Institutions, as in this case, are usually in the background, providing the structural framework for social practices. Unsurprisingly, a considerable number of institutions are implicated or involved in the construction of Loughner and representations of his mass killing including education, mental health services, police, House of Representatives, finance/currency, and church or organized religion. Examples given in “Language in use” and “Social practices” primarily related to education. The example of mental health clearance raised issues of diagnostic and classificatory systems and access to practitioners (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-0196859913489708">Sulzberger &amp; Gabriel, 2011</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-0196859913489708">
<title>Intertextuality</title>
<p>As described previously, intertextuality refers to how meanings accumulate and depictions cross-reference other images and texts in books, films, or other portrayals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0196859913489708">Fiske, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0196859913489708">Nairn &amp; Coverdale, 2006</xref>). In relation to Loughner and his mass killing, the primary role of intertextuality is in relating the current event to cultural constructions of previous mass murders and the perpetrators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0196859913489708">Blood et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0196859913489708">Rapley et al., 2003</xref>). Named murderers included Seung Hui Cho (Virginia Tech) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-0196859913489708">Sulzberger &amp; Gabriel, 2011</xref>), Timothy McVeigh and John Hinkley (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-0196859913489708">Weiser, 2011</xref>), and the Columbine killings were also mentioned (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0196859913489708">Becker, Kovaleski, et al., 2011</xref>). In a reminder of the Virginia Tech massacre (32 killed) it was noted that “many people and departments had clear signs of the instability of the gunman, but no one connected the information.”</p>
<p>A wider intertextual link was provided by the “mug shot grin” photo, that, in its first appearance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0196859913489708">Lacey, 2011b</xref>), was associated with classic signs of disturbed behavior—“his eyes darted back and forth and his mouth curled up at one point into a quick smile.” Similar signs are utilized in portrayals of cinematic killers such as the Joker (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-0196859913489708">Thomas &amp; Nolan, 2008</xref>) and the twitchy Norman Bates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0196859913489708">Russell &amp; Hitchcock, 1960</xref>). Also as with the portrayal of the Joker (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0196859913489708">Camp et al., 2010</xref>) animal and animalistic images were utilized in describing or interpreting Loughner’s behavior: “lone wolf” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0196859913489708">Johnson et al., 2011</xref>), “naked buttocks” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0196859913489708">Becker, Kovaleski, et al., 2011</xref>), a “kind of rare bird” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0196859913489708">Lipton et al., 2011</xref>). These in turn provided links to the lexicon of madness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0196859913489708">Nairn, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>Loughner was also described as having “crossed a border” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0196859913489708">Johnson et al., 2011</xref>) from being a young man described as “odd” to being an alleged killer. Intertextual associations of that phrase include the socioeconomic implications of crossing to the wrong side of the tracks, illegal immigrants violating a national border, rustlers, and other criminals avoiding the law, and, in relation to the purchase of the gun used in the shooting, “teetering on the edge of sanity” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0196859913489708">Editorial, 2011</xref>). Related to “border crossing” is a later allusion to “the dark side.” This is a concept recognizable from the <italic>Star Wars</italic> film (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-0196859913489708">Taylor &amp; Lucas, 1977</xref>) and was used by a journalist when outlining the “grammar as government conspiracy’ postings online, and who said that “the Loughners and Millers take many steps closer to the dark side” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0196859913489708">Haberman, 2011</xref>).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In undertaking this research we had two concerns. The first was the way in which attribution of mass killings and other violent acts to an individual’s presumed madness deflects attention from social and cultural issues that may have contributed to the acts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0196859913489708">Kilpatrick, 1999</xref>), and the second was a limited impact of destigmatizing projects on media and community portrayals of mental illness. We see modeling of the processes by which people and communities routinely construct particular individuals and groups in these stigmatizing ways as a powerful means for addressing both concerns because such models enable researchers, mental health personnel, and communities to move beyond merely describing the routine association of mental illness and criminal violence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0196859913489708">Nairn, et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0196859913489708">Pescosolido, Martin, Lang, &amp; Olafsdottir, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>In this work we have identified a wide range of resources used by lay individuals and officials when explaining how they experienced Loughner that, as assembled by the journalists, constructed significant issues about his mental state. In that way, the <italic>New York Times</italic> stories published over the 1st week after the shooting privileged madness as the explanation for Loughner’s shooting and killing. An alternative interpretation appearing in these items concerned drugs and, despite a conviction for “possession of drug paraphernalia” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0196859913489708">Lacey, Becker, &amp; Oppel, 2011</xref>), there were few occasions when Loughner was so represented. The quotations journalists assembled from teachers, classmates, neighbors, and associates about his unpredictable and disruptive behaviors were utilized alongside fragments from Loughner’s online postings to depict a person who was “disturbed,” “unpredictable,” and “creepy.” Similarly, Loughner’s mug-shot grin, because it violated normative social expectations, elicited repeated use of words like “odd,” “unusual,” and “troubled.” Those descriptions of Loughner and his actions were like a mosaic that journalists interpreted for readers while keeping them informed of the ongoing investigations. As assembled the mosaic pictured Loughner as isolated, erratic, and eccentric—the last linked to a sense of dangerousness and a loss of control.</p>
<p>The analyses showed how the four cultural mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0196859913489708">Nairn et al., 2011</xref>) contributed to representations of Loughner as mad. In these materials the primary mechanisms were “Language in use” and “Social practices.” “Culture” and “Institutions” specified normative situations and frameworks within which Loughner and his actions were identified as norm-violating, and therefore as requiring an explanatory account. The resulting portrayal of Loughner as “mad” shared common elements with representations of other mass killers who were presumed or known to have a mental illness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0196859913489708">Appleby &amp; Wessely 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0196859913489708">Barnett, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0196859913489708">Camp et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0196859913489708">Nairn &amp; Coverdale, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0196859913489708">Rapley et al., 2003</xref>). This seamless interplay between these cultural mechanisms, augmented by intertextual relationships between elements and images, underpinned a portrayal of Loughner as mad and dangerous that was so compelling, although no one quoted was a mental health professional, that prosecutors discussed their possible responses to an insanity plea (“Legal Strategy Could Hinge on Mental Assessment,” <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-0196859913489708">Weiser, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>From the very first article (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0196859913489708">Lipton et al., 2011</xref>) these elements began to merge into a generic picture of a young man who seemed to be, “Out of Control” a depiction that was elaborated and strengthened in subsequent articles (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0196859913489708">Table 1</xref>). This representation enrolled Loughner in the “madman” MCD cuing expectations that he could, or would, act in the violent and unpredictable ways considered typical of those categorized as “mad” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0196859913489708">Eglin &amp; Hester, 1999b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0196859913489708">Rapley et al., 2003</xref>). Concurrently, his murderous violence and other norm-violating actions provided apparent confirmation of the aptness of that MCD. For the reader as citizen, Loughner’s putative “madness” appeared to “explain” the apparently random shooting that killed six and wounded 13 while simultaneously confirming the regnant, stigmatizing common sense that persons with a mental illness are dangerous. Such an understanding of the event “releases the general public from responsibility” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0196859913489708">Kilpatrick, 1999</xref>, p. 128). However a fault line runs through this representation of Loughner. When a person is portrayed as “mad” they are understood to be subject to or the victim of their presumed mental disorder. Yet the revelations of Loughner’s detailed preparations for and behavior during the shooting appeared to show he was the active agent of his offences. And, as the agent, he has to be understood to be a person in control of himself. Analyses of media accounts of other mass killers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0196859913489708">Barnett 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0196859913489708">Nairn &amp; Coverdale, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0196859913489708">Rapley et al., 2003</xref>) show similar tension between an understanding that the perpetrator was an active agent of the offences, and their portrayal as being “out of control” and hence unpredictable, that renders them more fearsome.</p>
<p>There are several limitations to our analysis. We deliberately limited ourselves to one event and one newspaper so there needs to be further studies to assess the generality of our findings and the utility of the cultural mechanisms model for understanding media and other depictions of mental illnesses. Because language is polysemic other readers may offer different interpretations of the data though they would need to show that those alternative interpretations were coherent across all the items analyzed. Finally, although our analysis was comprehensive, for reasons of space we provided a sample of the interplay of the four cultural mechanisms and the intertextual relationships between them.</p>
<p>This analysis differs from many other studies of how mental illnesses are represented in that it analyses how lay people utilize widely available commonsense about “madness” in their efforts to interpret norm-violating actions and their widely disseminated meaning-making appears to confirm that same common sense. While we accept that this vicious cycle of use and apparent confirmation is not the only driver of the stigmatization of persons living with a mental illness, we argue that its power and effect must be acknowledged as a prerequisite to the development of effective destigmatizing interventions. Given the availability, diverse content, and utility of the “mad” MCD, as sketched here, it is unlikely that people’s beliefs or media depictions would be modified by mere exposure to reports that there are real though limited associations between mental illness, crime, and violence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0196859913489708">Mullen, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0196859913489708">Pescosolido et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-0196859913489708">P. J. Taylor &amp; Gunn, 1999</xref>), or the finding that persons living with a mental disorder are more commonly victims of crime (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0196859913489708">Simpson, McKenna, Moskowitz, Skipworth, &amp; Barry-Walsh, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>We had previously provided a framework (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0196859913489708">Nairn et al., 2011</xref>) for understanding the basis of the cycles of use and apparent confirmation that we employed in analyzing the explanatory role assigned to stigmatizing interpretations of Loughner’s actions. In that model, as noted above, people’s meaningful representations of events construct the target person’s agency or its absence. Consistent with this model, we directed attention to the agency of the speakers and, subsequently, the journalists, who were choosing the language, images, and snatches of narrative used to give meaning to specific aspects of Loughner’s appearance or the event they were making “sense” of. This differs from an alternative model offered by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0196859913489708">Pescosolido et al. (2008)</xref> that presents considerable detail about influences on those who stigmatize while paying little attention to their agency. Taking the agency of speakers and writers seriously demands a reorientation of efforts to destigmatize mental illnesses. A key step in such a reorientation would be to fully appreciate the power and availability of the “mad” MCD and the discursive resources that sustain it. As instanced here, the resources journalists and their sources used in making sense of norm-violating and otherwise inexplicable events like a mass killing are familiar, generic references to mental disturbances which are stigmatizing and potentially very damaging. A possible alternative to the representations such categorization enables is offered by persons living with mental disorders who cue readers to a different intertextuality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0196859913489708">Nairn &amp; Coverdale, 2005</xref>). We have previously argued (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0196859913489708">Camp et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0196859913489708">Nairn, et al., 2011</xref>) that those interested in the processes of stigmatization need to know how media representations are grounded in these pervasive cultural mechanisms and appreciate the emotional and potentially stigmatizing load of those portrayals. This is a necessary step in effectively disrupting the media’s constant recycling of the language, images, and narrative fragments that ensures the “mad” resources remain familiar, accessible and conceptually potent.</p>
