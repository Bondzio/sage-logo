<abstract>
<p><italic>Sporormiella</italic>, a genus of coprophilous fungus, is increasingly used as a qualitative proxy for megafaunal density. Decreased spore abundances in Late-Pleistocene and Holocene sediments are thought to signal prehistoric megafaunal population declines and extinctions. However, much remains unknown regarding the dispersal, deposition, and preservation of <italic>Sporormiella</italic>, hindering interpretation. Here we collected lake-center and lake-margin surface-sediment samples from 24 lakes in a west–east transect across South Dakota, Minnesota, and Wisconsin to test whether <italic>Sporormiella</italic> abundances varied along a precipitation gradient and areas of varying grazing intensity. Unlike other pollen types, relative abundances and concentrations of <italic>Sporormiella</italic> spores were uncorrelated between lake-center and lake-margin samples. For lake-margin samples, distance-to-shoreline and county-scale cattle density were significant predictors of <italic>Sporormiella</italic> relative abundances. Only distance to shoreline was a significant predictor of <italic>Sporormiella</italic> concentrations. The positive relationship between shoreline proximity and <italic>Sporormiella</italic> abundances differs from prior reports that <italic>Sporormiella</italic> concentrations decrease away from shoreline. For lake-center samples, <italic>Sporormiella</italic> relative abundances were negatively correlated with precipitation and <italic>Sporormiella</italic> concentrations had no significant predictors. These results suggest that <italic>Sporormiella</italic> representation in lake sediments is controlled by multiple factors, including but not limited to local megaherbivore density. <italic>Sporormiella</italic> concentrations appear to be ‘noisier’ than <italic>Sporormiella</italic> relative abundances, due to within-basin sedimentary effects on pollen and spore accumulation rates. More work on <italic>Sporormiella</italic> taphonomy is critically needed to better understand the controls on its representation in late-Quaternary sediments.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>At the end of the Pleistocene, over 90 genera of the world’s megafauna (animals weighing &gt; 44 kg) went extinct on all continents except Africa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0959683611425550">Koch and Barnosky, 2006</xref>), with additional extinctions on Madagascar and Pacific islands during the Holocene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0959683611425550">Burney et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0959683611425550">Wood et al., 2011</xref>). Paleoecologists have long debated the cause (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0959683611425550">Koch and Barnosky, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0959683611425550">Martin and Klein, 1984</xref>) and consequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0959683611425550">Gill et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0959683611425550">Owen-Smith, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0959683611425550">Robinson et al., 2005</xref>) of the late-Quaternary megafaunal extinctions. <italic>Sporormiella</italic>, a genus of coprophilous fungi, has increasingly been used as a proxy for megaherbivore population declines during the Late Pleistocene and Holocene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0959683611425550">Burney et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0959683611425550">Davis, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0959683611425550">Davis and Shafer, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0959683611425550">Gill et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0959683611425550">Raper and Bush, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0959683611425550">Robinson et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0959683611425550">Wood et al., 2011</xref>) and for the introduction of domesticated megaherbivores (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0959683611425550">Davis, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0959683611425550">Davis and Shafer, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0959683611425550">van Geel et al., 2003</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0959683611425550">2008</xref>). Spores of the fungus have been found on the dung of a wide range of extinct and extant megaherbivores including mammoth, bison, cattle and moose, as well as smaller mammals such as rabbit, porcupine and avian herbivores (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0959683611425550">Ahmed and Cain, 1972</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0959683611425550">Mead et al., 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0959683611425550">Mol et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0959683611425550">Richardson, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0959683611425550">van Geel et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0959683611425550">Wood et al., 2011</xref>). In North American records, <italic>Sporormiella</italic> abundances tend to be high in Late-Pleistocene sediments, low during the Holocene, and then high again after European settlement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0959683611425550">Cordova et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0959683611425550">Davis, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0959683611425550">Gill et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0959683611425550">Robinson et al., 2005</xref>). However, <italic>Sporormiella</italic> spores are sometimes absent at currently grazed sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0959683611425550">Cordova et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0959683611425550">Davis, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0959683611425550">Davis and Shafer, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0959683611425550">Raper and Bush, 2009</xref>) and it is also poorly understood why <italic>Sporormiella</italic> abundances are relatively low in Holocene sediments despite the survival of large herbivores and known <italic>Sporormiella</italic> hosts such as bison, elk, and deer.</p>
<p>There is thus a need to understand the ecological and taphonomic processes that govern the representation of <italic>Sporormiella</italic> spores in sedimentary archives. <italic>Sporormiella</italic>’s life cycle includes ingestion of spores by herbivores and passage through the digestive system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0959683611425550">Wicklow and Angel, 1980</xref>). Spores then germinate within the dung and new fruiting bodies (ascocarps) are formed at the dung surface. These ascocarps contain asci, each of which contains several (usually eight) ascospores (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0959683611425550">Doveri, 2007</xref>). The ascocarps burst and the asci and ascospores are dispersed to the surrounding vegetation where they can be consumed once again, continuing the cycle. Alternatively, ascospores might be deposited in lake sediments or elsewhere on the landscape where they then lie dormant. Each <italic>Sporormiella</italic> ascospore consists of a chain of four or more cells (also called subspores) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0959683611425550">Ahmed and Cain, 1972</xref>), and usually the disaggregated subspores are found in sediments; intact ascospores are uncommon and asci are rare. It is unlikely that spores disperse far from their source because of the positioning of <italic>Sporormiella</italic> and its dung source near the ground, where wind transport is ineffective (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0959683611425550">Davis and Shafer, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0959683611425550">van Geel et al., 2003</xref>). <italic>Sporormiella</italic> presence/abundance in lake sediments thus has been attributed to deposition by slopewash and short-distance aerial transport from dung in the watershed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0959683611425550">Davis et al., 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0959683611425550">van Geel et al., 2003</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0959683611425550">2008</xref>). In modern coprophilous fungal communities, the presence and abundance of particular fungal species is affected by climatic factors, such as precipitation (moisture availability) and temperature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0959683611425550">Angel and Wicklow, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0959683611425550">Masunga et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0959683611425550">Richardson, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0959683611425550">Yocom and Wicklow, 1980</xref>). It is plausible therefore to suspect that the representation of fungal spores in sediments might also be influenced by climatic factors. There is a need to clarify the importance and relative contributions of climatic, morphologic, and land use variables on <italic>Sporormiella</italic> representation in terrestrial and lacustrine records.</p>
<p>An increasing number of studies are relating <italic>Sporormiella</italic> abundances in contemporary sediments to herbivore abundance and grazing history, using soil and leaf-litter samples (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0959683611425550">Blackford and Innes, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0959683611425550">Cordova et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0959683611425550">Graf and Chmura, 2006</xref>) and modern and historic lake sediments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0959683611425550">Davis and Shafer, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0959683611425550">Raper and Bush, 2009</xref>). These studies conclude that <italic>Sporormiella</italic> is an indicator of highly localized grazing and, in historic sediments, is often but not always present in high abundance when herbivores are present. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0959683611425550">Graf and Chmura (2006)</xref>, for example, successfully used coprophilous fungi as indicators of grazed versus ungrazed plots. <italic>Sporormiella</italic> was also present in the dung of moa and other avian herbivores from New Zealand and <italic>Sporormiella</italic> abundances in soil cores appears to track their decline (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0959683611425550">Wood et al., 2011</xref>). <italic>Sporormiella</italic> abundance has been linked to the nearby density of megaherbivores in historic sediments, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0959683611425550">Raper and Bush, 2009</xref>), but the scale at which cattle density controls <italic>Sporormiella</italic> representation remains unclear. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0959683611425550">Raper and Bush (2009)</xref> showed that high <italic>Sporormiella</italic> abundances are associated with nearby grazing cattle, but also reported within-lake variations in <italic>Sporormiella</italic> concentrations. They found that <italic>Sporormiella</italic> concentrations rapidly decreased within the first 20 m from shore, presumably due to the limited dispersal capability of <italic>Sporormiella</italic>. Given these findings, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0959683611425550">Raper and Bush (2009)</xref> proposed an alternate hypothesis for the Late-Pleistocene and Holocene <italic>Sporormiella</italic> declines, i.e. that they may have been caused by rising lake levels that increased the distance between the cored location and the <italic>Sporormiella</italic> source area.</p>
<p>Here we investigate whether regional-scale spatial patterns in <italic>Sporormiella</italic> abundances are affected by factors such as climate and megaherbivore density, in order to better understand the processes that control temporal variations in <italic>Sporormiella</italic> abundances in lake sediments. Using a collection of 24 lakes from an east–west transect across the northern Great Plains of the USA, we investigate the relative importance of a collection of climatic, morphologic, and land-use variables on the representation of <italic>Sporormiella</italic> within and across lake basins. We then discuss the implications of these results for interpretation of <italic>Sporormiella</italic> in the modern and fossil record.</p>

<p>The Great Plains is characterized by a steep and relatively uniform precipitation gradient (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0959683611425550">Figure 1</xref>), with drier conditions to the west, resulting in a gradual change in vegetation from eastern deciduous forests, dominated by <italic>Quercus</italic> (oak), <italic>Ulmus</italic> (elm), <italic>Fraxinus</italic> (ash), <italic>Populus</italic> (poplar), <italic>Acer</italic> (maple), and <italic>Betula</italic> (birch) changing westwards to tallgrass and shortgrass prairie and finally a shrub steppe (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0959683611425550">McAndrews and Wright, 1969</xref>). The gradual and consistent change in precipitation and the resulting change in vegetation makes the Great Plains a classic area for gradient analyses of the effect of moisture-related climatic factors on ecological processes, both present (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0959683611425550">Bradford et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0959683611425550">Epstein et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0959683611425550">Lane et al., 1998</xref>) and past (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0959683611425550">Clark et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0959683611425550">Grimm, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0959683611425550">Nelson and Hu, 2008</xref>).</p>

<p>Two surface samples were collected at each lake: one from near the lake margin (10–50 m from the margin depending on accessibility. These distances were estimated in the field and then verified using Google Earth) and the other from the lake ‘center’, defined here as the deepest part of the basin. At some lakes we took multiple samples if we did not collect sufficient sediment in the first attempt. To measure water depth, we lowered a Secchi disk to the sediment–water interface with meter increments marked along the rope. The top 5 to 10 cm of sediment were collected using a Hongve gravity sampler. Amount of sediment retrieved (depth in cm) was recorded, and samples were described and stored in coolers with ice. Spatial coordinates of each sampling point were taken using a handheld GPS unit. At each site the presence or absence of cattle, pigs, geese, or other potential coprophilous fungal hosts were noted, and when present, their abundance was estimated qualitatively. It was not always clear whether cattle had access to the water’s edge, although access to the lakes is more probable at the western sites, where free-range grazing is more common.</p>

<title>Pollen analysis</title>
<p>In the lab, pollen and spores were extracted from the sediment using standard processing methods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0959683611425550">Faegri and Iversen, 1989</xref>). 10 ml of sediment was processed for each sample (20 ml for highly flocculent samples). To measure concentration, samples were spiked with <italic>Lycopodium</italic> tablets (stored in a calcium carbonate base) of known concentration (18 583 spores per tablet, 3 tablets = 55 749 ± 2292 spores added per sample).</p>
<p>For each sample, we performed a count of at least 350 grains (arboreal plants, herbs, aquatics, and fungi), identifying pollen types as well as <italic>Sporormiella</italic> and other coprophilous fungi. Modern reference materials and keys from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0959683611425550">Kapp et al. (2000)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0959683611425550">Doveri (2007)</xref> were used to identify pollen and fungal spores, respectively. Though rare, when <italic>Sporormiella</italic> was present in chains, spores were counted individually. Asci, the <italic>Sporormiella</italic> spore-bearing cells, were counted separately from spores and were excluded from the percent abundance and concentration data. Percent abundances were calculated relative to a sum consisting of all pollen and fungal types. Pollen and fungal concentrations were calculated by multiplying the ratio of counted pollen and spores to counted <italic>Lycopodium</italic> by the known concentration of <italic>Lycopodium</italic> spores (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0959683611425550">Stockmarr, 1971</xref>).</p>

<title>Other data sources and statistical analyses</title>
<p>We obtained climatic data from WorldClim (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0959683611425550">Hijmans et al., 2005</xref>), which consists of climatic averages calculated from weather station data for ad 1960 to 1990. We compiled county-level cattle density data from the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) National Agricultural Statistics Survey (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://quickstats.nass.usda.gov/">http://quickstats.nass.usda.gov/</ext-link>), by collecting the number of total beef and milk cows per county, reported at the end of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0959683611425550">2007</xref>. We then divided this by county area, resulting in individual cows/acre per county. We gathered lake depth and area from the Department of Natural Resources websites for each state. Information on the proportion of land area used as cropland and pasture is from the Global Agricultural Lands in the Year 2000 data set (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0959683611425550">Ramankutty et al., 2008</xref>). We used the ‘extract values to points’ function in ArcGIS version 9.1 by ESRI to assign the climatic and land use values to the lat/lon coordinates for each lake. This function uses bilinear interpolation to interpolate a value from the center of the grid cell to each target point. Because <italic>Sporormiella</italic> is thought to be a highly local indicator of grazing, the climatic and land use data at each point are the most relevant for these analyses.</p>
<p>We used multiple linear regression models to assess the relative importance of climate, county-level herbivore density, land use, and basin characteristics as predictors of the percent abundance and concentration of <italic>Sporormiella</italic>. We used a stepwise multiple linear regression model (StepAIC, specifying that the direction = ‘both’, in R version 2.10.1) which uses a combination of forward variable selection and backward elimination, assessing whether variables should be added or dropped after each stage of selection. Variable selection is based on the Akaike Information Criteria (AIC) measure of the goodness of fit of the model to the data. We square-root transformed the <italic>Sporormiella</italic> relative abundance and concentration data because it resulted in a more normal distribution. Normality was assessed based on inspection of histograms of distributions and Quantile-Quantile plots. The following potential predictor variables were included in the models: mean annual precipitation (MAP), mean annual temperature (MAT), precipitation of the wettest month, precipitation of the driest month, temperature of the warmest month, temperature of the coldest month, land use (percent pasture, based on raster data at a spatial scale of about 10 km), lake type (dammed versus natural), cattle per acre by county, lake area, lake maximum depth, and distance to shore (for the margin samples). We calculated a multiple linear regression model for each <italic>Sporormiella</italic>-related response variable (margin concentration, margin percent abundance, center concentration, center percent abundance). We then assessed statistical significance and variance explained by the models using <italic>p</italic>-values, <italic>r</italic><sup>2</sup>, and adjusted <italic>r</italic><sup>2</sup> values (which downweight <italic>r</italic><sup>2</sup> values for models with more predictor variables). To reduce the effects of co-linearity among climatic variables we ran an annual model which included MAP and MAT as climatic variables and a seasonal model which included precipitation of the wettest/driest months and temperature of the warmest/coldest months as alternatives to the annual climatic data.</p>

<p>Consistent with previous studies of the abundance of <italic>Sporormiella</italic> in historic sediments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0959683611425550">Cordova et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0959683611425550">Davis and Shafer, 2006</xref>), percent abundances of <italic>Sporormiella</italic> in the surface sediments are high at many sites.

<p>The following coprophilous fungi were also present in our samples: <italic>Podospora</italic>-type, and <italic>Coprinus</italic>-type, as well as fungi within the order Sordariales, some of which are coprophilous (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0959683611425550">Figure 2</xref> illustrates the three coprophilous types combined). We also identified <italic>Chaetomium</italic>, a cellulose decomposer, which is sometimes found on dung when mixed with straw (van Geel et al., 2003). Non-coprophilous fungal types identified include <italic>Fusarium</italic>, a common tree fungus, <italic>Neurospora, Aureobasidium</italic>-type, <italic>Panaeolus, Pleospora</italic>, and <italic>Ustulina</italic>. All other fungal spores not exhibiting defining features were counted but not identified to type.

Other pollen taxa show the expected east to west trends, with the percent abundance of arboreal taxa increasing to the east and the non-arboreal taxa declining in abundance. Among non-arboreal types there is a west-to-east transition from high percentages of <italic>Artemisia</italic> to <italic>Ambrosia</italic> and finally to <italic>Poaceae. Ambrosia</italic> abundances are highest in the middle of the transect, reaching up to 40% of the total pollen sum. Some western sites have a high percentage of <italic>Pinus</italic> which is likely due to long distance dispersal from the Black Hills of South Dakota because these sites are predominantly grassland.

<title>Climatic controls on <italic>Sporormiella</italic> abundance</title>
<p>Our results reveal several apparent correlations between climate and <italic>Sporormiella</italic> representation. The negative correlation between center percent abundance data and seasonal and annual precipitation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0959683611425550">Figure 5</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0959683611425550">Table 2</xref>) is somewhat surprising given that moisture is important in modern fungal community diversity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0959683611425550">Richardson, 2001</xref>); fungal diversity is higher in cool, moist conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0959683611425550">Wicklow and Angel, 1980</xref>) and one might expect that fungal abundances also would be higher in moist substrates. Several mechanisms might explain this relationship. First, climatic preferences vary among fungal taxa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0959683611425550">Richardson, 2001</xref>), so it is possible that <italic>Sporormiella</italic> is present but less abundant in moist environments. Alternatively, higher rainfall in the east might reduce the number of <italic>Sporormiella</italic> spores becoming airborne, reducing its dispersal distance and representation in lake sediments. Lastly, the negative relationship between relative abundances and precipitation simply may be an effect of the higher influx of arboreal pollen in the east, which drives down the relative abundance of <italic>Sporormiella</italic>. This interpretation is supported by the absence of significant correlation between <italic>Sporormiella</italic> lake-center concentrations and MAP.</p>

<sec id="section13-0959683611425550">
<title>Megaherbivore controls on Sporormiella abundance</title>
<p>County-level cattle density was a significant predictor of <italic>Sporormiella</italic> abundances, but only for the lake-margin relative abundance data and only when cattle density was included with distance-to-shore in a multiple linear regression model. This suggests that megaherbivore density is a significant influence on <italic>Sporormiella</italic> abundances, but that this effect can be obscured by other factors. One such factor may be differences in cattle husbandry within the Great Plains. Examination of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0959683611425550">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0959683611425550">2</xref> suggests that western counties with high cattle density may have higher <italic>Sporormiella</italic> abundances than eastern counties with high cattle density, although the sample size here is too small for this to be a statistically significant pattern. If so, this may reflect a shift from more open-range pasturing in the west to more fenced-in feedlots to the east. Clearly, information about local cattle densities around each lake would be preferable, but this information is difficult to obtain given the large range areas involved, the regional trend towards increasing absentee land ownership, and the difficulty of obtaining historical data over the several decades represented by these samples. We attempted on-site observations of cattle density, but are not confident in this as a measure of recent herbivore density.</p>

<sec id="section14-0959683611425550">
<title>Basin controls on Sporormiella abundance: within- and across-lake variation</title>
<p>The basin morphologic characteristics (lake depth, area, and basin type) are not strong predictor variables for <italic>Sporormiella</italic> variation. Similarly, differences in margin versus center sample data are not explained by these characteristics. One challenge is that some of these predictor variables are correlated across the transect (e.g. the frequency of dams increases to the west, pasture is more abundant to the west, etc.).</p>
<p>Our analyses suggest that the within-lake variations of <italic>Sporormiella</italic> are higher than for other pollen types. The data show no relationship between the lake-margin and lake-center abundances of <italic>Sporormiella</italic>, for both percent abundance and concentration data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0959683611425550">Figure 3</xref>). Conversely, similar analyses of key arboreal and non-arboreal taxa (<italic>Pinus, Quercus</italic>, and <italic>Ambrosia</italic>) reveal strong positive linear relationships between lake-margin and lake-center data (relative abundance: <italic>Pinus: p</italic> &lt; 0.001, <italic>r</italic><sup>2</sup> = 0.511; <italic>Quercus: p</italic> = 8.4 × 10<sup>−10</sup>, <italic>r</italic><sup>2</sup> = 0.8255; <italic>Ambrosia: p</italic> = 0.005, <italic>r</italic><sup>2</sup> = 0.308; concentration: <italic>Pinus: p</italic> &lt; 0.001, <italic>r</italic><sup>2</sup> = 0.47; <italic>Quercus: p</italic> = 9.83 × 10<sup>−9</sup>, <italic>r</italic><sup>2</sup> = 0.782; <italic>Ambrosia: p</italic> = 6.25 × 10<sup>−5</sup>, <italic>r</italic><sup>2</sup> = 0.525; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0959683611425550">Figure 3</xref>). Therefore we should be cautious in our interpretation of the <italic>Sporormiella</italic> data because of the various factors that influence its variability. Overall, various regression models explained less of the variation in the concentration data than in the relative abundance data. Pollen concentrations are strongly influenced by sedimentation rate and can vary by a factor of up to ten in a small lake basin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0959683611425550">Davis et al., 1973</xref>). This result is consistent with other reports that for heterogenous multilake data sets, relative abundances will be less noisy than concentration data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0959683611425550">Davis et al., 1973</xref>).</p>

<title>Comparison with previous work</title>
<p>A key predecessor to this work is <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0959683611425550">Raper and Bush (2009)</xref>, in which 15 lakes in ungrazed and grazed landscapes in central Florida were sampled to test the relationship between <italic>Sporormiella</italic> concentration and local cattle density. At each site a lake-center and lake-margin sample was analyzed, and for three lakes Raper and Bush collected a transect of four samples from lake-margin to lake-center (at 0, 20, 50, and 100 m from shoreline). They reported that <italic>Sporormiella</italic> concentrations were greater in lake-margin sediments where cattle grazed and <italic>Sporormiella</italic> was absent in the center samples of all lakes where cattle were absent. The intra-lake transects also showed that <italic>Sporormiella</italic> concentrations rapidly decreased within the first 20 m from shore.</p>
<p>Given the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0959683611425550">Raper and Bush (2009)</xref> findings, we were surprised to find a positive linear relationship between distance to shore and <italic>Sporormiella</italic> concentrations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0959683611425550">Figure 4</xref>). Although the reason for this discrepancy is not known with certainty, there are some likely possibilities. First, the effect of shoreline proximity on <italic>Sporormiella</italic> representation may be limited to very short distances from shoreline. In the within-lake transects of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0959683611425550">Raper and Bush (2009)</xref>, the decrease in <italic>Sporormiella</italic> abundances is limited to samples collected at the shoreline versus samples collected 20 m from shore; no trend in <italic>Sporormiella</italic> abundances is apparent at distances beyond 20 m (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0959683611425550">Raper and Bush, 2009</xref>: <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0959683611425550">figure 5</xref>). Similarly, both this paper and the interlake analyses from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0959683611425550">Raper and Bush (2009)</xref> show no significant relationship between <italic>Sporormiella</italic> concentrations between nearshore and center-lake samples (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0959683611425550">Raper and Bush, 2009</xref>: figure 8). These findings together suggest that interlake variations in <italic>Sporormiella</italic> concentrations are strongly affected by differences in basin morphology and hence sediment focusing. This conclusion is consistent with prior studies showing high variation in pollen concentrations and accumulation rates within and among lakes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0959683611425550">Davis et al., 1973</xref>); our analyses suggest that these variations are even more pronounced for locally produced and weakly dispersed <italic>Sporormiella</italic> than for other regionally dispersed pollen types (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0959683611425550">Figure 3</xref>). Perhaps larger lakes exhibit more sediment focusing and hence concentrate <italic>Sporormiella</italic> more at the center. It would be valuable to collect more within-lake transects as done by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0959683611425550">Raper and Bush (2009)</xref> as well as collect short cores to observe how the <italic>Sporormiella</italic> signature of the European reintroduction of megaherbivores varies within lakes.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0959683611425550">Raper and Bush (2009)</xref> hypothesized that climatic changes that produced rising lake level could be responsible for the Late-Pleistocene <italic>Sporormiella</italic> declines, by increasing the distance from the lake center to the <italic>Sporormiella</italic> source. As discussed above, we suggest that this effect of shoreline position on <italic>Sporormiella</italic> abundances may be limited to very short distances, i.e. within 20 m of shoreline. However, our finding that center percent abundance of <italic>Sporormiella</italic> decreases with increasing precipitation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0959683611425550">Figure 5</xref>) may support the Raper and Bush hypothesis via another mechanism, i.e. decreased aridity might increase the influx of arboreal pollen types and thereby drive down the relative abundances of <italic>Sporormiella</italic>. This mechanism should affect the relative abundance data only, not <italic>Sporormiella</italic> concentrations, so the reality of apparent declines in <italic>Sporormiella</italic> relative abundances should be checked against trends in concentration data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0959683611425550">Gill et al., 2009</xref>). Note that <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0959683611425550">Faith (2011)</xref> has suggested that increasing aridity might also be implicated in the Late-Pleistocene megafaunal declines in North America, via its effects on nitrogen cycling and plant nitrogen content.</p>
<p>Our paper generally supports the conclusions by others that <italic>Sporormiella</italic> is a highly localized signal of grazing. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0959683611425550">Raper and Bush (2009)</xref> reported a positive association between cattle density (per meter of shoreline) and <italic>Sporormiella</italic> concentrations in shoreline sediments. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0959683611425550">Davis and Shafer (2006)</xref> showed that <italic>Sporormiella</italic> is abundant in historic sediments and archaeological sites where livestock were once abundant. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0959683611425550">Graf and Chmura (2006)</xref> reveal that coprophilous fungi are in highest abundance in manured/grazed landscapes, while <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0959683611425550">Blackford and Innes (2006)</xref> found similar results in grazed woodland environments.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>This study shows that <italic>Sporormiella</italic> representation in lake sediments is influenced by multiple factors, including but not limited to megaherbivore densities. Other key factors include aridity (mainly through its effect on the abundances of other pollen types) and within-lake sedimentary processes. Within-lake variations for <italic>Sporormiella</italic> are higher than for other pollen types, confirming prior reports that <italic>Sporormiella</italic> dispersal and deposition is highly localized. <italic>Sporormiella</italic> concentrations appear to be more influenced by local sedimentary processes than <italic>Sporormiella</italic> relative abundances, consistent with prior studies of the deposition and resuspension of pollen within lakes. Although the widely observed <italic>Sporormiella</italic> declines in Late-Pleistocene and Holocene sediments may well be linked to the global wave of megafaunal extinctions, the results of this study point to the possible influence of other factors, and more work is needed to understand the factors controlling the representation of <italic>Sporormiella</italic> in lake sediments. Key steps forward include more process-based studies of <italic>Sporormiella</italic> transport to and within lakes, and more studies of <italic>Sporormiella</italic> representation within lakes, using additional regional-scale analyses, within-lake transects, and short cores spanning the historic re-introduction of domesticated herbivores.</p>
