<p>Breithaupt’s central claim is that “empathy can be regarded as a mechanism for strengthening a decision” (2012, p. 87). My concern is that it is not clear what is meant by “strengthen.” Does empathy merely give more motivational “oomph” to a decision already made, or does it strengthen a decision in the normative sense—does it give more reason for the decision?</p>

<p>To begin with, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1754073911421386">Fritz Breithaupt (2012)</xref> outlines what he calls a “three-step” model of empathy. (This is not to be confused with the three-person model of empathy.) Step 1 claims that we humans are “hyper-empathetic”; we have a tendency to empathize with all sorts of people (and things) in all sorts of ways, sometimes at considerable disadvantage to ourselves. Step 2 is the process by which the hypertrophy of empathy is damped down or blocked. Step 3 is the mechanism which unblocks or bypasses the blocking mechanism. This part of the article is highly schematic and general, not really distinguishing the variety of kinds of empathy (“a slew of potential mechanisms” [2012, p. 85]; “a range of different control mechanisms” [2012, p. 86]), and accordingly I will not discuss it in any detail, except perhaps to comment that, given the generality of the claims, it is hard to make out how the “model” can be predictive: it “predicts that human empathy is the strongest (be it in terms of intensity or duration) when it is paired with secondary mental activities that help to bypass the blocking mechanisms of empathy” (2012, p. 86).</p>
<p>Having outlined his three-step model, the article continues with the central discussion about the role of empathy in side-taking in situations of conflict. Breithaupt’s central claim is that “empathy can be regarded as a mechanism for strengthening a decision” (2012, p. 87). My concern is that it is not clear what is meant by “strengthen.”</p>
<p>The first comment is that this seems far too simple an account of what the role of empathy is when one is observing or otherwise engaged with some kind of conflict or competition. For one thing, the claim is at such a high level of generality, concerning all kinds of conflict, from sport to a legal conflict between two persons or two corporations, and concerning all kinds of empathy, from low-level resonance mechanisms to high-level imaginative projects. There is no argument why we should consider that empathy operates in the same way, or even in roughly the same way, in every kind of case. At one extreme might be the occasion where one switches on the television to watch a football match where one has no idea who is playing who, and, so to speak, “waits to see” which side one supports. Here, empathy might play a role in forming a decision about which side to take, rather than “strengthening” a decision already taken. At the other extreme are the occasions where one goes to court to hear a witness for the plaintiff, where you yourself have already taken sides with the defence, who happens to be your husband. Here, it would be surprising if your lack of empathy with the plaintiff “strengthened” your decision to take the side of your husband, as if you were not so sure he was in the right until you failed to empathize with the other side. Secondly, and relatedly, one might think that empathy operates in many other ways in a three-person model, other than as a mechanism for “strengthening” a decision. As Breithaupt himself notes, citing references, “It has been shown that empathy is significantly influenced by fairness perceptions,” so the extent to which one empathizes with one or other of the protagonists will here depend on prior fairness judgments.</p>
<p>Most important here, is the question of having reasons which justify one’s taking one side or another, which do not apply in at all the same way with sport. What exactly is meant by “strengthen”? One possibility is that it simply means the extent to which one happens to take one side against the other; this is the sport model and it may well be that empathy does sometimes work in the way suggested. But in the other kind of case, “strength” could be taken to mean something normative, to do with reasons as such. I do not find Breithaupt to be clear on this. At one point he says that empathy can lead to a “justification of one’s choice” (2012, p. 88), and the abstract says “justify her/his earlier side-taking” (2012, p. 84). But later this seems to be qualified as “quasijustify,” whatever exactly that might be. Let us consider an example.</p>
<p>Some philosophers have argued that abortion fits what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1754073911421386">Breithaupt (2012)</xref> calls the three-person model.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1754073911421386">1</xref></sup> Let us assume that it does. In this imagined case, you know that an unmarried woman wants to have an abortion, and you believe on balance that she would be wrong to do so, as she has no health reasons for her decision. Then you find out that the only reason why she wants an abortion is because having the child will get in the way of her planned skiing vacation. You now have more reason to think that she would be wrong to have that abortion, for you now have information that you did not have; your decision is, in just that sense, “strengthened” by what you now know. The question here is whether empathy can play that kind of normative reason-giving role, and if so, how. Does it merely give more motivational “oomph” to a decision already made, or does it strengthen the decision in the normative sense—does it give more reason for the decision? Few would doubt the possibility of the former on some occasions, but what about the latter? To answer this question, the sports model is irrelevant.</p>
