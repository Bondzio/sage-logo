<abstract>
<p>Media attention to genetically modified (GM) foods has been described as negative, especially in Europe. At the turn of the century appreciation of GM foods was at an all-time low in Europe. Food manufacturers are still careful in the use, development and communication of GM based food products, and their caution influences innovation processes. In this study we explore the link between media attention and innovation practice. Media attention to three specific high-profile GM food cases is described and linked to innovation practice. We elucidate the order of events in these cases and show that publics could only to a limited extent have formed an opinion on GM based food products based on scientifically valid data through written English media. Innovators in food biotechnology may benefit from this knowledge for future product development and marketing, and we suggest that innovation may benefit from early stakeholder involvement and communication activities.</p>

<title>1. Introduction</title>
<sec id="section2-0963662512458631">
<title>Study context</title>
<p>This study analyses three well known cases of media attention to genetically modified (GM) foods, dating back to the late 1990s. To our knowledge, no investigation on the longitudinal release in time of media articles in specific cases of GM foods has yet been published. We will show the number of media articles in English language written press and the appearance of scientifically valid data related to the cases on a quarterly basis. We elaborate on the extent to which publics may have been able to be informed about the outcome of these cases through the written press. We will briefly describe the course and order of events in these three cases of GM agriculture. The cases were chosen as they have been described and analysed in literature before (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0963662512458631">Marks et al., 2007</xref>): they occurred when public appreciation of biotechnology food products was at an all-time low level around 2000 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0963662512458631">Gaskell et al., 2006</xref>), they received a high level of media attention and they attracted extensive scientific review after initial publication. We look for characteristics in these cases, indicating the role of non-governmental organisations (NGOs) and highlighting the scientific response to controversies that initiated a steep increase in media attention. The first case regards the Monarch butterfly, which was claimed to be endangered by pollen of GM corn (May 1999). The second case describes the GM potato which was suggested to pose severe health risks (August 1998). The final case involves the possibly allergenic StarLink corn variety (September 2000).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0963662512458631">1</xref></sup></p>
<p>With our analysis we aim to illustrate that the public has been able to read about the scientific outcome of these cases in written English media articles only to a very limited extent, which may likely have hampered a balanced opinion forming about these biotechnological applications. After a description and analysis of the media representation of the cases, we will discuss the possible impact of GM technology related media attention to innovation practices in industry.</p>

<title>Media attention to GM foods</title>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0963662512458631">Listerman (2010)</xref> recently deliberated on the framing of biotechnology in opinion-leading newspapers. He aimed “to prove that the public biotechnology issue can be more thoroughly understood by a combined analysis of article and argument level [of newspaper articles, SF], which should hold true for other public issues as well” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0963662512458631">Listerman, 2010</xref>: 13). He analysed newspaper coverage in opinion-leading newspapers on a monthly basis “to grasp these short but highly relevant phases of increased media attention” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0963662512458631">Listerman, 2010</xref>: 5). Our paper expands on the work of Listerman and provides further insight into the knowledge needed for a public understanding of science, by exploring three specific cases of past biotechnology controversies, and indicating that the public was hardly able to learn the scientifically valid ‘facts’ behind these cases.</p>
<p>So far, the literature on media coverage has not provided much detailed data on the amount of coverage on specific issues in biotechnology. Listerman observed an increase, peak and decrease in media coverage. However, he did not provide convincing data to support this claim for <italic>specific</italic> issues in biotechnology. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0963662512458631">Nisbet and Huge (2006)</xref> have demonstrated cycles of increased and decreased media attention to plant biotechnology, but did not consider the attention to individual cases. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0963662512458631">Bauer and Gaskell (2002)</xref> have shown a gradual increase in media coverage of biotechnology until the year 1996. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0963662512458631">Shanahan et al. (2001)</xref> have demonstrated an increase in media coverage of agricultural biotechnology until 2000, with a fast rising of attention between 1997 and 2000. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0963662512458631">McInerney et al. (2004)</xref> showed a peak in coverage of GM food in 2000, in a study investigating publication patterns between 1992 and 2002. In this article, we will go one step further and show media attention on a case by case basis, including also an investigation of the relevant scientific claims.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0963662512458631">Listerman (2010</xref>: 5) stated that “[p]ublic attention, as well as news media attention to an issue is limited to a short period of time: the attention increases, ‘peaks,’ and then decreases again”. He refers here to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0963662512458631">Downs (1972)</xref>, who also made this statement, but then in relation to ecology. Downs’ study aimed to show how long public attention is likely to remain sufficiently focused upon any given issue to generate enough political pressure to cause effective change. He proposed an “issue-attention cycle”, describing the dynamics of attention for certain public issues (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0963662512458631">Newig, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0963662512458631">Nisbet and Huge, 2006</xref>). Five stages are distinguished, and environmental concern is taken as an example. In the first, pre-problem stage, a highly undesirable social condition exists but has not captured much public attention. In the subsequent alarmed discovery and euphoric enthusiasm stage the public becomes aware and alarmed about the drawbacks of the particular topic. In the third stage stakeholders start realising the costs of solving the problems will be very high. Hereafter, A gradual decline in intense public (and possibly also media) interest follows as a fourth stage. The final stage is the post-problem stage, where issues have been moved from the centre of public concern. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0963662512458631">Newig (2004)</xref> has confirmed the existence of discernible issue-attention cycles, however only for various public issues unrelated to agricultural biotechnology.</p>
<p>In our analysis we will not focus on political pressure. Instead we will discuss the effect Downs’ proposed issue dynamics may have on innovation development in the field of industrial food biotechnology. We will describe our three cases in relation to Downs’ issue-attention cycle, and identify their common factors in terms of the cycle pattern. The analysis will provide the basis for a discussion on the role of the media in innovation practices, and for our subsequent recommendations. By linking the media attention to the appearance of key scientific articles in these cases, and by elaborating on the role of NGOs and industry, we suggest that industry could be more proactive in seeking media coverage for GM based industrial applications throughout the innovation process.</p>

<title>2. Methodology</title>
<p>The order of events in our three cases is described and linked to the level of media attention in English written press. The number of general press articles on the three cases was determined using the Dow Jones Factiva database (accessed between January and March 2008).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0963662512458631">2</xref></sup> Using specific search queries we only selected for the number of articles related to the three cases matching the queries on a quarter of a year basis for eight years, starting in January 1998, ending in December 2004. The option “Search for free-text terms in Full Article” was selected in searching in the Factiva database. We used specific search queries to assess media attention levels in exact numbers of unique articles matching the query, while minimising false positives (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0963662512458631">Table 1</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0963662512458631">3</xref></sup> Also, we included as many media as possible in which people could learn about these specific agricultural biotechnological events. A manual inspection was carried out to exclude double counting of articles.</p>

<p>Hereafter we briefly illustrate how the tone of voice in media articles has changed in time. We explicitly do not wish to carry out an additional media framing study for agricultural biotechnology articles. Framing media attention is beyond the scope of our investigation for it demands specialist analyses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0963662512458631">Scheufele, 1999</xref>), and moreover studies investigating biotechnology media coverage have already been carried out (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0963662512458631">Hornig Priest and Ten Eyck, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0963662512458631">Kalaitzandonakes et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0963662512458631">Marks et al., 2003</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0963662512458631">2007</xref>). Instead, we exemplify with illustrative examples how tone of voice may have changed over time. After this brief analysis we compare the course of events in all three cases by illustrating to what extent the cases fit Downs’ issue-attention cycle.</p>

<title>The Monarch butterfly case</title>
<p>In May 1999 an entomologist, Dr. Losey, working at Cornell University, New York, published his laboratory research on the effect of the GM corn variety “Event 176”, a <italic>Bacillus thuringiensis</italic> (Bt) corn with the insecticidal protein “Cry1Ab”, on the non-target larvae of the Monarch butterfly in North America (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0963662512458631">Losey et al., 1999</xref>). These larvae feed on the leaves of milkweed, a weed present in and around corn fields. While the GM corn described in this particular case was designed to have insecticidal effects against the crop-spoiling corn borer, the effect on other (non-target) insects (such as Monarch butterflies) was until then largely uninvestigated.</p>
<p>In his laboratory study, Losey dusted milkweed leaves with Event 176 pollen and subsequently placed Monarch butterfly larvae on the leaves. In four days, half of the larvae population had died, in contrast to the control experiments with leaves covered with normal corn pollen and without pollen, where all larvae survived. The paper concludes that “with the amount of Bt corn planted in the US projected to increase markedly over the next few years, it is imperative that we gather the data necessary to evaluate the risk associated with this new agrotechnology and to compare the risks with those proposed by pesticides and other pest-control tactics” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0963662512458631">Losey et al., 1999</xref>: 214).</p>
<p>Within days after Losey’s scientific publication, newspapers published stories on how the Monarch butterflies “may be imperilled”, how toxic pollen “could kill” them and that GM corn “was shown to kill” them (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0963662512458631">Table 2</xref>). NGOs quickly picked up on the subject: in June 1999 Greenpeace protesters at a European Union council meeting (while Monarch butterflies and GM crops are mainly present in North America and not in Europe) held banners stating “Give Butterflies a Chance”. In the following months, newspapers reported that the situation was not as severe as was previously proposed. Scientists stated that the butterflies may even survive (also <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0963662512458631">Table 2</xref>).</p>

<p>But the initial scientific publication by John Losey contained only partial data. For example, it was not investigated which part of the total population of Monarch butterflies was actually endangered. The amount of larvae present in nature during the time pollen of GM corn is present, the amount of larvae feeding near GM fields or elsewhere, the minimal required dosage of Cry1Ab to be lethal, the effect of other corn varieties (not Event 176) on larvae survival, and a number of other facts required for a thorough risk assessment were uninvestigated and largely unknown until August 2001, when a publication appeared on the impact of Bt corn pollen on Monarch butterfly populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0963662512458631">Sears et al., 2001</xref>). This publication states that “[t]his 2-year study suggests that the impact of <italic>Bt</italic> corn pollen from current commercial hybrids on monarch butterfly populations is negligible” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0963662512458631">Sears et al., 2001</xref>: 11937). This publication answers the call in Losey’s paper for gathering more relevant information for risk evaluation. Further publications on the Monarch butterfly were summarised in 2002 by the PEW Initiative on Food and Biotechnology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0963662512458631">PEW, 2002</xref>: 14–15), who concluded:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>A type of Bt corn with a particular genetic combination known as Event 176 made by Novartis […] proved capable of harming some larvae because of high levels of toxin in its pollen. This particular type of corn never gained a significant market share because the Bt toxin isn’t expressed well in the corn stalk and as a result isn’t particularly effective […]. In 2000 Syngenta announced its decision to phase its Event 176 Bt corn out of the market. The registration for the Event 176 Bt corn expired on April 1, 2001 […]. “The only pollen showing severe toxicity to monarch larvae was Event 176 […] Bt11 corn was the next most concentrated in pollen, at one-hundredth the amount of toxin in Event 176 pollen. At 1,000 grains or more of Bt11 pollen per square centimeter, we did not show mortality. At 4,000 grains or more per square centimeter, the leaf surface was so dusty the larvae wouldn’t eat it and they starved regardless of whether it was Bt pollen or not.”</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The media attention analysis shows a large increase in number of publications on the Monarch butterfly in relation to GM corn in the period the initial article by Losey was published. Then a gradual decrease can be observed, until a minimum is reached approximately three years later (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0963662512458631">Figure 1</xref>). The scientific evidence demonstrating that the risks for Monarch butterflies are minimal appears in a period where media attention to the subject had already decreased to a minimum; the results of the evidence based scientific response do not seem to lead to an increase in the number of media articles.</p>

<title>The GM potato case</title>
<p>Cambridge Agricultural Genetics (CAG) had manufactured a genetically engineered potato that contains a lectin protein (acting against crop infection) from the snowdrop plant. A researcher at the Rowett Research Institute (RRI) in Aberdeen, Dr. Pusztai, carried out toxicity experiments with these potatoes on rats for the CAG. His research showed that the rats’ growth was impaired and some rats died after an increasingly longer diet of solely raw GM potatoes.</p>
<p>Without the research officially being finished and published, Pusztai was asked for his opinion on transgenic plants in general in a television documentary (<italic>World in Action</italic>, a current affairs series produced by Granada Television in the UK) on 10 August 1998, where he stated that he would not eat GM foods. Two days later he was suspended by the RRI. One year later, in October 1999, his research was published in <italic>The Lancet</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0963662512458631">Ewen and Pusztai, 1999</xref>), together with a critical review by other scientists in the same volume (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0963662512458631">Various Authors, 1999</xref>): the comments indicate the poor quality of Pusztai’s research; on the basis of a number of medical scientific arguments his research was discredited.</p>
<p>In February 1999 the British government resisted calls for a moratorium on GM foods. This same month, <italic>The Guardian</italic> published that some 20 researchers declared that they supported Pusztai’s findings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0963662512458631">Gillard et al., 1999</xref>), but at the same time his research was discredited in the UK newspaper <italic>The Independent</italic>: a biologist stated that because potato plants of the first generation were used (F1, grown directly from a single GM cell, known to contain more natural toxins), rather than plants of the next generations, the inhibition of growth in laboratory animals was to be expected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0963662512458631">Connor, 1999</xref>). The investigated potato was never introduced on the market: development ended before commercialisation.</p>
<p>The media attention analysis for this case shows an increase in attention around February 1999 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0963662512458631">Figure 2</xref>), two quarters after Pusztai’s media appearance, but also eight months prior to the official publication of the results in scientific literature. As in the case of the Monarch butterfly, a gradual decrease in media attention is observed. By the time validation of the scientific facts in the Pusztai potato case appeared, media attention had already decreased.</p>

<title>The StarLink corn case</title>
<p>In May 1998 the GM corn variety “StarLink”, produced by Plant Genetic Systems (later part of Aventis, currently of Bayer CropScience), was approved for use in industrial processes including animal feed by the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), who recognised the benefits of this particular crop. Although the corn was never meant for human consumption, in September 2000 traces of the StarLink corn variety were detected in the US food supply, by the Genetically Engineered Food Alert (GEFA), an organisation with a critical stance towards GM foods.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0963662512458631">4</xref></sup> GEFA claimed that the Cry9C protein, the active insecticidal component of StarLink corn, could be an allergen. The allergenic effect was later supported in a report by Friends of the Earth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0963662512458631">Freese, 2001</xref>). Newspapers spoke of the StarLink “scandal” and of the dangers of GM crops (see e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0963662512458631">Ivanovich, 2000</xref>).</p>
<p>In June 2001 the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention published that at least 28 people had experienced allergic reactions after eating StarLink corn (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0963662512458631">CDC, 2001</xref>). Yet all these persons tested negative for Cry9C antibodies, which indicates that the allergic reactions could not have been caused by the added insecticidal component. In 2003 and 2004 other research was published in medical journals showing that StarLink corn had no adverse effects on human health (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0963662512458631">Sutton et al., 2003</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0963662512458631">2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0963662512458631">Siruguri et al., 2004</xref>). Aventis withdrew its registration for StarLink corn in December 2000, effective February 2001, hence it is not grown. In October 2007, the EPA proposed to stop testing for StarLink in the currently produced and exported corn stack (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0963662512458631">EPA, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>The media attention analysis shows an immediate response by the media when GEFA presented their report in September 2000 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0963662512458631">Figure 3</xref>). Since the report appeared a gradual decrease in publications is again observed. By the time scientific evidence is presented on the validity of the initial case, media attention has decreased to a minimum. The initial approval of StarLink corn in 1998 did not trigger much media attention.</p>

<title>Online media</title>
<p>The absolute number of articles per quarter is given for the three cases and serves as an indication of trends. Several authors have indicated that the general tone of voice in biotechnology related media articles can be described as negative, especially in Europe (see e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0963662512458631">Hornig Priest and Ten Eyck, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0963662512458631">Kalaitzandonakes et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0963662512458631">Marks et al., 2003</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0963662512458631">2007</xref>). Although we did not aim to make a thorough assessment of the tone of voice of different media, we were interested in whether there were any signs of changes detectable over time in the general tone of voice related to these specific cases. To illustrate this, online media website archives were accessed (<italic>New York Times, Science Daily</italic>, Greenpeace media website, <italic>Guardian UK</italic> and BBC news website archives, accessed between January 2008 and March 2008), for a brief analysis of news releases during the Monarch butterfly case.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0963662512458631">Table 2</xref> gives a brief, limited, but illustrative overview of news headings in online media. It shows that initial framing may be considered as negative (with words like imperil, kill, toxic), and that the tone gradually changes to indicate a more nuanced view (discuss, new data, evidence, debate). While many have claimed a general negative tone of voice in lay press articles about modern agricultural biotechnology, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0963662512458631">Table 2</xref> indicates that on a case specific basis a different trend can be observed.</p>

<sec id="section11-0963662512458631">
<title>Downs’ issue-attention cycle and the three biotechnology cases</title>
<p>We analysed the development of media attention in the three cases through Downs’ issue-attention cycle. In our media cases we recognise this first stage, an “undesirable social condition, but has not yet captured much public attention, even though some experts or interest groups may already be alarmed by it” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0963662512458631">Downs, 1972</xref>: 39), as the phase before the media attention starts to increase: no specific events have occurred that generate much coverage. This may explain the lag phase in media response in the GM potato case. Experts were alarmed (television appearance of Dr. Pusztai), but there is not immediately a large increase in media attention, for the first real controversy (when the UK government deliberated on a call for a GM foods moratorium) was yet to arrive (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0963662512458631">Figure 2</xref>). In the StarLink corn case, something similar can be observed: after official approval in 1998, there is only very little media attention. Only after the appearance of the controversy (allergenic StarLink discovered in food), media attention suddenly increases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0963662512458631">Figure 3</xref>).</p>
<p>Subsequently, the second stage has been characterised by Downs as a stage with “alarmed discovery”, with an increase in media attention and a peak afterwards. But, instead of this pattern, also mentioned by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0963662512458631">Listerman (2010)</xref>, we observe an instant peak. This media-hype-like behaviour is often accompanied by self-reinforcing news waves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0963662512458631">Vasterman, 2005</xref>): issue reporting in high-profile papers may incite other, smaller papers to pick up on the issues and report about them also, creating fast positive feedback loops. This may also be occurring in the initial phase of increase in media attention in our cases. No preselected newspapers were used for this analysis, but instead the complete Factiva database was used, so we may see the effect of smaller newspapers picking up on an issue after the more prominent ones, which may result in a faster occurring peak. In any case, the more sources that report on the news, more people could have learned about these cases.</p>
<p>Also, in this second phase, the alarmed discovery is not (as suggested by Downs) “[…] invariably accompanied by euphoric enthusiasm about society’s ability to ‘solve this problem’ or ‘do something effective’ within a relatively short time” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0963662512458631">Downs, 1972</xref>: 39). An opposite view was observed in the brief tone of voice analysis. At the time public opinion analysis also shows a minimum in public optimism about biotechnology around 1999, the time at which the three cases occurred (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0963662512458631">Gaskell et al., 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>Downs distinguished the third stage of the issue-attention cycle as the stage where people are starting to realise that the cost of “solving” the problem would be very high. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0963662512458631">Listerman (2010)</xref> has argued that increased media attention to an issue may create a stronger ethical discussion, public discourse and scientific-economic discourse. However, neither of these responses seems to have a strong problem solving character. Our discussions in industry reinforce this point, since interviewees have mentioned that in the discussion about food biotechnology it is not necessarily about “solving the problem” but more about “coping with the issue”. Ongoing media coverage also supports this view: we have observed in the media analysis that after a specific event takes place, media attention increases rapidly, within one quarter, and then slowly decreases to almost no attention for the case at all, which takes over two years. This indicates that the issue has not been resolved.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0963662512458631">Table 2</xref> illustrates that the discourse in the media moves from strongly normative and emotive to more moderate and factual in different online article headings in time. In contrast, several studies have demonstrated that the general tone of voice about biotechnology is negative, specifically in Europe and regarding agricultural biotechnology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0963662512458631">Hornig Priest and Ten Eyck, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0963662512458631">Kalaitzandonakes et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0963662512458631">Marks et al., 2003</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0963662512458631">2007</xref>). Over the total period that was analysed in this study we observed that media attention is highest in the quarters directly after the initial events, and these media articles generally cover the controversy rather than the debate. The media articles that appear after the scientific data are available (invalidating the initial findings) seem to be more moderate in tone of voice, but considerably lower in absolute numbers. A general analysis of all articles would logically find a general negative framing, overlooking the change in tone.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0963662512458631">5</xref></sup></p>
<p>The pros and cons of food biotechnology are probably being weighed in this third stage (by e.g. journalists, publics and others), while the technology itself has not changed. Scientists are also picking up on the topic, and more research is conducted to investigate the scientific fundamentals of the StarLink corn, Pusztai and Monarch cases, to make scientifically valid claims. Subsequently we have entered the fourth stage of the cycle: a gradual decline in “intense public interest” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0963662512458631">Downs, 1972</xref>: 40). A decrease in public interest or optimism cannot be validated based on our data, but we do observe a gradual decrease in media coverage in all three cases discussed above.</p>
<p>The fifth and final stage of the issue-attention cycle, the post-problem stage is described as a “twilight realm of lesser attention or spasmodic recurrences of interest” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0963662512458631">Downs, 1972</xref>: 40). Media attention has moved elsewhere. These spasmodic recurrences may indicate why attention does not always decrease gradually, but why the graphs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0963662512458631">Figures 1</xref><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0963662512458631"/>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0963662512458631">3</xref>) show some fluctuations in media attention.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-0963662512458631">
<title>Common factors in the three case studies</title>
<p>Initially, an event relating to a food biotechnology controversy triggers media attention to increase to a maximum within the first quarter for all three cases. Hereafter, media attention gradually decreases to a minimum over the course of several years. Furthermore, the cases show that at least a year after the first decline in media attention, scientific data emerge that may substantiate the journalists’ claims that initially triggered the media hype. Or even nullify these claims, for the scientific data in these cases all show that there was no proven danger from these food products. Nevertheless, the further development of these products was halted, or the present products were retrieved from the market.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section13-0963662512458631">
<title>The public can learn about the outcome of the cases through written media only to a limited extent</title>
<p>Once the scientific foundations for making substantiated claims about risks were present, there seems to be complete radio silence between all related stakeholders. Our interpretation of this phenomenon is as follows. NGOs were silent, as the scientific data did not substantiate their claims. Industry that developed/sold the technology was silent, for they might be concerned not to create another media hype and/or NGO activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0963662512458631">Van Lelyveld, 2008</xref>). Scientists involved in validating the claims published in scientific journals and in reports for the institutions they work for, but not in popular media. Media do not cover much of the new evidence; there is no rise in media attention to the topics, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0963662512458631">Nisbet and Huge (2006)</xref> have also indicated. Apparently none of the other actors made a move to make the new scientific findings newsworthy or the media were not interested in opening the debate on the issue again.</p>
<p>While we can only speculate about the causality of the above, there is an important logical consequence of this stakeholder silence: the public could only to a limited extent have learned about the outcome of the cases through written media articles. We acknowledge that media attention cannot be directly linked to public opinion, which of course, is a result of many inputs and reflections on the topic. Yet, media coverage is a source of information and framing can influence opinion forming. Considering that public appreciation of GM foods was at an all-time low at the time of these three cases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0963662512458631">Gaskell et al., 2006</xref>) while media attention was high, it seems likely that the initial media articles with their questions and negative tone still lingered in people’s minds, for these articles were larger in number and more people were likely to have read them about the subject. Possibly negative perceptions were reinforced by the fact that most GM products were taken from the supermarket shelves when obligatory labelling was established in the EU in 2004 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0963662512458631">Sleenhoff and Osseweijer, 2008</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section14-0963662512458631">
<title>Attention increases rapidly and decreases for individual cases, not for the general topic of GM food technology</title>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0963662512458631">Thomas Listerman (2010)</xref> stated that attention for issues increases, peaks and then decreases again. Our analysis shows that the cycle metaphor for media attention cannot be properly demonstrated for food biotechnology, but it does apply for specific issue-related cases, like the GM food cases that are described above. Also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0963662512458631">Newig (2004)</xref> found this particular issue based cycle rather than a general public issue cycle (pertaining e.g. to meta-level issues like environmental sustainability, public health and safety). Nevertheless, the cycle patterns seem to be unlike those described by the dynamics of the issue-attention cycle by Downs. Our analysis suggests that instead of a pre- roblem stage for any specific issue, there is a ubiquitous public awareness of the general risks of food biotechnology. Under this heightened “state of alert”, any relevant incident may trigger a sudden increase in public and media attention.</p>
<p>Downs stated that “problems that have gone through the cycle almost always receive a higher average level of attention, public effort and general concern than those still in the pre-discovery stage” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0963662512458631">1972</xref>: 41). This suggests that when a certain issue has reached the post-problem stage in the issue-attention cycle, a related problem is more likely to be picked up by the media and the public. This may explain why the last of the three cases in time (StarLink corn) receives more media attention than the preceding cases.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section15-0963662512458631">
<title>Scientists could have spoken up</title>
<p>In all the cases described, the scientific data that appeared several years after the triggering event showed no health risk of the studied products. Scientists in academia and industry could have been more active in demonstrating this in the public domain, to get rid of speculation on the alleged risks that initiated the sudden increase in media attention, and to provide readers with more factual information on the topics. We do not imply that more valid scientific facts contribute to a more positive public attitude towards GM foods (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0963662512458631">Wynne, 2006</xref>). Yet still, while acknowledging that normative arguments may be as valid as scientific facts for the formation of public opinion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0963662512458631">Harremoës et al., 2001</xref>), more nuanced public opinion on GM foods is unlikely to occur with only negatively framed and scientifically incorrect media articles.</p>
<p>Also we do not assume that a public knowledge deficit could or should be overcome by scientists educating publics (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0963662512458631">Wynne, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0963662512458631">Cook et al., 2004</xref>). Merely, we argue that issue-attention cycles are unlikely to close if the correct data are not properly communicated by appropriate stakeholders. As scientists are the prime stakeholders who have the most up-to-date knowledge, one may expect them to reach out. However, possibly there was no incentive for scientists and the question arises who should communicate what, and to whom. While we cannot suggest the best way forward in this discussion, we reflect on our findings in the light of recently published public engagement approaches (see e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0963662512458631">Lengwiler, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0963662512458631">Delgado et al., 2010</xref>) below.</p>

<title>Publicity which may halt innovation is a concern for industry</title>
<p>While from a scientific point of view there was a low risk from the products described in the three cases, their innovation trajectories were stopped by their developers nonetheless, presumably largely due to the negative publicity. Of course, companies are careful not to risk their corporate and product brands, since they are important corporate assets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0963662512458631">Aaker and Jacobson, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0963662512458631">Van Riel and Fombrun, 2007</xref>). Companies continue to be careful in their communication regarding controversial scientific topics, not only in the genomics based industry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0963662512458631">Henderson et al., 2007</xref>), but also in e.g. the chemicals industry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0963662512458631">Burningham et al., 2007</xref>). It appears that many industrial genomics based innovation development processes have been slowed down, halted, or moved to other parts of the world because of concerns over public or political resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0963662512458631">Hodgson, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0963662512458631">Van Ooyen, 2009</xref>), and (GM related) public perception continues to be part of corporate investment prospectuses in the field of biotechnology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0963662512458631">Shields, 2008</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section17-0963662512458631">
<title>A vicious circle</title>
<p>The discussion above illustrates that a vicious circle is in place. It appears that several innovators are hesitant to talk about GM based food technologies and are cautious to market them as being GM. Also, there are only a few GM products available now on the EU market. Of the more than 100 (voluntarily) GM labelled products available in Dutch supermarkets in 2005 only 18 were found in 2008 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0963662512458631">Sleenhoff et al., 2008</xref>), despite the fact that the technology progressed. Industry may presume a low public appreciation of GM, and while also considering earlier media attention to GM, industry is still careful to place new GM based food innovations on the market (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0963662512458631">Henderson et al., 2007</xref>). Without any new products, the public is unlikely to see the potential benefits that GM technology may bring, and public appreciation of GM will probably not change, and innovators may remain hesitant to talk about GM.</p>
<p>This, however, does not mean that companies are against the use of GM technology in foods. Some companies have placed specific GM policies on their websites therewith responding to a call for more transparency and to help counteract misperceptions on corporate GM policies. Nevertheless, it remains unclear if this contributes to an actual change of public perception of a corporate brand or a particular GM product.</p>
</sec></sec>
<sec id="section18-0963662512458631">
<title>5. Ways forward</title>
<p>In contrast to this apparently hesitant approach to introducing GM products on to the market, recent studies have shown that there is a market for GM based food products: there is a difference between public opinion and shopping behaviour (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0963662512458631">European Commission, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0963662512458631">Knight et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0963662512458631">Powell et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0963662512458631">Spence and Townsend, 2006</xref>). In addition, public optimism in Europe about food biotechnology is currently higher than the minimum values observed in 2000 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0963662512458631">Gaskell et al., 2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0963662512458631">2011</xref>). Also, NGO activities in the field of GM currently appear to be lower in number and intensity than they were several years ago. But the question remains how new genomics based innovations should be deployed.</p>
<sec id="section19-0963662512458631">
<title>Suggestions: Timely and good quality interaction</title>
<p>We would like to make two suggestions based on the media attention case analyses and the discussion above, enabling stakeholders to be provided with more balanced information which may help to develop a balanced opinion about future GM and genomics based food products. Firstly, the inclusion of social aspects should be on time, early in the innovation process and in such a way that they contribute to the development and shape of the eventual commercialised product. Many science and technology studies scholars have suggested this early involvement, to help improve the innovation processes (for reviews, see e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0963662512458631">Lengwiler, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0963662512458631">Delgado et al., 2010</xref>). In this way the innovators can make sure that stakeholders (including journalists, users, NGOs, etc.) know about the development of the innovation process and can voice their concerns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0963662512458631">Deuten et al., 1997</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0963662512458631">6</xref></sup> From a media attention perspective, this may mean that the innovations are less interesting to publish about and hence will not attract much media attention, and controversies may be less likely to develop. This proactive communication strategy may avoid reactive responses to controversies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0963662512458631">Carolan, 2007</xref>), which are often highly emotive. This, however, requires a transparent innovation process with reliable scientific data and also the willingness of stakeholders’ involvement.</p>
<p>The second suggestion is that scientists should speak up. The outcome of our case analysis shows that while industry and academic scientists had the data to back up their claims, they did not use media to reach the public. No increased media attention is seen once these data are available, presumably also because no efforts were made by industry or academia to alleviate this lack of attention. Research has shown that some scientists view communication as difficult, some find it even impossible and dangerous, and most realise that extreme caution is necessary to prevent misunderstandings or misuse of scientific information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0963662512458631">Davies, 2008</xref>). In industry, communication is often organised and handled by people who are not involved in research and development. Yet, scientists, whether from academia or industry, know their own work best, and may be in the best position to explore possible issues of (public) concern and anticipate media attention. However, research has also indicated that innovators sometimes forget that their work is not restricted to just research and development, but also encompasses societal and organisational (market, marketing and communication) aspects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0963662512458631">Khilji et al., 2006</xref>). This indicates a need for training in reflexive awareness and communication skills. For this reason, and since both industry and academic scientists are involved in the validation of scientific claims with societal relevance, anticipatory skills in the form of reflexive awareness of their role in society and communication skills for talking to non-experts are recommended (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0963662512458631">Fisher et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0963662512458631">Schuurbiers and Fisher, 2009</xref>). Good communication by the innovator (with the right language and sound arguments showing relevance for stakeholders) may improve relations with other stakeholders, while simultaneously improving the credibility of the innovator (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0963662512458631">Penders and Nelis, 2011</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section20-0963662512458631">
<title>Reflection on recommendations</title>
<p>These recommendations also need some reflection. First, as argued above, providing publics with correct scientific information is no guarantee of more balanced public opinion. Nevertheless, without correct information about the described cases, the public is unable to change its reflection on the cases and possibly continues to base opinions on negatively framed and incorrect information. We suggest that putting an effort into broadly providing sound data after investigation of claims that turned out to be false, is crucial and may be a good first step towards more balanced public opinion, and that scientists are in a good position to facilitate that first step.</p>
<p>Second, it cannot be expected that stakeholders with a different agenda than that of the innovator will easily endorse an innovation. But that is not in fact the goal of the suggested timely communication. The aim is to involve stakeholders to make sure that they are part of the innovation process, and not just a vague complement to things that have already been decided upon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0963662512458631">Carolan, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>Third, one may feel that stakeholders with different agendas may hold back an innovation rather than contribute to its development. Yet, the public is not unanimously for or against a technology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0963662512458631">Wynne, 2006</xref>). Stakeholders can be expected to be critical, but this can also be seen as beneficial for the innovation process. It may stimulate scientists to take more considerations into account, while simultaneously make them consider societal issues in their design. One might argue: if a stakeholder holds back an innovation, it is not well developed enough. Especially with the view of preventing negative hype-like media attention, addressing the concerns of many stakeholders could prove beneficial. We argue that critical reflection with openness from innovators and other stakeholders is a prerequisite for good, timely and open communication. Nevertheless, it is not suggested here that all stakeholders should be completely content with the innovation, but rather that their concerns are addressed.</p>
<p>Last, it appears that a trade-off for innovators needs to be made, between introducing something completely “new” all at once, or a gradual introduction into society, informing stakeholders and especially competitors of the upcoming research and development programmes and market introduction. Introducing something new after secret development may aid obtaining a leading market position, but a more open innovation paradigm holds specific advantages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0963662512458631">Chesbrough, 2006</xref>), e.g. stakeholders may help improve the quality of innovation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0963662512458631">Moors et al., 2003</xref>).</p>

<title>6. Summary and conclusion</title>
<p>This study set out to explore the links between media attention to three high-profile cases of agricultural GM food innovations and current innovation practices. Our analysis of media attention through Downs’ issue-attention cycle indicated a similar order of events in all cases. The analysis illustrates that it can take over two years for the scientific community to respond to an issue, whilst it takes the media only days. Days after a “scandalous” event takes place, media attention increases to a maximum. The public learned about these events through media articles with expressive and emotive headings. NGOs used the opportunity to demonstrate against GM technology in foods. Further marketing or development of all products in these cases was halted after the controversy was presented in the media. In the months following the controversy, media attention gradually decreases and the framing changes from very expressive to more neutral.</p>
<p>Combined, the case exploration and analysis show that the public is only to a very limited extent able to learn about the outcome of the scientific studies regarding the initially proposed risks of the three cases’ products through written media articles. Hence, negative framing by the media is not corrected and low appreciation of biotechnology probably remains. The current EU market offers only a very limited number of GM labelled products, and it appears that some innovators remain hesitant to introduce new GM based innovations and to communicate about GM innovations in general. This leads to a communication gridlock, as we have illustrated above.</p>
<p>We made two suggestions to overcome this impasse, to further enable the public to form a balanced opinion through written media on sound scientific data, and to prevent negative hype-like media attention that may hamper both product development in industry and public appreciation of new and emerging technology based innovations. First, we advocate a transparency by innovators that allows public involvement in the production development process. Second, we encourage scientists to become aware of the role they play in new and emerging, possibly controversial, science and technology and to communicate their results. Further research should clarify if scientists in industry can be engaged to become more reflexive and communicative, and if the biotechnology industry can improve its innovation practices with the use of perspectives of other stakeholders.</p>

<p>In all of the described cases some scientific findings of different research groups are contradictory. This study does not aim to give a complete overview of what happened in these high-profile cases; it merely gives an overview of the key events in the cases and the corresponding media attention, which may contribute to our understanding of the role of the media in the three cases. In addition, we do not wish to imply with this article that GM foods are either harmful or harmless; we only wish to give an overview of the course of events in the three cases.</p></fn>

<p>An indication of false positives may be found in the fact that the results do show that in some quarters preceding a certain event, there is already some media attention found matching the query, which should be impossible since the initial event did not take place yet. However, in all instances media attention was less than 1% of the maximum quarter, and therefore considered unimportant.</p></fn>

<p>Not too late to change the future products, thereby aiming to prevent a Collingridge dilemma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0963662512458631">Collingridge, 1980</xref>). Also, one may recognise that the perceived public problem does not lie so much in flawed product development, but in that the use of a certain technology is not perceived positively. In that sense, one may wonder whether or not any process using genomics based technology is doomed to fail, whatever the product may be.</p></fn>
