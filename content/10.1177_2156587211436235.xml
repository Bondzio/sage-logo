<abstract>
<p>The present study determined the effects of electroacupuncture on interstitial cells of Cajal and investigated whether changes in the stem cell factor pathway were involved. Animals were assigned to normal, diabetic, diabetic plus sham stimulation, diabetic plus low-frequency stimulation, and diabetic plus high-frequency stimulation groups. Electroacupuncture was performed daily for 8 weeks. In vitro contractility of colonic muscle strips were studied. Expression of c-kit (the marker of interstitial cells of Cajal) and stem cell factor were measured. The results showed that (1) contraction of colonic muscle strips was significantly elevated in low- and high-frequency stimulation groups and (2) in contrast to the diabetic group, the expressions of c-kit and stem cell factor were markedly increased in the low- and high-frequency stimulation groups. These results indicate that both low- and high-frequency stimulation can promote the contractility of colonic muscle strips partially through increasing the number of interstitial cells of Cajal, and these effects could be mediated by an elevated endogenous stem cell factor.</p>

<body>
<p>Disorders of gastrointestinal motility are known to occur frequently in diabetic patients, including gastroparesis, constipation, and diarrhea,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-2156587211436235">1</xref></sup> and affect blood glucose control and the quality of life in patients with diabetes mellitus. The mechanism of gastrointestinal dysmotility has been associated with pathological changes in interstitial cells of Cajal.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-2156587211436235">2</xref></sup> In patients with diabetes, the phenomena of cellular degradation and decrease in the number of interstitial cells of Cajal affect the whole gastrointestinal tract.</p>
<p>Electroacupuncture, a modification of acupuncture, which stimulates acupoints with electrical current instead of manual manipulation, is a potential method of treating gastrointestinal motility disorders.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-2156587211436235">3</xref></sup> Although extensive studies have investigated the effect of electroacupuncture on gastric motility,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-2156587211436235">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-2156587211436235"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-2156587211436235">6</xref></sup> relatively little information exists to address its effect on the colon. Electroacupuncture at the <italic>Zusanli</italic> (ST-36) acupoint has been reported to accelerate colonic motility in conscious rats.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-2156587211436235">7</xref></sup> Our previous study has found that electroacupuncture at ST-36 can promote distal colonic contractility through the cholinergic pathway.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-2156587211436235">8</xref></sup> Jin et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-2156587211436235">9</xref></sup> suggested that electroacupuncture is effective in the treatment of constipation. Recently, it has been documented that electroacupuncture can increase the density of interstitial cells of Cajal<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-2156587211436235">10</xref></sup> and upregulate the expression of colonic c-kit (the marker of interstitial cells of Cajal) in slow-transit constipated rats.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-2156587211436235">11</xref></sup> However, the potential role of electroacupuncture in the interstitial cells of Cajal in diabetic rats have scarcely been investigated.</p>
<p>Interstitial cells of Cajal express c-kit protein (a receptor tyrosine kinase integral to interstitial cells of Cajal), which is the receptor for the stem cell factor. The function and survival of interstitial cells of Cajal depend on the activation of c-kit by the stem cell factor. The stem cell factor includes 2 isoforms: the soluble stem cell factor and membrane-bound stem cell factor. The binding of c-kit and stem cell factor can activate tyrosine kinase and a series of downstream signaling events that have been known to be essential for the maintenance of interstitial cells of Cajal phenotypes and differentiation and proliferation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-2156587211436235">12</xref></sup> Reduced expression of the stem cell factor has been reported in the colon of diabetic animals.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-2156587211436235">13</xref></sup> Recently, it has been reported that electroacupuncture could elevate stem cell factor levels.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-2156587211436235">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-2156587211436235">14</xref></sup> However, it is unknown whether the regulative role of electroacupuncture on interstitial cells of Cajal is associated with the stem cell factor pathway.</p>
<p>The aims of our study were to evaluate the effect of electroacupuncture at ST-36 on interstitial cells of Cajal in the colon of diabetic rats and to investigate whether the stem cell factor signaling pathway was involved in the regulative effect of electroacupuncture on interstitial cells of Cajal.</p>

<title>Materials and Methods</title>
<sec id="section2-2156587211436235">
<title>Animals</title>
<p>A total of 50 adult male Sprague-Dawley rats (250-350 g) were used in the present study. Rats were purchased from the Experiment Animal Center of Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China. They were housed under normal laboratory conditions (12/12-hour light-dark cycle, 18°C-22°C) and were given water ad libitum. The study was started after 1 week, when the rats were adapted to the environment. All animals in our study were treated strictly in accordance with the National Institutes of Health Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals, and the work was approved by the ethics committee of laboratory animals.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-2156587211436235">
<title>Experimental Protocols</title>
<p>Animals were randomly divided into 5 groups: normal control group, diabetic group, diabetic plus sham stimulation group (only acupuncture but no electrical current, 30 minutes), diabetic plus low-frequency stimulation group (10 Hz, 1-3 mA, 30 minutes), diabetic plus high-frequency stimulation group (100 Hz, 1-3 mA, 30 minutes). Diabetes was induced by intraperitoneal injection with streptozotocin (Alexis Biochemicals, San Diego, CA) 60 mg kg<sup>−1</sup> prepared in citrate buffer (pH 4.5, Sigma, St Louis, MO, USA). Age-matched controls were injected with citrate buffer at the same dose as the diabetic group. The food and water supply was sufficient for free intake by animals during the experimental period. Blood glucose and body weight were measured before and 1 week after injection as well as prior to obtaining specimens. Animals were considered diabetic if the random blood glucose 1 week after streptozotocin injection was higher than 16.7 mmol/L.</p>
<p>Electroacupuncture was performed at ST-36 daily for 8 weeks.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-2156587211436235">8</xref></sup> At the end of 8 weeks, animals were killed, and specimens of the distal colon were obtained from each rat. Each specimen collected from the animals was divided into 4 pieces of similar size, which were then either immediately immersed in Kreb’s solution used for the contractility study, or snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80°C for real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and Western blot analyses, or placed into 4% paraformaldehyde for immunohistochemistry analysis.</p>

<sec id="section4-2156587211436235">
<title>Measurement and Analysis of the Contractile Activity of Colonic Muscle Strips</title>
<p>In vitro experiments were performed on the distal colon. Circular muscle strips measuring 7 × 2 × 1 mm<sup>3</sup> were cut from the distal colon.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-2156587211436235">15</xref></sup> Each strip was carefully tied at both ends by threads and immediately mounted on the circular axis in a 25-mL organ bath filled with warmed Kreb’s solution with the following composition (mmol/L): 119 NaCl, 4.7 KCl, 1.2 MgSO<sub>4</sub>, 1.2 K<sub>2</sub>HPO<sub>4</sub>, 2.5 CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 25 NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, and 11.1 D-glucose. The organ bath was maintained at 37°C and continuously gassed with 5% CO<sub>2</sub> and 95% oxygen to maintain a pH of 7.4. The upper part of the thread was connected to isometric force transducers (Fort-10, WPI, USA), which were connected to a chart recorder (MP-100 system) to record contractile activity concurrently. Data were analyzed by Acknowledge 3.7.1 (Biopac Systems Inc, USA).</p>
<p>Experiments began following equilibration for at least 1 hour in an organ bath. Cumulative concentrations of acetylcholine (10<sup>−7</sup>, 10<sup>−6</sup>, 10<sup>−5</sup>, 10<sup>−4</sup>, and 10<sup>−3</sup> mol L<sup>−1</sup>), a cholinergic receptor agonist, were consecutively applied to each muscle strip at 5-minute intervals. The concentration–response curve for acetylcholine on spontaneous contractile activity of colonic circular muscle strips was generated.</p>
<p>Then, we evaluated the contractions of muscle strips with interstitial cells of Cajal removed, by methylene blue incubation and intensive illumination.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-2156587211436235">16</xref></sup> Muscle strips were incubated in Kreb’s solution containing 50 μmol/L methylene blue at 37°C and gassed with 95% O<sub>2</sub> and 5% CO<sub>2</sub> for 40 minutes in the dark. Then, the muscle strips were immediately exposed to light (50 mW/cm<sup>2</sup>) for 5 minutes after methylene blue staining. The contractions of muscle strips with interstitial cells of Cajal were measured as mentioned above for the common muscle strips.</p>
<p>Concentration–response contractile curves of the muscle strips before and after removal of interstitial cells of Cajal were compared. The variation in percentage of mean area under the curve measured every 5 minutes was calculated as percentage variation, reflecting changes of effect–concentration curves before and after adding each concentration of acetylcholine. The disparity in percentage variation between common colonic muscle strips and muscle strips with interstitial cells of Cajal removed, at each concentration of acetylcholine, were calculated as percentage decrease reflecting changes of interstitial cells of Cajal at each concentration in different groups. In this manner, percentage decrease could be calculated as follows: Percentage decrease = Percentage variation<sub>before ICC removed</sub> − Percentage variation<sub>after ICC removed</sub>. (Here, ICC refers to interstitial cells of Cajal.)</p>

<title>Expressions of c-kit in Colon Tissue by Immunohistochemistry Analysis</title>
<p>The immunohistochemical study was carried out under the following conditions using antikit antibody (1:200, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc, Santa Cruz, CA) and antigoat Histostain-plus Kit (Jing Mei Biotech, Shenzhen, China), which included secondary antibodies for immunohistochemistry and HRP-linked streptavidin.</p>
<p>Distal colon tissue samples were fixed by 4% paraformaldehyde, then processed for embedding and cut into sections. Paraffin tissue sections of 5 μm were deparaffinized in xylene and hydrated in a graded solution of ethanol. After endogenous peroxidase activity was quenched with 3% hydrogen peroxide for 15 minutes, the specimens were microwaved (at 750 W) for 5 minutes and were treated with normal rabbit serum in phosphate-buffered saline for 30 minutes to diminish the nonspecific binding and then incubated with primary antibody (c-kit, 1:200, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc) in a moist chamber overnight at 4°C. After washing 3 times with phosphate-buffered saline (pH = 7.2), incubation was carried out with secondary antibodies (rabbit antigoat IgG) for 30 minutes at 37°C. Later, the specimens were washed 3 times and incubated in a solution containing diaminobenzidine and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>. The slides were washed again, counterstained, and then dehydrated. Specificity of the antibody was confirmed by negative control in the absence of primary antibody treatment.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-2156587211436235">17</xref></sup> Two observers evaluated the slides using an Olympus FV500 optical microscope (Olympus, Tokyo, Japan). Positive immunostaining was evaluated at a magnification of 400.</p>

<title>The mRNA Expression of c-kit and Membrane-Bound Stem Cell Factor in Colon Tissue by Real-Time PCRs</title>
<p>Total RNA was extracted using the TRIzol Reagent (Invitrogen Life Technologies, 15596-026, Carlsbad, CA), and RNA samples were reverse transcribed according to the instructions of the manufacturer (ReverTra Ace-α, FSK-100). The specific primers used in our study are listed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-2156587211436235">Table 1</xref>
. PCRs were performed as described by the manufacturer using the Toyobo Thunderbird SYBR Green polymerase chain reactions Mix (QPS-201). The reaction was performed in 25 μL total volume containing 12.5 μL SYBR green/enzyme reaction mix, 2.5 μM of primer, and 2 μL cDNA. The PCR conditions were 95°C for 1 minute, followed by 40 cycles at 95°C for 15 s, 58°C for 20 s, and 72°C for 20 s. Real-time detections were performed on an ABI-StepOne Detection System (Applied Biosystems, Carlsbad, CA). Melting curve analysis was performed by increasing the temperature by 1°C from 72°C to 95°C and measuring the fluorescence at every temperature point for a period of 20 s. Potential contaminations were monitored using nontemplate controls. The transcript level of each specific gene was normalized to the β-actin amplification. The 2<sup>−ΔΔCT</sup> method was used to quantify the relative change of gene expression.</p>

<title>Expression of c-kit and Membrane-Bound Stem Cell Factor in Colon Tissue by Western Blot Analysis</title>
<p>Distal colon specimens of about 0.5 g were ground into the cell suspension with a blade. The suspension was centrifuged (Eppendorf 5403) at 12 000 <italic>g</italic> for 10 minutes at 4°C, and protein concentrations were measured by the Bradford method. Then, equivalents of 50 μg of extracted proteins were separated using 10% sodium dodecylsulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to a PVDF (polyvinylidene fluoride) membrane (Millipore, Bedford, MA). The PVDF membranes were blocked in 5% nonfat milk for 1 hour, followed by incubation with primary antibodies against c-kit (1:200, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc) and stem cell factor (1:400, Abcam, Cambridge, UK) at 37°C for 1 hour and then at 4°C overnight. Rabbit antirat actin (1:400, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc) served as the internal control. This was followed by incubation with horseradish peroxidase-linked secondary antibody (1:6000, horseradish peroxidase-linked antigoat or horseradish peroxidase-linked antirabbit, Jing Mei Biotech, Shenzhen, China) for 1 hour at room temperature. Detection of protein was achieved with enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL reagents, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Piscataway, NJ), and the blot was subjected to autoradiography.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In the current study, we demonstrated that electroacupuncture at ST-36 could stimulate the contractility of colonic muscle strips and restore impaired interstitial cells of Cajal in the colon of diabetic rats; this is accompanied by upregulation of the stem cell factor both in the colon tissue and in serum.</p>
<p>There are some studies that reported stimulating effects of electroacupuncture on colonic motility in vivo.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-2156587211436235">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-2156587211436235">8</xref></sup> However, the effects of electroacupuncture on colonic muscle strip in vitro and the precise mechanisms underlying electroacupuncture on colonic motility have scarcely been investigated. The hypothesis that impaired interstitial cells of Cajal could be restored by the process of electroacupuncture has been proposed on the basis of previous studies.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-2156587211436235">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-2156587211436235">11</xref></sup> In line with this hypothesis, removal of interstitial cells of Cajal by methylene blue and exposure to light was used in our study.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-2156587211436235">16</xref></sup> The effects of methylene blue and light exposure in muscle strips were specific only to interstitial cells of Cajal, without affecting the enteric nerve system and smooth muscle cells.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-2156587211436235">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-2156587211436235">18</xref></sup> In our study, the contractility of common muscle strips in the untreated diabetic group was markedly decreased compared with controls, but it was elevated in the low- and high-frequency stimulation groups. Moreover, when interstitial cells of Cajal were removed, the percentage decrease was significantly lower in the untreated diabetic group than in controls, but it was greater in the low- and high-frequency stimulation groups compared with the untreated diabetic group. This phenomenon implies that pretreatment with electroacupuncture, not only high-frequency but also low-frequency treatment, had a restoring effect on impaired interstitial cells of Cajal, which may be attributed to the stimulatory effect on the contractility of colonic muscle strips.</p>
<p>Decrease in the number of interstitial cells of Cajal in diabetes has been reported in animal models<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-2156587211436235">19</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-2156587211436235"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-2156587211436235">21</xref></sup> as well as in people with diabetes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-2156587211436235">22</xref></sup> The model of diabetes in our study was established successfully. To provide sufficient assessment of the interstitial cells of Cajal in the colon, immunohistochemistry, real-time PCRs, and Western blot were performed. In the current study, Western blot showed an 80% loss of interstitial cells of Cajal in the colon of diabetic rats compared with the control group, which is consistent with previous findings.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-2156587211436235">19</xref></sup> Our study also found that the expression of c-kit increased significantly in low- and high-frequency-stimulation-treated diabetic rats but was not altered in the sham stimulation group, suggesting that electroacupuncture, both low and high frequency, has the capability to increase the expression of c-kit in diabetic rats. This was consistent with the previous results.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-2156587211436235">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-2156587211436235">11</xref></sup>
</p>
<p>In addition to investigating the effect of electroacupuncture on interstitial cells of Cajal, the experiment was also designed to study the possible mechanisms involved. The stem cell factor is essential for maintaining the function and survival of interstitial cells of Cajal.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-2156587211436235">23</xref></sup> Together with injury to the interstitial cells of Cajal, diabetic rats also showed a reduced expression of stem cell factor in both serum and colon tissue in our study. These findings were consistent with those of previous studies.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-2156587211436235">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-2156587211436235">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-2156587211436235">25</xref></sup> Other studies have reported that the abnormalities of interstitial cells of Cajal can attributed to a deficiency in the endogenous stem cell factor.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-2156587211436235">25</xref></sup> The exogenous stem cell factor can partially reverse the pathological changes in interstitial cells of Cajal.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-2156587211436235">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-2156587211436235">25</xref></sup> The role of the stem cell factor in the development of interstitial cells of Cajal has been studied extensively in vivo and in vitro.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-2156587211436235">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-2156587211436235">26</xref></sup>
</p>
<p>Moreover, it was reported that electroacupuncture could elevate the soluble stem cell factor level,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-2156587211436235">14</xref></sup> but there is no study of electroacupuncture on the membrane-bound stem cell factor. Little information about stem cell factor levels in electroacupuncture-treated diabetic animal and human tissue is available. In the present study, we demonstrated that both soluble stem cell factor and membrane-bound stem cell factor were increased significantly in low- and high-frequency-stimulation-treated diabetic rats, indicating that the increased expression of stem cell factor might be involved in the mechanism of electroacupuncture on colonic contractility and interstitial cells of Cajal.</p>
<p>In our study, we noticed that the changes in both soluble stem cell factor and membrane-bound stem cell factor paralleled the c-kit protein expression. Although both had significant correlations with c-kit, regression analyses indicated that membrane-bound stem cell factor was the only independent effect of the potential determinant to c-kit protein expression, and there was a significant positive correlation between them. This suggests that the higher the membrane-bound stem cell factor level was, the more c-kit was expressed in colon tissue. Our results are consistent with the observation that membrane-bound stem cell factor is a more effective agonist for c-kit receptor compared with soluble stem cell factor and preferentially stimulates the c-kit receptor.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-2156587211436235">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-2156587211436235">27</xref></sup>
</p>
<p>Weight loss and hyperglycemia were the 2 main parameters that characterized the streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-2156587211436235">28</xref></sup> Li et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-2156587211436235">29</xref></sup> reported that electroacupuncture could increase the appetite, sleep, and body weight. In the current study, diabetic rats treated with high-frequency stimulation exhibited an increase in body weight. Blood glucose levels after treatment with different modalities of electroacupuncture were not significantly lower than those of untreated diabetic rats, and they were still hyperglycemic. Our results indicate that electroacupuncture can increase the body weight of diabetic rats but has no effect on blood glucose.</p>
<p>In conclusion, electroacupuncture at ST-36 can promote the contractility of colonic muscle strips partially through increasing the number of interstitial cells of Cajal in diabetic rats, and these effects may be mediated by elevated endogenous membrane-bound stem cell factor levels but are not related to blood glucose levels.</p>
