<abstract>
<p>Crime victimization surveys are important sources of trend information and provide data for basic criminological research. In recent years, victim surveys have proliferated and their strengths are well known. The aim of this study is to increase the methodological literature on victim surveys by analysing framing effects, defined as the way the survey instrument communicates its topic and aim, especially in terms of the gendered nature of violence. Three experimental frames were applied to independent, random samples of the adult Finnish population: male-to-male violence frame, female-to-male violence frame, and male-to-female violence frame. The impacts of these frames were analysed in relation to two outcome variables: self-assessed propensity to report hypothetical borderline incidents in a victim survey and reporting of prior personal violent victimization. Thus, we utilized measures of both intended survey reporting behaviour and real survey reporting behaviour. The findings indicate that the male-to-female violence frame increases the willingness of the respondents to report borderline cases to survey researchers, regardless of other factors. It also increases the prevalence of reported prior victimizations. The female-to-male frame has a similar but weaker framing effect. The findings are discussed from the point of view of the ‘conversation’ paradigm of survey methods research.</p>

<p>Crime victimization surveys are standard tools used in modern criminological research. They are used in most developed nations to monitor crime trends. In Finland, national crime victim surveys were launched in 1980. Since then, and especially beginning in the 1990s, there has been a considerable proliferation of crime victim surveys targeted at particular populations, such as women, young people and children (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1477370811424383">Haggerty, 2001</xref>). However, the growing number of victim surveys has not been accompanied by a corresponding interest in methodological research, especially with regard to how the targeting of specific sub-populations affects the results. In this article, we examine the methodological foundations of crime victim surveys by probing framing effects in a survey experiment.</p>
<sec id="section1-1477370811424383">
<title>Prior research</title>
<p>In survey research, a large number of factors influence the respondents’ capability and willingness to reply to questions. Some of these are external to the research instrument, such as the perceived climate of opinion during the research process or even the weather at the time of research contact. Others are internal to or embedded in the research instrument. These range from the method of data collection (phone interview, mail survey, computer-assisted survey, etc.) to the wording and sequence of questions and topics within the instrument. Factors such as the sponsor and the name of the study are also likely to affect the responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1477370811424383">Bowling, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1477370811424383">Tourangeau and McNeeley, 2003</xref>). In this article, we use the concept <italic>framing effect</italic><sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1477370811424383">1</xref></sup> to denote effects that emerge from how the survey instrument communicates (explicitly and tacitly) the topical focus of the survey. An important aspect of framing effects is that they can be largely controlled by the researchers – unlike other context effects, such as changing climates of opinion or the presence of other people when people respond to questions. Our concepts ‘gender framing’ and ‘gendered violence framing’ thus refer to how and whether the questionnaire communicates to the respondent that the research is about violence by one gender against the other.</p>
<p>For the respondent, answering a question is a highly contextual affair. People engage with survey questions as if participating in a natural conversation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1477370811424383">Tourangeau and McNeeley, 2003</xref>: 25). Respondents draw upon subtle cues to make inferences about the intent of the questions and how they are ‘expected’ to answer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1477370811424383">Tourangeau and McNeeley, 2003</xref>: 27). The apparent purpose of the survey as perceived by the respondent thus potentially influences the response. People who respond to a survey tend to be sympathetic to the goals of the survey. They have made the decision to engage in altruistic behaviour by responding, and they wish to cooperate with the demands of the study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1477370811424383">Tourangeau and McNeeley, 2003</xref>: 28–9, 30). For example, Tourangeau and McNeeley (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1477370811424383">2003</xref>: 29) have suggested that some US rape surveys are based on the assumption that rape is generally underreported. In their view, it is likely that such surveys ‘cast a wide net’ by triggering the perception that the intent is to apply a broad concept of victimization. Motivated by the wish to cooperate with the researcher, respondents interpret the questions so that they allow a broad inclusion of incidents. Additionally, people who already have a broad concept of violence may be more likely to respond.</p>
<p>Previous research has identified at least three mechanisms through which framing effects operate. First, earlier questions can provide the respondents with an <italic>interpretive</italic> framework that is applied as they decipher the meaning of the subsequent questions. Second, the preceding questions can produce a <italic>priming</italic> effect, which activates the retrieval of topical memories and facilitates responding to subsequent questions. Third, prior questions can produce <italic>judgemental contrasts</italic> so that subsequent questions are interpreted in relation to questions presented earlier in the survey (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1477370811424383">Tourangeau et al., 2003</xref>: 491)</p>
<p>One potential source of framing effects is the title of the study. In a study conducted in Norway, the researchers investigated the effect of the title and the length of the study on the response rate in a mail survey that dealt with women’s health (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1477370811424383">Lund and Gram, 1998</xref>). The study was based on five independent random samples of middle-aged women using five experimental conditions, each questionnaire having a different length and title. It appeared that emotionally loaded concepts used in the title, such as the words ‘cancer’ and ‘woman’, had a positive effect on the response rate but did not influence the distribution of the risk factors. However, in studies targeting specific populations that are known to suffer from a disease, the introduction of the questionnaire may have an impact on the variable associations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1477370811424383">Smith et al., 2006</xref>). In the field of youth crime surveys, a small-scale pilot study conducted in Finland suggested that the sequence of topics matters when the respondents are asked about attitudes towards crime. The respondents tended to be less tolerant towards crime if the questions about attitudes were preceded (rather than followed) by the questions about crime victimization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1477370811424383">Kivivuori et al., 2001</xref>: 37–8). Conceivably, attitudes related to crime are more punitive if people are first asked to report their own victimization experiences.</p>
<p>Gender is highly relevant in the conversation that takes place between the respondent and the questions formulated by researchers, especially if the research is about gendered phenomena. There is a scarcity of research on this topic as well,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1477370811424383">2</xref></sup> although an important related study was conducted by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1477370811424383">Galesic and Tourangeau (2007)</xref>. Their study was a randomized controlled trial examining the impact of framing on responses about sexual harassment in the workplace. The respondents were randomly assigned to one of two conditions: one questionnaire stressed the researcher’s connection with a feminist organization, while the other described the researcher as neutral on the issue of sexual harassment. The titles of these questionnaire versions were ‘Sexual Harassment Survey’ and ‘Work Atmosphere Survey’, respectively. Respondents in the feminist frame reported more experiences with sexual harassment and fewer experiences with non-sexual problems. Similar differences emerged in the questions asking respondents to comment on how bothersome the behaviours were. Respondents in the feminist frame condition were more likely to define all incident descriptions as sexual harassment. Clearly, the framing of the study influenced how the respondents replied to the questions.</p>
<p>In telephone surveys, the gender of the interviewer is a potential source of a framing effect. In a study conducted in the United States, the researchers found that the respondents were influenced by the gender of the interviewer when responding to questions about gender roles. Both female and male respondents were more supportive of gender equality if they were interviewed by a woman (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1477370811424383">Kane and Macaulay, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1477370811424383">Tourangeau and Yan, 2007</xref>: 876). In mail surveys, however, the paper questionnaire is ‘mute’ but not necessarily genderless. In the present study, we examined the possibility that a questionnaire with a gendered framing can produce framing effects, influencing the results of the study.</p>
<p>In sum, the studies described above support the metaphor of ‘conversation’ when examining framing effects in surveys. Respondents attend to cues about what the researchers want to know and may adjust their responses accordingly. Tourangeau and McNeeley have suggested that the apparent topic of the survey potentially influences the respondents’ views on the types of the incident they are expected to report. They imagined an experiment in which the respondents would answer identical questions after being primed by different frames. Such an experiment ‘would examine how reports are affected by the frames, and it could compare respondents’ judgments as to whether they were supposed to report hypothetical incidents in vignettes describing borderline cases’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1477370811424383">Tourangeau and McNeeley, 2003</xref>: 35–6). In this research, we roughly followed these suggestions. We constituted frames by using hypothetical borderline scenarios and examined the possible framing effects on two measures: subjective assessment of whether the incident would be reported in a survey and the respondent’s own reports of prior victimizations.</p>

<title>Data</title>
<p>The data for this research were collected under the auspices of a methodological research project, the Finnish Experimental Victim Survey (FEVS), a mail survey with broad research goals. The full design of the FEVS included six different questionnaires and six random samples. Each questionnaire was targeted at a nationally representative sample of 1200 persons aged 18−74 years. The sample was limited to Finnish-speaking persons, who comprise about 93 per cent of the population.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-1477370811424383">3</xref></sup> The response rates are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1477370811424383">Table 1</xref>. In the analysis, the data were weighted to correct for differential responding in terms of age and sex.</p>

<p>All of the six FEVS questionnaires had a similar look and identical introductory letter, title page and the page on which the respondents provided background information. Following these introductory sections, there were three versions of the questionnaire that included scenarios that introduced a gendered violence frame (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1477370811424383">Table 1</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-1477370811424383">4</xref></sup> In this study, we examined whether questionnaires with a gendered framing of violence influence (a) people’s subjective propensity to report violence in a hypothetical survey and (b) their actual reports of victimization.</p>
<p>Our research is not a randomized controlled trial in the strict meaning of the term. Instead of randomizing those in a selected group into experimental conditions, we used independent nationally representative random samples. This decision was based on several considerations. Because actual victim surveys use such random samples, the results from methodological experiments made in heavily self-selected samples, such as among university students, may not be applicable to ‘real-life conditions’ involving representative samples (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1477370811424383">Hamby et al., 2006</xref>: 515). The use of general population samples also makes it easier to replicate the analysis later on in order to study the impact of changing cultural and social contexts on responding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1477370811424383">Schuman, 2009</xref>).</p>
<sec id="section3-1477370811424383">
<title>Frames</title>
<p>In this study, three questionnaires included a gendered scenario: male-to-male, male-to-female and female-to-male violence frame questionnaires. The main purpose was to examine the effects of gendered frames (where the gender of the offender and the victim is different) on violence reporting when compared with a non-framed questionnaire and the male-to-male violence frame.</p>
<p>There was no questionnaire variant for female-to-female violence. Although this decision was based mostly on economic grounds, it is also worth noting that female-to-female violence is relatively rare. For instance, of all homicides committed in Finland, only 2 percent had female perpetrators and victims, whereas female-to-male homicides account for 8 percent of cases, male-to-female homicides make up 28 percent of cases, and male-to-male homicides account for 62 percent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1477370811424383">Kivivuori et al., 2007</xref>: 8). In cases of non-lethal violence, the relative frequencies are roughly similar, with male-to-male violence dominating the scene (55 percent), followed by male-to-female violence (31 percent).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-1477370811424383">5</xref></sup> Furthermore, female-to-female violence is practically non-existent as a publicly debated social problem, especially if compared with other gender constellations. Even female-to-male violence is more salient in public debates, largely as a response to surveys targeting male violence against women.</p>
<p>The gendered frames were constructed by adding different scenarios to the beginning of the questionnaire. These scenarios dealt with violence at work, on the street and at home. In all the scenarios, the level of violence was relatively non-serious, resulting in only a minor injury. The type of injury (bruised arm) was adopted from the study of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1477370811424383">Felson and Feld (2009)</xref>. The scenarios were intended to depict cases on the border between ‘reportable’ and ‘non-reportable’ incidents, as suggested by Tourangeau and McNeeley (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1477370811424383">2003</xref>: 35–6). Our scenarios were:</p>
<list id="list1-1477370811424383" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p>1. A worked as a nurse in a hospital. One day he/she was hit by B, a patient who was in a delirious state, and A’s arm was bruised. [Work violence]</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>2. At night, A was returning from the movies and was queuing at a kiosk that sold fish and chips. B was in the same queue. A and B did not know each other previously. They started to quarrel about who had been first in the line. B pushed A so that A hit the vendor and got a bruise on his/her arm. [Street violence]</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>3(a). A and B, a married couple, quarrelled over a phone bill in the kitchen. They yelled at each other. When A started to move away towards the living room, B, who was standing in the doorway, pushed him/her. A’s arm hit the wall and he/she got a bruise on his/her arm. After this, the quarrel ended. [Home violence]</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>The gendered frames were created by reversing the gender of the offender and the victim in the scenarios. In the male-to-male violence questionnaire, both the victim and the offender were males. In the male-to-female violence questionnaire, the victim was female and the offender male. In the female-to-male questionnaire, the victim was male and the offender female. The scenarios were identical with one exception: in the male-to-male questionnaire, the home violence scenario depicted two male friends sitting at the kitchen table, drinking alcohol:</p>
<list id="list2-1477370811424383" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p>3(b). A and B, who are friends, often spend the evening together drinking alcohol. One day they were sitting at the kitchen table and started to run out of alcohol. They yelled at each other about who should drink what was left. <italic>When A started to move away towards the living room, B, who was standing in the doorway, pushed him. A’s arm hit the wall and he got a bruise on his arm. After this, the quarrel ended</italic>. [The part that is identical with 3(a) is italicized]</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>Had we used the basic home violence scenario in the male-to-male frame, this would have indicated homosexual domestic violence, a scenario that is unfamiliar and outside the experience of most respondents. With regard to home violence, we wanted to compare gendered frames with the most common and publicly available type of violence (male-to-male violence), not with the rare homosexual domestic violence. Furthermore, all other factors apart from alcohol consumption and gender constellation (place, length of the relationship, type of violence and level of injury) were identical in all the home violence scenarios. Our label for this type of scenario is ‘home violence’, stressing the <italic>place</italic> of violence and distinguishing it from the two other scenario types − street violence and violence at work.</p>
<p>The gender frame was made explicit in each questionnaire, to guarantee ‘frames that the respondent cannot miss’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1477370811424383">Gaines et al., 2007</xref>: 7). First, the gender of the victim and the offender were held constant within each questionnaire, making it quite clear that the scenarios dealt with a special, gendered constellation of violence. Second, this section of the questionnaire began with a short title, which explicitly stated that the questions concerned men’s or women’s safety. In the male-to-female violence questionnaire, the statement informed respondents that the scenario questions were about ‘women’s safety’. In questionnaires depicting violence between men and violence by women against men, the title stated that the scenarios were about ‘men’s safety’. This rubric was influenced by the model of the Finnish Violence against Women (VAW) survey, which used the title ‘women’s safety’ in the questionnaire. Third, each scenario was followed by questions about the scenario, two of which asked the respondent to put himself/herself in the position of the victim (more about this below).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-1477370811424383">6</xref></sup></p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1477370811424383">
<title>Outcome variables</title>
<p>In this study, we used two outcome variables, corresponding to Analyses 1 and 2 reported below. First, we examined how the gendered framing influenced the respondents’ self-assessed readiness to report violent incidents to a hypothetical survey research worker (Analysis 1). After each scenario, the respondents were asked: ‘Imagine that you were in the position of [victim’s name]. A survey research project contacts you to ask if you have been a victim of violence. Would you report the above incident as violence?’ The response options were ‘no’, ‘maybe’, ‘quite likely’ and ‘certainly’. In what follows, the concept of self-assessed survey reporting propensity refers to people’s readiness to report scenario incidents to survey researchers. Second, we examined how the gendered framing influences the respondents’ reports about personal violent victimization during the past 12 months (Analysis 2).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1477370811424383">
<title>Controls</title>
<p>The design of the FEVS approximates a randomized experiment because each framed questionnaire was administered to an independent sample of the Finnish adult population. However, people’s decision about whether to participate or not introduces a potential source of non-randomness. Previous research has shown that the willingness and ability to respond to questions on sensitive topics varies according to the age, gender and socioeconomic background of the respondent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1477370811424383">Rosenbaum and Langhinrichsen-Rohling, 2006</xref>: 406). Hence, there can be compositional differences between the samples owing to differential responding in sociodemographic sub-groups. To control for the compositional effects in the analysis, the FEVS questionnaire included questions on core sociodemographic features of the respondent. These were gender, age, marital status, education, primary economic activity, occupational status, economic situation of the household and community type.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-1477370811424383">7</xref></sup></p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1477370811424383">
<title>Response rate</title>
<p>Prior research suggests that the topic of the survey influences people’s decision to participate. People with an interest in the topic are more likely to participate than those without such an interest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1477370811424383">Groves et al., 2004</xref>). In the current design, we had no external data on people’s prior victimization and therefore could not estimate whether victims of violence are more likely to respond than others. However, the match or mismatch of the gender of the respondent and the direction of the gendered violence in the frame can be taken as a rough indicator of the influence of ‘topic interest’. When the response rate is disaggregated by gender (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1477370811424383">Table 1</xref>), the difference between female and male response rates is highest in the ‘male violence against females’ frame. That frame appears to support female responding behaviour more than the female-to-male frame among male respondents. However, the effect of the frames appears to be smaller than the length of the questionnaire: for both females and males, the highest response rate was found in non-framed (shorter) questionnaire variants.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-1477370811424383">
<title>Analysis 1: Framing effects on self-assessed survey responding</title>
<p>The gendered framing of the questionnaire clearly and consistently affects people’s self-assessed propensity to report violent incidents to survey researchers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1477370811424383">Figure 1</xref>). People are most inclined to report violent incidents when the scenarios describe females as victims and males as offenders, irrespective of the type of violence. The male-to-female frame generates the highest levels of self-assessed reporting propensity in all three violence types. Since the frames were studied using independent random samples, it can be suggested that the frames were the cause of the differences in the survey responding propensity.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-1477370811424383">8</xref></sup></p>

<graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1477370811424383-fig1.tif"/>
</fig>
<p>Regarding home violence, male-to-male violence framing yields the lowest self-assessed survey reporting propensities. Female violence against males increases the respondents’ tendency to report it, and the highest reporting likelihood is associated with the male-to-female violence frame. In contrast, street violence and work-related violence show a more ‘non-linear’ effect: here there is no difference between the male-to-male scenario and the female-to-male scenario, but the male-to-female scenario is associated with an increased self-assessed survey reporting propensity. This effect is related to male responding (see below).</p>
<p>Framing effects were further examined in multivariate logistic regression models to control for the possible compositional disparities between experimental framing conditions. For the purposes of the following analyses, we dichotomized the survey reporting propensity variables so that 1 equals certainty in survey responding and 0 equals all other response options combined. The control variables were entered into the models simultaneously. The results of the analysis confirm that the effect of framing is strongest in home violence, net of other variables (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1477370811424383">Table 2</xref>). Compared with the respondents in the male-to-male framing condition, the respondents in male-to-female responding condition were 3.3 times more likely to say that they would certainly report the incident to survey researchers. In street violence, the corresponding odds ratio (OR) was 2.1, and in work-related violence it was 1.9. The findings on street and work violence are important. They reveal that the effect of the male-to-female violence frame is robust (and does not reflect the particularity of the 3(b) scenario).</p>

<p>The multivariate model additionally shows that the gender of the respondent was associated with an increased propensity to report home violence but not other types of violence. Middle-aged respondents manifested a consistently higher propensity to report home and street violence than older respondents; concerning home and street violence, the same applied to young respondents (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1477370811424383">Piispa, 2004</xref>). A high level of academic education was consistently related to a high readiness to report incidents in violence surveys. A subjectively assessed economic situation showed a non-linear association with self-assessed survey reporting propensity: people whose economic standing was either below or above average were more prone to report than those in between these polar opposites. Being married was related only to reporting work violence. Residing in suburban areas or rural centres was associated with a propensity to report home violence.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-1477370811424383">9</xref></sup></p>

<title>Gender-specific framing effects</title>
<p>There were both female and male respondents in all framing conditions. Thus, there were males responding in the ‘male violence against females’ frame and females responding in the ‘female violence against males’ frame. The question on survey reporting propensity asked the respondents to place themselves in the position of the victim in the particular scenario. This means that the males responding to male-to-female violence scenarios were asked to empathize with the female victim in the scenario. This raises questions about how the framing operates when the gender of the scenario victim and the gender of the respondent are aligned.</p>
<p>Both males and females responded very similarly to home violence scenarios: for both genders, male violence against females generated the greatest reporting propensity (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1477370811424383">Table 3</xref>). Among male respondents, responding in the male-to-female frame appears to trigger a particularly strong intention to report the incident in a victim survey. This is an ‘unrealistic’ reaction in the sense that the men were asked to put themselves in the position of the female victim. This finding may reflect the so-called ‘chivalry effect’ or social desirability. Male respondents in male-to-male and female-to-male frames may be less prone to regard the incident as reportable violence in order to appear ‘tough’ or as someone who can handle violence.</p>

<p>We further examined framing effects on putative survey responding by fitting the above regression models separately for female and male respondents. The findings (not shown) corroborate the results shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1477370811424383">Table 2</xref>. Male-to-female violence framing increases the self-assessed survey reporting propensity in both males and females. In contrast, the effect of female-to-male home violence (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1477370811424383">Table 2</xref>) appears to reflect solely male responding.</p>
<p>In sum, the analyses indicate that <italic>survey respondents have an elevated self-assessed violence survey reporting propensity when they are primed by a gendered violence framing condition that involves males as offenders and females as victims</italic>. This holds true for both genders and all types of violence (home, street and work). The effect of female-to-male violence framing appears to be more limited to male respondents.</p>

<title>Analysis 2: Framing effects on reporting violent victimization</title>
<p>In the analysis above, we examined the impact of gendered frames on self-reported propensity to consider violence scenarios as ‘reportable violence’ in a hypothetical survey context. Significant framing effects were observed. The next logical step is to ask whether the framing influences the way the respondents respond to survey questions about their own violent victimizations. When examining this, we drew on the non-framed questionnaire versions included in the overall design of the FEVS project, which double the number of respondents included in the analysis (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1477370811424383">Table 1</xref>). This is useful because the framing effects on reporting actual violence are likely to be smaller than in the hypothetical scenarios. Furthermore, with regard to home violence, the above results on self-assessed reporting propensity may have been influenced by the particularity of the male-to-male violence scenario (the 3(b) scenario on drinking buddies). In the following analysis, we compared violence reporting in the framed conditions to the behaviour of respondents who were not primed by any gendered framing concerning the issue of violence.</p>

<title>Violence prevalence in different frames</title>
<p>The prevalence levels of violent victimization in different framing conditions are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-1477370811424383">Table 4</xref>. The core result is best captured by the four summary rows at the bottom of the table. In physical violence, the questionnaires with gendered framing yielded higher levels of victimization than questionnaires with no gender frame or a male-to-male frame.</p>

<p>It could be argued that the threat questions are particularly susceptible to framing effects because they are more subjective by definition than those concerning violent incidents. However, this does not appear to be the case. The gender effect was observed particularly with regard to physical violence but not with respect to threats or sexual violence. As such, this is consistent with the above results on self-assessed survey reporting as the scenarios in that analysis were about physical violence. However, it should be noted that, when items comprising the physical violence scale are observed individually, the frame-based difference appears to be most evident in items such as ‘other violence’ and ‘obstruction of movement’.</p>

<title>Multivariate analysis</title>
<p>The bivariate findings (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-1477370811424383">Table 4</xref>) suggest that framing caused people to respond differently to violent victimization questions. To control for possible compositional effects in the randomized sub-samples, we conducted multivariate analyses, holding constant the sociodemographic characteristics of the respondents (the same variables as shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1477370811424383">Table 2</xref>).

<p>The findings corroborate that, if the survey instrument communicates a gendered perspective of the violence issue to the respondents, this influences people’s reporting and/or recall of personally experienced physical violence. The frame ‘male violence against women’ in particular appears to boost the reporting of physical violence. The framing effect of the female-to-male frame is marginally significant (<italic>p</italic> = .052) in influencing the reporting of physical violence. Findings related to ‘any’ violence reflect the framing effects on physical violence reporting because the sum scale of ‘any’ violence is dominated by items tapping into the physical part of the violence continuum. In the following, we use only the reporting of physical violence as the outcome variable in order to avoid redundant information.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table6-1477370811424383">Table 6</xref> shows framing effects separately into six gender/age groups. Findings indicate that the young and middle-aged females are more prone to be influenced by gender framing. Young females are exclusively susceptible to the male-to-female frame, whereas their middle-aged counterparts are influenced by gendered framing in general. Thus, both groups are more likely to report personal violent victimization if they enter the victimization questions through the frame of ‘male violence against females’. It is likely that the overall framing effect shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-1477370811424383">Table 5</xref> reflects the responses of those in these groups.</p>

<p>Among males, gendered framing has no effect on reporting past victimizations. However, the male-to-male violence frame appears to block violence reporting among young males. Possibly they want to appear ‘tough’ (and hence not as victims) when entering the victimization questions through the frame of male-to-male violence.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<sec id="section13-1477370811424383">
<title>Limitations</title>
<p>This study was based on a design that controlled the causal factor experimentally in a series of independent random samples of the Finnish adult population. This kind of design makes a clear distinction between cause and effect and it allowed us to conclude that framing has causal power over the way people respond to victim surveys. However, four limitations must be briefly discussed. These pertain to the questions related to correspondence to reality, effect duration, use of comparison groups, and recall period.</p>
<p>The applicability of findings to real-life conditions is a central concern in survey experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1477370811424383">Gaines et al., 2007</xref>: 7). In this study, the frames were introduced in a manner that is not realistic or ‘natural’ for typical crime victim surveys. To our knowledge, such surveys hardly ever begin with violence scenarios that prime respondents, setting them up to have a specific perspective. In such surveys, the gendered framing is constituted by the title of the questionnaire, the introductory letter and the content of the questions. The current findings do not, therefore, prove that actual gender-based surveys influence the reporting of violence in a similar manner. What the findings do indicate is that such framing effects are likely in gendered surveys.</p>
<p>The question of effect duration is pertinent when survey experiments are designed to model real-life causal processes, which take place outside the survey responding situation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1477370811424383">Gaines et al., 2007</xref>: 5–6). In such cases, it is relevant to ask whether the framing effect lasts more than, say, 10 minutes. However, in the present research, the real-life effect that is being simulated is a very short one: the time it takes to respond to a victim survey. With respect to survey responding, our design was realistic, and it went beyond asking mere survey reporting intentions by examining actual self-reports of violent victimization.</p>
<p>The findings on self-assessed survey reporting were based on the male-to-male violence scenario as a comparison group. In home violence, this scenario was a ‘drinking buddies’ scene. Therefore, with regard to home violence, the strong framing effects may reflect the extremely low status of marginalized males in Finnish society. However, the gender framing effect was also clear in street and work violence where the comparison condition was identical with the gendered frames (apart from the gender status). Furthermore, analyses of actual violence reporting corroborated the finding that the male-to-female violence framing had the strongest influence on recalling and reporting physical violence. This is important because, in that comparison, framed questionnaires were compared with the non-framed questionnaire types (with no scenarios whatsoever). Thus, the finding concerning self-assessed survey responding is not reducible to a contrast effect vis-à-vis marginalized male violence.</p>
<p>Finally, our use of a 12-month recall period may have hindered us in detecting even stronger gender framing effects. Conceivably, a longer recall period (for example, the relatively often used lifetime period) could have revealed even greater susceptibility to framing effects. After all, the role of memory and primed recall are likely to be greater if the respondents are asked to recall incidents that have taken place well into the past. From this point of view, our test of framing effects was conservative and biased against detecting priming effects that are based on memory retrieval.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section14-1477370811424383">
<title>Core findings</title>
<p>In this research, we constituted framing by adding hypothetical scenarios of borderline incidents to the survey. In these borderline incidents, frame variation was created by alternating the gender of the victim and the offender. The findings strongly support the existence of framing effects in crime victimization surveys. Framing effects were observed both in a respondent’s self-assessed propensity to report borderline incidents and in people’s personal victimization reports.</p>
<p>First, gendered framing clearly influenced people’s self-assessed willingness to report a borderline incident as violence in a victim survey, regardless of the type of violence. People responding in a male-to-female violence frame were most prone to report incidents of work, street and home violence. Female respondents, in particular, were consistently influenced by the male violence against females framing. With men, similar effects may reflect chivalry and social desirability effects − the social norm that women ought to be especially protected. In this respect, the current findings are consistent with the findings of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1477370811424383">Felson and Feld (2009)</xref> on the determinants of reporting incidents to the police. They found that people are particularly likely to report offences by men against women. Similarly, we found that, in a survey context, people are more likely to define male-to-female violence as reportable. This framing effect was expressed independently of the victim–offender relationship and was observed in home violence, street violence and work violence.</p>
<p>Second, gendered framing influenced people’s reporting of their personal victimizations. Multivariate analyses indicated that the male-to-female violence frame yields higher prevalence levels of physical victimization. This finding has practical relevance because there are surveys that focus specifically on male violence against females (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1477370811424383">Haggerty 2001</xref>). Framing effects should be kept in mind if the results of such surveys are compared with surveys targeted at other social groups. Moreover, the VAW surveys may suffer from internal validity problems that are due to framing effects. For instance, the ‘male violence against female’ frame appears to influence young and middle-aged respondents more than the elderly respondents (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1477370811424383">Piispa, 2004</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section15-1477370811424383">
<title>Concluding remarks</title>
<p>The present findings should not be seen as principally critical of surveys that deal only with male violence against females. The observation that framing effects were related to physical violence is of some interest here. Gendered framing does not necessarily function by including more trivial cases, such as threats and various forms of controlling behaviour. The effect may have more to do with the decision to participate in the survey by responding and with factors related to primed recall. On the other hand, the gendered framing effect on reporting personal physical victimization reflected primarily questions on ‘obstruction of movement’ and ‘other violence’. These are less serious items in the physical violence continuum (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-1477370811424383">Table 4</xref>). Therefore, framing effects based on conceptual expansion cannot be completely ruled out. In other words, it is possible that gendered framing has led respondents to subsume borderline incidents involving the obstruction of movement and other violence into the conceptual umbrella of reportable violence. More research is needed on this question.</p>
<p>The reasons that gendered framing generates a higher survey reporting propensity and higher prevalence levels of violent physical victimization are likely to be multiple. First, framing probably influences the selection of who responds and who does not because framing introduces topics that evoke more interest in some respondents and less in others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1477370811424383">Groves et al., 2004</xref>). Male violence against females may be a particular trigger for female victim participation (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1477370811424383">Table 1</xref> showing response rates). In the analysis, we used weights to cancel out differential responding in gender and age groups, but a selection of respondent status based on prior victimization cannot be discounted. It is possible that victims of violence are more likely than non-victims to respond to victim surveys (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1477370811424383">Killias et al., 1994</xref>: 190–1). If this is the case, the framing effect could interact with victim status to induce high response rates in surveys on male violence against females. Second, stimulating memory may have caused a priming effect. Even though the recall period was short, it is possible that framing-primed memory retrieval was involved. Third, altruistic motives may have influenced the findings if respondents believed that the researchers wanted to know about specific types of violence. Fourth, more research is needed on the possibility of tactical responding, where responding is influenced by policy and advocacy concerns,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-1477370811424383">10</xref></sup> if people regard surveys as a means of raising consciousness about specific types of violence.</p>
<p>In sum, the findings of the Finnish Experimental Victim Survey are highly consistent with the paradigm that sees survey responding as a form of ‘conversation’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1477370811424383">Tourangeau and McNeeley, 2003</xref>). Respondents answer questions posed and framed by the researchers. They search for cues about what the researchers probably want them to report. In doing so, they engage in altruistic behaviour in order to help researchers in studying specific issues. Acknowledgement of such phenomena does not compromise the objectivity and validity of the victim survey, yet awareness of the possible framing effects increases the objectivity of a study. Conceivably, research could even yield weights to be used to correct for framing effects when different social groups are compared. Generally, the findings underscore that survey researchers should be highly self-reflective about how the different aspects of the survey are framed.</p>

<p>Galesic and Tourangeau define framing effects as resulting from ‘the way the survey is presented to the respondents in terms of its name, sponsor, topic and stated purpose’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1477370811424383">Galesic and Tourangeau, 2007</xref>: 190; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1477370811424383">Tourangeau and McNeeley, 2003</xref>: 36).
