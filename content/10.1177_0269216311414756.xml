<title>Background:</title>
<p>Constipation is common and distressing in palliative care. Despite this, approaches to assessment and subsequent treatment are most remarkable for the numbers who fail adequate palliation.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-0269216311414756">
<title>Aim:</title>
<p>The primary aim of this paper is to summarise the current approaches to assessing constipation in palliative care, contrasting these approaches with those recommended by gastroenterologists in the assessment of resistant constipation in non-palliative care. The secondary aim is to suggest ways that the approaches used by gastroenterologist could be modified to be tolerable to palliative care.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0269216311414756">
<title>Design:</title>
<p>A non-systematic review of the literature was undertaken.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0269216311414756">
<title>Data sources:</title>
<p>The electronic databases (MEDLINE, CINHAL) were searched for English language articles that explored assessment of constipation in palliative care and evidence-based gastroenterology guidelines that summarised assessment and management of constipation.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0269216311414756">
<title>Results:</title>
<p>Currently, the assessment of constipation in palliative care is predominantly based on people’s reports, physical examination and if further imaging is deemed necessary, a plain abdominal radiograph. However, data in non-palliative care patients refutes the usefulness of self-reported symptoms to localise whether problems are due to colon dysfunction or structures of defaecation. Plain radiographs are most useful to exclude a bowel obstruction only. In cases of resistant constipation, gastroenterology guidelines recommend an assessment approach that includes measuring colon transit time and an assessment of the structures that facilitate defaecation.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0269216311414756">
<title>Conclusions:</title>
<p>Current approaches to assessing constipation in palliative care are very different to those recommended by gastroenterology guidelines. However, modified approaches may be tolerable to palliative care patients and offer the chance of developing targeted palliation.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Constipation is a frequently distressing problem that often complicates the lives of people with specialist palliative care needs. Prevalence reports between 30 and 100% are quoted,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0269216311414756">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0269216311414756">2</xref></sup> with most reports available describing the problems experienced by people with advanced cancer. It is most likely that the widely ranging prevalence figures reflect the lack of agreed definition in palliative care. Patients tend to report constipation as a subjective experience characterised by changes in their experience in passing stool whereas clinician’s definitions tend towards constipation as a physical problem characterised by changes in stool appearance and frequency.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0269216311414756">1</xref></sup> In contrast, it is recommended in the non-palliative care population that constipation is defined by the Rome Criteria<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0269216311414756">3</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0269216311414756">Table 1</xref>).</p>

<p>Regardless of the definition, laxatives are frequently prescribed to palliate the problem. Previous observations describe more than 60% of people admitted to a palliative care unit (<italic>n</italic> = 211) were prescribed laxatives, 79% of whom had cancer. Of the people prescribed laxatives, greater than 50% were prescribed two or more laxatives simultaneously.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0269216311414756">4</xref></sup>
</p>
<p>Although constipation is a common problem in palliative care, the usual approaches to management are most remarkable for the number of people who fail to achieve adequate symptom relief. Reports suggest that 40–70% of palliative care patients treated with laxatives including peripheral opioid antagonists continue to experience symptomatic constipation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0269216311414756">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0269216311414756">6</xref></sup>
</p>
<p>Failure to effectively palliate constipation is worrying as the negative impacts may be serious. In addition to abdominal pain and discomfort, other problems such as nausea, vomiting, anorexia, urinary retention and bowel obstruction have been attributed to constipation any of which may prompt hospitalisation. Constipation may equal or rival pain as a symptom in terms of the distress and anxiety provoked.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0269216311414756">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0269216311414756">8</xref></sup> In both malignant and non-malignant life-limiting illnesses, constipation may have a direct deleterious impact on reported quality of life,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0269216311414756">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0269216311414756">10</xref></sup> with recent data suggesting the greater the number of laxatives prescribed for a person, the more distressed the person’s family is likely to be.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0269216311414756">2</xref></sup>
</p>
<p>There are also societal costs. Constipated palliative care patients receive more community nursing support and are 20% more likely to be hospitalised.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0269216311414756">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0269216311414756">12</xref></sup> When hospitalised, severely constipated patients receive more nursing time, with a recent study suggesting that earlier and more effective interventions for this group will result in significant clinical and economic benefits.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0269216311414756">13</xref></sup> As the demands for palliative care services over the next decade are expected to rise, there is a real need to identify more efficacious approaches to managing the problem of constipation.</p>
<p>In gastroenterology, constipation is a problem attributed to either neuro-muscular dysfunction of the colon or neuromuscular dysfunction of the structures that facilitate defaecation. It would be rare for palliative care clinicians to frame the problems that result in constipation in palliative care in such a simple physiological manner despite the fact that the same structures have to be impaired. The main differences, though still poorly articulated, are likely to be the insults that the colon and pelvic structures are subjected to in a palliative situation. The authors of this paper are of the opinion that if such a premise was adopted in palliative care, a more rigorous assessment of constipation in a framework established in gastroenterology would be possible.</p>

<title>Current approaches to assessing constipation in palliative care</title>
<p>Palliative care patients are most likely to identify themselves as constipated when they experience difficulties with ease of defaecation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0269216311414756">14</xref></sup> Palliative care consensus practice guidelines recommend diagnosis and treatment based predominantly on individuals’ subjective reports despite the fact that symptoms do not reliably distinguish the anatomical location or cause of the problem.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0269216311414756">15</xref></sup> Physical examination is recommended to identify problems that may contribute to the problem, such as a tumour mass or ascites. Rectal examination is indicated but aside from diagnosing rectal impaction, little other data is commonly sought from this.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0269216311414756">14</xref></sup> When further investigations are considered necessary in palliative care for people well enough to tolerate such investigations, practice guidelines recommend plain abdominal radiographs.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0269216311414756">16</xref></sup> However, little consideration is paid to the fact that radiographs are most useful for excluding bowel obstruction<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0269216311414756">17</xref></sup> as the cause of the presenting symptoms but otherwise offer little information to refine the differential diagnosis of constipation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0269216311414756">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0269216311414756">19</xref></sup>

<title>Assessing constipation in non-palliative patients</title>
<p>In contrast, the diagnostic approaches recommended by gastroenterology guidelines aim to define as clearly as possible the underlying pathology of the problem which then allows implementation of tailored interventions. Constipation affects up to 30% of the general population, and gastroenterologists define constipation symptoms as arising from disturbed neuro-muscular function of the colon or disturbed neuro-muscular function of the structures of defaecation or, in some instances, a combination of both. Investigations to sub-classify people to one or more of these pathological groups are recommended not only to facilitate care but also to improve epidemiological and therapeutic investigations.</p>
<p>As in palliative care, assessments by gastroenterologists begin at the bedside where specialist guidelines recommend a comprehensive digital rectal examination (DRE). Unlike palliative care, the DRE is undertaken to not only to exclude rectal faecal impaction but to commence the process of screening for pelvic muscle weakness, paradoxical anal sphincter contraction or an inability to relax the anal sphincter appropriately<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0269216311414756">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0269216311414756">21</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0269216311414756">Table 2</xref>). In non-palliative care patients, components of the DRE have been correlated with objective studies supporting the usefulness of this examination,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0269216311414756">21</xref></sup> although the same correlations have not been explored in the palliative care population. As a result of this dearth of evidence, the DRE is underutilised, highlighted by the observation that whilst 60% of 166 new admissions to one specialist palliative care unit had laxatives prescribed with 30% having constipation listed as one of the main problems, only six (4%) had a DRE documented.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0269216311414756">4</xref></sup></p>

<p>Further investigations recommended by gastroenterology practice guidelines include measuring colon content transit times with a colon transit test (CTT), and assessment of the structures of defaecation with anorectal manometry and balloon expulsion tests<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0269216311414756">15</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0269216311414756">Table 3</xref>). The results of these investigations allow the physical problems that may underlie an individual’s problems to sub-categorised into one of four main groups: (i) irritable bowel syndrome where no dysfunction of the colon or defaecation structures are identified but a person constantly perceives or experiences symptoms of constipation; (ii) slow transit constipation where passage of colonic contents is prolonged; (iii) pelvic dyssynergia where paradoxical contraction of the external anal sphincter occurs; and (iv) combination slow transit plus outlet obstruction (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0269216311414756">Table 4</xref>).</p>

Most attention is paid to subjective reports despite suggestions that such reports alone do not reliably predict the underlying physical changes leading to the problem. A study of chronically constipated people (<italic>n</italic> = 190) compared their symptom experiences with objective measures of colon transit times and defaecation, allowing these people to be objectively subcategorised into either slow transit constipation or disordered defaecation constipation. The results suggested that 94% of people studied felt the need to strain regardless of which subgroup of constipation they fell into, with the authors concluding the symptoms experienced by people do not have adequate specificity to accurately reflect the type of underling problem.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0269216311414756">29</xref></sup>
</p>
<p>It is these observations that underlie the opinion that the current approaches to assessing constipation, based predominantly on subjective reports in palliative care, is not adequate. An alternative approach that is based on assessments that sub-categorise constipated non-palliative population according to the major underlying pathophysiology to palliative care patients is proposed.</p>
<p>To facilitate such an approach, appropriate sub-categories applicable to palliative care populations need to be defined. A logical starting point to do this is to consider the available evidence that confirms factors that contribute to the development of constipation in palliative care patients. Although most of this is extrapolated from research in other fields of medicine, three physical subgroups are proposed: (i) slow transit of colonic contents; (ii) recto-sigmoid outlet delay; and (iii) overlap syndrome with diagnostic features of both slow transit and recto-sigmoid outlet delay.</p>
<p>The slow transit category is based on the numerous factors in palliative care that have been shown to slow colonic contents in other areas of medicine and the incidence of slow transit constipation in the whole population. Acquired factors know to slow transit commonly occurring in palliative care include medications (especially medications with anti-cholinergic effects<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0269216311414756">30</xref></sup> (which includes opioids), opioid analgesia,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0269216311414756">31</xref></sup> reduced oral intake,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0269216311414756">32</xref></sup> deteriorating performance status presenting as reduced mobility,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0269216311414756">33</xref></sup> metabolic disturbances such as diabetes mellitus,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0269216311414756">34</xref></sup> renal failure,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0269216311414756">35</xref></sup> and paraneoplastic syndromes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0269216311414756">36</xref></sup> Ideopathic slow transit is likely to occur in 10% of the general community, but the impact of this on the severity of the constipation symptoms experienced during their time in palliative care is not known.</p>
<p>Rather than the label of pelvic floor dyssynergias used in functional constipation, the category recto-sigmoid outlet delay is suggested to accommodate problems of the structures of defaecation, both functional and acquired. This term, coined to describe the problems of disordered pelvic structure function in the elderly, includes constipation symptoms secondary to the functional problems of inappropriate contraction of the external anal sphincter on straining and inadequate relaxation of the internal anal sphincter. It also includes the acquired problems of anal obstruction secondary to myopathic or neuropathic processes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0269216311414756">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0269216311414756">38</xref></sup> Myopathic processes contribute to other symptoms in palliative care such as dyspnoea and weakness but the notion that muscle weakness could contribute to constipation has not yet been explored.</p>
<p>The third group proposed is that of a mixed group of slow transit and outlet delay. Given the numerous pathologies that palliative care patients are likely to accumulate as disease progresses, this may be the most common problem as life becomes very short.</p>
<p>Objectively confirming these subcategories in palliative care requires further research. However, early data already supports that features of this approach and subsequent management are feasible. As ever in palliative care, any interventions must be considered within the individual’s ability to tolerate them.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0269216311414756">39</xref></sup> However, it is also important to acknowledge that the length of time a person may spend under the care of a palliative care team is highly individual and that palliative care is not synonymous with terminal care.</p>
<p>In those people who are well enough to tolerate a plain abdominal radiograph, CTT is measurable. Transit times are calculated by counting how many radio-opaque markers are visible on a plain abdominal radiograph sing a validated formula. Such an approach was adopted in a pilot study of palliative care inpatients (<italic>n</italic> = 10), 80% of whom had colon transit times greater than 72 h, contrasting with non-constipated healthy controls where times range between 20 and 50 h.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0269216311414756">40</xref></sup> However, it is not possible to identify if this was due to slowed transit of content through the colon due to problems with the colon or delayed transit through the rectum leading to a backup of markers because of pelvic floor dysfunction. Whilst this study is small, to our knowledge, no other studies like this exist. Other observations have documented the time through the whole gut to be prolonged with a study by Sykes of 17 palliative inpatients suggested whole gut transit times between 96 and 288 h,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0269216311414756">41</xref></sup> which compares with whole gut transit times of 9 to 96 h in normal populations.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0269216311414756">42</xref></sup>
</p>
<p>Although not yet studied in palliative care patients, it is possible to assess the integrity of pelvic structures at the bedside. Balloon expulsion requires no more than a bedside commode and a balloon catheter with a 50 ml balloon. Furthermore, anal manometry may be undertaken with a handheld perineometer, with this approach validated in a control population against other more invasive methods.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0269216311414756">43</xref></sup>

<title>How could such an approach to assessing constipation be useful in palliative care?</title>
<p>Undertaking such comprehensive assessments would, for the first time, allow clinicians to knowledgably target constipation treatments according to the main underlying physical problems that have resulted in the symptom of constipation. This would allow the management of constipation in palliative care to be more akin to other symptoms in palliative care such as pain, nausea and dyspnoea. It is currently accepted and even recommended that the pathophysiology that underlies these symptoms in each individual are considered, investigated if appropriate and management tailored accordingly. It must be stressed that like any other approach to symptom control in palliative care, such targeted strategies need to be applicable to the individual’s capacity to tolerate the same and the expected prognosis.</p>
<p>It is possible that this more structured approach to assessing constipation will allow more rationale prescribing around constipation. This is in contrast to current management of constipation where management is largely based on clinical guidelines with little evidence to support the use of most laxatives. However, when idiopathic slow transit constipation has been proven, the initial step for people is the prescription of stimulant laxatives. Assessing people in the manner suggested in this paper allows such an approach to be trialled in palliative care. There is sometimes hesitancy in palliative care patients to prescribe stimulants without stool softeners due to the commonly held belief that this will result in excess cramping abdominal pain. However, when objectively studied, senna alone (dose 17.2 mg daily to 25.8 mg tds) in a palliative population was found to bowel tolerated and effective, when compared to senna plus docusate regimes (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0269216311414756">Table 4</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0269216311414756">44</xref></sup>
</p>
<p>It seems logical that such approaches would not be limited to slow transit. Weakness of the pelvic floor in the absence of slow transit in chronic constipation prompts the recommendation that people should receive regular suppositories with the aim of keeping the rectum empty. In theory, this means that the numbers of medications people are prescribed can be reduced with the expectation that symptoms will be better palliated (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0269216311414756">Table 4</xref>).</p>

<title>Strengths and limitations to this proposed approach</title>
<p>The approach to assessing constipation proposed here has many potential advantages. Potentially, the management of constipation could become more rationale with prescribing tailored to the problem. This could also allow clinicians and researchers to have an objective framework from which to explore the impact of risk factors for constipation on the colon and structures of defaecation including the impact of progressive disease on the colon and structures of defaecation and other impacts such as medications, changes in appetite and changes in performance status. Lastly, this also offers researchers the chance to study different laxatives including the peripheral opioid antagonists from the improved position of understanding. It is possible that better understanding of the impact of all these factors will help explain why opioid antagonists such as methylnaltrexone are effective in 50% of people<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0269216311414756">6</xref></sup> despite the fact this is a target treatment. Ultimately, the aim of this process is to develop an evidence-based algorithm to improve outcomes of palliative care patients with constipation symptoms.</p>
<p>However, it is naive to consider that introducing such an approach into palliative care would be without challenges. The proposal outlined here represents a significant change for clinicians who are loath to initiate any investigations that they perceive could be burdensome for their patients. Whilst the investigations outlined here have been chosen because they are minimally invasive, the available evidence to support this observation is largely derived from different patient groups to palliative care. Whilst this is acknowledged, it is also the current clinical reality that the burden of constipation for palliative care patients is significant within current treatment paradigms. Further discussions around an alternative approach as proposed here are needed.</p>
