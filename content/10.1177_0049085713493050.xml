<p>Conflicts and disasters are more common and affecting more people now than ever before. Millions are fleeing from their homes to escape persecution and pain, inevitable in such situations. In the new, unfamiliar place they, however, end up worse off, suffering some of the most traumatic experiences, and where even for their bare survival they depend on help. The effort of the international humanitarian community in assisting and protecting people affected by conflicts and disasters is the subject of this fascinating book.</p>
<p>Most of those involved in humanitarian work generally see their role simply as rushing relief supplies and deploying medical personnel to wherever they may be needed. However, for Elizabeth Ferris, the author of this brilliant book, ‘the essence of the humanitarian enterprise is protection’. Protection is concerned with the real life-and-death issues: ‘taking action to stop refugees from being pushed back across borders, civilians from being massacred by vigilantes or insurgents, and women being raped by marauding gangs and providing support to desperate people who use desperate measures to try to find safety in distant lands’. Its key concern is the protection of vulnerable groups.</p>
<p>Protection has now acquired a new prominence on the agenda of the international humanitarian community. Policies, manuals, guidelines and monitoring indicators are being churned out incessantly, with protection becoming a part of mainstream practice. This has also emerged as a popular subject for discussion in conferences, as also with the authors of books, journal articles, and so on. But the indiscriminate use of protection in all kinds of activities—from preventing violence by determined terrorists groups to protecting women from being raped—is robbing it of its distinctive meaning. This is becoming worrisome, especially to the author of this book, a strong protection protagonist.</p>
<p>The author provides in her inimitable manner an excellent overview of the entire humanitarian enterprise. The book, covering all aspect of humanitarian work, is neatly divided into 10 chapters, each dealing comprehensively with diverse topics: international law, human rights, humanitarian assistance, the role of UN and NGOs, global governance, humanitarian dilemmas, natural disasters, financing issues, challenges facing humanitarian actors, and finally observations and conclusions. The chapters on humanitarian principles and international law, the UN and NGOs in humanitarian operations, and global governance, in particular, provide information on many new developments and are highly illuminating.</p>
<p>The author provides a brief history of protection, describing how protection as a concept emerged from international humanitarian law, refugee law, and human rights law. The human rights law emerged later in the aftermath of Second World War. The lawyers in these three specialist fields of international refugee law, humanitarian law and human rights law dominated the 1980s. But all these laws, international standards and peacekeepers proved insufficient to protect people on the ground. These failed to prevent ethnic conflicts in Bosnia, Rwanda and Somalia, for example. In the 1990s, protection thus emerged as a reaction to the failure of the international community to prevent widespread bloodshed. Both human rights and protection have since emerged as areas of wide concern today, and as the author points out, ‘many use the term “protection” as shorthand for a person’s basic human rights’.</p>
<p>The author while focusing on the many actors who are involved in assisting and protecting civilians quotes from a study, which concludes that ‘most people survive and do so without assistance from external parties’. She also agrees with this widely held view that in emergencies, such as earthquakes, it is essentially the initial local effort that saves most of the lives. Subsequently, other actors arrive on the scene (governments, UN, NGOs, and other agencies, even celebrities) and share the responsibility to provide further relief and resettlement assistance.</p>
<p>Traditionally, victims of disasters are provided urgently needed basic relief supplies, such as food and medicine, but the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami experience brought to the fore the need for their protection as well. Even in the face of this tragedy, widespread human rights abuses were reported in providing relief and long-term assistance. The international humanitarian community is now of the view that those affected by floods, earthquakes, and volcanic eruptions also deserve protection by the humanitarian community the same way as the people rendered as refugees due to conflicts. In addition, the author also sees climate change related displacement as a major future challenge for the international humanitarian community.</p>
<p>The task of delivering humanitarian assistance is becoming complex and a challenging one. It is getting more difficult, risky and politicised. Well-meaning humanitarian workers increasingly face a danger to their lives. In fact, they have been attacked in many places just for doing their duty of protecting innocent civilians from being massacred. Governments and even non-state actors often prevent humanitarian aid from reaching its intended recipients for their own reasons. This happens because in some countries international humanitarian aid is seen as a cover for the designs of Western nations to promote activities that have no resemblance whatever to the proclaimed lofty international humanitarian principles.</p>
<p>The perception that humanitarian actors should be allowed to function freely because they are independent and impartial has changed, particularly in parts of the Islamic world, where much humanitarian work is focused. The author seems inclined to agree with this changed perception: ‘as a social scientist, I have recognised from the beginning of my engagement in humanitarian efforts that the international response to the victims of war and disaster depends more on politics than on altruism’.</p>
<p>The conclusion of this study is that while the role of humanitarian agencies in protecting people affected by conflicts and disasters is vital, that is not a panacea for all their sufferings. In spite of the growing focus on protection, and a plethora of international standards, guidelines and manuals, neither the risk to people of losing their lives has decreased, nor the gender-based violence as a weapon of war has ceased to be used against civilians. In the Middle East, even the efforts of the UN Relief Works Agency for Palestinian Refugees (UNRWA) could not ensure protection of the Palestinian civilians against the repeated Israeli attacks in Gaza. Donor pressures on the Sri Lankan government to evacuate civilians in the final stages of military action against insurgents simply did not work. She argues that it is therefore important that international community holds political leaders and leaders of armed groups accountable for protecting their own people. There is a limit to what humanitarian protection can do, and recognising this limitation may well pave the way towards more effective measures that would ensure the physical protection of civilians.</p>
<p>This book is focused on issues surrounding humanitarian aid for victims of conflicts and disasters. The kind of international humanitarian resources to assist and protect these victims, as discussed in this book, does not however exist for those displaced by development, though they also undergo similar horrendous experiences. They also lose their lands, homes, jobs, social networks and cultural moorings, to name a few of their precious possessions—a phenomenon which Michael Cernea has termed as ‘the risks of impoverishment’. Human rights abuses abound in their situation as well. It would this seem unfair to treat victims of development differently. Often, even national efforts also fail them. Governments are generally hesitant even to adopt resettlement policies to protect displaced people, and where they exist, to implement them firmly.</p>
<p>The fact is that there is much that development actors can learn from the international humanitarian experience. Similarly, humanitarian actors involved in managing conflicts and disasters can also learn much from the experiences of those managing displacement from development. Their approach to resettlement involving advance planning, including initial social impact assessment, relocation, resettlement and development, has some useful lessons. It must however be admitted that the resettlement planners of development-induced displacement are helped by the fact that displacement can be foreseen much before it occurs, which is not the case with disasters. For example, an earthquake hits an area without any warning signal and the first priority then is to rush relief and to save the lives that are in grave danger. This does not permit the humanitarian actors the luxury of time required for meticulous prior planning of long-term resettlement assistance and development. Still, what they can learn is to go beyond short-termism in rebuilding the lives of survivors, as the resettlement planners must do for those affected by development projects.</p>
<p>The author’s own personal experiences with humanitarian work beginning since 1985, and years of research work supported by an incredibly extensive review of the existing literature have gone into the writing of this remarkable book. Ferris’s book should be essential reading for students pursuing courses on humanitarian aid, refugees, disaster management, human rights, international relations, international and UN studies, and also development displacements. Overall, this is an outstanding contribution to the literature on one of the most challenging tasks confronting the international humanitarian community today.</p>
