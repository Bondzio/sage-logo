<p>This book is on the side of the<italic>mystical fool</italic> because this kind of fool tells the truth, shows the world its errors and shouts out its problems, and because the need for <italic>mystical fools</italic> is still substantial today. The expression comes from a 1934 text by Jung himself: if anyone dared to predict at the beginning of the 20th century that in thirty years the Jews would be persecuted again as in the Middle Ages or that instead of the Cross a swastika would be saluted, “that man would have been hooted at as a mystical fool” (142).</p>
<p>The volume shows that, beyond all objections that could be made to Jung’s psychology, his theory is still important in this “period when a theologically terrorized humanity looks for salvation” (185). Religious-based belief – theological or secular – must overtake the divinities; it has to search for “a God beyond the Gods of theism” (180), i.e. for a Spirit that would include the feminine side by side with the masculine. Humans will learn that, in Jung’s terms, “the relation of the divine to the human is the relation of the unconscious to consciousness as wholly intrapsychic functions of each other” (221). Also, people will understand that the distinction between divine and human must be left behind and that the “[t]ranscendence becomes a wholly intrapsychic reality” (228). Even if Jung’s theory is right, it still can be considered “powerfully anarchic” because it denies an absolute political, religious or ethnic truth.</p>
<p>This book is a step-by-step explanation of Jung’s psychology and myth. It clarifies not only the main Jungian ideas, like the numinous, individuation and so on (Chapters 1 and 2), or the relativity of God (Chapter 3), but it also discusses the intellectual relationships and controversies of ideas that Jung had with Martin Buber (Chapter 4) or Victor White (Chapter 5), and the affinities with S.P. Huntington’s theory (Chapter 7): religion is “the most significant factor in the creation of civilizations and so of the conflict that exists between civilizations” (154). Huntington’s assumption, believes the author, is more pessimistic than Jung’s. The latter has more optimistic conclusions: “With Jung the myth would be that of a currently developing consciousness, in living touch with the psychic source of all religions and their cultures, coming to permeate each existent civilization from the same human depths that initially created them and their differences” (163).</p>
<p>In addition, in Chapter 10 the influences of some mystics on Jung are shown, especially those of Meister Eckhart and Jakob Boehme. The volume ends with an abundant Bibliography and an efficient Index.</p>
<p><italic>On Behalf of the Mystical Fool</italic> will be helpful not only for scholars of Jungian studies or psychologists interested in therapeutic associations between religious life and psyche. The book is clearly written even for those not specialized in Jung’s theory; consequently it will be of great interest for scholars engaged in Religious Studies since Jung’s point of view about the religious situation is far from being obsolete. Not least, the book presented here could be stimulating for believers of any kind: religious, political, cultural and ethnic; maybe they will start asking questions about their beliefs, “[i]f it could be realized that the Gods, both religious and political, create themselves through the psyche” (230).</p>
