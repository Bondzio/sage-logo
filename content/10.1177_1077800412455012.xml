<abstract>
<p>This brief article sets the stage for the three articles about causality and qualitative research by Maxwell, Donmoyer, and Anderson &amp; Scott (as well as Erickson’s critique of these articles) that follow by placing the debate about causality in qualitative research in an historical context. This article notes that the use of qualitative methods historically often was justified by claims that qualitative methods represented a new and radically different paradigm, a paradigm that, among other things, rejected the notion that social phenomena could be described or explained in cause and effect terms. This article suggests that the paradigm talk of the past should not be dismissed cavalierly since all empirical research is framed and, therefore, influenced by the a priori assumptions of the researcher (and the particular research community that has socialized the researcher). However, the article also suggests that earlier thinking about paradigms and qualitative methods—and, more specifically, thinking that unequivocally dismisses the possibility of causal explanations in qualitative research—needs to be reconsidered. This reconsideration, of course, is what the papers that follow do, albeit in quite different ways.</p>

<title>The Past as Prologue</title>
<p>During the final quarter of the 20th century, educational researchers, along with researchers in a number of other fields in which quantitative methods had been used almost exclusively, became increasingly interested in exploring the potential of <italic>qualitative</italic> research methods. For some, such as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1077800412455012">Miles and Huberman (1984/1999)</xref>, methods were merely methods; others, however, saw the embrace of qualitative methods as symptomatic of much more significant changes in the research landscape. The indisputable leaders of this second group were Lincoln and Guba; their 1985 book, <italic>Naturalistic Inquiry</italic>, profoundly influenced a whole generation of qualitative researchers in a number of fields.</p>
<p>In <italic>Naturalistic Inquiry</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1077800412455012">Lincoln and Guba (1985)</xref> argued that the embrace of qualitative methods signaled the emergence of a new research paradigm. And taking a cue from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1077800412455012">Kuhn (1962/1996)</xref>, who earlier had argued that new physical science paradigms were incommensurable with the paradigms they eventually supplanted, Lincoln and Guba made the same claim about the paradigm they suggested was emerging in the social sciences. One of the incommensurable differences between the new and the old paradigms involved the notion of causality. Lincoln and Guba, in fact, titled one of the chapters in <italic>Naturalistic Inquiry</italic>, “Is Causality Viable?” After providing an impressive philosophical critique of the concept of causality, they conclude that causality—at least as that idea had been conceptualized by most of the research community in the past—is not a viable concept for qualitative researchers who were embracing the new, emerging paradigm they described.</p>
<p>The historical importance of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1077800412455012">Lincoln and Guba’s (1985)</xref> paradigm talk should not be underestimated. Within the educational research field, at least, paradigm talk helped qualitative methods (and qualitative researchers) gain acceptance in an academic culture that historically equated the notion of <italic>research</italic> with quantification, experimentation, and statistical inference (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1077800412455012">Gage, 1963</xref>). As someone who became a qualitative researcher at about the time that <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1077800412455012">Lincoln and Guba (1985)</xref> published their very influential 1985 book, I can attest to the fact that Lincoln and Guba’s talk of incommensurable paradigms did, indeed, help keep the critics of qualitative methodology at bay. And being part of a fledgling movement that claimed it would radically remake (and, in the process, improve) social science research provided the sort of emotional aid and comfort that is always needed by those who opt to swim against the currents of a dominant culture. Anyone who scoffs at these sorts of contributions should note that philosophers and historians of science (see, for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1077800412455012">Lakatos, 1978/1999</xref>) have suggested that, even in the physical sciences, new ideas and novel ways of approaching research often need something akin to <italic>political</italic> protection before they can be accepted on their intellectual merits alone.</p>

<sec id="section2-1077800412455012">
<title>Reconsidering the Paradigm Talk of the Recent Past</title>
<p>Egon Guba, unfortunately, is no longer with us, but Yvonna Lincoln continues to be a prolific scholar whose later work has extended—but never veered very far from—the general line of argument laid out in <italic>Naturalistic Inquiry</italic> (see, for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1077800412455012">Lincoln, 2010</xref>). Today, however, some segments of what is now, in many fields, a thriving qualitative research community seem to be suggesting that the paradigm talk of the relatively recent past is passé. This view is especially strong among certain (but, certainly, not all) researchers who advocate the use of mixed-methods research designs (see, for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1077800412455012">Creswell, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1077800412455012">Tashakkori &amp; Teddlie, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1077800412455012">Teddlie &amp; Tashakkori, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Whether it was ever appropriate to characterize social scientists’ embrace of qualitative methods as something akin to the sort of paradigm shifts that <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1077800412455012">Kuhn (1962/1996)</xref> described in the physical sciences is a question that can be—and currently is being—debated (see, for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1077800412455012">Donmoyer, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1077800412455012">Nespor, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1077800412455012">Wright &amp; Lather, 2006</xref>). The contributors to this collection of articles, however, believe that <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1077800412455012">Lincoln (2010)</xref> was generally on target when she recently responded to certain mixed-methods critics’ cavalier dismissal of the paradigm talk of the past. Among other things, Lincoln noted that the a priori assumptions that frame any kind of empirical research inevitably influence empirical findings in important ways; consequently, it is important for all researchers—whether they use quantitative, qualitative, or mixed-methods research designs—to be aware of their framing assumptions and to inform the consumers of their research about them.</p>
<p>The contributors to this collection of articles, however, also assume that it is necessary to critically examine the assumptions embedded in the paradigm talk of an earlier era now that qualitative research has established a relatively firm foothold in a number of academic fields. Critical examination is important because the paradigm talk of the past has been quite influential. I, personally, realized the extent of its influence a number of years ago when I was giving a talk on mixed-methods research design at a university in Indonesia. Midway through my talk, I was interrupted by a scholar in the audience who was polite (as Indonesians normally are), but, also, obviously, a bit incensed. “We cannot mix methods,” I was told, “because Lincoln and Guba say this is not possible.”</p>
<p>Now, I am fairly certain the Indonesian scholar—and, for that matter, also many contemporary advocates of mixed-methods research—got Lincoln and Guba more than a little wrong. (Lincoln and Guba argued that paradigms, not methods, per se, were incommensurable.) The Indonesian scholar’s response, however, did dramatize for me the reach of Lincoln and Guba’s thinking at that point in time. And there is no reason to believe that Lincoln and Guba’s influence is merely an historical phenomenon. Indeed, ideas from the past invariably filter into and influence thinking in the present.</p>
<p>Furthermore, earlier ideas are all the more powerful when individuals are unaware of their source and simply assume that they reflect the way things are and have to be. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1077800412455012">Kuhn (1962/1996</xref>, p. 85), for example, has noted that scientists who have been socialized by a physical science discipline to see the world and think of research in particular ways normally are unaware that the ideas they have been socialized to accept represent merely one way of thinking about and viewing the world (p. 85). We suspect that much the same thing can be said about contemporary qualitative researchers socialized to accept many of the ideas articulated by Lincoln and Guba back in 1985. Indeed, contemporary advocates of mixed-methods research would not feel the need to dismiss what, for them, is the inconvenient idea of paradigm incompatibility if such paradigm talk was no longer influential.</p>

<title>An Overview of the Three Articles in This Collection</title>
<p>So, in this issue of <italic>Qualitative Inquiry</italic>, there are three articles that reexamine one aspect of Lincoln and Guba’s paradigm talk. Their specific focus is the claim that qualitative researchers—at least qualitative researchers who wish to adhere to the new research paradigm that Lincoln and Guba described in their 1985 book—should not characterize social phenomena in cause and effect terms. The authors who have contributed articles to the collection have examined the causality issue from somewhat different perspectives.</p>
<sec id="section4-1077800412455012">
<title>Article 1</title>
<p>The first (and, also, the second) article in the collection share a concern with answering questions about what works. Joseph Maxwell, the author of the first article, “The Importance of Qualitative Research for Causal Explanation in Education,” for example, notes that although “there is a great deal of valid, useful qualitative research in education that has nothing directly to do with causation,” the concept must be brought into play by any field “if it wants to make valid and useful claims about what works.”</p>
<p>Maxwell goes on to argue that qualitative researchers’ rejection of the concept of causality is actually a rejection of only one conception of causality, the so-called <italic>regularity</italic> conception of causation that can be traced back to the work of Hume. Maxwell also describes an alternative view—a view that is often referred to as a <italic>process</italic> conception of causality. This alternative view focuses on “the actual processes that resulted in a specific outcome in a particular context.” It assumes that “causation is thus fundamentally local rather than general.” Maxwell argues that this alternative view of causation often is implicit in the actual practice of qualitative research, even though qualitative research rhetoric normally rejects the very idea of talking in any sort of causal terms.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1077800412455012">
<title>Article 2</title>
<p>As has already been noted, the second article, “Can Qualitative Researchers Answer Policymakers’ What-Works Question,” which I authored, also is concerned with answering questions about what works. In this article, however, the focus is on the what-works questions posed by policy makers and on the fact that policy makers expect answers that employ a notion of causality that is more like the regularity view of causality that the author of the first article, for good reason, rejects than the process view he endorses.</p>
<p>Consequently, the second article asks whether qualitative researchers who wish to have their work funded by the policy community and/or who would like to have an impact on policy decision making can overcome, at least <italic>conceptually</italic>, paradigm-based objections to answering policy makers’ version of the what-works question. The second article also considers whether qualitative researchers can actually provide the sorts of answers that policy makers will find useful and uses recent studies to provide an answer to this question.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1077800412455012">
<title>Article 3</title>
<p>The third article, “Toward an Intersectional Understanding of Causality and Social Context,” by Gary Anderson and Janelle Scott, takes yet a different tack. Anderson and Scott are representative of a critical theory inspired tradition of qualitative research that historically has been quite skeptical of claims that the notion of causality has no place in qualitative inquiry. This skepticism is based on the assumption that eliminating causal talk can all too easily lead to underestimating the effects of phenomena such as racism, sexism, and class-based inequality. (See, for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1077800412455012">Sharp &amp; Green, 1975</xref>) and, also, Anderson’s discussion of <italic>critical ethnography</italic> in an article he published in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1077800412455012">1989</xref>.)</p>
<p>So, it is not surprising that, in the article that appears here, Anderson and Scott enthusiastically embrace the process view of causality explicated and endorsed in the first article and also endorsed—albeit with a number of caveats about pragmatic concerns—in the second. Anderson and Scott, however, also express concern that the process accounts that most qualitative researchers are likely to produce will ignore macro-level forces within society. They note that, in the past, even qualitative researchers who have focused on race, class, and/or gender have tended to focus on causes at the cultural level and ignored the impact of larger social forces that transcend particular cultures. In their article, Anderson and Scott use an idea initially developed in the second article in this collection—the idea that researchers can (and, in fact, have to) rely on a preponderance of evidence strategy to answer policy maker’s version of the what-works question—to suggest a possible way to eliminate, or at least minimize, qualitative researchers’ traditional bias against focusing on macro-level forces.</p>

<title>The Collection as a Whole: An Opportunity to Juxtapose Differing Ideas</title>
<p>The three articles being published here were originally written for a symposium at the 2011 Annual Meeting of the American Educational Research meeting. That session included two discussants, Fred Erikson and the previously mentioned Yvonna Lincoln. Both discussants had provocative things to say about each of the articles, but their overall assessment of each of the three articles was exceedingly positive. After the session, Lincoln strongly urged the authors not only to attempt to publish the articles they had presented but also to submit them for publication as a group. She indicated that the journal she coedited would be happy to receive all three articles as a group and send them out for review.</p>
<p>Obviously, given the contents of this issue of <italic>Qualitative Inquiry</italic>, the reviews for all three articles turned out to be positive. Collectively, the three articles that are being published in this issue demonstrate the wisdom of publishing the articles together, for placing the articles side by side in the same location allows readers to juxtapose ideas in one article with ideas in either or both of the other articles.</p>
<p>Let me provide just one example of the usefulness of the juxtaposition process alluded to in the previous paragraph: It seems likely that at least some of the micro-level bias that Anderson and Scott write about in Article 3 is related to the fact that those engaged in the sort of applied research that is the focal point of Article 2 are predisposed to highlight causes of problems and potential solutions that policy makers and practitioners have some control over. If this analysis is correct, the analysis provides support for <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1077800412455012">Lincoln’s (2010)</xref> claim that paradigms still matter.</p>
<p>To be sure, paradigms, today, are more likely to reflect different purposes rather than the fundamentally different world views that Lincoln and Guba wrote about back in 1985 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1077800412455012">Donmoyer, 2006</xref>). (In some respects, at least, we are all constructivists now!) And, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1077800412455012">Kuhn (1962/1996)</xref>, himself, clarified in later editions of <italic>The Structure of Scientific Revolutions, incommensurability</italic> is not a synonym for <italic>logical incompatibility</italic>. For example, I, certainly, understand and even agree with the position articulated by Anderson and Scott in this collection’s third article, even though their analysis is not likely to have much influence on my policy research when the intended audience for that research is, say, state legislators. However, should the Occupy-Wall-Street movement ever become structured enough to sponsor symposia, and should I ever be invited to be part of a symposium panel, you can be pretty sure that I would make the thinking on view in the Anderson and Scott article—and the results of any research studies that were inspired by the macro perspective Anderson and Scott endorse—the main focus of my comments. In short, the meaning of <italic>paradigm</italic> may have changed a bit over the years, but the different perspectives on view in this collection of articles demonstrate that paradigms do still matter.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-1077800412455012">
<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>The other authors and I agreed to submit the articles to <italic>Qualitative Inquiry</italic> with one stipulation: The discussants’ quite thoughtful critiques also be included. Because she was playing the role of editor overseeing the review process, Yvonna opted not to submit her remarks for review. Fortunately, Fred Erickson did not have to confront what could be seen as a conflict of interest; consequently, he readily agreed to share his commentary. So, here, readers will find three very different articles and a critique of the articles. All four contributions focus on the issue of whether or not qualitative researchers can and should characterize social phenomena in cause and effect terms.</p>
