      <abstract>
        <p>Mainstream western feminism is generally known as secular. Women in this movement have
          fought religious dogmas and paternalistic gender patterns in religious texts and
          traditions. However, for many women all over the world religion is also an important part
          of their lives. Some of them try to combine their religious beliefs and feminist ideals.
          For a long time, their discussions remained at the margins, but in the last few years,
          ‘mainstream’ feminists are forced to rethink their standpoint about religion. Many have
          chosen a critical approach towards the relationship between religion and emancipation, but
          others express the need to take into account differences between women in the definition
          of feminism and emancipation. This article analyses a popular Dutch feminist magazine and
          how it defines feminism in relation to religion and culture. The article undertakes an
          in-depth analysis of how the notions of religion, culture and feminism are interpreted and
          discussed in the Dutch feminist magazine <italic>Opzij</italic>. The concepts of
          experience, solidarity, emancipation and difference are central in the investigation.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>It was long assumed that both multiculturalism and feminism are connected to progressive
        movements and hence have comparable and compatible goals. However, both in academia and in
        popular media the critique on multiculturalism has grown and is often accompanied with
        arguments related to gender equality and/or feminism. In the Netherlands, Ayaan Hirsi
            Ali<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1350506811434676">1</xref></sup> has been an
        important actor in the debates about multiculturalism in general, and Islam specifically.
        One of her main arguments is that Islamic sexual morality keeps Muslim men, women and
        children in a ‘virgin cage’, which prevents them from adapting their religion to western
        values such as individualism and freedom (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1350506811434676">Ali, 2004</xref>). But also the Dutch politician Geert Wilders is known for his extremely
        critical views on multiculturalism, integration and Islam and references to gender equality
        in his arguments. In September 2009 for example, he proposed to introduce a ‘headscarf
            tax’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1350506811434676">2</xref></sup> He argued that
        as women who wear a headscarf might be considered to pollute the public sphere in the
        Netherlands, they should pay for a permit to wear the headscarf in the Netherlands. This
        extreme proposal led to a heated debate in the Netherlands, also because the words he used
        to introduce his ideas about the headscarf were considered highly offensive.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-1350506811434676">3</xref></sup></p>
      <p>Besides these politicians, feminists also have been critical about the relationship between
        religious and cultural diversity and feminism. Cisca Dresselhuys, for example, is well known
        for her ideas about the influence of religion on women’s lives and especially for her famous
        remark about the incompatibility of the headscarf and feminism.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-1350506811434676">4</xref></sup> Such arguments raise many questions about
        possible conceptualizations of equality, subjectivity, emancipation and freedom. Feminism
        has a long history of thinking about difference, but the current debates seem to force
        feminists to rethink these with more urgency and adjust them to renewed political contexts.
        In this article I analyse how the feminist popular Dutch magazine <italic>Opzij</italic> has
        defined feminism and feminist struggles in relation to cultural and religious diversity.
          <italic>Opzij</italic> is the most long-standing and influential feminist monthly in the
        Netherlands and it represents the dominant approach to feminism. Furthermore, through its
        many interviews with politicians and opinion leaders, it also forms a bridge between
        feminist views and the broader public debate.</p>
      <p>My own commitment to writing this article originates from a certain void in feminist
        thinking and vocabulary when it comes to the relationship between cultural and religious
        diversity and feminism. I am a white, non-religious feminist, but I do not adhere to the
        politics of secular feminists who simply condemn other women’s faiths and cultures as
        problematic. On the other hand, I find it difficult to understand that some women do not
        fight against patriarchal traditions which are part of their culture or religion. Therefore,
        I want to develop the vocabulary and analytical tools to better understand the complexity of
        the relationship between culture, religion and feminism, and to develop more nuanced
        perspectives towards it.</p>
      <p>The main aims of the article are to enhance our understanding of the arguments and
        disagreements in the feminist discourse of <italic>Opzij</italic> and eventually to
        critically rethink the relationship between feminism and culture and religion as discussed
        in many European countries, of which the Netherlands is just one example. In that sense, the
        instruments that I employ to investigate and rethink the relationship between these concepts
        are very relevant for other countries as well. Moreover, the particular aspects of the Dutch
        discourse make it an excellent learning case. Since the murders of Pim Fortuyn and Theo van
        Gogh, multiculturalism in general, and Islam specifically, has been high on the political
        agenda. A climate arose in which so-called ‘political correctness’ was left behind and it
        was argued that people should be able to say anything they want about other groups in
        society. Due to the abandonment of ‘political correctness’, we are faced with an almost
        unfiltered debate.</p>

      <title><italic>Opzij</italic>: An introduction</title>
      <p><italic>Opzij</italic> is a monthly magazine in the Netherlands in which various issues
        related to women, emancipation and feminism (such as work, family life and politics) are
            discussed.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-1350506811434676">5</xref></sup> It is also
        the most long-standing and influential feminist monthly in the Netherlands. It started as a
        radical and activist magazine, but changed over time into a more mainstream feminist
        magazine. The total circulation of the magazine is 85,000 and the readers are mostly
        well-educated, well-off women, between the ages of 25 and 49. Remarkably, the magazine’s
        website does not say anything about the ethnicity of its readers.</p>
      <p>Since September 2008, Margiet van der Linden has been the editor-in-chief of
          <italic>Opzij</italic>. She is the successor to Cisca Dresselhuys, who held this position
        from 1981 to 2008. Van der Linden has changed <italic>Opzij</italic> considerably. She
        states that the most important transformation is that the magazine has become more open to
        diversity. One such example is the enlisting of Moroccan-Dutch columnist Nora Kasrioui, who
        writes about the emancipation of ‘allochtonous’ girls. These changes to
          <italic>Opzij</italic> are not the subject of this article, however; the sample for the
        analysis herein was deliberately selected from the years 2004–2007 when Cisca Dresselhuys
        was still the editor-in-chief. The reason for this is that I first of all found it important
        to gain more knowledge about the different discourses on cultural and religious diversity
        and feminism in the years that these issues were at the top of the political agenda. Second,
        these ‘earlier years’ cover an important strand in the discussions about this subject that
        needs to be investigated further. Hence, by starting from the critical views of the
          <italic>Opzij</italic> editors in the years 2004–2007, this article aims to develop a
        better understanding of the relationship between religion, culture and feminism. The idea
        behind this is that a close analysis of this specific aspect of the discourse will give us
        more insight into the different interpretations of feminism and could be a starting point
        for a redefinition of the relationship between cultural and religious diversity and feminism
        in a more nuanced, dynamic and positive manner. In that context I would like to emphasize
        that this article does not aim to present an overview of the definitions of multiculturalism
        and feminism in <italic>Opzij</italic>, but rather wants to contribute to current debates
        about feminism and multiculturalism by closely analysing the different arguments about these
        subject in a very specific context. Hence, while it would be possible to find statements in
          <italic>Opzij</italic> (under the current editor-in-chief) with different perspectives on
        feminism and religion, this article focuses purposely on another period of
          <italic>Opzij</italic>, with more sceptical views about these subjects.</p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="section3-1350506811434676">
      <title>Feminism and cultural and religious diversity</title>
      <p>As I mentioned in the introduction, feminism and multiculturalism have for the last two
        decades regularly been described as incompatible. In her famous essay ‘Is multiculturalism
        bad for women’, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1350506811434676">Susan Moller Okin
          (1999)</xref> for instance argues that if we agree that women should not be disadvantaged
        because of their sex, then we should not accept group rights that permit oppressive
        practices. According to Okin, cultures and religions are suffused with practices and
        ideologies concerning gender, and most cultures facilitate control over women in various
        ways. Okin published her essay together with about a dozen responding papers and was both
        criticized and applauded by other scholars. Her claims led to a complex and important
        debate.</p>
      <p>In the Netherlands, sociologist Sawitri Saharso responded with a counter essay, called
        ‘Multiculturalism and feminism’. Saharso claims that multiculturalism and feminism might not
        always be easily compatible, but that they are certainly not incompatible either (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1350506811434676">Saharso, 2000</xref>). They can be friends,
        she says, even though it is a friendship that needs to be worked on. According to Saharso
        there are two rather remarkable things about the (Dutch) debates on multiculturalism. First
        of all, very often, Dutch culture is set against ‘the’ cultures of foreigners. Second, most
        of the discussions on tolerance refer to gender relations. Saharso argues that in order to
        draw a line regarding tolerance towards others cultures, the defenders of Dutch culture
        often use ‘women’s issues’.</p>
      <p>This connects to the work of Baukje Prins, who states that the harsh discussions about
        multiculturalism and Islam in the Netherlands show that since the 1990s a new public
        discourse has arisen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1350506811434676">Prins,
        2002</xref>). According to Prins, this ‘neo-realist’ genre can be recognized by four main
        characteristics: authors or speakers in this discourse present themselves as persons ‘who
        dare to face the facts’ and openly discuss what is <italic>really</italic> happening; they
        believe themselves to be representing ‘normal people’; they argue that having ‘a sense of
        reality’ is an important part of the Dutch national identity; and finally, neo-realists can
        be recognized by their aversion to the political left. Moreover, an essential element of the
        neo-realist discourse is the importance of emancipation in these debates. Even though none
        of the neo-realists seem to have shown any interest in feminism or women’s rights before,
        they now use gender relations to define their own identity as opposite to the ‘Other’. An
        example of this would be how they often claim to rescue or save migrant women from their
        traditional lives and conservative men (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1350506811434676">Prins, 2002</xref>).</p>
      <p>Also Duits and Van Zoonen emphasize that ‘girls’ bodies have become the metonymic location
        for many of the social and cultural struggles in Western European immigration societies’
          (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1350506811434676">Duits and Van Zoonen, 2006</xref>);
        even though the voices of the girls involved are hardly ever heard in this context, as their
        choices are mainly articulated in terms of their sexuality and lack of agency. By showing
        the compatibilities between the Dutch discourses on porno-chic and Muslims women’s
        headscarves, Duits and Van Zoonen also make it very clear how these issues have connected
        ‘western conservatism with radical feminism, fundamentalist Islam, traditional Christianity,
        liberal feminism and all other ideologies and actors that would support bans on women’s
        garments’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1350506811434676">Duits and Van Zoonen,
          2006</xref>: 114). In this article, the main concepts in these debates are rethought in
        order to produce an alternative perspective.</p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="section4-1350506811434676" sec-type="methods">
      <title>Sample and method of analysis</title>
      <p>The material I used to analyse <italic>Opzij</italic> covers a period of time in which the
        relationship between cultural and religious diversity and feminism was a much-discussed
        subject: July 2004–July 2007. It includes very important moments related to the topic, such
        as the first broadcast (on Dutch national television) of Ayaan Hirsi Ali’s film
          <italic>Submission</italic> (August 2004), the murder of the director of this film, Theo
        van Gogh (November 2004), and the case around the passport of Ali and her departure to the
        USA (May 2006). Ayaan Hirsi Ali is generally seen as the dominant factor in the Dutch
        debates about culture, religion and feminism (or gender equality), so her input and these
        events are also of great importance for this article.</p>
      <p>In order to find all the articles in <italic>Opzij</italic> (from July 2004 to July
            2007)<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-1350506811434676">6</xref></sup> that deal with
        culture and religion, I chose a combination of search terms that refer both to the issue in
        general (multiculturalism, religion, integration, ‘allochtonous’ and traditions) and to
        specific events or themes that have been important in the Dutch debates about culture and
        diversity (Islam, burqa, Muslim women and Ayaan Hirsi Ali).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-1350506811434676">7</xref></sup> This resulted in a total of 164 articles, of
        which 56 were actually relevant to this research project. Articles were regarded as
        irrelevant if they only mentioned one of the search terms in passing, and did not actually
        discuss the subject. Finally, there were a number (20) of short articles and news items
        which were relevant but were excluded from the analysis because of their short length and
        lack of argumentation. This brings the total number of articles for the analysis to 36. I
        acknowledge that this is a rather small sample, which does not lend itself for any
        generalizations. It is however very appropriate for the in-depth analysis in this article,
        which aims to explore and rethink the relationship between religious and cultural diversity
        and feminism.</p>
      <p>For this article the main approach is critical discourse analysis (CDA), following
        especially the work of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1350506811434676">Norman Fairclough
          (2001)</xref>. I have chosen to focus on the work of Norman Fairclough regarding CDA
        because power and power relations are central in his work. After a preliminary analysis of
        the sample, it turned out that the articles in <italic>Opzij</italic> could not simply be
        divided on the basis of their arguments (positive or negative) regarding the relationship
        between cultural and religious diversity and feminism. In fact, only a small part of the
        sample explicitly discussed this relationship and presented either a pessimistic or
        optimistic argument about it. In the other articles, only a specific facet of this
        relationship was focused upon. This focus was often a dilemma, a problem to be resolved or
        something that needed to be changed, according to the author or interviewee. Definitions of
        culture, religion, multiculturalism, feminism and their relationship were taken for granted
        and hence not further investigated.</p>
      <p>The fact that most articles did not have an explicit argument on the relationship between
        cultural and religious diversity and feminism (but rather make a statement about a related
        topic, based on a certain, often not explained, interpretation of this relationship) was not
        only an important first conclusion of the preliminary investigation of
          <italic>Opzij</italic>, but also a complicating factor for further analysis of the sample.
        Hence, not only explicit arguments about culture, religion and feminism turned out to be
        relevant for the research, but also much more implicit ones. In order to get a better
        understanding of the <italic>Opzij</italic> discourse, I focused on two basic questions from
        discourse analysis. First of all, who or what is the object of the article/statement? Or,
        more concretely, who or what needs to change according to the author or interviewee? The
        second question was: who or what is considered as the problem and who or what as the
        solution? The answers to these questions resulted in a rich overview of the arguments in the
          <italic>Opzij</italic> articles.</p>
      <p>After analysing the sample with the first question, six categories or answers could be
        distinguished: feminism (or feminists), Muslim women, Islam (or Muslim traditions), Dutch
        society (or government), the style of debating and finally the relationship between
        multiculturalism and feminism. Of course one could think of possible other facets of this
        relationship but they could not be found as such in <italic>Opzij</italic>. This article
        focuses on the first two categories of the sample: feminism (feminist standpoints and
        feminist solidarity) and Muslim women (who counts as feminist? mechanisms of in/exclusion),
        concluding with a critical investigation of the dynamics among these categories in different
          <italic>Opzij</italic> articles.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-1350506811434676">8</xref></sup> One consequence of this is that this article pays disproportional
        attention to Islam, not because I confuse cultural and religious diversity with Islam, but
        because the sample mainly concentrates on this specific group.</p>

        <p>In her two columns around the issue of how feminism should deal with multiculturalism,
          Jolande Withuis puts forward two main problems; the first is ‘historical’ and the second
          is about contemporary feminists in the field of gender studies.</p>
        <p>In ‘Strijdbaar en superieur’ (‘Warrior like and superior’) Withuis writes about the
          struggle of a ‘first wave’ feminist and shows why feminists should defend their own
          struggles, instead of asking ‘average women’ what they want. In 1917, 43,000 Christian
          women signed the petition ‘do not give us the right to vote’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1350506811434676">Withuis, 2006</xref>), nevertheless, Withuis argues,
          nobody would now dare to say that feminists at that time should have changed their views
          on voting. According to Withuis:</p>
        <p><disp-quote>
            <p>This historical fact teaches us . . . that religions can change . . . ; it teaches us
              that Christianity is not less hostile to women than Islam is. Furthermore, it reminds
              us that also the pioneers of the first wave sometimes did not get support from the
              women whose interests they defended. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1350506811434676">Withuis, 2006</xref>,; my translation)</p>

        <p>Hence, according to Withuis, feminists do not need the approval of all women in their
          struggles. In some cases they should just fight for what they think is right. The question
          that comes to mind here is: when is a female argument a feminist one? Or, which
          standpoints count as feminist? Withuis argues that feminists do not need the approval of
          all women, but who says that feminists should? It seems that this author tries to exclude
          her opponents from the discussions by referring to extreme arguments. Unfortunately this
          rules out the option of a possible fruitful debate about standpoint theory.</p>
        <p>In ‘Meninkjes’ (‘Little opinions’) Withuis expands on the issue of ‘approval’. The
          problem, in her view, is that researchers constantly refer to the fact that we should
          listen to the opinions of Muslim women, instead of criticizing certain categories, such as
          Muslims and non-Muslims. The argument she gives for this statement is that oppressed
          people are not always open to liberation:</p>
        <p><disp-quote>
            <p>If someone argues that ‘Muslim women want to wear a headscarf’, I not only see the
              veiled 10 year olds, but also Aafke Komter’s <italic>De macht van de
                vanzelfsprekendheid (The Power of the Self Evident)</italic>. After this analysis of
              invisible power differences in marriages, the phrase ‘what they want themselves’ is an
              empty slogan. Komter shows that something as simple as ‘to want something yourself’
              does not exist: the least powerful people give shape to their desires through those of
              the powerful and experience those as their own. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1350506811434676">Withuis, 2005</xref>; my translation)</p>
          </disp-quote></p>
        <p>According to Withuis, it is meaningless to think about ‘what women themselves’ want,
          because there is no such thing as ‘wanting yourself’. I must agree with her that people
          are shaped by the society they live in. The question is, however, whether Withuis is
          indeed criticizing the concept of autonomy and starting a (legitimate) discussion or
          whether she is using the argument to claim that <italic>certain</italic> people cannot
          judge their own decisions. It is difficult to answer this question based on these two
          quotes only, but it does appear that she is not referring to her own ability to make
          decisions in these quotes. I elaborate on this in the next sections, in which the
          discrepancy between ‘feminists’ and ‘Muslim women’ comes even more to the surface. The
          implicit reference in this quote is to false consciousness, or the idea that people (in
          this case Muslim women) might believe that they want something, but in practice do not
          realize that they have come to believe this, through the influence of an oppressive power.
          Many feminists have criticized this concept,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-1350506811434676">9</xref></sup> my arguments against it in the context of
          this particular quote are the following. First of all, it is often used to depict a
          particular group (namely Muslim women). Hence, there are already unequal power relations
          at play when the concept of false consciousness is utilized. Second, the concept of false
          consciousness does not help us to better understand the issues at stake here. Instead of
          investigating the arguments, experiences and strategies of different women and evaluating
          what makes a feminist standpoint, denouncing other opinions as false puts the issues at
          stake aside.</p>
        <p>To summarize, Withuis argues that discussions about religion and culture too often end up
          in statements from certain feminists about the experiences and opinions of the women who
          live in these communities. She believes that this is not the right approach for feminists.
          First of all, she says, we have historical examples that show that sometimes some women
          just do not know what is best for them, and second, gender theorists have shown that women
          can think they want something, without realizing they might have been influenced by more
          powerful others.</p>
        <p>The issues of experience and feminist standpoints are also discussed in a group interview
          article with 14 experts. In this article, a group of gender and diversity experts
          (researchers, politicians and women who work for relevant NGOs) talk about how feminism
          should deal with cultural and religious differences. The most important aspect of the
          discussion is the question: should (Dutch, secular) feminists hold on to their ideas about
          equality and justice or should they be more open to different interpretations and ask
          Muslim women what they want? Contrary to Withuis, many of these experts say that we should
            <italic>talk to Muslim women, instead of about them</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-1350506811434676">10</xref></sup> The various answers in the interviews,
          however, show that the question of feminist standpoints is not just about listening or not
          listening to Muslim women (as Withuis seems to argue), but rather about
            <italic>whose</italic> experiences should count as feminist. The division between
          ‘feminists’ and ‘Muslim women’ continues to play an important role in most
            <italic>Opzij</italic> articles/statements.</p>
        <p>Local politician Fatima Elatik believes that feminists should respect the fact that there
          are different ways to achieve emancipation. She further argues that the strength of Muslim
          women is not sufficiently acknowledged:</p>
        <p><disp-quote>
            <p>Muslim women want to become emancipated in their own way, with respect for their
              background and religious traditions and by keeping the dialogue with their family. We
              have to facilitate that. (Elatik, 2005, cited in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1350506811434676">Dresselhuys, 2005</xref>; my translation)</p>
          </disp-quote></p>
        <p>Elatik explicitly argues that there are different ways of achieving emancipation,
          implicitly however, she also points out that Muslim women’s experiences and standpoints
          should be taken into account in feminist analyses or struggles. Through these words,
          Elatik goes beyond the framework of feminists that either need or do not need approval, as
          presented by Jolande Withuis. The issue, according to Elatik, is not about approval, but
          about defining emancipation. However, judging from the quote above, the question related
          to the division between ‘Muslim women’ and ‘feminists’ remains. Who is the ‘we’ she is
          referring to in the last sentence of the quote? It seems that Elatik criticizes feminists
          who judge Muslim women for having a different perspective on emancipation, but she does
          not deconstruct the framework and power relations behind this.</p>
        <p>Marli Huijer argues that Dutch feminists ‘should not act like big sisters’. She does not
          make a division between Muslim women and feminists, but explicitly talks about different
          forms of feminism. Dutch feminists, she argues:</p>
        <p><disp-quote>
            <p>. . . can contribute by not regarding these women as more oppressed, but as women
              whose own feminism needs support. (Huijer, 2005, cited in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1350506811434676">Dresselhuys, 2005</xref>; my translation)</p>
          </disp-quote></p>
        <p>Van Zoonen also emphasizes the importance of supporting the struggles of these women:</p>
        <p><disp-quote>
            <p>I get so sick of all these little opinions and do not understand where Dutch people
              get their so called expertise about Islam and Muslim women from. I do not have this
              expertise and would rather have the women who are trying to combine emancipation and
              Islam to speak for themselves. (Van Zoonen, 2005, cited in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1350506811434676">Dresselhuys, 2005</xref>; my translation)</p>
          </disp-quote></p>
        <p>In the above quotes, the interviewees argue for a different approach towards feminism.
          They plead for cooperation between different women, but frame the issue rather differently
          to Withuis. They propose that Dutch or secular <italic>feminists</italic> support Muslim
            <italic>feminists</italic> and recognize their struggles and choices. Hence, they aim to
          acknowledge different interpretations of emancipation and feminism. In other words, they
          want to work together with women who share similar goals, even though they might have
          different approaches to achieve these goals. Withuis, on the other hand, does not want
          feminists to debate their ideals with women who are not interested in emancipation. While
          Withuis talks about whom we <italic>should not</italic> listen to, Huijer and Van Zoonen
          talk about who we <italic>should</italic> listen to.</p>
        <p>Van Zoonen and Huijer start from multiple interpretations of feminism and aim to achieve
          cooperation between women, while acknowledging differences. Withuis, on the other hand,
          frames the discussion rather differently; she starts from the problem: how should
          feminists respond to women who do not want to be emancipated? Feminists, according to
          Withuis, should not ask these women what they want, but fight the oppression and
          deconstruct certain categories. In my view, Huijer and Van Zoonen do not necessarily
          dispute this when they say that feminists should support the <italic>struggles</italic> of
          Muslim women.</p>
        <p>Here lies the connection to the many discussions among feminists about standpoint theory.
          Withuis seems to fight against a rather essentialist and fixed interpretation of
          standpoint theory. According to her, not all women can produce better knowledge because
          they are in a marginalized position. On the contrary, she believes that oppression can
          blind people from a critical view. Huijer and Van Zoonen, however, defend a rather
          different, much more dynamic and collective perspective on standpoint theory. They not
          only take into account the power differences (and oppression) between men and women, but
          also between women. Furthermore, they do not start from any marginalized woman’s position,
          but from those who have developed oppositional consciousness. This suggests that if we
          want to theorize this issue further in a productive way, we should not allow ourselves to
          get stuck in sentences like ‘should we or should we not listen to Muslim women’, but
          instead think about how we can use experience as a basis for feminist standpoints.</p>

        <title>Feminist solidarity</title>
        <p>In the previous section, the problems related to feminists’ responses to multiculturalism
          (or actually Islam) were discussed. I pointed out that many of the statements deal with
          different aspects of this issue, without really engaging in a single and well-defined
          debate. In the following, I move the focus of attention from feminist standpoints to
          feminist solidarity. Many of the articles in <italic>Opzij</italic> focused on the issue
          of solidarity. It seems again, though, that there is no clear definition of the
          disagreement. The discussion is framed as if there is a difference of opinion between
          those who aim for solidarity between women and those who do not. Yet, when we take a
          closer look at the statements it appears that most (if not all) authors aim for more
          solidarity. Hence, the actual debate is about the right interpretations of solidarity.</p>
        <p>Jolande Withuis talks about solidarity using the case of Ayaan Hirsi Ali. In her view,
          feminists need to show their solidarity with this politician:</p>
        <p><disp-quote>
            <p>Where are the educated feminists who support (or if necessary refute) Ayaan with
              fundamental analyses and usable research results? When do ‘the girlfriends’ of Ayaan
              Hirsi Ali turn up alongside ‘the friends’? . . . Why are professors and students from
              women’s studies not protesting at the parliament buildings since 2 November: we are
              not leaving until she returns? . . . A black refugee is threatened with death because
              of her feminist political opinion. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1350506811434676">Withuis, 2005</xref>; my translation)</p>
          </disp-quote></p>
        <p>Judging from this quote, Withuis believes there is a lack of solidarity among feminists
          for Hirsi Ali. Because Hirsi Ali is threatened as a black feminist, feminists should
          support her. This view clearly differs from most remarks that were made in the group
          interview article. Marli Huijer for instance, argues that:</p>
        <p><disp-quote>
            <p>Solidarity with Muslim women starts with informing ourselves of the long tradition of
              (pan-) Arabic feminism, with interest in the lives and stories of Muslim women and
              with allowing and facilitating these women’s own ideas in public space. . . . Dutch
              feminists can contribute to that by not seeing Muslim women beforehand as more
              oppressed, but as women whose feminism deserves support. (Huijer, 2005, cited in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1350506811434676">Dresselhuys, 2005</xref>; my
              translation)</p>
          </disp-quote></p>
        <p>Especially this last quote shows how close the connection is between the discussions on
          feminist standpoints and on feminist solidarity. Those who are considered to have proper
          feminist standpoints are also regarded as deserving of feminist solidarity. The different
          views on equality and difference are related to this. The writers in
            <italic>Opzij</italic> largely base their judgement regarding feminist standpoints on
          definitions of equality. Those who struggle for equality through sameness aim for feminist
          standpoints that do this, too, and vice versa. Hence, Withuis supports Ayaan Hirsi Ali and
          her struggle for equality through sameness; Huijer connects to Muslim feminists, who fight
          for equality through difference. Both authors detect a lack of solidarity among feminists,
          but do not recognize the different starting points of their struggles. As becomes clear
          from this analysis, there is solidarity among feminists, but only between those feminists
          who share the same vision on equality.</p>

        <title>Who counts as feminist? Mechanism of in/exclusion</title>
        <p>In the previous paragraphs I discussed the discourse in <italic>Opzij</italic> on
          feminism, more specifically on feminist standpoints and solidarity. When does a female
          standpoint count as a feminist one and when should feminists show their solidarity with
          other women? This section focuses on the articles about Muslim women. By scrutinizing the
          discourse about Muslim women in <italic>Opzij</italic>, it becomes clear how they are
          separated from ‘feminists’ and ‘feminism’.</p>
        <p>The first thing to be noted about the articles on Muslim women is that they are written
          from a rather different perspective than those on feminism and feminists. In most of the
          articles of the latter category there was often an explicit statement to be found on the
          problems and solutions related to the connection between multiculturalism and feminism. In
          the articles on Muslim women, on the other hand, these statements are much more implicit.
          I believe that this is connected to the different aims of these pieces. The articles on
          ‘feminism’ share a commitment to <italic>theorize</italic> feminism, and as mentioned
          above, the discussions were mostly about feminist standpoints. The articles that focus on
          Muslim women do not correspond to that goal; they do not theorize how Muslim women see
          feminism or how to be a Muslim feminist in a western country. Instead, they are centred on
          one particular question: why do women choose to live according to (strict) Islamic
          customs? The number of articles on feminism and Muslim women is too small to allow us to
          draw strong conclusions, but it is worth noting that <italic>Opzij</italic> has no
          articles that theorize how, for instance, feminism and Islam can/cannot be combined. I
          would like to argue that this is connected to the conceptualization of feminism in
            <italic>Opzij</italic>. Instead of discussing different interpretations of feminism,
          such as Muslim feminism and secular feminism, <italic>Opzij’</italic>s articles either
          talk about how <italic>feminists</italic> should deal with difference or about the
          decisions of <italic>Muslim women</italic>. In this way, it seems they position
          (secular/white) feminists on one side and Muslim women on the other. In other words: there
          are feminists and there are Muslim women.</p>
        <p>The headscarf is an important theme in <italic>Opzij</italic> and in many articles and
          interviews there is some sort of reference to it.</p>
        <p>In <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1350506811434676">2006</xref>, Bochhah interviewed
          six women on the issue of the headscarf. Her article discusses why Muslim women decide to
          wear a headscarf. The women interviewed mention a broad range of reasons: (1)
          rebellion/resistance, (2) religion, (3) identity/definition of the self and (4)
          family/community. Most of their reasons are related to their self-image or identity: I
          feel prettier when I wear one, I feel more secure, it reminds me of my Muslim identity, or
          it makes me feel more conscious of my behaviour. Then there are the religious reasons for
          wearing a headscarf: I do it out of love for the Prophet, it makes my faith complete, or
          it is a command and I like living according to the rules of the Qu’ran. Finally, there are
          the arguments related to the (expectations of) family or community: I get more respect
          from Moroccan boys, my family appreciates it that I wear a headscarf, or I want to show
          people that I am a good Muslim.</p>
        <p>The statements about the headscarf are very descriptive: <italic>Opzij</italic> does not
          explicitly write about what Muslim women should or should not do, as it does for
          feminists. Instead the magazine is exploring <italic>why</italic> Muslim women do certain
          things. This could mean that the editors find these women’s choices problematic, but they
          could also be trying to make these women’s choices seen more acceptable for feminists. In
          any case, <italic>Opzij</italic> is trying to understand these women and their choices,
          which suggests a distance between the <italic>Opzij</italic> editors (or their audience)
          and Muslim women. I believe that this shows that the editors of <italic>Opzij</italic>
          focus on a white or non-Muslim audience. Hence, they are not trying to raise understanding
          for Muslim women among Muslim women.</p>
        <p>In the article ‘De lokroep van de Islam’ (‘The call of Islam’), psychiatrist Carla Rus
          investigates why young women (especially ‘autochtonous’ Dutch women who decide to convert)
          are attracted to Islam. The question she wants to answer is:</p>
        <p><disp-quote>
            <p>Which young women voluntarily give up the rights and freedoms that my generation of
              women have obtained during the second wave with so much pain? (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1350506811434676">Rus, 2006</xref>; my translation)</p>
          </disp-quote></p>
        <p>Two aspects of this question stand out. First of all, the author assumes that these women
          are giving up rights when they are converting to Islam. One might wonder whether this is
          necessarily the case or, in fact, whether these women might not mind giving up certain
          liberal rights. Authors such as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1350506811434676">Saba
            Mahmood (2005)</xref> have shown that not all women want liberal freedom; some women
          actually choose to submit to God and/or possible patriarchal religious traditions. Rus
          approaches this issue as a matter of false consciousness: why do people do things that are
          not in their best interest? This means that she is not really asking an open ‘why’
          question. Or to put it more bluntly, she seems to judge these women’s choices already in
          her question, instead of being open to understand them better.</p>
        <p>Second, there is a generational aspect in the question. The women who become Muslim are
          not just giving up any rights, but the rights that women from Rus’s generation have fought
          for. This is where the pain seems to lie. I believe that this could be an important aspect
          of the discussions about multiculturalism and feminism that needs further investigation.
          At first sight, the differences between feminist generations might not be connected to
          multiculturalism, but we need to ask why many of the feminists from the second wave
          generation are now so fiercely criticizing Islam. The answer could be found in the
          following quote:</p>
        <p><disp-quote>
            <p>For me as an ex-Reformed person, who has wrested from an external authority and had
              learned to trust her own authority, this is shocking to read. These women are actually
              saying that they do not know what to do in life without a religious leader and that
              they do not trust themselves enough when it comes to morals. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1350506811434676">Rus, 2006</xref>; my translation)</p>
          </disp-quote></p>
        <p>Hence, Rus herself has struggled against external authorities and cannot imagine why
          other women would actually desire this. From her perspective every woman would choose to
          be free (from authorities) if she could.</p>
        <p>In the first instance, this article on conversion seems comparable to those on the
          headscarf, but the final argument of this piece is considerably different. The authors
          cited earlier only tried to understand Muslim women who decide to wear the headscarf. In
          other words, there was no clear normative statement to be found. Rus, on the other hand,
          is providing the reader explicitly with her opinion on this issue. Most arguments for
          conversion are followed by a statement of the author in which she explains why such
          arguments are problematic in her view. Hence, in this case, the author is trying to
          understand these women’s choices and at the same time thinks about how to change them.
          This is confirmed by her conclusion, in which she says:</p>
        <p><disp-quote>
            <p>There is no use in fighting these new Islamic Dutch girls; the history of
              Christianity teaches us that faith grows when it is oppressed. They should be tempted
              back via good examples: women with self-esteem who help others out of an inner
              civilisation, without wanting anything back for it – not even afterwards in paradise.
                (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1350506811434676">Rus, 2006</xref>; my
              translation)</p>
          </disp-quote></p>
        <p>Note that there lies a long history behind the words Rus is using. For example during the
          first wave of feminism, white, bourgeois feminists tried to emphasize their importance for
          the nation (and hence the need for civil rights) by arguing that they needed to help
          Others. They created a task for themselves by defining social issues as other people’s
          problems. This way they managed to transfer the boundaries of the nation; they included
          themselves, by creating new second range citizens, such as women from the colonies (see,
          for instance, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1350506811434676">Waaldijk, 1999</xref>).
          Of course we cannot easily apply the strategies of certain first wave feminists to the
          remarks of Carla Rus, but it is remarkable that the concept of ‘helping others’ remains
          recurrent in feminism. The similarities (and differences) between these approaches to
          feminism need further investigation.</p>

      <title>Rethinking feminist standpoints and experience</title>
      <p>The discussions in <italic>Opzij</italic> as discussed in the previous sections connect to
        a long history of feminist thinking on standpoint theory and situated knowledges. Both
        theories have taught us that location can influence our views on certain issues. The main
        difference is that standpoint theory starts from the normative notion that certain positions
        provide better grounds for knowledge production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1350506811434676">Harding, 1991</xref>), while the theory of ‘situated
        knowledges’ demonstrates that all standpoints provide partial views, for which we have to be
        accountable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1350506811434676">Haraway, 1991</xref>).</p>
      <p>If we apply standpoint theory and situated knowledges to this discussion, we see that both
        will help us in rethinking the relationship between culture, religion and feminism from a
        more critical perspective than <italic>Opzij</italic> does. Standpoint theory tells us why
        we need a view from below, and should take the experiences of women from minority cultures
        into account. But standpoint theory is not merely about women’s experiences; these are just
        a point of departure, a ground for ‘knowledge-claims’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1350506811434676">Bracke, 2004</xref>). In order to develop a standpoint, one
        needs to combine social location with political analysis. When we approach standpoint theory
        in such a manner, it becomes obvious why it is important that the voices from Islamic
        feminists should be taken into account in feminist research and theory. These women have
        transformed their experiences (from below) into standpoints, through their political
        projects. Of course, the question of which standpoints are ‘proper’ standpoints is not
        always easy to answer and obviously still leads to much discussion between feminists.</p>
      <p>Where Bracke starts from a political interpretation of standpoint theory to make feminist
        thinking more complex, one could also turn to the concept of situated knowledges. Haraway
        emphasizes the construction of identities much more explicitly than Harding does and plays
        with identities and boundaries (where for Harding these are much more static). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1350506811434676">Prins (1997)</xref> argues that the Dutch
        discourse on ethnic minorities and multiculturalism is a good case for exploring the concept
        of situated knowledges, because it is a discourse in which many ‘non-innocent’ positions are
        put forward, and because the relations between marginal and dominant groups in society are
        at stake. This is also reflected in the discourse of <italic>Opzij</italic> where white,
        secular women seem to judge the positions of religious women, without critically
        investigating their own.</p>
      <p>I would like to argue that both concepts are important in feminist research, but they
        relate to different angles of the debate about culture, religion and feminism. Hence, if we
        want to rethink statements about the so-called tensions between these concepts, one could
        argue that minority women also fight for equality, albeit it in another way and, for
        example, from within their community. Another argument, however, would be that some women
        might not want the equality or freedom that, for example, Ayaan Hirsi Ali stands for. These
        different lines of reasoning are connected to different theoretical frameworks. I would like
        to argue that standpoint theory would be an important instrument in the first and that
        situated knowledges provides us with an entry to the latter. In my view, a redefinition of
        the relationship between culture, religion and feminism needs to take into account both of
        these classical feminist concepts and apply them to current debates (e.g. about religion and
        feminism) to develop more inclusive interpretations of feminism.</p>
      <p>Moreover, the current debates about agency and subjectivity teach us much about how to
        think differently about feminism and religion. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1350506811434676">Saba Mahmood (2005)</xref>, for example, states that if
        feminists really want to understand the lives, experiences and strategies of all women, we
        have to be open to the possibility that we can learn from other women and maybe even change
        our political views accordingly. Therefore, according to Mahmood, feminists have to separate
        their analytical and prescriptive work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1350506811434676">Mahmood, 2005</xref>). Hence, we should not try to define beforehand whether a certain
        experience is a good standpoint or not, but first try to understand it and discuss the
        political consequences afterwards. In order to be able to do this, Mahmood argues, feminists
        have to rethink their conceptualization of agency. Most feminist thinking is primarily
        liberatory and agency in this context is described as a model of subordination and
        subversion. Mahmood argues that this attachment of agency to progressive politics is
        problematic. If, she says, there are different ways to change the world depending on social,
        political and historical contexts, then the meaning of agency should not be fixed in
        advance.</p>
      <p>I agree with Mahmood that feminists need more open analytical tools in order to research
        these topics. However, I also think that, besides opening up the concept, the discussions
        about cultural and religious diversity and feminism would benefit from a conception of
        subjectivity that combines a certain form of openness with a road to change. I believe that
        the work of Rosi Braidotti provides us with such a combination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1350506811434676">Braidotti, 2008</xref>). While arguing that normative
        secularism is too closely connected to Islamophobia, she calls for a more nuanced analysis
        of the relations between feminism and religion/spirituality. She emphasizes the long history
        of feminism and spirituality (think of the work of Audre Lorde or Luce Irigaray) and the
        importance of recognizing this. The interesting aspect of Braidotti’s definition of
        subjectivity is that she aims to keep subjectivity ‘political’ without letting it become
        negative or fixed. This means that her interpretation of subjectivity is not about producing
        radical counter-subjectivities, but rather about daily practices and negotiations within
        dominant norms:</p>
      <p><disp-quote>
          <p>Political subjectivity or agency therefore consists of multiple micro-political
            practices of daily activism or interventions in and on the world we inhabit for
            ourselves and our future generations. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1350506811434676">Braidotti, 2008</xref>: 16)</p>
        </disp-quote></p>
      <p>Hence, by applying these refreshing interpretations of agency and subjectivity and applying
        more classical feminist conceptions of standpoint theory and situated knowledges, it becomes
        possible to analyse the lives and experiences of religious women or women from minority
        cultures differently. Rather than evaluating their activities and choices within the limited
        framework of subordination versus liberation or ‘should we listen to them or not’, more
        nuanced perspectives can be developed, with attention to daily negotiations or alternative
        perspectives on equality and liberty.</p>

      <title>Conclusions</title>
      <p>In this article I have analysed three years of <italic>Opzij</italic> articles on the
        relationship between feminism and multiculturalism. Comparing the articles in the preceding
        sections on ‘Muslim women’ and those on ‘feminists’, I would like to argue that even though
        Muslim women’s <italic>issues</italic> are discussed in <italic>Opzij</italic>, these women
        are not really involved in the discussions about feminism. In the articles about Muslim
        women, choices are evaluated from a universal view on feminism. Feminism, in these cases, is
        approached as something quite fixed. For instance, there were no articles in which authors
        discussed whether and how feminism and Islam could be combined. Also in the section on
        feminists, I could not find such debates. Furthermore, in the pieces on feminism there was
        no discussion about <italic>why</italic> (white) feminists do certain things. Thus, Muslim
        women’s choices are investigated, while those of (white) feminists are not. Note though that
        white (allochtonous) women who decide to convert to Islam are investigated. They seem to
        fall in-between the applied categories. Second, feminists discuss what feminism is or should
        be, but not how it could be combined with religion. In other words, only the boundaries of
        feminism are debated, not the basics.</p>
      <p>Another point that is of importance is the use and abuse of standpoint theories. In my
        view, one of the main disagreements revolves around the question: who can decide what a
        feminist standpoint is, or is not? On many occasions, remarks are found that refer either to
        a lack or to a surplus of contact with certain groups of women. Can feminists develop
        general ideas about what feminism is, or should they be more open to the experiences and
        opinions of women? The essential question here is, when we talk about experience, whose
        experience do we mean? Those who want to take experiences into account seem to refer to a
        specific, political, interpretation of standpoint theory. They do not propose to ask
        ‘average’ women what they think of certain issues. Instead, they propose working more
        closely with Muslim feminists. The opponents of this approach on the other hand, often
        mention a much more individual interpretation of ‘taking women’s experiences into
        account’.</p>
      <p>This media analysis showed that one of the main points of discussion in
          <italic>Opzij</italic> was who is included in the feminist ‘us’ and who is not. The key
        concepts in these discussions were experience and solidarity. I would like to argue that
        feminism can be defined in a more inclusive way, but then it needs to take into account the
        critical standpoints that Muslim women have developed, as well as the critical perspectives
        on agency and subjectivity, such as proposed by authors like Rosi Braidotti and Saba
        Mahmood. Finally, they need to acknowledge differences between women, as well as the
        possibilities of different ideas about what emancipation means.</p>

          <p>Ayaan Hirsi Ali is a politician, opinion maker and writer, who came to the Netherlands
            as a refugee from Somalia in 1992. In 2002, she became a member of the (conservative)
            liberal party VVD, in this period she also started to publish her ideas on Islam and
            women. In the summer of 2004, Ali’s film <italic>Submission</italic> was first shown.
            Only months later, the director of the film, Theo van Gogh, was killed in the centre of
            Amsterdam. The film is generally seen as the direct reason for this political murder. In
            May 2006, Ali reached world headlines again because of a discussion about her asylum. A
            Dutch television documentary showed that she had lied about her name, age and her escape
            to the Netherlands. The Minister of Integration and Immigration soon announced that
            these lies made Ali’s passport invalid. A month later, the minister changed her decision
            and said that Ali could keep her passport, because apparently she was allowed to use the
            name Ali according to Somalian law. A few days later the government collapsed because
            one of the coalition’s parties withdrew its support following these events. Ayaan Hirsi
            Ali left the country anyhow, to start a new career in Washington.</p>
