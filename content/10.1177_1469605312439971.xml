<abstract>
<p>My aim in this article is to investigate the relationships between time-experience and imperialism in the Roman world. The archaeological exploration of past time-concepts has developed significantly over the last two or three decades, moving us beyond the old dichotomy of linear/abstract and cyclical/substantial times. However, there is much still to do, especially to link ideas about temporality with issues of agency and power. The Roman empire is a fruitful context in which to explore this connection, as there is sufficient evidence from a range of sources to illuminate the ways in which some time-experiences changed with Roman conquest of a region, while others persisted. Using insights derived from the work of pragmatist philosopher G.H. Mead, I argue that there is a fundamental linkage between temporality and agency, which takes on a particular significance in culture-contact situations, and I illustrate this with a detailed case study of the changing rhythms of rural life in Roman Britain.</p>

<sec id="sec1-1469605312439971"><title>Introduction: Archaeological approaches to time</title>
<p>Time should be the unifying theme of archaeological theory and practice. Although more critical debate on the nature of archaeological time(s) began only in the 1970s, it has always provoked considerable discussion, not merely in terms of chronology but also of the definition and scope of the discipline. From the 1970s, increasing attention has been directed to the different scales and concepts of time that might be relevant to understanding the past, as well as the very relationship between past and present. Yet resolution of the problems of time continues to be elusive, and it remains a somewhat marginal strand in theoretical debate, in methodological development, and in attempts to harmonize the entrenched divide between theorists and practitioners (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1469605312439971">Holdaway and Wandsnider, 2008</xref>: 8). Significant areas of the inevitable overlap between temporal issues and other archaeological problems remain largely unexplored. In this article, I would like to investigate one of these problems – the relationships between agency and structure in a context of imperial domination – in a fashion which highlights the interface between particular theories of time and particular ways of analysing material culture patterning. I begin with an overview of archaeological approaches to time, which will help to provide some useful definitions and conceptual tools with which to begin exploring the particular nature of Roman time-concepts. To gain further traction on these, though, a novel approach to the relationship between time and agency will be developed, based on the temporal philosophy of George Herbert Mead (1863–1931), and worked through with structural and artefactual sequences from a typical Romano-British site.</p>
<p>If debates about the time-depth of the human past, and of the ways in which change in human life occurred in time, were foundational to the discipline of archaeology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1469605312439971">Murray, 1993</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1469605312439971">1999a</xref>), more diverse issues in the theorization of time were only broached in the intellectually dynamic period of the late 1970s and early 1980s. Two major issues stand out as structuring the debate from this point onwards: relevant scales of time frame, and varying kinds of time-concept (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1469605312439971">Lucas, 2005</xref>: 28–31; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1469605312439971">Murray, 2006</xref>: 87). One key approach to the first theme was Geoff Bailey’s ‘time perspectivism’ (1983, 1987), defining multiple analytical timescales but privileging the relationship between archaeology and long-term processes. The ‘time-perspectivist’ label would subsequently be extended to applications of <italic>Annales</italic> approaches (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1469605312439971">Bintliff, 1991</xref>), among others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1469605312439971">Bailey, 2007</xref>: 198–199; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1469605312439971">Holdaway and Wandsnider, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1469605312439971">Murray, 1999b</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1469605312439971">2006</xref>). The second theme, of different time-concepts or experiences, was also aired at an early stage, in Mark Leone’s paper on ‘Time in American Archaeology’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1469605312439971">1978</xref>). It really grew as an area of interest, though, out of the post-processual critique of some of the aforementioned literature, for example <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-1469605312439971">Shanks and Tilley’s discussion of Bailey’s approach (1987a: 120–126)</xref>. Subsequent, more in-depth studies of time-concepts (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1469605312439971">Barrett, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1469605312439971">Gosden, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr85-1469605312439971">Thomas, 1996</xref>) drew on a range of social theory and Continental philosophy to explore the relationship between time and past experience, and more recently research in this vein has honed in on the particular theme of memory and the notion of the ‘past in the past’ (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1469605312439971">Bradley, 2002</xref>; papers in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1469605312439971">Borić, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr86-1469605312439971">Van Dyke and Alcock, 2003</xref>). Meanwhile, and of relevance to the substantive content of this article, scholars of historical societies have been pursuing investigation primarily of concepts of time-measurement (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1469605312439971">Feeney, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1469605312439971">Hannah, 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1469605312439971">2009</xref>), although typically with less explicit theoretical agendas than have been evident in archaeology.</p>
<p>The two dominant strands of time research appear to represent different traditions, but there are several shared concerns (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1469605312439971">Harding, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1469605312439971">Murray, 1999a</xref>). Discussion of the issue of time-scale has been strongly focused on the nature of the archaeological record. Bailey, for example, has defended time perspectivism as the best way of dealing with the different kinds of palimpsests of which archaeological data are comprised (2007; cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1469605312439971">Lucas, 2008</xref>). Interpreting the archaeological record primarily in terms of aggregation, coupled with the recognition that archaeology is a present-day pursuit, here leads to a focus on long-term ecological or social processes. Critics of this kind of approach, while also asserting the ‘present-ness’ of archaeological activity, have generally argued that foregrounding long-term narratives and ‘abstract time’ measurement is mistaken, because only the ‘substantial time’ of past experience was real to past people. Sometimes this distinction between broad kinds of time-concept has been mapped onto other dichotomies between linear and cyclical time-schemes, or between ‘the West’ and ‘the Other’ (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1469605312439971">Gosden, 1994</xref>: 2–8; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-1469605312439971">Shanks and Tilley, 1987b</xref>; cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr82-1469605312439971">Squair, 1994</xref>). However, more recent efforts to break down the mutually exclusive nature of such dichotomies have recognized that different kinds of time are to be found in all societies, and furthermore that our attempts at understanding other time-concepts must still make some use of our particular archaeological time conventions, and of the characteristics of archaeological material (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1469605312439971">Gardner, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1469605312439971">Harding, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1469605312439971">Herzfeld, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1469605312439971">Lucas, 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1469605312439971">2008</xref>). Such work has drawn both on familiar and novel sources of time theory, and on similar debates in anthropology (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1469605312439971">Gell, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1469605312439971">Ingold, 1993</xref>), to produce accounts of temporal experience which are multi-scale and pluralist.</p>
<p>Among such sources of time theory, I would like to single out the work of Barbara Adam as particularly useful in highlighting alternative ways of categorizing time that go beyond traditional dichotomies, while also providing concepts useful to the archaeologist. Adam’s approach is in turn a point of entry into that of Mead, whom she has championed, which I explore further below. Adam’s many contributions to time theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1469605312439971">1990</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1469605312439971">1994</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1469605312439971">1995</xref>, 2004) highlight the diversity within supposedly monolithic ‘western time’, and furnish concepts which are appropriate to consider in any context when examining cultural variation in understandings of time (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1469605312439971">Herzfeld, 2009</xref>: 109, 115; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1469605312439971">Lucas, 2005</xref>: 64–67). Adam’s work does not diminish the importance of particular ideologies of time in the modern West (nor their impact on other parts of the world via colonialism, on which more below; cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1469605312439971">Leone, 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1469605312439971">Nanni, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-1469605312439971">Rule, 1999</xref>). Yet it explores the range of components that make the simple phenomenon of ‘repetition with variation’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1469605312439971">Adam, 1990</xref>: 167–169), that characterizes temporal life, take on different permutations in different settings (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1469605312439971">Table 1</xref>). For instance, there are many dimensions to the experience of time that revolve around <italic>time frame</italic> and <italic>timing</italic> – location in time (however marked or reckoned), appropriate and inappropriate times to do things, coordination of accounts of the past or arrangements for the future, and so on. Then there is <italic>temporality</italic> – the experience of time passing as rhythmic but irreversible – and the differential rates at which this affects us – the variable <italic>tempo</italic> of social, biological and other processes, and our engagements with them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1469605312439971">Adam, 1994</xref>: 508–512). All of these interconnected aspects of time-experience cross-cut boundaries between ‘natural’ and ‘cultural’, or ‘substantial’ and ‘abstract’ times, and point us to the importance of the more fundamental link between time and action. This connection is analysed further below, both theoretically and through an in-depth case study. However, I want to conclude this introduction by briefly sketching some characteristics of time-reckoning in the Roman world, to illustrate the importance of Adam’s pluralistic view of time-concepts and also to provide some background for what follows.

<p>There is a range of evidence relating to issues of time frames and timing in the Roman empire, though on the whole this material is geographically restricted and frequently involves writing. This immediately brings us back to the relationship between archaeological interpretation of past times and the nature of our evidence. From a time-perspectivist position, Adam’s insights might be relevant to periods with written evidence of calendars and the like, but they are out of sync with the majority of (prehistoric) archaeological data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1469605312439971">Bailey, 2007</xref>: 214–215; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1469605312439971">Holdaway and Wandsnider, 2008</xref>: 2; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1469605312439971">Murray, 1999b</xref>: 24). However, even in a historical context, more direct evidence of time-concepts only illuminates a small proportion of what was going on, and we are thus compelled to make the most of other kinds of evidence. Undeniably, though, the changing organization of time in Rome and Italy, particularly during the later republic and early empire (the first century BC – first century AD; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-1469605312439971">Salzman, 1990</xref>: 5–8) is well documented. The fact that Roman time-reckoning conventions were quite fluid is in itself worth noting, and indeed there were different tempos of change in these conventions, depending on whether we consider the reckoning of hours in the day, days and months in the year, the counting of years, or the occurrence of different activities and festivals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1469605312439971">Hannah, 2005</xref>: 98–130; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-1469605312439971">Richards, 1998</xref>: 206–219; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-1469605312439971">Salzman, 2004</xref>). In each case, the factors shaping these reckoning schemes included a complex mixture of ‘cultural’ and ‘natural’ elements – seasons and cycles of sun, moon, or stars, astrological concepts, the influence of priests and politicians, and people’s activities in town and country. Even at the level of sub-divisions of the day, for example, there were variations in practice between measuring seasonally variable hours according to sunlight, and more uniform segments of time with lamps or water-clocks, which saw increasing use within certain domains of activity, such as law (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1469605312439971">Hannah, 2009</xref>: 98, 112–127). A range of qualitative aspects of time can also be gleaned from the written evidence, including the designation of certain days in each month for different kinds of public activity, and more or less auspicious times for action, relating particularly to astrological beliefs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1469605312439971">Hannah, 2005</xref>: 101–102, 116; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr87-1469605312439971">Whitrow, 1998</xref>: 57). The question remains, though, of how widespread across the empire any of these various Roman time-concepts were. In fact, there is evidence both from the eastern and western parts of the empire that local calendrical systems, festivals, and ideas about auspicious timings persisted throughout much of the imperial period (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr83-1469605312439971">Swift, 2002</xref>). Indeed, Feeney has argued that time was not a primary tool of Roman imperialism, in the way that it may have been for later empires, with the idiosyncratic range of Roman times remaining narrowly confined to the imperial core (2007: 209–211). Yet calendars are only one type of evidence, and more importantly only one form of temporal structure. In other ways, as we will see below, Roman imperialism strikingly affected the tempo of provincial lives. How this relates to the dynamics of power in the empire requires us first to consider further the relationship between time-concepts and agency, and between these matters and archaeological data.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec2-1469605312439971"><title>A pragmatic approach to time: Unpacking the temporal qualities of action</title>
<p>As already discussed, a number of archaeological approaches to past time-concepts have focused on the small scale of human action and experience. That this may be problematic in relation to the character of archaeological remains has been a concern of proponents of time perspectivism, and others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1469605312439971">Bailey, 2007</xref>: 208–210; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1469605312439971">Lucas, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1469605312439971">Murray, 2006</xref>). In what follows I argue for the importance of human-scale interpretations in our narratives about the past, but I do take on board the need for a thoroughly considered approach to the nature of archaeological sequences. I think there is also some truth in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1469605312439971">Bailey’s critical comments (2007: 218–219)</xref> on the techniques that those looking for temporalities at such scales have frequently employed, in particular the concentration on ‘past pasts’, and the exploration of ‘biographies’ of single objects. The former is certainly justifiable, but unlikely to encompass all that is of interest in past time-concepts, while the latter can lead to problems in the elucidation of past human agency (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1469605312439971">Gardner, 2011</xref>). To overcome these issues, an approach is needed which foregrounds the fundamentally temporal nature of action, while sustaining a methodologically viable link between archaeological patterns and patterns of practice. Illustrations of the latter element have been proliferating for some time now (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1469605312439971">Lightfoot et al., 1998</xref>), and I provide a further example below. In order to refine the theoretical component of the approach, I explore here briefly the ideas of one of the ancestors of contemporary social theory, whose work has been neglected by all but a few – although those few (like Barbara Adam) have shown how fruitful these ideas might be. In addition to illuminating the connection between time and agency in a novel way, and thus providing an underpinning to the set of time-concepts already discussed, Mead offers some provocative thoughts on the existence of the past which relate directly to archaeological concerns.</p>
<p>George Herbert Mead contributed to the founding of the American philosophical school of pragmatism, directly inspired the symbolic interactionist approach in social psychology, and was a noted commentator on social and political matters in his day (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1469605312439971">De Waal, 2002</xref>: 1–5; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1469605312439971">Deegan, 2007</xref>: 3–16). Despite a hugely wide-ranging intellectual programme, Mead’s influence has been somewhat less apparent than that of other social theorists of his time, partly because his major published works were posthumously derived from lecture notes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1469605312439971">De Waal, 2002</xref>: 5–7; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1469605312439971">Joas, 1997</xref>: vii–xxiii). However, there is something of a renaissance in Mead studies, with increasing recognition of the value of his thought. Certainly, Mead’s work specifically, and pragmatism and symbolic interactionism more broadly, are highly relevant to a range of problems in archaeological theory, from the temporal ones considered here, to the nature of social interaction and the relationships between people and things (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1469605312439971">Baert, 2005</xref>: 160–163). So far, few archaeologists have referred to his work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1469605312439971">Gardner, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-1469605312439971">Richardson, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-1469605312439971">Sillar, 2011</xref>), with his contemporary Peirce (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-1469605312439971">Preucel, 2006</xref>) and later pragmatist Richard Rorty (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1469605312439971">McDavid, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-1469605312439971">Saitta, 2003</xref>) taking more of the limelight. Mead’s thought on time, though, deserves attention, and has been debated at some length by scholars concerned directly with this issue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1469605312439971">Adam, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1469605312439971">Flaherty and Fine, 2001</xref>), as well as by those interested in its intersection with matters of identity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1469605312439971">Jenkins, 2002</xref>), and agency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1469605312439971">Emirbayer and Mische, 1998</xref>).</p>
<p>This time-philosophy is distinctive in the way it deals with the mutual determinacy of present, past and future. For Mead – and this is a hallmark of pragmatism – time is all about action. The lectures published as <italic>The Philosophy of the Present</italic> (2002[1932]) address the nature of the present as ‘the locus of reality’. He defines the present as commensurate with action, rather than as a quantifiable but almost negligible instant of time, the ‘knife’s edge present’ of classical philosophy and physics (2002[1932]: 51–53; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1469605312439971">De Waal, 2002</xref>: 33–34). This present, therefore, is of variable duration, depending on the qualities of action being undertaken (and particularly whether or not problematic situations are encountered; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1469605312439971">Mead, 2002[1932]</xref>: 49–51). Most importantly, while the present is the only reality, and thus the only point from which past and future can be determined, both past and future have effects on the present, and in their own way determine it. Past actions, in their material residues and memory traces, structure present ones, while orientation towards imagined future outcomes equally go some of the way towards guiding the actor in their present. Yet as novel acts create each new present, so the character of past and future shifts. Mead describes this as the social relationship between present, past and future (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1469605312439971">2002[1932]</xref>: 49–53, 105–109). This proposition has two major implications that concern the discipline of archaeology, although they create an interesting dilemma. The first, already arrived at by some theorists via other pathways, is that any meaningfully structured past is created in and for the present (2002[1932]: 36–44, 57–59; cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1469605312439971">Bailey, 2007</xref>: 202, 214–216; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-1469605312439971">Shanks and Tilley, 1992</xref>: 20–22; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr82-1469605312439971">Squair, 1994: 94)</xref>. The second, more original and productive, is that any interpretation of meaningful action must attend to the temporal orientation of such action; how do a perceived past and future influence an experienced present, and how does a present act shape a past or a future? While these points set up an interesting paradox, in that to interpret past actions we must imagine a past present, but we cannot do so except in our own present, Mead’s own work on the social self provides a neat solution. A key element of this is the notion of an actor’s ability to ‘take the role of the other’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1469605312439971">Mead, 1934</xref>: 144–222, 354–378); that is, observing the gestures of others and interpreting them as actors. Insofar as archaeological data are representative of ‘acts’ or ‘gestures’ (to use Mead’s terms; cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-1469605312439971">Richardson, 1989</xref>), this is what the – partial, situated – interpretation of past presents entails.</p>
<p>Putting this matter aside, then, what is the broader value of Mead’s perspective? My answer would be simply that Mead’s work significantly clarifies the temporal aspects of the relationship between actors and structures. This relationship has been discussed almost ad nauseam in archaeology over the last 30 years, but in the process the balance between structure and agency has been lost (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1469605312439971">Gardner, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1469605312439971">Hegmon, 2003</xref>: 219; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1469605312439971">Joyce and Lopiparo, 2005</xref>). A temporal approach can restore this balance, as I try to demonstrate below, and furthermore it enables us to tackle the pressing problems of scale and resolution that beset our interpretations of archaeological data (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1469605312439971">Lucas, 2008</xref>). It is in this respect that time can serve to unite theory and practice. Before illustrating this with an archaeological dataset, though, the implications of Mead’s theory of time for the interpretation of (past) action need setting out a little more precisely. These are specified by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1469605312439971">Emirbayer and Mische (1998)</xref>, in a response to problems in conceptualizing ‘agency’ within social theory. Using Mead’s temporal philosophy to supplement the work of theorists such as Giddens and Bourdieu, they argue that the linking of habit and creativity that distinguishes human agency is fundamentally a linkage of past and future in the present, as Mead established (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1469605312439971">Emirbayer and Mische, 1998: 963</xref>). They also suggest that structures are equally profoundly temporal as ‘<italic>ways of ordering time</italic>’ (1998: 963; original italics). Defining agency in terms of a triad of iteration/habit, projection/imagination and practical evaluation/judgement (1998: 971; see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1469605312439971">Table 2</xref>), Emirbayer and Mische emphasize the temporal qualities of agency in a fashion that is worth quoting in full:
<disp-quote>
<p>The ways in which people understand their own relationship to the past, future, and present <italic>make a difference</italic> to their actions; changing conceptions of agentic possibility in relation to structural contexts profoundly influence how actors in different periods and places see their worlds as more or less responsive to human imagination, purpose and effort. (1998: 973; original italics)</p></disp-quote>

<p>Such an approach goes a long way towards making analysis of ‘historically-situated’ agency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-1469605312439971">Shalin, 2000</xref>: 339–341) possible, and refining some of the admittedly crude generalizations about historically variable cultural attitudes to tradition and change offered by Giddens, for example (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1469605312439971">Meskell, 1999</xref>: 26). Drawing on Mead’s neglected insights amplifies the temporal dimension of structuration in a novel way, emphasizing the need to interpret archaeological patterning in terms of practices and how these are routinely maintained or creatively transformed. Such patterning might not give the kind of information about time-experience that calendars or sundials do. Yet it is revealing of various other aspects of time in Adam’s typology, such as the tempos of change in traditions and how these may be continued from the past or altered with respect to the future, thus linking momentary actions to larger, but still ‘human-scale’, phenomena. In situations of culture-contact, we might expect these dynamics to be particularly contested, and thus particularly visible (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1469605312439971">Joyce and Lopiparo, 2005</xref>: 371). Elucidating the temporal qualities of practice can thus greatly expand our understanding of imperial processes in action.</p>

<sec id="sec4-1469605312439971"><title>Tempo, tradition and transformation in the Romano-British countryside</title>
<p>I want to illustrate the various elements of the approach outlined above by examining one site over a significant length of time. This site is the Romano-British farmstead of Cotswold Community in central-southern England, and it has been chosen here as an example of a very common type of site, but one largely neglected in Romano-British archaeology until the advent of developer-funded commercial excavation some 20 years ago. The population of Roman Britain – like the rest of the empire – was predominantly rural, living in small settlements whose precise form and density varied regionally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr84-1469605312439971">Taylor, 2007</xref>). Of low visibility and, traditionally, low priority compared to other site-types, more and more such sites have been excavated over the last couple of decades (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1469605312439971">Fulford and Holbrook, 2011</xref>), reinforcing Britain’s place as an archaeologically very well-understood part of the empire. The site at Cotswold Community is particularly useful for examining the everyday experiences of Romano-British people because it has been recently and thoroughly excavated (1999–2004 by Oxford Archaeology, 2005–2008 by Thames Valley Archaeological Services) and well published (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-1469605312439971">Powell et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr81-1469605312439971">Smith et al., 2010</xref>). It also comprises both a sufficient spatial extent for analysis and a lengthy prehistoric sequence into which context the Roman-period evidence can be placed, allowing full assessment of the impact of the empire. In summary, the excavated area (<italic>c</italic>.37ha of gravel terrace straddling the Gloucestershire/Wiltshire county boundary) included a series of features and settlements dating from the middle Neolithic onwards (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1469605312439971">Figure 1</xref>). Use of the location by mobile pastoralists in the early phases gave way to roundhouse settlements from the middle Bronze Age into the Iron Age, albeit still geared towards livestock farming. Although the settlement focus seems to have moved outside of the excavated area in the middle Iron Age (<italic>c</italic>.400–300 BC), a new nucleus for occupation was established later in the Iron Age that continued in use through the Roman period, with major structural alterations in the early, middle and later centuries of that era, and increasing evidence for arable cultivation. The main features of these phases comprised enclosures and trackways, pits and waterholes, and some structures. The settlement focus again shifted away in the post-Roman period, and the site became fields (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-1469605312439971">Smith, 2010</xref>). The fact that the main enclosed settlement of the Iron Age and Roman periods is entirely within the excavated area, along with the combination of continuity of location with transformation of organization, makes the site a suitable one with which to explore the temporal qualities of a range of different practices.
<fig id="fig1-1469605312439971" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p>Overall plan of the Cotswold Community excavation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-1469605312439971">Powell et al., 2010</xref>: Frontispiece, with additions; copyright Oxford Archaeology, used with permission).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1469605312439971-fig1.tif"/></fig></p>
<p>Looking at the main structural and stratigraphic sequence, while the earlier prehistoric periods contain interesting evidence for tempos of action, more detail is discernible in the later Iron Age and Roman periods, partly because the site condenses to a fairly definite nucleus (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1469605312439971">Figure 2</xref>). This involved a move from the probable middle Iron Age focus just outside of the southern limit of excavation, to a palisaded enclosure to the north of the site, sometime towards the later Iron Age, although pottery dating is imprecise during this period (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr80-1469605312439971">Smith and Powell, 2010</xref>: 108). Initially the domestic buildings were not within the palisade, but in the late Iron Age, perhaps in the early years AD, a more complex network of enclosures was created, with domestic activity situated in the heart of this. The ditches defining many of these enclosures were recut several times, and contained finds groups that were more substantial and varied than hitherto (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr80-1469605312439971">Smith and Powell, 2010</xref>: 99–119). If this reorganization did take place before the Roman conquest of the area in the mid-first century AD, with a fort and then town established at Cirencester only 5km away, then the next upheaval came afterwards, in the mid-Roman period. This phase actually comprises two sub-phases, but perhaps represents a more continuous series of modifications and redevelopments during the second century.
<fig id="fig2-1469605312439971" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p>Composite plan of later Iron Age and Roman phases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-1469605312439971">Powell et al., 2010</xref>: 100; copyright Oxford Archaeology, used with permission).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1469605312439971-fig2.tif"/></fig></p>
<p>The earlier elements include two trackways connecting the farmstead to the wider world, and some alterations to the boundaries, while the later changes focused on the internal structure of the settlement, seeming to divide it up into more functionally discrete areas than had previously been evident, attested by features like a corn-dryer in one zone. This new arrangement persisted for a time until the last major Roman-period alteration, which occurred sometime in the late third century. During this settled period, routines of dumping material into boundary ditches and then recutting them are manifest across the site. Beyond the settlement core, field systems were also increasingly evident, occasionally marked with burials (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-1469605312439971">Smith and Powell, 2010</xref>: 119–144). One field boundary marked by two inhumations intersected with the end of a long late Bronze Age/early Iron Age pit alignment, hinting at the intermingling of stability and flux in acts which were novel creations of continuity. The occupants of the site in the later Roman phase still used many of the mid-Roman boundaries, but new features, which probably accumulated gradually, included stone-founded buildings in the main enclosure and a small inhumation cemetery. The latter was mainly focused around a Bronze Age barrow. A couple of boundary-marking burials were also found. The long continuity of occupation on the site apparently finally came to an end in the third quarter of the fourth century AD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr80-1469605312439971">Smith and Powell, 2010</xref>: 144–166). Overall, this relatively unprepossessing site thus has a great deal of evidence – in the form of features relating to routines and transformations – for how people adapted in their present to changing ideas about the future. Before discussing these issues in depth we need to take a closer look at the finds.</p>
<p>There are all sorts of challenges in discussing the temporal characteristics of groups of finds, and the boundary between strict matters of chronology and themes of time-experience is unsustainable (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1469605312439971">Lucas, 2005</xref>: 95–106). This is particularly evident if we start with the pottery. The Roman period was unsurprisingly more materially conspicuous than earlier eras, with 21,612 sherds of late Iron Age to Roman date compared to 3095 earlier prehistoric and 1795 late Bronze Age to mid-Iron Age. In the Roman phases, the mid-Roman period was most productive of pottery (40% of the assemblage, with 36% late Roman and 24% late Iron Age/early Roman) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1469605312439971">Biddulph, 2010a</xref>: 167; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1469605312439971">Brown and Mullin, 2010</xref>: 1). Through this time, local reduced wares were dominant, providing a backdrop of continuity to certain more dynamic features of the assemblage. These relate to changes in pottery supply and in site activity/depositional practice; both factors are temporally significant. The later Iron Age/early Roman groups were more numerous and diverse than those of the preceding phase, with six new vessel forms available and several new fabrics. This trend continued into the mid-Roman period, with increases apparent in both quantity (more EVEs) and deposition (more phased groups). These phenomena are linked and one can be a product of the other, but here there genuinely appear to be both more pots on the site and more activities involving their disposal. There were also increases in form (36 new types, some suggesting new cooking or eating practices) and fabric variety (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1469605312439971">Biddulph, 2010b</xref>: 33–37). Both the characteristics of the assemblage and the increase in activities which led to potsherds being deposited indicate a higher turnover of vessels and a greater frequency of their disposal in dumping practices. This increased tempo of activity was not maintained into the later second century, though, with fewer groups at a time when generally pottery industries were quite buoyant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1469605312439971">Going’s [1992]</xref> work enables calibration of site assemblages against provincial production trends to assess whether a lower quantity of pottery in a given period is a factor of supply or demand). In the early fourth century, though, the volume of pottery increased again, albeit not to mid-Roman levels, and not with quite such marked innovation in forms (30 new types) or fabrics. Some changes to depositional practice occurred at this point too, with fewer, larger groups, in features such as waterholes, which also tended to be filled with more freshly broken material (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1469605312439971">Biddulph, 2010b</xref>: 37–41). The pottery assemblage can thus be seen as extremely informative about the tempos of a range of practices, including those to do with eating, with exchange, and with disposal. Linear trends of generally increasing usage and diversity of objects can be set against cycles of higher or lower turnover of material (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1469605312439971">Figure 3a</xref>). These trends take on more significance if we compare them with other artefact categories.

<p>The coinage and small finds are most readily related to the temporality of life at Cotswold Community. The coin assemblage was a good size for a rural site, with 360 Roman coins (all copper alloy), as well as two Iron Age silver pieces; however, about 90 per cent of these were unstratified. The coin-profile of the site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1469605312439971">Figure 3</xref>b) shows that the supply to and/or deposition of coins on the site is mainly a feature of the fourth century. Through the later first, second and early third centuries, only a handful of coins were lost by people living here, but subsequently, and particularly from 330 until the 360s or 370s, there was a marked increase in volume and, importantly, turnover of money at the site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1469605312439971">Booth, 2010</xref>). Across Britain, this is a period of increased coin-use, such that ‘monetization’ of the rural economy is only really apparent from the later third century onwards (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-1469605312439971">Reece, 2002</xref>: 102), and indeed, the people at Cotswold Community joined this trend a little later than most. In terms of the rhythms of the site itself, it is clear that people on the site became engaged with imperial practices of exchange only really in the late Roman period, via an innovation in their material repertoire, and one which linked them into the institutional time frames of the empire itself, through the representations and legends on the coins. Whether these explicit messages were understood or not, the turnover of new objects of this type was increasing in a period when other items – like the pottery discussed above – were less likely to be novel.</p>
<p>With the small finds, there are yet further cycles to consider (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-1469605312439971">Powell, 2010</xref>). Numerically among the most abundant finds of Roman-period metalwork were hobnails, indicating a new trend in footwear, and while these increased dramatically in the later Roman period this is linked to the much greater number of inhumation burials at this time, and thus a new type of deposition. Other items relating to dress were also quite numerous, with up to 47 brooches, of which the majority date stylistically to the late first century BC to first century AD, although those that were stratified (15 of the total) were generally in mid- to late Roman contexts. This indicates that while there was an influx of new dress accessories in the pre-conquest period (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1469605312439971">Jundi and Hill, 1998</xref>), these objects were then curated for quite a long time, or entered rubbish deposits which were subsequently moved. Later brooch types are lacking, and there are few of the fairly typical later Roman types of objects, like bracelets, suggesting some change in means or attitude in this period (only 11 bracelets were found, compared to four times as many at nearby sites of similar status). Other categories of items like tools are fairly constant, but overall the assemblage is on the small side, with some categories of household items lacking compared to other sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-1469605312439971">Powell, 2010</xref>: 116–119). There are relevant patterns also to be found in other sources of evidence, such as animal remains, but space precludes their discussion here.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec5-1469605312439971"><title>The impact of empire on everyday temporalities</title>
<p>Putting all of the various elements of the site at Cotswold Community together, what can be said about the overlapping cycles of continuity and change in different practices? Despite the lack of direct evidence for things like calendrical awareness or other aspects of time-reckoning, there are certainly abundant indications of the varied tempos and temporalities of action. These can in turn be related to the impact of empire, albeit in a more complex way than might be initially hypothesized. The structural sequence of the site encompasses both apparently episodic and more continuous change – pulses of considerable transformation in activity, like the relocation of the main settlement focus in the later Iron Age, or its replanning in the decades preceding the Roman conquest, and in the second and later third centuries, alongside more regular routines, for example of ditch maintenance by periodic recutting. Interpretation of how such structural events spread out in time is challenging, and distinguishing significant rebuilding from routine maintenance is not always easy. The picture described above can be put forward quite confidently, though, based on the excavators’ integrated assessment of features and finds. What it indicates is that people living at Cotswold Community were able to act flexibly amid changing social and economic circumstances, probably connected to the formation of new political networks in the late Iron Age, the flourishing of the nearby urban centre at Cirencester in the early second century, and the shift from urban to more rural-elite power-networks in the later third and fourth centuries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr80-1469605312439971">Smith and Powell, 2010</xref>: 117–119, 138–144, 164–166; cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1469605312439971">Mattingly, 2006</xref>: 56–57, 278–279, 372–374; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1469605312439971">Moore, 2011</xref>). Each of these broad (social) structural shifts, widely attested in Britain, was linked in some way to Roman imperialism. These links include the complex relationship between southern Britain and the empire in the period between Caesar’s expeditions and Claudius’ invasion (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1469605312439971">Creighton, 2000</xref>), the quite deliberate foundation of urban communities in the generations after conquest (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1469605312439971">Creighton, 2006</xref>), and the rather more unintended consequences of empire in the drift towards provincial self-sufficiency and the localization of power in the fourth century (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1469605312439971">Gardner, 2007</xref>). At certain times then – though, notably, not the military conquest itself – routines were significantly disrupted for a short period; such transformations were certainly perceptible, and involved people living on the farm acting differently than hitherto, in their present (requiring ‘practical evaluation’ in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1469605312439971">Emirbayer and Mische’s terms [1998: 971]</xref>), with respect to their new ‘projected’ future, under the influence of (but in turn shaping) the diverse structures of empire.</p>
<p>In other ways, revealed particularly by the evidence of the finds, being drawn into the Roman empire certainly affected the tempo of life at Cotswold Community (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1469605312439971">Adam, 1994</xref>: 511). Again, this change began before actual conquest; the evidence of brooches and pottery shows significant shifts in the temporal nature of certain practices in the later Iron Age – practices such as exchanging (frequency of acquisition of novel types of things), eating (increasing occurrence of new types of pots), and dressing, with concomitant changes to the frequency of rubbish deposition and/or artefact curation. In other words, people’s temporal relationships with things began to shift quite significantly at this point. Such change, interestingly linked more to the pre-conquest social transformation in southern Britain than the invasion, set a new pattern for the post-conquest period, but again this was a pattern that would undergo subsequent periods of episodic flux. While routines surrounding the use, breakage/disposal, and replacement of pottery became established from this time that would have been unrecognizable to the early Iron Age inhabitants of the site, there were also periods when supply changed – in keeping with cyclical patterns in the broader economy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1469605312439971">Going, 1992</xref>) – but apparently also demand, when perhaps short-term circumstances on the site led people to anticipate longer intervals between acquiring new vessels, as in the late second century (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1469605312439971">Biddulph, 2010b</xref>: 35). In dress, the late Iron Age innovations which were very much a widespread feature in Britain – a phenomenon known as the ‘fibula event horizon’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1469605312439971">Jundi and Hill, 1998</xref>: 126) – were not really to be repeated by the farmstead’s inhabitants, and the curation of older brooches, and lack of newer types of items, would have been a noticeable feature of these people’s appearance in the later Roman period. Yet this does not mean that they were entirely stuck in the past – wilfully or otherwise – as in this period the general monetization of the countryside produced another kind of new object that these people interacted with, as well as new trends in matters such as treatment of the dead. Whether or not these changes affected people’s identification with the empire, making them more ‘Roman’, is another matter, and a complex one in its own right (the turnover of fourth-century coins, for instance, certainly made the changing person of the emperor more immediate than previously). The key thing here, though, is not just that the tempo of change in the Roman period was greater than hitherto – this is noticeable to us, but not necessarily to someone living in their third-century present. Rather, the structures of the empire created opportunities and constraints which meant that life was <italic>more subject to variations in tempo</italic>; in this respect, imperialism impacted upon time-experience in quite a profound way.</p>
<p>The fact that people responded to this transformation with efforts to mark continuity, therefore, is significant, and here we see the real importance of the notion of ‘the past in the past’. The agency of the people living at Cotswold Community was being influenced by new structures outside of their control, that created, and continued to create, new rhythms relating to exchange, eating, dress and so on – <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1469605312439971">Emirbayer and Mische’s ‘ways of ordering time’ (1998: 963)</xref>. These transformations were absorbed successfully (at least until the later fourth century), but sustained alongside them was a strong strand of stability and habit, generated through acts which – while very much part of a present – made more or less deliberate reference to the past (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1469605312439971">Chadwick, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1469605312439971">Jenkins, 2002</xref>: 274–276). Examples of more intentional kinds of action might include the mid-Roman burials near the terminus of the major early Iron Age pit alignment, or the later cemetery in the vicinity of the Bronze Age barrow. More routine continuities perhaps include the preference throughout the Roman period – for whatever reason – for a fairly similar range of pottery, or the following and recutting of some features over generations, such as one of the mid-Roman trackways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr80-1469605312439971">Smith and Powell, 2010</xref>: 120). Further elements of material culture, such as the pattern of brooch acquisition, care and deposition, might carry more or less significance at certain times – not necessarily deliberately ‘traditional’, except when compared directly with newer trends. All of these material patterns do, though, speak to practices which buffered the people living in Cotswold Community against the more ever-changing times in which they lived as part of the Roman empire, even as they were able to innovate in some ways and adapt to those times. They were not simply, or at least not always, simply ‘going on’ with what had been done before, but – as Mead’s fundamental insight reminds us – creating in the present a past for that moment, and simultaneously looking to the future. Compared to the evidence of calendars and the like, then, the effects of empire on everyday time-experience can be seen to be quite profound, but not all-determining; people still had the capacity to actively shape their response to these structural effects.</p>

<sec id="sec6-1469605312439971"><title>Conclusion: The temporalities of empire</title>
<p>At the scale of a single site we can see that time-experiences in the Roman world were multiple, and were bound up with structuration. If space permitted the consideration of multiple sites in Britain, we might examine how the temporal qualities of life on a farmstead compared with those of a town or a fort, and examine how migrants between different communities, such as recruits into the military, might experience further imposition of change in the temporal framing of their actions (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1469605312439971">James, 1999</xref>: 16–18). And of course, different provinces with different relationships to the broadest structures of the Roman empire would also produce different stories. In each case, though, the interaction of actors in those provinces with such structures would be fundamentally temporal. The agents with most power in the empire may not have imposed Roman calendrical conventions on all of its citizens, but the process of imperialism nonetheless affected the mutual constitution of present, past and future for very many people, even on humble rural sites like that at Cotswold Community. The Roman empire thus bears comparison with other empires, and we can see both similarities and differences with the way these used or at least affected time-concepts in subject areas. In colonial Victoria, for example, Aboriginal time-concepts were radically challenged by the imposition of new time-reckoning structures, linked to aspects of timing including work routines, by agents of the British empire. Yet resistance could also be enacted through such time-concepts, for example through the scheduling of indigenous gatherings on the Sabbath (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1469605312439971">Nanni, 2011</xref>: 23–25). Thus, while the means by which specific aspects of time were imposed in recent centuries might be more encompassing than those of the Roman period, they were neither completely successful, nor indeed completely representative of the real multiplicity of imperial times (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1469605312439971">Adam, 1994</xref>). In these respects there are fruitful comparisons to be made between the temporal dynamics of different empires.</p>
<p>Given the fundamentally temporal nature of human being, that time should be an issue in situations of asymmetrical power relations and cultural contact is hardly surprising. The way in which we approach time-experience in the past, and its relation to our present, is important, however. There are many theories of time, as indicated in the introduction to this article, and a certain amount of disagreement about which are more appropriate either in the interpretation of archaeological material, or in defining the self-perception of the archaeologist. What I have tried to do is to accept the multiplicity of time-concepts, but also their essential binding with issues of structure and agency. Pragmatism, and in particular the work of Mead, provides a good grounding for such a perspective, as well as clear guidance that the merit of any approach must be judged in its effect on action (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1469605312439971">James, 1995[1907]:</xref> 17–32). In this case, I take that to mean not just whether a more comprehensive account of the process of Roman imperialism can be produced, but also whether it can help us to deal with as full a range of evidence as possible. In the foregoing, I have referred to studies of textual material that illustrate the range of Roman time-concepts that were of interest to predominantly urban-dwellers in the imperial core, and then I have looked in detail at the rhythms and tempos of life in a rural context on the imperial fringe. In the latter, I have used some aggregates and palimpsests to discuss not individual actions, perhaps, but patterns of action which can be interpreted in relation to the decisions and experiences of past actors (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1469605312439971">Bailey, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1469605312439971">Harding, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1469605312439971">Lucas, 2008</xref>). Such an exercise is an act in the present, and is therefore shaped by conventions of archaeological practice and the divisions in the discipline, but this returns us to the point that thinking about time should be a central area of debate that brings diverse theorists and practitioners together. A handful of scholars have shown the way, with work that addresses issues of time-experience and methods of archaeological work with stratigraphy and assemblages (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1469605312439971">Chadwick, 2003</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1469605312439971">2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1469605312439971">Lucas, 2001</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1469605312439971">2005</xref>). If we want to avoid the further fragmentation of archaeology in an economically hostile world, there are few better subjects than time to focus our attention upon.</p>
