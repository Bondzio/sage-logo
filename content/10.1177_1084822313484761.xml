<body>
<p>According to the most recently available data from the World Health Organization (WHO), stroke and other cerebrovascular diseases are the second leading cause of death worldwide in 2008.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1084822313484761">1</xref></sup> During 2008, an estimated 6.15 million people around the world died from stroke or another form of cerebrovascular disease. The WHO also estimates that one in six people worldwide will have a stroke in their lifetime.</p>
<p>In the United States, 129,476 Americans died from stroke in 2010,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1084822313484761">2</xref></sup> which makes stroke the fourth leading cause of death. The prevalence of stroke varies by racial and ethnic groups in the United States. During the period 2006 to 2010, American Indians and Alaska Natives (AI/AN) have experienced highest prevalence of stroke.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1084822313484761">3</xref></sup> Age-adjusted prevalence of stroke was 5.9% among AI/AN people in 2010, 2.4 times greater than non-Hispanic White adults (2.4%) and Hispanic adults (2.5%), and 4 times greater than their Asian adult counterparts (1.5%). Stroke is the seventh leading cause of death among AI/AN.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1084822313484761">4</xref></sup> Among the factors putting AI/AN populations at greater risk of having a stroke are the high prevalence of obesity, physical inactivity, a lack of daily fruit and vegetable consumption, cigarette smoking, hypertension, diabetes, and socioeconomic barriers.</p>
<p>According to the 2010 Census, 5.2 million AI/AN people lived in the United States, representing approximately 1.7% of the U.S. total population.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1084822313484761">5</xref></sup> The number of AI/AN populations is projected to rise to 8.6 million by 2050, constituting approximately 2% of the total U.S. population.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1084822313484761">6</xref></sup> As AI/AN populations grow, the burden of stroke is expected to increase. This column describes the risk factors that may explain disparities in stroke prevalence among AI/AN populations. Culturally appropriate approaches are also discussed.</p>
<sec id="section1-1084822313484761">
<title>Risk Factors Influence the Prevalence of Stroke</title>
<sec id="section2-1084822313484761">
<title>Obesity</title>
<p>Obesity is an important risk factor for stroke. American Indians and Alaska Natives have a high prevalence of obesity in adults. Data from the National Center for Health Statistics has shown that the prevalence of obesity as measured by body mass index (BMI ≥ 30) in AI/AN adult populations (39.4%) is 1.6 times likely than of non-Hispanic Whites (24.3%).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1084822313484761">7</xref></sup> Approximately 20% of AI/AN preschool children were overweight, and an additional 21% were obese.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1084822313484761">8</xref></sup> The epidemic of overweight and obesity in AI/AN populations often result from lifestyle factors such as physical inactivity and unhealthy diets. However, AI/AN people view overweight and obesity as normal and healthy.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-1084822313484761">
<title>Physical Inactivity</title>
<p>Regular physical activity provides protection against obesity and other health risks, such as stroke. AI/AN adults participate in relatively low levels of physical activity. Only 12.5% met current federal physical activity guidelines, compared to 22.8% of non-Hispanic Whites.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1084822313484761">7</xref></sup> This may be due to a decrease in physical activity as traditional occupations such as hunting and farming among AI/AN populations.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1084822313484761">
<title>A Lack of Daily Fruit and Vegetable Consumption</title>
<p>There is a protective relationship between fruit and vegetable intake and stroke. Only 37% of AI/AN adults consumed recommended number of at least five servings of fruits and vegetables each day.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1084822313484761">9</xref></sup> Another study found that 70% to 85% AI/AN adults reported fewer than three servings of vegetables or fruits on the previous day.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1084822313484761">10</xref></sup> A possible explanation for this includes the shift from a subsistence diet to a more Westernized diet after modernization.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1084822313484761">11</xref></sup> There may have other factors within the AI/AN environment that may hinder their ability to access and consume fruits and vegetables.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1084822313484761">
<title>Cigarette Smoking</title>
<p>Cigarette smoking has been identified as a risk factor for stroke and high blood pressure. AI/AN adults aged 18 years or older (26.6%) had the highest prevalence of current smoking compared with other racial and ethnic populations (i.e., 19.8% non-Hispanic Whites, 19.5% non-Hispanic Blacks, 12.2% Hispanics, and 9.3% Asians).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1084822313484761">7</xref></sup> In addition, 50% of AI/AN middle school students and 60% of high school students reported current use of any tobacco product.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1084822313484761">12</xref></sup></p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1084822313484761">
<title>High Blood Pressure</title>
<p>There is a well-established relationship between high blood pressure and the risk for developing stroke. Compared with White adults (23.9%), AI/AN adults (30%) are 1.3 times as likely to have high blood pressure.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1084822313484761">7</xref></sup> Since AI/AN populations are more likely to be obese and current cigarette smokers than non-Hispanic Whites, these risk factors can lead to adverse effects on blood pressure and stroke.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-1084822313484761">
<title>Diabetes</title>
<p>Diabetes is an extremely important risk factor for stroke among AI/AN populations. The risk for stroke is 2 to 4 times higher among people with diabetes. American Indian and Alaska Native adults are 2.3 times more likely to be diagnosed with diabetes compared with non-Hispanic Whites (16.1% vs. 7.1%). The high prevalence of obesity and physical inactivity among AI/AN populations may contribute to the high rate of diabetes.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-1084822313484761">
<title>Socioeconomic Barriers</title>
<p>In 2010, as compared to 10.6% of non-Hispanic Whites, a higher percentage of AI/AN population (25%) lived at the poverty level.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1084822313484761">13</xref></sup> This population is also less educated and only 14% have earned at least a bachelor’s degree, in comparison to 31% of non-Hispanic Whites. Additionally, 29.2% of AI/ANs had no health insurance coverage and this population often lives in rural areas. These factors can limit their ability to access to stroke information and health care, and understanding of health information.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-1084822313484761">
<title>Culturally Appropriate Approaches</title>
<p>American Indians and Alaska Natives are an ethnically and culturally diverse population. There are 566 federally recognized AI/AN tribes, and more than 100 state recognized tribes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1084822313484761">12</xref></sup> Health care professionals need to be aware that each tribe has distinct customs, cultural values and practices, and resides in diverse geographical territories. Moreover, to effectively care for AI/AN populations, culturally appropriate programs need to use a holistic approach that reflects AI/AN cultural health and illness conceptions. For example, the traditional AI/AN concept of health includes four intricately woven elements of life: the physical, mental, emotional, and spiritual.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1084822313484761">14</xref></sup> AI/AN people believe that any imbalance of these four health elements results in illness or poor health; connections, relations, and family are among the many essential components of well-being. These cultural values and beliefs often differ from those of the dominant society. Health care professionals who serve AI/AN communities or want to work with AI/AN populations should be required to receive training on tribal traditions and cultural awareness to enhance cultural competence.</p>
<p>Health care professionals are in an invaluable position in all phases of stroke care for AI/AN populations. Healthy People 2020 objectives related to stroke include increasing the proportion of adults who are aware of the symptoms of and how to respond to a stroke, and increasing the proportion of adults with prehypertension who meet the recommended guidelines.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1084822313484761">15</xref></sup> Health care professionals play a central part in achieving these nationwide goals. For primary prevention of stroke, AI/AN populations would benefit from efforts to enhance their knowledge about the nature of stroke, risk factors, its signs and symptoms, and the need for urgency of treatment. Education information using culturally appropriate methods is needed on lifestyle changes and association between stroke, blood pressure control, the benefits of regular physical activity, and tobacco use. For instance, the cultural value of familism and collectivism plays important roles in their concepts of disease causation. A comprehensive strategic plan must include family-, school-, and tribal-based interventions. In addition, health care providers should be aware of health care resources that are available to AI/AN communities. For example, the U.S. Government established the Indian Health Service (IHS) within the Department of Health and Human Services to provide health and educational assistance to 566 federally recognized Tribes across the United States. The IHS operates a comprehensive health service delivery system for AI/AN populations living in different areas.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1084822313484761">16</xref></sup> The IHS website also has educational information on stroke education and risk factors as well as American Heart Association, American Stroke Association, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and National Stroke Association websites.</p>
<p>The role of health care professionals in secondary prevention of stroke for AI/AN populations is centered in the early diagnosis and timely referral for treatment options. Health care professionals should be aware of evolving current practices and guidelines for the stroke screening, such as National Stroke Association guidelines. Since AI/AN children are more likely to live with their parents and grandparents, stroke literacy program that teaches elementary school children to recognize stroke symptoms (FAST—Face, Arm, Speech, Time)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1084822313484761">17</xref></sup> and take urgent action (e.g., call 911) may have particularly important health implications for this high risk population.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-1084822313484761">
<title>Summary</title>
<p>American Indians and Alaska Natives are facing health disparities in stroke. Many of the risk factors for stroke among AI/AN people are preventable. Culturally specific and evidence<bold>-</bold>based practices are needed to improve health care and outcomes for this population. Finally, only few studies have been published on stroke in American Indians and Alaska Natives. An emphasis on the training and development of AI/AN researchers must be a priority to better address the health disparities within this population.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1084822313484761">10</xref></sup></p>
