<title>Background</title>
<p>The Danish welfare state is changing. At least 12 governmental reforms have been launched and implemented in the span of less than a decade. Many of the changes have taken place in the municipalities. Here, a so-called “structural reform” was decided in 2004, intended to reduce the number of municipalities from 271 to 98 large municipalities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1403494812449519">1</xref>]. The new health reform was launched in 2005 which the municipalities were made central units and responsible for a national (although locally anchored) health programme based on health promotion and prevention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1403494812449519">2</xref>].</p>
<p>As a part of the reform, more general health-promoting activities directed towards the citizens have been placed in the municipalities, especially health-promotion interventions aimed at children’s and adolescent’s health. The reform allows for the municipalities to decide for themselves how to organize the activities. The political ideas in the reform are several. One idea is to establish health promotion as a local, cross-policy area based on context-specific and com munity-based activities. Locally formulated political strategies for health have gathered different political fields. Recent studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1403494812449519">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1403494812449519">4</xref>] have shown that mostly all of the municipalities have formulated political strategies for health as recommended from the state agencies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1403494812449519">5</xref>] and the municipal interest organization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1403494812449519">6</xref>].</p>
<p>This article focuses on the area for children’s and adolescents’ health. We want to identify the organizational means by which health promotion has been incorporated into institutions such as schools and day care, where other tasks and duties have traditionally been more central concerns. The basis for the discussions is a cooperative research project named <italic>Children at Risk</italic> funded by the Danish National Research Council carried out by researchers from two research environments: the Department of Management, Politics and Philosophy at Copenhagen Business School and the Department of Pedagogy at The Danish School of Education, University of Aarhus (during the period from 1 September 2007 to 31 December 2009). The general objective in the studies has been to assess and compare the managerial and intervention-pedagogical tendencies in the health-promotion strategies. The article focuses on the interplay between the political–administrative and the educational–professional level. The intention is to compare policy solutions and intervention strategies, examining whether the local organization of prevention and health-promoting efforts are: (a) risk orientated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1403494812449519">7</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1403494812449519"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1403494812449519">9</xref>]; (b) network based [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1403494812449519">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1403494812449519">11</xref>]; and (c) value reflected and learning orientated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1403494812449519">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1403494812449519">13</xref>].</p>

<title>Methods</title>
<p><italic>Children at Risk</italic> has a mixed qualitative design including a survey based on telephone interviews, several personal and focus group interviews, and five comparative case studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1403494812449519">14</xref>]. The interviews with representatives from all the Danish municipalities and the case studies from selected municipalities have been taken into a critical, interpretive framework with the power to establish new critical knowledge based on the empirical research [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1403494812449519">15</xref>].</p>
<p>The research has been divided into four separate studies, three of them employing literature reviews, analysis of health policies, individual interviews, and focus group interviews, whereas one of them has been based solely on an telephone interview survey.</p>
<p>The first study compares the health strategies on the area for children and young people in four selected municipalities on the basis of policy materials, organizational diagrams, and interviews with public managers. In this comparative case study, four administrative models are investigated. The empirical material has been obtained through focus group interviews and documents readings.</p>
<p>A second study is based on telephone interviews with health managers, directors, and leading health-promotion coordinators on the area for children and adolescents in 72 of the 98 Danish municipalities. The interview subjects have been questioned from a standardized questionnaire with groups of questions concerning the following themes:</p>
<list id="list1-1403494812449519" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Where is health promotion and disease prevention placed in the municipal organization</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>To what extent is the efforts for children and adolescents organized as collaborations and networks together with external players</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>What kind of pedagogical approaches to health promotion is adopted in concrete projects</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Through the interviews, knowledge has been produced concerning the initial municipal efforts to integrate the tasks of prevention and health promotion among children and adolescents [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1403494812449519">16</xref>].</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>A third study has been carried out in cooperation with the Danish Heart Foundation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1403494812449519">17</xref>]. The study has conducted focus group interviews with a total of 108 pupils aged 13–14, from 18 different school classes across the country; they were asked about their views on health and their involvement in prevention and health promotion. The perspective rewired partly on anthropological methodology focused on children as informants, partly on a system theoretical approach to knowledge [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1403494812449519">18</xref>]. The study illustrates the adolescents’ knowledge in relation to a number of the health challenges they face [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1403494812449519">19</xref>].</p>
<p>A fourth and last case study compares the intervention programmes and interventions strategies in five municipalities. The selection criteria have been finding municipalities of varying size and geographical location. Furthermore, it is a criterion that diverse approaches to health education are represented. The comparisons are based on policy materials, programmes, plans, and focus group interviews with health professionals with a total of 36 informants. Some interview subjects are municipal managers with various levels of responsibility for children’s and adolescents’ health, while others are health professionals or health educators with day-to-day responsibility for prevention and health-promoting activities targeting children and adolescents [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1403494812449519">20</xref>].</p>
<sec id="section7-1403494812449519">
<title>Theoretical framework</title>
<p>The research are guided by three different theoretical approaches. First, the organization of health promotion for children and adolescents is seen in a policy perspective as a certain type of policy network [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1403494812449519">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1403494812449519">21</xref>]: a special type of hybrid organization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1403494812449519">11</xref>] combined with “risk management” [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1403494812449519">22</xref>] defines public management.</p>
<p>Secondly, it is assumed that certain semantics, that is concepts, meanings, and values [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1403494812449519">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1403494812449519">24</xref>] are employed in the discourses that have an impact on how children and adolescents’ health is put into words.</p>
<p>Third, a set of assumptions from the role and participation literature are decisive, focusing on the roles given to children and adolescents through concrete initiatives in school and during leisure time [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1403494812449519">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1403494812449519">25</xref>]. Inclusion is seen as related to conditions of life, lifestyle, and the idea of “the good life”. Furthermore, a certain value perspective is adopted, leaving the analyses open to the type of knowledge, values, and norms that are put into play through municipal health efforts for children and adolescents. This approach links a systems-theoretical perspective [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1403494812449519">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1403494812449519">26</xref>] with an education- and participation-oriented perspective [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1403494812449519">27</xref>], as well as a health concept that encompasses values from the children’s everyday life. Value-based collaboration between various professionals and value-reflected interaction between health professionals and children/adolescents serves as a recurrent focal point [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1403494812449519">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1403494812449519">28</xref>]</p>
</sec>

<sec id="section8-1403494812449519">
<title>Empirical findings</title>
<p>As previously mentioned, research has shown that most Danish municipalities have turned prevention and health promotion into a strategic area in line with other strategic areas in their health policies. In relation to this policy finding, a first important finding in our project has been that the municipalities have developed supportive organizational structures of a cross-sectional kind such as networks and centres.</p>
<sec id="section9-1403494812449519">
<title>Networks</title>
<p>In the interview survey, a number of municipalities mention projects related to a so-called Healthy City-Network. This network has been established through government funding, organized in a regional setting and with projects implemented on a local level. Looking at the network, three policy levels are active in the network formation, though the local level is the most important to the activities. An administrative manager for community health tells:</p>
<p>“In the Healthy City-Network we create the agenda ourselves as the projects are our own. But at the same time we are in close contact with the other municipalities in the network. This allows us to test our ideas with others” [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1403494812449519">29</xref>].</p>
<p>A project leader from another municipality concludes in relation to cooperation among the participants in projects in the Healthy City-Network:</p>
<p>“We take turns on leadership in order to make the most of all good efforts. We crosses traditional divisions and we benefit from each other” [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1403494812449519">29</xref>].</p>
<p>A leader from an administrative unit for children and adolescents says:</p>
<p>“Even though the healthy City-Initiative is initiated from the top, we have no difficulties following orders, as we are the people who carry out the initiatives and make safe the actual cooperation” [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1403494812449519">29</xref>].</p>
<p>The three statements are telling for the way networks are organized in the municipalities. Concluding from the experiences we have been told in the interviews, networks are very much organized through the project and activities that are implemented. Cooperation is very practically understood as joint interventions.</p>
<p>Network organization is also organize the health-promotion activities in (a) local health centers – as settings for health-promotion activities aimed at the citizens – or in (b) centres of health knowledge. Two employees in a health centre explain:</p>
<p>“And the citizens do not need to go through their general practitioner or social worker. As citizens they are allowed to approach us at their own hand. It is easy. Just enter the building” [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1403494812449519">29</xref>].</p>
<p>A case example taken from a large municipality will clarify this difference. Here a knowledge centre in Children’s Health has been established. The rationale is different from the above-mentioned centre as the centre is not organized as a face-to-face contact centre with the citizens. Rather the centre is aimed at binding together internally in the municipal organization. In the centre are almost 20 different health professionals employed: social physicians, pediatricians, anthropologists, psychologists, public health nurses, and pedagogical consultants. From the different professional positions, they work together in formulating cross-sectional initiatives and projects. The everyday leader and coordinator of the centre explains:</p>
<p>“Huge interdisciplinary and managerial synergies are produced by being together in a centre. Why? Because we get to build up a lot of important personal contacts. We are a broad team and that is a big advantage. And we also have a lot practical know-how. It is an interesting environment” [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1403494812449519">29</xref>].</p>
<p>Another network finding is that the municipalities have organized mostly all of the activities in bottom-up-projects of a network kind. Both our interviews and case studies from the municipalities show that health-promotion projects are organized as interdisciplinary projects rooted in several institutions. Several of them also involve parties that do not work for the municipality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1403494812449519">30</xref>].</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-1403494812449519">
<title>Double-sided strategies and involvement</title>
<p>In relation to disease prevention and health promotion targeted at children and adolescents, the municipalities’ strategies prove to be double sided. On the one side the people involved in projects express a wish to work from broad, positive, and pedagogical principles, while on the other side they also realize the importance of operating from a narrower health professional basis and with firm foundation in risk strategic target areas, e.g. reported from the Danish National Board of Health. In this context, it is an important discovery that there are apparent connections between the themes the municipalities give their projects and the statements from, e.g., the National Board of Health [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1403494812449519">5</xref>]. The following quotations show a double focus on wellbeing and certain lifestyle factors: nutrition, smoking, alcohol, and exercise (in Danish the so called KRAM standards). A public health nurses says:</p>
<p>“Generally speaking we do understand health in very broad terms, and it is supposed to be about quality of life, but this does not mean that we forget about KRAM. You see: KRAM is what we are brought up with” [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1403494812449519">29</xref>].</p>
<p>The following two quotations show a negation of the risk factors:</p>
<p>“First and foremost it is about their [the children] well being and self-confidence. Our bench mark is not whether they have lost 10 kilos or not. Rather we rate out success from the feeling that they come and flourish, we can see it when they almost straighten up in their backs” [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1403494812449519">29</xref>].</p>
<p>“… Really, you see a whole lot of professionals that put emphasis to the wrongs that can be done. And I think you should be very careful not to end up like some kind of saviour. Every third kid in sixth grade feels outside the class fellowship. That is more alarming than a lot of other things. So fuck off with KRAM and your 60 minutes exercise a day” [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1403494812449519">29</xref>].</p>
<p>The double-sided orientation of many projects occurs. On the one hand the municipalities closely follow predefined determinants of lifestyle diseases (diet, smoking, alcohol, and exercise) while on the other organizing their projects from a broader perspective, e.g., when it comes to the involvement of children and adolescents. Health professionals in almost all communities say that they take national proclamations into consideration; at the same time many professionals at the same time claim that their projects are based on a broad concept of health. Apparently, the municipalities attempt to work systematically in relation to specific health effort areas, in accordance with national risk statements, but their simultaneous consideration of possible involvement in the projects points toward more open and educational objectives for prevention and health promotion.</p>
<p>The question is: Is the risk- and disease-oriented concept of health on a collision course with the broad and positive?</p>
<p>However, from the interviews it seems that the involvement of the children is often characterized by participation only in the health-related activities, not participation in decision making, objectives, planning, or evaluation. The municipalities often use quite a fixed set-up for the activities with predefined standards for the aims of the specific health-promotion or prevention activities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1403494812449519">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1403494812449519">20</xref>].</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-1403494812449519">
<title>Political expectations – cooperation and evidence</title>
<p>A main finding in our case analysis is that the health efforts directed toward children and adolescents are the subject of massive political expectations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1403494812449519">20</xref>]. Overall, health professionals are aware that political decisions and priorities are an important part of their working conditions. However, when presented with an exceeding amount of expectation, the balance between long- and short-term strategies for prevention and health promotion is affected. Short-term projects and initiatives often meet the immediate expectations, usually set by politicians, for efficiency and measurability, leading to long-term strategies being deprioritized. With short-term planning, there is a risk that the overall effort becomes fragmented and incoherent, causing problems in relation to recruitment, coherence and forward planning. This is why we recommend more long-term planning with a focus on consistency rather than on immediately measurable effects. An additional problem is that a municipality’s overall schedule of activities may appear as an attempt to include all political focal areas, rather than a targeted attempt to address the real problems and risk groups.</p>
<p>On the level of actual interventions, a key issue is related to cooperation between the municipalities’ health professionals and schools. The schools’ core services are education, while health efforts often concentrate on child and adolescent risk behaviour. Cooperation is a major challenge for both parties [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1403494812449519">20</xref>]. Schools are not expected simply to adjust to the municipalities’ overall objectives, requirements, and ideas in the prevention and health-promotion area. Generally, there is widespread understanding for the fact that schools are under pressure by their own core services, and therefore cannot be expected to be available for “external cooperation partners”.</p>
<p>Action based on evidence is a key challenge that, like the above-mentioned priority, is influenced by an element of expectation pressure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1403494812449519">20</xref>]. Many municipalities find it frustrating that they often lose the knowledge that they have produced, because there do not exist any standardized ways to collect and apply experience-based knowledge about prevention and health promotion. Working with evidence implies specific skills that are not always at hand in the municipalities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1403494812449519">20</xref>]. As a result, there is a lack of competence to work evidence based in practice.</p>

<sec id="section12-1403494812449519" sec-type="discussion">
<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The above-reported findings concerning networks, double-sided strategies, involvement/non-involvement, political pressures and expectations, and incorporation between schools and heath professionals provide important insights into the mechanisms of the municipalities’ understanding of and work with heath promotion and prevention.</p>
<p>The link between health and pedagogy is one of the main points. Typically, municipalities are preoccupied with the educational consequences of the projects, but they do not focus to the same extent on developing projects with explicit educational goals, justifications, and content. Health pedagogy is often a matter of retrospective rationalization rather than the starting point of planning. The health/risk behaviour-oriented approach overrides the health educational approach.</p>
<p>The overall impression is that municipalities give high priority to prevention and health promotion directed toward this target group, yet they face a number of challenges at the management, collaboration, and knowledge levels. Operational links between education, health professionalism, and management strategies pose the foremost challenge.</p>
<p>At management level, there are two significant differences between: (a) health professionalism and educational management and (b) strategic and professional management. The level of prioritization of health professional and educational competences varies from municipality to municipality. Furthermore, strategy and professional health pedagogy are prioritized differently, which in turn influences the integration of management skills. The challenge is to ensure that the overall strategic process does not become too polarized or bureaucratic, thus slowing down or complicating the specific health initiatives [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1403494812449519">30</xref>]. The large municipalities in particular have an important task in linking the strategic focus with professional and educational approaches to prevention and health promotion if they want to succeed in establishing a coherent child and adolescent health effort.</p>
<p>At the executive level, a shortage of health pedagogical reflection often becomes apparent when education and wellbeing are construed as reflective parts of the total child and adolescent health programme. This means that pedagogical considerations and decisions become a natural part of the health effort. The opposite is the case when health is considered in a narrow perspective associated with the children’s alleged or actual risk behaviour; the pedagogical reflection on children’s and adolescents’ learning and competence development is lost.</p>

<sec id="section13-1403494812449519" sec-type="conclusions">
<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>The subject of our investigation has been the ways in which municipalities organize prevention and health-promotion efforts for children and adolescents. Our research has confirmed the assumption that the municipalities organize health through different kinds of partner ships, hybrid networks, and more traditional interdisciplinary healthcare networks, while they at the same time incorporate traditional institutions such as kindergartens, schools, and kinder/youth clubs both public and private.</p>
<p>Moreover our research confirms a wide use of projects. Health activities are put in projects that are very often formulated with predefined aims and goals, but are at the same time based on quite open participation forms. We can conclude that an operative link exists between a quite fixed administrative vocabulary of health promotion and an open professional culture and action-based way of understanding at the level of the project activities. In order to strengthen the operative link between administration and operation, we would propose a link between health and education that appears to be influenced by whether the concept of health in question is narrowly or widely defined; which in turn determines whether or not municipalities choose to develop or upgrade the educational qualifications of their staff. It is important for the individual employee to feel sufficiently pedagogically qualified. We recommend that priority be given to the development of pedagogical skills among the staff working with prevention and health promotion targeted at children and adolescents.</p>
<p>Ensuring consistency in the municipal health efforts also calls for an understanding of evidence-based work. This would make the daily work with children and adolescents’ health more effective and it would ensure a clearer image of long-term consequences. It should be clarified which skills are required for evidence-based work. Furthermore, the parties involved should make an effort to qualify the evidentiary basis for their own practices in light of the already existing knowledge about best practices; they should also contribute to new evidence on the subject. This may require external partners, e.g. researchers, who have the required skills to document and carry out evidence-based prevention and health promotion.</p>
<p>The conclusion is that management, health professionalism, and health education must be operationally linked, in order to enable mutual exchange of knowledge, concepts, and understandings. An operational link functions so as to allow internal communicative processes to be influenced by others; however, the decisions that occur as a result of this obviously depend on the self-description of the individual function and its internal communication. First, this means that an inclusive approach to prevention and health promotion must be taken seriously at all three levels: at management level, among health professionals, and among pedagogical staff (teachers and pedagogues). Second, it means that a concrete interdisciplinary, as well as externally directed, collaboration must be established with parties both related to the healthcare field and to pedagogy, taking as its starting point an ambition to support children and adolescents in making decisions and acting in situations that affect their health. Finally, it requires that health promotion and prevention be viewed and organized as learning processes that indicate children’s and adolescents’ development and ability to relate consciously to the new challenges they face.</p>
<p>We wish to point to the necessity of formulating common values and goals that meet the diverse interests and challenges. Operative links indicate cooperative levels which facilitate a creative and innovative effort in prevention and health promotion targeted at children and adolescents – across traditional professional boundaries. In particular, an effort can be made to broaden the horizon, involving alternative participants in municipal prevention and health- promotion work with children’s and adolescents’ health.</p>
