<abstract>
<p>Governmental agencies are important sources of information on the health and well-being of citizens. Recently, improvement in the data collection and reporting of race, ethnicity, social class, and primary language has received considerable attention by national and state governmental bodies in the US as we try to accommodate the social and health needs of an increasingly diverse population. This article draws on the author’s work as a sociologist in a state governmental public health agency to improve the collection and reporting of social data for the purpose of describing health disparities across subpopulation groups and informing equitable health policies. It illustrates how sociologists in governmental agencies can be agents of social change in broad-based collaborative efforts to improve population health and social policy. It describes the context in which a governmental agency is uniquely positioned to be a site of social change.</p>

<title>Résumé</title>
<p>Les agences gouvernementales sont d’importantes sources d’information sur la santé et le bien-être des citoyens. Les améliorations récentes dans la collecte des données et leur enregistrement en matière de race, d’ethnicité, de classe sociale et de langue principale ont fait l’objet d’une attention toute particulière de la part des organismes gouvernementaux américains, au niveau national aussi bien que fédéral. En effet, nous nous efforçons de satisfaire aux besoins sociaux et sanitaires d’une population de plus en plus diverse. Cette communication s’inspire de mon travail en tant que sociologue auprès d’une agence fédérale de santé publique, visant à améliorer la collecte et l’enregistrement des données sociales afin de pouvoir décrire les disparités sanitaires entre les sous-populations, et de mettre au point des politiques sanitaires équitables. Le but est de montrer que les sociologues travaillant auprès des agences gouvernementales peuvent générer le changement social grâce à des efforts collaboratifs de grande envergure afin d’améliorer la santé publique et la politique sociale, et de décrire les contextes qui font d’un agence gouvernementale un espace privilégié de changement social.</p>

<title>Resumen</title>
<p>Las agencias gubernamentales son fuentes importantes de información acerca de la salud y el bienestar de los ciudadanos. Recientemente, la mejora en la recogida y transmisión de datos relativos a la raza, grupo étnico, clase social e idioma primario ha recibido una considerable atención por parte de los organismos gubernamentales a nivel nacional y estatal en los Estados Unidos, a la vez que se intentan acomodar las necesidades sociales y sanitarias de una población cada vez más diversa. Este artículo, se basa en mi trabajo como socióloga en una organización gubernamental estatal de la sanidad pública para mejorar la recogida y transmisión de datos sociales con el fin de describir las disparidades sanitarias encontradas en los grupos de subpoblación e informar sobre las políticas de equidad sanitaria. Se ilustra como los sociólogos de las organizaciones gubernamentales pueden convertirse en los agentes del cambio social mediante esfuerzos colaborativos de amplio espectro con los que mejorar la salud de la población y las políticas sociales. Se describe también el contexto en el que las organizaciones gubernamentales se encuentran en una posición única para convertirse en un lugar para el cambio social.</p>

<p>In recent years, racial and ethnic minority populations have grown considerably in many US states. For example, racial and ethnic minority residents of the state of Connecticut represented about 10% of its overall population in 1980 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0011392111429218">US Census Bureau, 1980</xref>). By 2000, 22% of Connecticut residents belonged to a racial or ethnic minority group; and the 2010 Census estimates that almost 29% of all Connecticut residents belong to a racial or ethnic minority group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0011392111429218">US Census Bureau, 1996</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0011392111429218">2011</xref>). While Connecticut’s (and other states’) growing diversity underscores the importance of accurate and comprehensive information on race, ethnicity, and health in state agency data systems, it also creates new challenges for state data collection systems.</p>
<p>Federal, state, and local governmental agencies are important sources of information on the health and well-being of citizens. Governmental agencies are repositories of historical records of births, marriages, and deaths, and over time, can provide details of the shifting racial, ethnic, and class composition of communities. The US Census Bureau, for example, has collected information on the racial and ethnic composition of citizens since 1790. Every decade these categories have changed, in response to changes in social ideologies and population composition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0011392111429218">Wallman et al., 2000</xref>).</p>
<p>Historically, the federal government has provided important guidance and support to states in the systematic collection of such data; likewise, states have been viewed as laboratories for innovation and models of change in the area of health care reform, health equity, and definitions of marriage and family.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0011392111429218">1</xref></sup> In this article, I first describe federal efforts to improve data collection highlighting the role sociologists have played in advancing social data collection. Next, I describe my efforts as a sociologist within a state public health agency to improve health and social data collection and to build collaborative relationships with academic and other partners for the purpose of advancing health equity. Finally, I outline the components of these efforts that may be informative for other sociologists in practice.</p>

<title>Federal efforts to improve data collection</title>
<p>Recently, improvement in the data collection and reporting of race, ethnicity, social class, and primary language has received considerable attention by research and governmental bodies in the United States (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0011392111429218">IOM, 2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0011392111429218">2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0011392111429218">National Committee on Vital and Health Statistics, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0011392111429218">NRC, 2004</xref>). Widespread concern about racial and ethnic disparities in health has been one of the driving forces for such task forces, as has been the recognition that a National Health Information Infrastructure (NHII) will require the collection and sharing of standardized data across various segments of the public health and health care infrastructure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0011392111429218">Friedman et al., 2002</xref>: xii). Sociologists have been prominent advisors in these national research bodies. The National Academy of Sciences (NAS) is a private, non-profit honorific society of leading scholars in research and engineering established by the US Congress.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0011392111429218">2</xref></sup> NAS, through its research arm, the National Research Council (NRC), and its health arm, the Institute of Medicine (IOM), provides advice on science policy and technical issues that influence the health, education, and well-being of the American people (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0011392111429218">IOM, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0011392111429218">NAS, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0011392111429218">NRC, 2009</xref>). Members of the NAS have included distinguished sociologists such as Mary Waters, James House, Lawrence Bobo, Robert Putnam, Alejandro Portes, Douglas Massey, Stanley Lieberson, Neil Smelser, and Harrison White (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0011392111429218">NAS, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>NAS provides guidance to the US Office of Management and Budget (OMB), the federal agency tasked with elaborating a system of data collection and use that provides uniformity and comparability across federal agencies. The OMB has laid out a minimum standard for the collection and presentation of data on race and ethnicity. The development of the current standard took place in the 1970s in response to the need for comparable data to monitor civil rights as required by the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the Voting Rights Act, and Public Law 94-311 that required federal agencies to report separate counts of the Hispanic population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0011392111429218">Wallman et al., 2000</xref>). This standard, OMB Statistical Policy Directive No. 15, was published in 1977, and later revised in 1997 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0011392111429218">OMB, 1995 [1977]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0011392111429218">1997</xref>). The 1997 standard, Revisions to the Standards for the Classification of Federal Data on Race and Ethnicity, was developed in recognition of the nation’s increasing diversity and the federal government’s continuing need to monitor conditions of minority group populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0011392111429218">OMB, 1997</xref>).</p>
<p>Sociologists played a central role in early discussions regarding possible revision of the 1977 standards. At the beginning of the period for public input (1993), the OMB requested that the NAS Committee on National Statistics (CNSTAT) convene a group ‘to articulate issues surrounding a review of the categories’ that included representatives of federal agencies, academia, social science research institutions, interest groups, and private industry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0011392111429218">OMB, 1997</xref>). A two-day workshop took place in February 1994, and it addressed substantive, methodological, and research issues surrounding revisions to the standard (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0011392111429218">OMB, 1997</xref>). Karl Taeuber, Professor of Sociology at the University of Wisconsin at Madison, chaired this workshop, and other leading sociologists were workshop participants, including David Williams, Robert Hauser, Sharon Lee, Clara Rodriguez, and Mary Waters. This eminent group has been known for their work on African American poverty and racial segregation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0011392111429218">Taeuber and Fielding, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0011392111429218">Williams and Collins, 1995</xref>); racial and ethnic identity and immigrant assimilation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0011392111429218">Lee and Boyd, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0011392111429218">Rodriguez, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0011392111429218">Waters, 1999</xref>); and trends in health and aging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0011392111429218">Sewell et al., 2004</xref>). This group articulated the substantive, methodological, and research issues, but it did not make specific recommendations regarding racial and ethnic categories to be included in the federal standard. The summary of this workshop is published as <italic>Spotlight on Heterogeneity: The Federal Standards for Racial and Ethnic Classification</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0011392111429218">Committee on National Statistics, National Research Council, 1996</xref>).</p>

<title>Why federal standards are important</title>
<p>Recommendations from this group of scholars informed the current federal guidelines for the collection of race and ethnicity data, established in 1997. This current federal (OMB) standard identifies five racial groups (American Indian or Alaska Native, Asian, black or African American, Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander, white) with the possibility of selecting more than one race group; as well as two ethnicities (Hispanic or Latino, not Hispanic or Latino) for enumeration. The OMB emphasizes that self-report is the preferred method of data collection. It also notes that race and ethnicity ‘are social-political constructs and should not be interpreted as being scientific or anthropological in nature’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0011392111429218">OMB, 1997</xref>: 58788). While it is commonly recognized in public health and social science literature that race and ethnicity are not meaningful biological markers, it is also recognized that they are important social and political markers of the distribution of power and wealth in our society, discrimination, personal and social identity, and group solidarity. For this reason, race and ethnicity are considered salient factors to consider in measuring population health and well-being, and, therefore, important variables to continue collecting in public health and vital statistics data systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0011392111429218">NRC, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0011392111429218">Stratton et al., 2007b</xref>).</p>
<p>The federal OMB directive provides a <italic>minimum</italic> standard for the collection of uniform and comparable data by federal agencies. Additional categories (such as expanded race and ethnicity groupings) are supported so long as they can be collapsed into the minimum categories. This standard ensures a common language to reflect the increased diversity of the US population, and to monitor compliance with civil rights laws. The 1997 standard was to take effect immediately for all new record keeping and reporting. All federal programs were directed to adopt the revised policy on race and ethnicity categorization by 1 January 2003 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0011392111429218">OMB, 1997</xref>: 58786).</p>
<p>Although these federal guidelines for data collection have existed now for more than a decade and have been adopted by lead federal agencies like the US Census Bureau and the National Center for Health Statistics, still some federal data systems (e.g. several housed at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC]) do not enforce these standards at the federal or state level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0011392111429218">Nepaul et al., 2007</xref>: 40).</p>
<p>Standardization of data on racial and ethnic health disparities is important for several reasons. First, race and ethnicity categories hold social and symbolic meanings that influence our perceptions and lived realities. The federal OMB categories provide a common language for national, state, and local health agencies; they improve comparability of race and ethnicity across public health data sets; and they provide an opportunity to address current racial and ethnic disparities across health indicators that a non-standardized system may not (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0011392111429218">Nepaul et al., 2007</xref>: 16–17). In its report, <italic>Race, Ethnicity, and Language Data: Standardization for Health Care Quality Improvement</italic>, the IOM states that: ‘Sharing and comparing data across systems calls for a common vocabulary to avoid omission of categories that might be critical to monitoring disparities and to allow mapping of categories from one system to another’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0011392111429218">IOM, 2009</xref>: 19).</p>
<p>It is worth noting that, within the social sciences today, there are important conversations being had and issues being articulated about the changing nature of racial-ethnic identity in North America (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0011392111429218">Kretsedemas, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0011392111429218">McKinley and Asencio, 2011</xref>). Kretsedemas, for example, notes that ‘immigrant experiences contest and complicate the process of black racialization’ and that the ‘racialization of Latino populations’ is redefining whiteness (2008: 826). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0011392111429218">McKinley and Asencio (2011)</xref> as well as others note that an individual’s experience of multiple oppressions within a particular social context may determine which identity becomes most salient, either made prominent or silenced in a given situation. As scholars and practitioners, we recognize the complexity and shifting sands of human identity, but yet we also recognize the value of capturing racial-ethnic identification in federal and state data collection systems.</p>

<title>State efforts – Connecticut</title>
<sec id="section4-0011392111429218">
<title>Background</title>
<p>In this section, I describe the efforts of one state agency to improve its data collection and reporting for the purpose of addressing health (and social) inequalities and, importantly, the role of sociology in informing these efforts. The Connecticut Health Disparities Project was a two-year project (2006–2008) of the Connecticut Department of Public Health supported by funding from the Connecticut Health Foundation, the largest philanthropic organization in the state. As a medical sociologist working in a state public health agency, I wrote the grant that funded this project; and later I became the project director, who oversaw all aspects of the grant. Funding from this private, non-profit organization enabled my state agency to support two full-time staff positions for the project (in addition to my state-funded position), host state partner meetings, and publish a series of reports and issue briefs.</p>
<p>As a sociologist in public health, I was well positioned with this grant funding to integrate social constructivist concepts, ideas, and understandings into our work as a state public health agency in addressing health disparities in our state. As a field of practice, public health has long been influenced by ideas and constructs from the fields of medicine as well as the biological, behavioral, and social sciences. Throughout its long history, public health has been influenced by each of these disciplines; at times, it has tended toward more biological and behavioral explanations for observed population health differences; and at other times it has tended toward more social structural explanations. In recent years, public health discourses have been deeply influenced by the work of sociologists, like <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0011392111429218">Link and Phelan (1995)</xref>, who have examined the underlying, social structural or ‘fundamental’ causes of disease, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0011392111429218">Williams and Collins (1995</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0011392111429218">2001)</xref>, who have examined the patterns of socioeconomic and racial differences in health and racial residential segregation. While these concepts are well known in the sociological literature, they have not been consistently integrated into public health practice.</p>
<p>The goal of the Connecticut Health Disparities Project was to improve the statewide infrastructure for documenting, reporting, and addressing health disparities in Connecticut. As the project director along with my team, I aimed to shape state public health agency policy regarding health and social data collection and to inform the practice of public health by defining key terms such as ‘health disparity,’ and ‘race and ethnicity,’ by elaborating the relationship between social factors and population health, and by issuing a comprehensive report on disparities in health and health care access within the state of Connecticut. The project also sought to build collaborative statewide working relationships and thereby to shape meaningful discourse through a network of researchers, policy analysts, and data managers focused on the measurement and reporting of health disparities. As part of these community-building efforts, my project staff and I also developed relationships across sections and programs of our agency to track and report health disparities as well as collaborative learning projects focused on the social determinants of health.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0011392111429218">
<title>The significance of health disparities in public health</title>
<p>Public health surveillance in the US has long demonstrated that racial and ethnic minority populations tend to have poorer health and quality of life and less access to medical care than the white, majority population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0011392111429218">US Department of Health and Human Services, 1985</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0011392111429218">1990</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0011392111429218">2000</xref>). The persistence of such disparities over time has been a concern of both the federal and state governments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0011392111429218">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0011392111429218">Hynes et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0011392111429218">Stratton et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0011392111429218">Truman et al., 2011</xref>). While it is widely recognized that race and ethnicity data by themselves are insufficient to understand and characterize health disparities, it is a fact that such data are more commonly collected in US public health databases than, for example, socioeconomic position as measured by education, income, or poverty level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0011392111429218">Krieger et al., 2005</xref>). Both the US medical and public health research literature are more likely to analyze and report health differences by racial/ethnic subgroups rather than by socioeconomic subgroups. This fact has also resulted in an unfortunate tendency of the research literature to explain and thereby reify the constructs of race and ethnicity as inherent, biological characteristics of a given population group rather than as fluid constructs based on social identity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0011392111429218">Williams, 1994</xref>).</p>
<p>Nonetheless, many researchers and policy analysts understand that social structural factors like living and working environments are important, underlying or ‘fundamental’ causes of health disparities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0011392111429218">Link and Phelan, 1995</xref>), and substantial efforts are now underway to overcome the absence of socioeconomic data in US public health databases through enhanced use of area-based socioeconomic measures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0011392111429218">IOM, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0011392111429218">Krieger et al., 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>As a first step in the Connecticut Health Disparities Project, my staff and I sought to develop a working definition of health disparities for the state Department of Public Health (DPH). This definition was developed in conversation with agency staff, was adopted in 2007 by our agency, and later published in the form of an issue brief <italic>Defining Health Disparities</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0011392111429218">Stratton et al., 2007a</xref>). After reviewing definitions developed by the federal government, we determined that it was important to consider and name the particular disparity populations in our state; and while we acknowledged that it might not be appropriate or possible to provide detailed analyses of each priority population, we nevertheless considered it important to recognize these subgroups as priority populations for public health surveillance. As a sociologist, I was particularly interested in addressing disparities using a sociological lens. Consequently, we established the following definition:</p>
<p><disp-quote><p>Health disparities refer to the differences in disease risk, incidence, prevalence, morbidity, and mortality and other adverse conditions, such as unequal access to quality health care, that exist among specific population groups in Connecticut. Population groups may be based on race, ethnicity, age, gender, socioeconomic position, immigrant status, sexual minority status, language, disability, homelessness, and geographic area of residence. Specifically, health disparities refer to those avoidable differences in health that result from cumulative social disadvantage. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0011392111429218">Stratton et al., 2007a</xref>)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>Currently, many state public health agencies do not collect sufficient information regarding citizens’ socioeconomic status, immigrant status, sexual minority status, language, disability, and homelessness; yet going forward, these are salient characteristics by which to document and describe a population’s health. The sociological concept ‘cumulative social disadvantage’ is an important one for public health practice in that it connotes the burdens of an individual’s and/or group’s inability to access social resources over time; and it acknowledges the effects of an accumulation of disadvantages over the life course on health (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0011392111429218">Dannefer, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0011392111429218">Ferraro and Kelley-Moore, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0011392111429218">Ferraro et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0011392111429218">Ross and Wu, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0011392111429218">Wadsworth, 1997</xref>). As project director, I was in a position to integrate these ideas into public health practice and policy.</p>
<p>A second issue brief of the project, <italic>Race and Ethnicity Matters: Concepts and Challenges of Racial and Ethnic Classifications in Public Health</italic>, examined the concepts of race and ethnicity, their meanings, and their use in public health (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0011392111429218">Stratton et al., 2007b</xref>). As stated previously, medical and public health research literature routinely relies on classifications of race and ethnicity to ‘explain’ differences in health outcomes, and as such, very often treats race and ethnicity as inherent, biological characteristics of individuals that, by themselves, account for observed population differences. Although it is well understood within sociology and the social sciences that underlying social and economic factors influence health outcomes in myriad ways, administrative and research databases too infrequently collect detailed socioeconomic information on individuals, such as household income, wealth, and occupation. The emphasis on race and ethnicity in medical and health data systems and lack of emphasis on socioeconomic factors tend to obscure health differences resulting from economic inequality while overemphasizing the importance of race and ethnicity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0011392111429218">Stratton et al., 2007b</xref>). Our agency, like many other agencies, sees a continued importance in the collection of race and ethnicity in public health data systems because these constructs illuminate the context of health inequalities; however, we are in a position to further social structural explanations by also improving the collection of socioeconomic information in our public health databases.</p>
<p>Lastly, in the second and final year of the project, we published a comprehensive state health disparities report, which included information on 63 key social, economic, and health indicators for Connecticut residents. The audience for this document – <italic>The 2009 Connecticut Health Disparities Report</italic> – included health care advocates, community-based agencies and activists, legislators, health care policy experts, research analysts, and academic audiences. In addition to providing comparative health information by race and ethnicity, it examined the underlying social and economic factors contributing to inequalities in people’s health outcomes. The fundamental premise of <italic>The 2009 Connecticut Health Disparities Report</italic> is a sociological observation; namely, that the health of an individual is inextricably linked to the community and social environment in which she or he lives (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0011392111429218">Stratton et al., 2009</xref>). Over 4000 copies of this report have been distributed mostly to partners in our state, and in the first year following its publication, I conducted 15 public presentations on its findings, mostly to academic and community audiences. A 2011 national report, <italic>State Documentation of Racial and Ethnic Health Disparities to Inform Strategic Action</italic>, released by the National Academy for State Health Policy, identifies Connecticut as a model state in the breadth and depth of its reporting on health disparities based on the content of <italic>The 2009 Connecticut Health Disparities Report</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0011392111429218">Hanlon et al., 2011</xref>).</p>

<title>Evaluating data collection</title>
<p>Another important step in the Connecticut Health Disparities Project was to undertake a systematic assessment of how information is collected and reported in our agency databases that collect individual-level health information. Databases were identified by reviewing previous capacity assessments and through correspondence and meetings with agency branch and section chiefs. Database focus areas ranged from vital statistics to infectious diseases and cancer. These agency stakeholders were important to the identification of databases and distribution and completion of the surveys. Our project staff met with these stakeholders formally and informally, used email to distribute the surveys and keep them updated on the progress of the assessment, and worked to make sure that all participants participated in the assessment process. We established collaborative relationships for this project throughout the agency.</p>
<p>We supplemented this database survey with qualitative data, using formal and informal conversations, staff feedback on the drafts of the questionnaire, facilitated group discussions, and email correspondence to develop a thorough and complete picture of DPH data collection efforts. Our database report, <italic>The Collection of Race, Ethnicity, and Other Sociodemographic Data in Connecticut Department of Public Health Databases</italic>, was published in the second year of the project (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0011392111429218">Nepaul et al., 2007</xref>). Findings showed that while about one-half of our agency databases were federally funded, fewer than 20% complied with race and ethnicity classifications described in the 1997 federal OMB standard. It is also interesting to note that many of the ‘non-OMB compliant’ agency databases were federally funded and were using the ‘non-OMB compliant’ race and ethnicity categories provided to them by another federal agency, the CDC. Databases rarely collected information on socioeconomic position, language, and acculturation. Although many databases collected residential address information, most did not use geocoding to characterize area of residence by US census tract or block group.</p>
<p>An important part of our survey addressed agency data collection and reporting related to race and ethnicity, and how it compared with current federal standards. We asked study participants to identify barriers to changing current state health data collection practices. There were many important issues identified, including incomplete reporting of information on data collection forms, and the fact that much public health data are collected in hospitals and other clinical settings where accurate sociodemographic information is seen as less important than clinical information. Many departmental programs are federally funded and must generate reports to funders in a prespecified format. An important finding of this database project is that within the federal agencies that should be in compliance with the current federal OMB standards, some programs use the standards and others do not (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0011392111429218">Nepaul et al., 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>One recommendation of this report was to create and implement a DPH Data Collection and Use Policy to standardize the collection and reporting of sociodemographic data across the organization; and during the second year of the project, our staff developed the first agency policy for the collection of sociodemographic data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0011392111429218">Connecticut Department of Public Health, 2008</xref>). The policy document was reviewed by over 50 people from all levels of the agency. Our partners throughout the state also had the opportunity to review and comment on the data collection policy during a special comment period. Reviewer feedback, when appropriate, was incorporated. The review process was successful in generating discussion throughout the agency. The policy was established in 2008 (two years after the project began), and implementation of the data policy was set for 2012 (four years following establishment of the policy) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0011392111429218">Connecticut Department of Public Health, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>Key elements of this data policy, <italic>Connecticut Department of Public Health Policy on Collecting Sociodemographic Data</italic> (2008), include the requirement that agency databases would collect at least the data elements specified in the minimum federal OMB standard, including race with the option of choosing more than one race, and ethnicity, which should precede the race question. Some programs might decide that they need additional sociodemographic information beyond that specified by the minimum standard. For this reason, we established an <italic>ideal</italic> standard that specifies the additional data elements programs can use to capture information on the social determinants of health. For example, expanded Asian and Hispanic or Latino ethnicity categories might be relevant to some programs’ needs since these are the two fastest growing minority groups in our state. Asians, in Connecticut, include such diverse populations as Chinese, Taiwanese, Asian Indian, and Vietnamese. Hispanics or Latinos in our state include distinct subgroups such as Puerto Ricans, Mexicans, Dominicans, Peruvians, and Ecuadorians.</p>
<p>Other data elements required as part of the minimum DPH data policy standard include age (date of birth and date of event recorded) of the individual, which is an important and crucial correlate of any health outcome, and an expanded gender category that includes not only male and female, but an ‘other, specify’ open-ended category. While all agency databases collected some form of age information, the vast majority of our agency databases allowed for only two (male, female) options within the sex/gender category. We applied a critical sociological lens by which to view sex and gender options in state administrative databases. We recognized that an open-ended ‘other, specify’ option would allow for the possibility of ‘intersexual,’ for example, on the birth record, or a variety of other options such as ‘trans-sexual,’ ‘transgender,’ and other variations in our infectious and chronic disease databases that would more accurately reflect the gender identities of our citizens. As an agency we recognize that such additional sex/gender options are not only important for the historical documentation of our state citizenry but also for the purposes of policy and program development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0011392111429218">Connecticut Department of Public Health, 2008</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-0011392111429218">
<title>Collaborative community-building efforts</title>
<p>As part of our efforts to build dynamic and long-term collaborative relationships, I created and organized an academic advisory group for the project, which was comprised of faculty from three leading state institutions – Southern Connecticut State University, University of Connecticut, and Yale University. These advisors provided important guidance to this project, and they represented the disciplines of: anthropology; biostatistics; epidemiology; geography; nutrition; public health; social work; sociology; and African American, Asian American, Latina/o, family, and gender studies. Our academic collaborators included various schools, programs, and departments within our state university system. The multidisciplinary perspectives of this group of health and social scientists enabled us to examine and discuss at length the relevance of social constructs and social variables on population health. We met as a group once during the two-year project to discuss salient issues in the collection of race, ethnicity, and other sociodemographic data in our state agency databases, such as inconsistencies in data collected across databases, changing definitions, and missing information; the social and political constructs underlying such data collection; and the appropriateness of current public health data collection and reporting efforts.</p>
<p>Members of our advisory group also participated in three statewide meetings organized over a two-year period by our project as panelists, presenters, and keynote speakers regarding issues such as the use of race and ethnicity in data collection and reporting, developing coherent data collection policies, and the use of geocoding in surveillance of health disparities (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0011392111429218">Taylor, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0011392111429218">Vias, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>Our first two statewide meetings included approximately 80 participants each from more than 30 state agencies; the first meeting focused on our data enhancement efforts, the database survey and its recommendations, and our second state meeting focused on the data policy and its developmental process. The objective of these meetings was to share our data collection and policy efforts with state agency partners in an effort to shape the discourse regarding sociodemographic data collection across state agencies. Recordings of the first meeting were broadcast statewide via public access television. Our third and final meeting drew more than 60 attendees from both state and community-based agencies. Presentations at this meeting demonstrated the use of census data, geographic information systems (GIS), and geocoding to enhance surveillance of health inequalities in the context of residential neighborhoods or place.</p>
<p>As project director, I participated as a guest speaker regarding the social significance of health disparities in college and university courses of our academic partners. I also participated as a member of the national advisory board for the Center for Eliminating Health Disparities Among Latinos (CEHDL) – a National Institutes of Health (NIH) funded center that is a collaborative effort of the University of Connecticut (and since 2010, Yale University), Hartford Hospital, and the Hispanic Health Council (Hartford, Connecticut). Our project and state agency staff participated in the CEHDL’s annual health disparities conferences, and as a conference presenter I discussed the collaboration of the DPH and CEHDL and how we applied the social ideals of health equity through programs and projects that promote public health (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0011392111429218">Hynes, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>Another important collaboration of this project was a subcontract I developed with the University of Connecticut (UConn) Geography Department, known as the ‘UConn – DPH Geocoding Collaborative.’ Two professors and two graduate students worked with our DPH epidemiology staff to geocode 20 years of Connecticut mortality data, which would enable a geographical analysis of mortality in our state, for example, by poverty level. Improving our agency’s ability to analyze health data by residential address added one more dimension to a social structural perspective on public health data. It should be noted that the impact of residential segregation on health has been well articulated by sociologists like <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0011392111429218">David Williams and Chiquita Collins (2001)</xref>. In addition, the UConn – DPH team developed a protocol for geocoding data, which could be used by other staff in the agency as they geocoded their respective health data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0011392111429218">Hayward et al., 2008a</xref>). Other collaborative projects of this team included a literature review of the geography of health disparities, which was published as a monograph, <italic>The Spatial Context of Health Disparities</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0011392111429218">Hayward et al., 2008b</xref>). Our project also hosted three presentations by UConn faculty and graduate students for our agency staff describing the applications of GIS in neighborhood environments to examine patterns of asthma and spatial analyses of mortality. UConn graduate students also provided technical assistance to our agency epidemiologists on mapping immunization rates in urban neighborhoods, and one UConn professor obtained internal university grant funding to examine the relationship of statewide mortality to local poverty area of residence (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0011392111429218">Vias, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>As part of our effort to build collaborative partnerships, we also developed working relationships with other Connecticut state agencies. We established an email network of state agency analysts, and had numerous correspondences regarding our respective agency efforts to improve collection of race, ethnicity, and sociodemographic information. Within our own agency, we established working relationships with all branches related to data improvement; and we developed a monthly email newsletter featuring a paper of the month on some health disparity research topic or social construct.</p>
<p>Following conclusion of the grant-funded project in 2008, we have continued efforts to monitor agency data collection. In 2010, we published a compendium of agency databases with detailed information on sociodemographic and other data elements collected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0011392111429218">Connecticut Department of Public Health, 2010</xref>), and we are currently conducting a follow-up survey of agency databases to determine the extent of adherence to the 2008 data collection policy. While implementation of the agency data policy is not yet complete, during 2011 we continued to work toward its implementation.</p>
<p>As part of an effort to increase agency knowledge and understanding of the social determinants of health, in 2009 I developed two staff training courses using a film and discussion format for two film series produced by California Newsreel – <italic>Race: The Power of An Illusion</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0011392111429218">2003</xref>) and <italic>Unnatural Causes: Is Inequality Making Us Sick?</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0011392111429218">2008</xref>). Both courses have been taught for two consecutive years with continuing education credits offered to interested staff. Course evaluations indicate that the film and discussion series have provided a powerful learning experience and forum for expanded discussions of the social influences on health. As part of the evaluations for these courses, I have held small group discussions to examine what worked, what did not work, and how these films and discussions have engaged agency staff and influenced conversations regarding the social constructs of race and ethnicity and the social determinants of health. We have two academic advisors for each of these courses (representing the disciplines of sociology; public health; and African American, Latino, and family studies), and they have participated in the annual evaluation and planning meetings and offered valuable suggestions. As an agency, we have also purchased ‘streaming rights’ from California Newsreel and posted these film series on our virtual training site, TRAIN Connecticut (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://ct.train.org/">ct.train.org/</ext-link>), which made both series accessible to community groups; and we have sent announcements to our state partners regarding the availability of these series on demand.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-0011392111429218">
<title>Moving forward – looking ahead</title>
<p>While the two-year funded project has concluded, our state agency has continued efforts to improve its data collection on race, ethnicity, gender, and other sociodemographic variables that influence health outcomes; and we continue to work with agency staff to implement data collection standards set by the agency policy. Our issue briefs defining health disparities and exploring the social constructs of race and ethnicity and gender, as well as a comprehensive agency report on health disparities have set a standard for meaningful conversation about and response to continuing health inequalities in our state. Since the project ended, we have successfully launched a staff training series on the social determinants of health and the meaning and use of the constructs of race and ethnicity in our agency work. Projects with our state collaborators and academic advisors continue in both the development of our agency’s geographic information systems capacity and in an advisory role to our staff training courses in the social determinants of health. Also, our agency has been a co-sponsor with the UConn School of Social Work and others of a 2011 one-day conference, Health and Human Rights in Connecticut: Building an Equitable Health Care System, which brings a human rights lens and perspective on the health care debate in our state. Through these activities we have tried to shape meaningful policy, practice, and pedagogy as well as collaborative, community-building efforts in our state to address health inequalities.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>This case study explores the role of sociology and sociologists in framing the public discourse regarding the relationship of race, ethnicity, and other social factors on health. It also highlights the contribution of sociology to everyday practice in a government agency. Sociologists who have chosen to work in governmental and other types of agencies can incorporate the more theoretical elements of sociology to everyday practices, such as in the gathering and interpretation of social data. Such improvements in data collection and reporting provide a foundation for social change that can lead to greater health and/or social equity.</p>
<p>There are several key components of this effort to effect social change within a state agency: first, the application of a sociological lens on our agency data collection efforts through a systematic and thorough assessment of agency databases, followed by the development of an agency data policy for collecting important social variables (with a timetable for implementation); second, development of staff training materials and film and discussion courses related to the social determinants of health and the importance of social data collection to accurate measurement and reporting of health disparities; third, identifying and working with allies both inside and outside of the agency in order to cultivate long-term partnerships that tackle various aspects of health inequalities and disparities in our state; and finally, the production of a variety of products, such as reports, issue briefs, training programs, and meetings/conferences that are useful to state partners and the public in their efforts to address health disparities.</p>
<p>There are several other less tangible elements that, I believe, have added to the effectiveness of our agency efforts to be a site of social change in the context of persisting health inequalities in our state. First, powerful social ideas inspire our human efforts. Ideas such as health equity and health as a fundamental human right are inspirational rallying points for citizens at large and workers in public health in particular. It is my belief that these powerful social ideas inspired so many of us engaged in this collaboration to work hard on the project objectives. Second, external funding helps to support these efforts. The external funds provided by a non-profit philanthropic foundation helped push a social change agenda that might have been lost in the day-to-day work of a state public health agency. Third, collaboration (both internal and external) with clear objectives enriches working relationships. Efforts to engage and connect with academic, state agency, and community partners enhanced the project’s accomplishments.</p>
<p>While immediate efforts of the Connecticut Health Disparities Project focused on the improvement of data collection systems to accurately monitor and track health disparities and the development of statewide collaborative networks, our long-term agency goal has been to promote a vision of health equity for all citizens of Connecticut in collaboration with our statewide partners. These collaborations continue in the form of new projects and partnerships.
