<sec id="section1-0363546513479016">
<title>Background:</title>
<p>Symptomatic medial collateral ligament (MCL) instability is rare, and it is frequently associated with multiligament injuries. Most clinical investigations have failed to clearly define the specific objective outcome measures assessing the stability of the MCL quantitatively before and after the reconstruction procedure.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-0363546513479016">
<title>Purpose:</title>
<p>To quantitatively evaluate the early clinical outcomes of patients with valgus instability of knee joints who had undergone superficial MCL reconstruction using Achilles tendon allografts.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0363546513479016">
<title>Study Design:</title>
<p>Case series; Level of evidence, 4.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0363546513479016">
<title>Methods:</title>
<p>From August 2005 to December 2010, 19 consecutive patients with MCL injuries were included in this study. The inclusion criteria were (1) a subacute or chronic MCL injury, with a time from initial injury to surgery of longer than 3 weeks, and (2) valgus laxity graded C or D according to the International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC). All patients underwent superficial MCL reconstruction using Achilles tendon allografts. To evaluate the laxity of the MCL preoperatively and postoperatively, valgus stress radiographs using a Telos device were used. Other assessments included the IKDC subjective functional evaluation and Lysholm score estimation.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0363546513479016">
<title>Results:</title>
<p>Sixteen of the 19 patients (12 men and 4 women) were available for final follow-up. The median age of the patients was 37 years (range, 19-53 years); mean body mass index (BMI) was 26.4 (range, 21.7-29.4). The mean time from injury to surgery was 15.9 months (range, 24 days to 84 months), and median follow-up period was 34 months (range, 24-67 months). The mean medial knee laxity (side-to-side difference) was 8.9 ± 3.2 mm (range, 6-15.9 mm) preoperatively and 1.1 ± 0.9 mm (range, –1.1 to 3.2 mm) postoperatively (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .001). The preoperative mean IKDC subjective knee functional score was 49.8 ± 6.9 (range, 31-57.5), while the postoperative functional score was 84.3 ± 6.0 (range, 71.3-93.1) (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .001). The mean Lysholm score was 69.3 ± 5.9 (range, 55-78) preoperatively and 88.6 ± 5.0 (range, 75-95) postoperatively (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .001). There was no significant correlation between patients’ BMI and the final clinical outcome scores (<italic>P</italic> = .311).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0363546513479016">
<title>Conclusion:</title>
<p>In a small set of patients with multiligament-injured knees, valgus laxity can be effectively restored through surgical management with superficial MCL reconstruction, when the other associated ligament injuries are reconstructed as well. The subjective functional results were significantly improved postoperatively at short-term follow-up.</p>

<p>The medial collateral ligament (MCL) is one of the most commonly damaged ligamentous structures of the knee joints.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0363546513479016">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0363546513479016">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0363546513479016">22</xref></sup> Most MCL injury cases (Hughston grade<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0363546513479016">14</xref></sup> I or II) can be treated nonoperatively, leading to satisfactory clinical outcomes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0363546513479016">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0363546513479016">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0363546513479016">18</xref></sup> Surgical treatment of MCL injuries has been proposed for severe valgus laxity (Hughston grade III) with associated ligament injuries or chronic cases.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0363546513479016">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0363546513479016">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0363546513479016">30</xref></sup> The principles of surgical management include repair and reconstruction techniques.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0363546513479016">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0363546513479016">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0363546513479016">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0363546513479016">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0363546513479016">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0363546513479016">31</xref></sup> Reconstruction techniques have only addressed the superficial medial collateral ligament (sMCL) or in combination with the posteromedial structures, such as the posterior oblique ligament (POL) and the posteromedial capsule.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0363546513479016">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0363546513479016">20</xref></sup> Semi-tendinosus autografts or allografts and Achilles allografts can be used for reconstructions.</p>

<p>In this study, we quantitatively analyzed the outcomes of sMCL reconstruction after taking into consideration the multiligament knee injuries. Our hypothesis was that the valgus laxity of the knee could be effectively restored with surgical management with sMCL reconstruction. Also, the subjective functional results could be significantly improved at early-stage follow-up postoperatively.</p>

<title>Patients</title>
<p>In the period between August 2005 and December 2010, we saw 19 consecutive cases confirmed with symptomatic MCL injuries. For each patient, the sMCL reconstruction procedure was performed using Achilles tendon allografts. Among the 19 patients, 3 of them did not continue to the follow-up. As a result, 16 patients had final follow-ups (84.2%). The study design was approved by the institutional review board of our hospital (Beijing Jishuitan Hospital). Informed consent was obtained from each patient enrolled in this study.</p>
<p>The inclusion criteria of this study were (1) a subacute or chronic MCL injury, with a time from initial injury to surgery of more than 3 weeks, and (2) International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) valgus laxity grade C (6- to 10-mm medial joint space width at 20° of knee flexion) or D (&gt;10-mm opening, side-to-side difference) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0363546513479016">Figure 1</xref>).</p>

<p>Valgus stress radiographs. (A) In the right knee, preoperatively, the medial joint space width was calculated as 22.6 mm at 20° of knee flexion. (B) In the left knee, in the same patient, the medial joint space width was calculated as 6.7 mm. The result of the valgus stress radiograph revealed a 15.9-mm side-to-side difference in the medial joint space width, indicating that the medial instability of the knee was grade D according to the International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC). (C) In the right knee, postoperatively, in the same patient, the medial joint space width was calculated as 9.5 mm. (D) In the left knee, the medial joint space width was 7.9 mm. The postoperative medial instability of the knee was grade A according to the IKDC.</p>

<p>Among the 16 patients included in this study, there were 12 men and 4 women. The median age was 37 years (range, 19-53 years), and mean body mass index (BMI) was 26.4 (range, 21.7-29.4) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0363546513479016">Table 1</xref>). The mean time from injury to surgery was 15.9 months (range, 24 days to 84 months), whereas the median follow-up period was 34 months (range, 24-67 months). Four patients with fewer than 1.5 months’ time between the injury to surgery, diagnosed as subacute cases, received nonoperative treatment initially. Surgical treatment was performed if the valgus instability of the knee joint for each patient was severe and symptomatic after more than 3 weeks.</p>

<p>For the combined injuries, 12 (75%) of the 16 patients had posterior cruciate ligament (PCL) injuries. Five patients (31.3%) had anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injuries, while 7 patients (43.8%) had posterolateral complex (PLC) injuries. Ligament reconstruction or repair surgeries were performed on each of the injured structures. Combined meniscal tears were observed in 4 knees, for which partial meniscectomy procedures were performed. Two patients presented with patellar dislocations, 1 patient received nonoperative treatment, while another underwent a medial patellar ligament reconstruction procedure.</p>
<p>Of the 16 patients, 12 were admitted into our sports medicine service and confirmed as having severe valgus instability of the knee joints, including 4 patients with failure of nonoperative treatment for at least 3 weeks after the initial acute MCL injury and who received sMCL reconstruction. Another 4 patients were referred to our department from other hospitals and were confirmed as having severely chronic valgus instability.</p>

<title>Surgical Technique</title>
<p>The reconstruction or repair procedures for the ACL, PCL, and PLC injuries were performed first, which have been well described in the published literature.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0363546513479016">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0363546513479016">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0363546513479016">16</xref></sup> Other structural injuries, such as meniscal tears and chondral lesions, were treated simultaneously.</p>
<p>For each sMCL reconstruction, a cryopreserved Achilles allograft was used. The medial epicondyle was identified through a longitudinal incision, which was distal and anterior to the adductor tubercle. Then, the attachment site of the sMCL was identified, which was slightly proximal and anterior to this location. At this point, an eyelet passing pin was drilled transversely across the femur. Another longitudinal incision was made medially to the tibial tubercle. The distal tibial attachment of the sMCL was identified deep within the pes anserine bursa. A Kirschner wire was drilled through the center of the distal attachment site. A subcutaneous tunnel was created between the femoral and tibial attachments of the sMCL. An isometry test was performed with a suture looped over the passing pin at the femoral site and the Kirschner wire at the tibial site. A bone tunnel was drilled at the femoral attachment according to the measured diameter of the bone plug of the Achilles allograft. The bone plug was passed into the femoral tunnel and fixed with a bioabsorbable interference bone fixation screw (Linvatec Inc, Largo, Florida). Then, the allograft was passed under the fascia of the subcutaneous tunnel to the tibial attachment and was fixed at the center of this location with a 4.5-mm cortical screw and a 17-mm spiked washer (Linvatec Inc).</p>

<title>Objective Assessment</title>
<p>Stress radiographs were used for the quantitative assessment of the medial stability of the knee joints both preoperatively and postoperatively. The knee was kept in 20° of flexion, and a Telos device (Telos GmbH, Marburg, Germany) was used for the valgus stress radiograph (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0363546513479016">Figure 1</xref>); 150 N of stress was applied. The medial joint space width was calculated on both the affected knee and the uninjured knee. The side-to-side difference indicated the valgus laxity of the knee. Medial stability was classified according to the IKDC as (1) normal: medial joint space width (20° of knee flexion, valgus, side-to-side difference) of 0 to 2 mm; (2) nearly normal: medial joint space width of 3 to 5 mm; (3) abnormal: medial joint space width of 6 to 10 mm; and (4) severely abnormal: medial joint space width of &gt;10 mm.</p>

<p>The assessment of other combined ligament injuries was conducted as follows. The ACL was examined using the side-to-side difference of anterior tibial translation measured with a KT-1000 arthrometer (MEDmetric Corp, San Diego, California) as well as the Lachman test and pivot-shift test. The PCL was examined with a posterior drawer test at 90° of knee flexion and a posterior stress radiograph using a Telos device (150 N of stress was applied). Varus laxity was evaluated at 30° of knee flexion using a Telos device (150 N of stress was applied). External rotational laxity was assessed with a dial test at 30° of knee flexion. The results were graded according to IKDC guidelines, and all grades were determined by comparison with the noninjured knee.</p>

<title>Subjective Functional Scores</title>
<p>The preoperative IKDC subjective scores and Lysholm scores were 49.8 ± 6.9 (range, 31-57.5) and 69.3 ± 5.9 (range, 55-78), respectively. At the final follow-up, the IKDC subjective scores and Lysholm scores were 84.3 ± 6.0 (range, 71.3-93.1) and 88.6 ± 5.0 (range, 75-95), respectively. Both the subjective functional scores were significantly improved postoperatively (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .001) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0363546513479016">Table 2</xref>). There was no significant correlation between patients’ BMI at the time of surgery and the clinical outcome scores at the final follow-up (<italic>P</italic> = .311).</p>
<p>Among the 16 patients who were available for postoperative MRI evaluation, the sMCL grafts were demonstrated on the T2-weighted images on coronal scans. On these 2 or 3 images, the grafts were seen as continuous low-signal bands of fibers extending along the peripheral aspect of the medial femoral condyle and medial tibial plateau. The entire course of the sMCL graft from its origin on the medial femoral condyle to its distal insertion on the proximal tibial metaphysis could be seen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0363546513479016">Figure 2</xref>).</p>
<p>The laxity of the associated ligaments was assessed at the final follow-up. Of the 5 ACL reconstructions, the mean side-to-side difference on the KT-1000 arthrometer measurement was significantly improved from 9.6 ± 1.5 mm (range, 8-12 mm) preoperatively to 1.8 ± 0.7 mm (range, 1-2.8 mm) postoperatively (<italic>P</italic> = .008). The Lachman test and pivot-shift test findings both were negative in 4 patients and 1+ in 1 patient. For the 12 PCL reconstructions, the mean side-to-side difference on posterior tibial translation as measured with the Telos device was significantly improved from 15.8 ± 6.6 mm (range, 9.0-30 mm) preoperatively to 3.3 ± 1.7 mm (range, 0.2-5.8 mm) postoperatively (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .001). The posterior drawer test result was negative in 9 patients and 1+ in 3 patients. Seven patients who underwent PLC surgeries had increased external rotation of 17.6° ± 2.5° (range, 15°-20°) and lateral joint space width of 5.9 ± 0.4 mm (range, 5.5-6.3 mm) preoperatively. At the follow-up, statistically significant improvements were observed for both external rotation and lateral joint space width of 0.6° ± 2.9° (range, –5° to 4°) (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .001) and 0.7 ± 0.5 mm (range, 0.2-1.2 mm) (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .001), respectively. In 12 of the 16 patients, the range of motion of the knee was maintained, which was symmetrical compared with the uninjured knee. In the other 4 patients, 2 patients were observed with 10° loss of flexion of the injured knee postoperatively. One patient had a 20° loss of flexion of the injured knee postoperatively. During the early postoperative period, another patient with unsatisfactory rehabilitation of knee motion received manipulation under anesthesia and maintained a 10° loss of flexion at the final follow-up. None of the patients had limitations of knee extension, and the patients did not complain of subjective functional knee problems.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In this study, using a single Achilles allograft, a sMCL reconstruction technique was performed for the treatment of IKDC grade C or D valgus laxity of the knee joint. The mean side-to-side difference in medial joint space width improved from 8.9 ± 3.2 mm (range, 6-15.9 mm) preoperatively to 1.1 ± 0.9 mm (range, –1.1 to 3.2 mm) postoperatively. After the reconstruction of the sMCL, the result indicated that valgus instability could be effectively treated. Moreover, the clinical functional assessment illustrated a significant improvement at follow-up. The short-term clinical outcomes after surgery agreed with our hypothesis.</p>
<p>Several forms of reconstruction techniques have been described for severe medial instability of the knee, including single-bundle and double-bundle sMCL reconstructions and sMCL combined with POL reconstruction. These reproduce different anatomic insertions of the femoral and tibial attachments.</p>
<p>In recent years, several studies have been published presenting the single-bundle sMCL reconstruction technique and clinical outcomes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0363546513479016">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0363546513479016">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0363546513479016">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0363546513479016">31</xref></sup> However, interpretation of these studies has been complicated for 2 reasons. First, it is difficult to assess both the severity and the exact structures of the MCL that were ruptured in most studies, owing to the different classification used to describe the degree of the grade of the injury. Second, it is difficult to compare the different outcomes because of a lack of data on the precise measurement of medial joint space width at both 0° and 30° of knee flexion before and after the surgical treatment. Yoshiya et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0363546513479016">31</xref></sup> followed 34 patients who underwent sMCL reconstruction using autograft semitendinosus/gracilis tendons. In this study, the preoperative valgus stress radiographs measured only a mean of 4.4 mm (range, 3-6 mm) of increased medial joint space width. Therefore, it would appear that these knees would belong to the category in which nonoperative treatment might be the most recommended procedure. Fanelli and Edson<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0363546513479016">8</xref></sup> described a procedure to reconstruct the sMCL in patients with “high-grade” sMCL ruptures using an Achilles tendon allograft or semitendinosus tendon autograft. The millimeters of increased medial joint space width at 0° and 30° of flexion were not provided preoperatively. In other studies,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0363546513479016">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0363546513479016">21</xref></sup> it is noted that few investigators used stress radiography to objectively measure medial joint space width preoperatively and postoperatively.</p>
<p>In our study, a Telos device was used to perform valgus stress testing, which evaluated the medial joint space width using stress radiographs. It was more reproducible and reliable for comparison of valgus laxity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0363546513479016">21</xref></sup> To our knowledge, very few clinical studies focused on sMCL reconstruction that used stress radiography to present a quantitative assessment of medial laxity. In our study, all of the patients received stress radiographs and clinical assessments both preoperatively and postoperatively. The early-stage clinical and functional outcomes were comparable with those published previously by other authors.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0363546513479016">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0363546513479016">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0363546513479016">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0363546513479016">31</xref></sup>
</p>
<p>The double-bundle technique for sMCL reconstruction is still controversial because of the variable tibial insertions being addressed. Borden et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0363546513479016">5</xref></sup> reported a technical note, describing 2 tibial tunnels, which were placed in the anterior-to-posterior direction within the tibial insertion of the sMCL. On the other hand, in a cadaveric study by Feeley et al,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0363546513479016">10</xref></sup> an anatomic double-bundle reconstruction was performed by securing the shorter limb of the graft at the site of the proximal tibial insertion of the sMCL and a longer limb at the distal position. Their biomechanical results indicated that the double-bundle reconstruction was better equipped to resist the valgus and external rotations in response to valgus stress when compared with the single-bundle technique. Both the configurations were used to reapproximate 2 separate anatomic insertions of the sMCL on the tibia. The definition of the double-bundle technique for sMCL reconstruction should be clarified, and the clinical outcomes require further evaluation.</p>
<p>In recent years, in the management of chronic medial laxity of the knee joints, many authors have suggested MCL reconstruction combined with POL repair or reconstruction.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0363546513479016">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0363546513479016">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0363546513479016">26</xref></sup> The POL is one of the most important structures of the posteromedial corner. It contributes to the stabilization of external rotation, internal rotation, and valgus movement of the tibia.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0363546513479016">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0363546513479016">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0363546513479016">26</xref></sup> Lind and associates<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0363546513479016">22</xref></sup> followed 61 patients with IKDC grade C or D medial instability and reported that 98% of the patients were normal or nearly normal (IKDC grade A or B) postoperatively. To optimize clinical results, they suggested the reconstruction of both the structures for severe MCL instability. In a small series of 26 patients, Kim and colleagues<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0363546513479016">19</xref></sup> reported that 92% of the 24 patients, who were followed for at least 24 months, were IKDC grade A, with an average medial joint space width of 1.1 mm (range, 0-5 mm). In an in vitro study, LaPrade and coworkers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0363546513479016">21</xref></sup> concluded that an increased medial joint space width of 6.5 mm at 0° of knee flexion and 9.8 mm at 20° of knee flexion indicated a complete medial knee injury involving the sMCL, POL, and deep MCL. The authors recommended an anatomic reconstruction of the sMCL and POL.</p>
<p>In contrast to the previous studies, in the present series, 4 of the 16 patients, who had an increased preoperative medial joint space width of 9.8 mm or more, underwent sMCL reconstruction only without addressing the POL. All the patients recovered stable knees under valgus stress at the final follow-up. However, very few comparison studies of clinical outcomes involving POL reconstructions have been conducted. The indication for surgical management of the POL in the treatment of medial injuries of the knee requires further clarification.</p>
<p>Our study validated the hypothesis that the anatomic reconstruction of the sMCL could effectively restore knee kinematics and stability in the sMCL-deficient knee, as revealed in published articles.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0363546513479016">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0363546513479016">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0363546513479016">31</xref></sup> In addition, sMCL reconstruction with a single Achilles allograft offers relative advantages in certain situations. First, an Achilles tendon graft provides sufficient graft tissue and sufficient strength for reconstruction of the sMCL. Second, the graft placement is relatively simple, and it allows secure fixation at both insertions. In global and prolonged knee ligament reconstruction procedures, this technique requires less operative time and reduces the complexity of an anatomic reconstruction of the sMCL and the POL.</p>
<p>The most important strength of our study is that all of the enrolled patients underwent standard quantitative assessments of medial laxity based on stress radiographs both preoperatively and postoperatively. Moreover, 16 of 19 (84.2%) patients were available for the final clinical evaluations with at least 2 years’ follow-up. The greatest limitation of this study is the small and heterogeneous population with combined ligament ruptures in which it was difficult to determine the clinical outcomes of isolated MCL procedures. The POL treatment principle was not involved in our study. In addition, in the period extending from the preoperative to postoperative evaluations, we did not assess the differences in rotatory instability of the knee. Finally, the follow-up period was relatively short. The midterm and/or long-term clinical outcomes after sMCL reconstruction should be assessed further.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>In a small set of patients with multiligament-injured knees, valgus laxity can be effectively restored through surgical management with the sMCL reconstruction, when the other associated ligament injuries are reconstructed as well.
