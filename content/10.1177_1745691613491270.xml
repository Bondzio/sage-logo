<title>Introduction to “An Additional Future for Psychological Science” by John T. Jost (New York University)</title>
<p>William J. McGuire (1925–2007) grew up in New York City during the Great Depression and, after serving in World War II, studied philosophy and psychology at Fordham College, the Catholic University of Leuven (or Louvain) in Belgium, and Yale University. After completing a postdoctoral training position at the University of Minnesota, McGuire pursued an illustrious academic career on the faculties of the University of Illinois, Columbia University, the University of California at San Diego, and Yale University. He was a cofounder of the Society for Experimental Social Psychology and President of the Personality and Social Psychology Division of the American Psychological Association. McGuire is considered by some to be the “father of social cognition” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1745691613491270">Wyer, 1991</xref>, p. vii), having pioneered a distinctive approach to social psychology following the “cognitive revolution” that began during the 1950s. He received the American Psychological Association’s Distinguished Scientific Contribution Award (1988), the Association for Psychological Science’s William James Fellow Award (1989), the Society of Experimental Social Psychology’s Distinguished Scientist Award (1992), and the International Society of Political Psychology’s Harold Lasswell Award (1998). McGuire is best known for his empirical studies of persuasion and social influence, but he contributed profoundly to numerous areas of scholarship and research, including the study of epistemology and philosophy of science, which is the subject of the essay published here. Additional biographical and autobiographical information about William J. McGuire is provided by the following sources: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1745691613491270">Banaji and Hastie (1999)</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1745691613491270">Evans (1980)</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1745691613491270">Hunyady and Jost (2004)</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1745691613491270">Jost and Banaji (2008)</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1745691613491270">Jost, Banaji, and Prentice (2004)</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1745691613491270">Jost and Hardin (2011)</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1745691613491270">McGuire (1999)</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1745691613491270">Pearce (2008)</xref>.</p>
<p>Following McGuire’s death in late 2007, I (as his last Ph.D. student and a close family friend) was asked by his widow and former research collaborator, Claire V. McGuire, to inspect the dozens of file cabinets and boxes containing research materials, correspondence, and unfinished manuscripts in their New Haven home. There, I discovered this gem, which was apparently drafted in late 1978 in response to a journal editor’s invitation to contribute an article for a special issue devoted to the “future of social psychology.” It would appear that McGuire worked on the manuscript but neither finished nor submitted it for publication. To my mind, it is a remarkable and impressive piece of work, in part because it is less circumspect than his other writings and more openly critical of the reigning philosophy of science in psychology, which is most strongly associated with Karl Popper.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1745691613491270">2</xref></sup> Most important, McGuire directly challenges the ubiquitous assumption that the purpose of empirical research is to determine which hypotheses and theories should be rejected (or falsified) and which should be left standing (for the time being, at least).</p>
<p>Although McGuire’s essay was written 35 years ago, it strikes me as incredibly timely. As in the 1970s, the science of social psychology faces another internal “crisis”—this one having to do with concerns about research ethics and full disclosure with respect to study methods and statistical analyses (e.g., see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1745691613491270">Ledgerwood &amp; Sherman, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1745691613491270">Nosek, Spies, &amp; Motyl, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1745691613491270">Pashler &amp; Wagenmakers, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1745691613491270">Roediger, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1745691613491270">Simmons, Nelson, &amp; Simonsohn, 2011</xref>). Decades ago, McGuire argued that it would benefit psychological scientists to be more forthright and communicative not only about those research discoveries that “worked,” but also the entire process of insight and theoretical and empirical refinement, which might involve pilot studies, multiple revisions of materials and procedures, and more than a few “dead ends.” McGuire believed in the ethical use of statistics, to be sure, but his goal would not have been simply to rid our discipline of “false positives” (empirical conclusions that seem to be true but really are not). For him, this formulation of the problem—as well as one proposed solution, namely to try to attempt exact replications of every study in the published literature to determine which results are legitimate and which are not—would have seemed epistemologically naive, especially given that such replications are typically conducted in a different social setting (i.e., a different time and place) than the original studies.</p>
<p>Instead, as McGuire argues powerfully in the essay that follows, we need to recognize that the genuine purpose of empirical confrontation—in the natural sciences no less than the social sciences—is not simply to weed out false propositions but rather to determine the precise circumstances under which a given proposition may be said to be true and those circumstances under which it may be said to be false. This determination requires, among other things, a deep appreciation of the context-embeddedness of many of the phenomena we study, as well as a healthy skepticism about any bottom-line statistical claim about whether a given effect is “real” or not. If the epistemological purpose McGuire identifies were properly regarded as the highest scientific goal, there would be no reason for researchers to publish only their most “successful” results (at <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05). McGuire’s thesis may be a radical one, but it is not as radical as some that have been suggested, such as the abdication of scientific gate-keeping altogether. In any case, the community of psychological scientists may finally be ready to consider McGuire’s proposal several decades after he sought to offer it.</p>
<p>The original draft of this essay contained no definitions of philosophical terms (and very few citations). At the journal editor’s request, I have inserted a few footnotes and other references and compiled supplemental bibliographies for readers who would like to learn more about the methodological and epistemological issues addressed by McGuire. I also offer the following definitions of two key philosophical terms that feature prominently in this essay:</p>
<list id="list1-1745691613491270" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p><italic>Logical empiricism</italic>: the doctrine that “the warrant for all scientific knowledge rests upon empirical evidence in conjunction with logic, where logic is taken to include induction or confirmation, as well as mathematics and formal logic” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1745691613491270">Salmon, 2001</xref>, p. 233).</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Positivistic inductionism</italic>: the systematic scientific attempt “to assemble observations and arrive at reliable generalizations based upon them” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1745691613491270">Tudor, 2007</xref>).</p></list-item></list>
<p>Finally, I would recommend that interested readers consult the full entry for “logical empiricism” from the online <italic>Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy</italic> (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/logical-empiricism/">http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/logical-empiricism/</ext-link>).</p>
<p>In the years following the drafting of this essay, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1745691613491270">McGuire (1989</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1745691613491270">1997</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1745691613491270">2004</xref>) proposed a prescriptive metatheory, called <italic>perspectivism</italic>, in which he spelled out his own epistemological position (including a “tragic theory of knowledge”) and offered numerous recommendations for how to conduct meaningful, programmatic research in the social and behavioral sciences. One of the most provocative (and potentially perplexing) tenets of perspectivism, which he alludes to in the present article, is that “the opposite of a great truth is also true” (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1745691613491270">Banaji, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1745691613491270">Hardin, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1745691613491270">Jost, 2004</xref>; and several other chapters collected in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1745691613491270">Jost et al., 2004</xref>). I would discourage readers from being overly literal in interpreting McGuire on this point. He was by no means an epistemological relativist (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1745691613491270">Jost &amp; Kruglanski, 2002</xref>). It is rather that, as Curtis Hardin and I pointed out:
<disp-quote>
<p>For McGuire, interesting questions were seldom, if ever posed in “either/or” terms; he preferred “when” and “how.” Scientific controversies, according to McGuire, should not focus on whether one or another perspective is true (or even truer), but when and under what circumstances each perspective is true enough to illuminate, however partially, the causes of human behavior. . . McGuire argues that the scientific hypothesis is simply a proposition that—as one tool among many in the scientist’s toolbox—should be freed from the philosophical burdens of metaphysical absolutism and seen for what it is: a product of human creativity that can help us in our necessary, noble, and ultimately tragic quest for knowledge. We may never attain a perfectly accurate understanding of reality—what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1745691613491270">Rorty (1979)</xref> referred to as a “mirror of nature”—but we close with the optimistic suggestion that what we can attain might actually be better and more practical. Our knowledge, whether as laypersons or as scientists, is bound to oversimplify reality, and a perspicacious reading of McGuire suggests, however slyly and against the grain, that oversimplification (i.e., selective perception in terms of distinctive features) might just be what makes the knowledge valuable. A pocket-sized map of New York City—every would-be traveler and epistemologist must finally admit—is far more useful than a perfectly detailed life-sized replica would be. The tragedy of knowledge, in other words, may be a blessing in disguise. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1745691613491270">Jost &amp; Hardin, 2011</xref>, p. 49)</p>

<title>An Additional Future for Psychological Science by William J. McGuire</title>
<p>The logical empiricism philosophy of science that has dominated our thinking about psychological research since the middle of the 20th century was a happy advance over the positivistic inductionism that preceded it. At the same time, it perpetrates a disastrous misunderstanding of the relationship between a theory and empirical observation, the correction of which could redirect our understanding of our research undertakings in ways that would add significantly to their fruitfulness. This misperception of the relation between a theory and data perpetrated by logical empiricism has had a variety of dire consequences for psychological science. It has introduced discordance between what we do and what we <italic>think</italic> we do and between what we do and what we <italic>say</italic> we do. This has alienated us from ourselves and has erected a barrier to the recruitment and sympathy of intelligent outsiders. The misunderstanding has caused us to overlook the most useful information in our data and to petrify our theories so that their development has been much poorer than might otherwise have been the case. It has also distorted our communication of the research process, both in terms of journal publication and graduate student instruction.</p>
<p>Here, I shall first discuss the epistemological error as regards the relationship between theory and empirical observation that was introduced by logical empiricism. I shall then discuss some negative effects of this philosophical error on graduate training and publication in social psychology, and finally describe how an understanding of the error can suggest some redirections of graduate training in social psychology that might restore a certain honest zest to the field, which seems to be lacking in many of its current practitioners.</p>
<p>I would like to extend the scope of this essay even further. It will be challenging to discuss the implications of the epistemological error in logical empiricism, not only for its implications prescriptively for the formal knowledge involved in social psychological research, but also descriptively for the knowledge process in general, even in informal thinking. We could extend the discussion beyond ontogenetic knowledge acquisition (i.e., knowledge acquired by the individual) to the phylogenetic growth of knowing (i.e., knowledge development in the human species) and even further to a discussion of the nature of knowledge itself—that is, the relationship of knowing to the thing known. But here I will confine myself to the more circumscribed topic—no small issue in itself.</p>

<title>Impact of Logical Empiricism: One Step Forward, One Step Back</title>
<p>I shall first review briefly the well-known position of logical empiricism regarding the relationship between theory and empirical observation, explaining its popularity in psychology during the past half century in terms of the advance it represents over the positivistic inductive epistemology that it replaced. I shall then describe the error it introduced, an error perhaps not logically intrinsic to the theory but a psychologically compelling overreaction to the positivism it replaced. I shall then describe the relationship between theory and empirical observation that I believe should reorient our thinking toward the research enterprise in very important ways.</p>
<sec id="section4-1745691613491270">
<title>The logical empiricist’s view of the theory–observation relationship</title>
<p>That logical empiricism would be as appealing as it has been during the past half century or more to psychological researchers in search of a philosophy of science is easy to understand if one recognizes that it replaced an inductionist positivism associated with the philosophy of science view of Roger Bacon or a theory of knowledge associated with David Hume and the British empiricists. This positivism was itself a corrective reaction against the earlier philosophy of knowledge of the “Schoolmen,” who believed, among other things, that “rational knowledge about God was possible and necessary” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1745691613491270">Kusukawa, 1995</xref>, p. 201).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-1745691613491270">3</xref></sup> The Schoolmen’s approach had been dominated by deductive thinking, appeal to general principles and earlier precedents, and so on—to a large extent disdaining formal observational routine as a source of knowledge. These empiricist rebels urged that we turn to the mutually observable world around us and take readings that would allow us to induce the principles that governed reality.</p>
<p>The logical empiricist correction to this positivistic inductionism was to recognize the importance of theory, increasing its priority in the knowledge process as regards time and prestige. The inductionist, reacting against the apotheosis of theory in the Schoolmen’s speculations, reduced theory to an epiphenomenon that would somehow be induced on the basis of sufficient empirical observation. Those who formed the <italic>Wiener Kreis</italic> (Vienna Circle) and other founders of logical empiricism pointed out that theories should not and, indeed, cannot be relegated to this secondary role; theory should and does precede observation.</p>
<p>One must possess a theory before collecting observations: In making observations, dozens of decisions must be made in advance about what to notice and what to ignore, how to categorize what we perceive, and which interrelations among these categories (i.e., variables) are to be tested. Given that our observations will be circumscribed (and distorted) by our theoretical preconceptions in any case, logical empiricism urges us to make these theoretical preconceptions explicit in the first place and to order our observations in such terms from the start; in this way, our selectivities and biases will be made explicit for possible correction by ourselves or others, and we shall have guidelines for how to generalize the implications of our observations. Thus far, logical empiricism finds a suitable role for theory in the total knowledge process, ascribing it a role somewhere between its apotheosis by the deductive Schoolmen and incidental effect status accorded it by the positivistic inductionists. We are now all logical empiricists in this sense, referring pejoratively to latter day positivistic inductionism in terms of “fishing expeditions” and “dustbowl empiricism.”</p>
<p>But if logical empiricists agreed with the deductive Schoolmen in concluding that the knowledge process should begin with theory, they departed radically from the antiempiricist view that there the process also ended. The logical empiricist insisted that the pursuit of knowledge should go beyond theory formulation to theory testing. The total knowledge process involves formalizing the theory so that all of its terms are interrelated and tied ultimately to an intersubjectively observable world via operational definitions. Such a test involves defining outcomes and terms of the relationship between observable events that, if they do not obtain, tend to disconfirm the theory.</p>
<p>In the philosophy of logical empiricism, the purpose of empirical observation is to test a theory, either confirming it or disconfirming it. Admittedly, I am neglecting an adequate discussion of such issues as the probabilistic nature of disconfirmation, Karl Popper’s error in thinking that theories can be disconfirmed but not confirmed, whether it is possible to disprove the null hypothesis, the nature of the null hypothesis, and so on. These are all important issues that deserve discussion in their own right, but I neglect them here because my objection to the logical empiricist viewpoint is more fundamental and holds regardless of how one chooses to resolve these other issues. My objection to the logical empiricist notion of the empirical side of science as a test of the hypothesis has nothing to do with how hypotheses are to be tested but with the more basic assumption that the purpose of observation is, or should be, to <italic>test</italic> the hypothesis.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1745691613491270">
<title>A post-logical empiricism view of the theory–observation interaction</title>
<p>My thesis is that, in any given cycle of research, we proceed from an explicit statement of a hypothesis that is linked to a broader theory to the design and conduct of an empirical confrontation (in this respect, agreeing with the logical empiricism position) but that the purpose of this empirical confrontation is not to test the theory, but to <italic>develop</italic> it—to make its hidden assumptions, limitations, and interacting factors clearer to ourselves and others. Underlying this thesis is an even more fundamental premise—a bit outrageous sounding on first hearing—that we cannot really test a hypothesis because all hypotheses are true. I hold with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1745691613491270">William Blake (1790)</xref> that, “Everything possible to be believed is an image of truth” (p. 77). That is, if a person of reasonable competence and seriousness states a hypothesis about a human social phenomenon, then it is almost inevitably valid; if the premises within which the person derives a hypothesis hold, then the hypothesized relationship would follow.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-1745691613491270">4</xref></sup></p>
<p>For example, if a person who apparently has been contemplating the origins of leadership says to us, “You know, taller people are more likely to rise to power than shorter ones,” the statement is probably <italic>ipso facto</italic> true for having been derived. Of course, it is quite possible that some other reasonable person may come up with the opposite hypothesis that shorter people are more likely to rise to leadership. However, this is no embarrassment because not only are all hypotheses true, but so are their contraries if they too have been honestly and thoughtfully generated. When one hears the hypothesis that shorter people are more likely to rise to leadership than are taller people and finds it unconvincing and perhaps even surprising or incredulous, then what is called for is not a test of the hypothesis, but rather its clarification by making explicit the unspoken presuppositions from which it is drawn. Perhaps the researcher who generated the hypothesis was thinking of a fairly specialized situation— perhaps a notion that diminution spurs people to higher levels of endeavor, that one is discussing only moderate degrees of “shortness,” that the organization in which leadership is attained does not involve face-to-face contact, nor a task calling for physical strength, and so on. Some of these presuppositions (which were perhaps not even conscious to the generator of the hypothesis himself or herself) can be made explicit by questioning the hypothesis’s proponent or role playing what the person could possibly have been thinking of in proposing such a relationship. Indeed, I have elsewhere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1745691613491270">McGuire, 1973</xref>) suggested a useful technique for creative hypothesis generation: Take a very straightforward proposition (such as, “people like others to the extent that the others are like themselves”), reverse it by stating its contrary, and then generate the special circumstances under which the contrary would be true.</p>
<p>When the investigators feel they have proceeded to the point of diminishing returns with this <italic>a priori</italic> clarifying of the circumstances under which the hypothesis would obtain, it is time for the empirical confrontation. This should involve creating an experimental design that establishes the conditions one determines to be essential plus some others (the importance of which are less certain), varying some factors in each set, and then conducting the empirical confrontation to see when the hypothesized relationship obtains. Quite often it will happen that no relationship at all is observed in the first situation designed or that there is a peculiar variation in the relationship that seems quite unrelated to the hypothesis. Therefore, one adjusts various factors in the empirical situation until the results begin to come out “right”—that is, in a pattern that is understood to be at least partially conforming to the original hypothetical intuition (unless by now the investigators have lost interest in this initial insight).</p>
<p>Readers experienced in research will perhaps recognize that I am proposing—as a <italic>post</italic>logical empiricism way of using empirical confrontation—to develop a theory recognized as true <italic>a priori</italic> by making its meanings and hidden assumptions more explicit. This, experienced researchers may point out, is not at all different from the way that they and their students have long been proceeding (within the logical empiricist tradition) to put a hypothesis of questionable validity to an empirical test. I grant that the empirical work purportedly done within the logical empiricism framework over the past half century has indeed usually proceeded as I have urged, but I note that this way of proceeding does not properly lie within the logical empiricism hypothesis-testing philosophy of science. The serious consequences of this confusion include deceiving ourselves as to what we are doing, overlooking the most useful information derivable from the empirical confrontation, underreporting and misreporting to others what we have been finding, and training students in our graduate programs to perpetuate this situation, which wastes a large part of the utility of our theories and of the empirical confrontation.</p>
</sec></sec>
<sec id="section6-1745691613491270">
<title>Some Deleterious Effects of the Logical Empiricism Error</title>
<p>I shall now describe briefly how the fiction that we are working within the logical empiricism philosophy has distorted our communication of the information involved in the interaction between theory and empirical confrontation when we publish our research for one another in the journals and when we teach this distorted methodology and content to students in our graduate programs. This distorted communication, derived from the fallacy that we have been testing our hypotheses rather than learning to understand them, has created multiple detriments: We are presenting a quite biased sample of our own findings, withholding from publication the most valuable information derived from our empirical work, and denying ourselves the information inherent in the theory and observations of closely related researchers. In discussing these detrimental effects, I shall use social psychological examples; however, my criticism extends to research throughout psychology and indeed to all sciences that allow their purported adherence to logical empiricism to guide communication in the scholarly journals and graduate training programs.</p>
<sec id="section7-1745691613491270">
<title>Distortion of what gets published</title>
<p>The tragedy of our purported adherence to the logical empiricist philosophy is not that we allow it to distort terribly what we do, but that we allow ourselves to pretend that we have adhered to it when we publish the results of our research. Thus, we lose much (or, for our readers, all) of the information in the empirical work that clarifies the meaning and domain of validity of our theory. As we go about designing and conducting the empirical observations to bear on the hypothesis, experienced researchers rely on armchair thinking to determine precisely what they have in mind. In the course of this, one typically thinks of a variety of conditions under which the hypothesized relationship would not obtain (insights that tend to be a source of pain and anxiety rather than joyful discovery, insofar as we take logical empiricism seriously). Then, the investigator engages in prestudies to select the proper materials, powerful enough manipulations, sufficiently sensitive measures, and so on. It is not unusual to expend several times as much effort in these prestudies to get the conditions right as one spends in the final study that is written up for publication. There might be as much information gained from some of these prestudies as there is in the final published study, and the whole program of research with its patterns of confirmations and disconfirmations tends to contain many times as much information about the hypothesis and the theory in which it is embedded than the final study which comes out right (or in rare cases is published as definitively disproving the hypothesis).</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the researcher working within the logical empiricist tradition tends not to write up the whole program of research, using the prestudies no less than the final one, to disclose the complex pattern of hypothesized and observed relationships. If the researcher were to submit a manuscript that did present this full pattern of information, the editor operating within the logical empiricist tradition would likely return it with some indignant remarks about wasting journal space and inflicting upon readers preliminary meanderings about his or her pilot studies.</p>
<p>The experienced researcher plays this editorial role himself or herself when reviewing manuscripts or dissertation proposals. The students may submit a doctoral prospectus outlining the derivation of a testable hypothesis and the gist of an experiment that would test it. The advisor frequently tends to feel uneasy about the hypothesis or about its testability in the manner proposed and suggests to the student that he or she do some preliminary work along the lines of a feasibility test. The student then plays around with the ideas in a variety of empirical settings until conditions can be specified in which the manipulations and the measure work in the manner anticipated. The prospectus is rewritten accordingly and approved and the dissertation research carried out.</p>
<p>What is ultimately published is not the information-rich prestudies in which the student gained control of the situation sufficiently to run a promising demonstration, but simply that final demonstration, which constitutes only a small subset of the empirical information obtained—and a biased subset at that. Indeed, with a logical empiricist philosophy guiding the student’s and advisor’s thinking about the work along the narrow channel of devising a set of conditions that will simply test the hypothesis, they probably have not even grasped themselves the full meaning of the prestudies and their consequences for the hypothesis and the theory in which it is embedded. Hence, due to the blinders of logical empiricism, the information about the theory in the empirical work is lost to ourselves as well as to the public to whom we communicate.</p>

<title>Resulting distortions of graduate training</title>
<p>There has been a sizeable and vocal minority within psychology that has expressed profound disenchantment with laboratory research in psychological science, recognizable in abusive terms such as <italic>artificial, artifact-prone, experimenter bias, demand characteristics, evaluation apprehension, fun-and-games, irrelevant, nonreplicating</italic>, and so on. The self-criticism has been especially loud within experimental social psychology, a field that was once particularly hardy but has experienced a series of crises of confidences (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1745691613491270">McGuire, 1967</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1745691613491270">1969</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1745691613491270">1973</xref>). There have been frequent expressions of uneasiness as to the proper place of the laboratory and the hypothesis-testing approach within our research and graduate training programs. I shall discuss here the epistemological bases of this disciplinary angst that I think is its most important component—although there are other bases of the uneasiness, such as the ethics of using human participants in research, the costs and benefits of psychological research to society, and so on.</p>
<p>The alienating effect of the logical empiricist’s miscontrual that the purpose of the empirical aspect of research was to test the given, petrified hypothesis yielded by a theory led to the “fun-and-games” era of laboratory research in social psychology that was so attractive to many a young researcher in the 1960s and so repulsive to many in the 1970s. If the purpose of empirical investigations is simply to test one’s hypothesis, then the bright and lively psychologist had to trip the light fantastic in order to avoid banality. If one started with a mundane hypothesis, one was playing a dull game: If the results did not confirm the obvious hypothesis, then one looked foolish at probably having designed an insensitive test; if one did confirm it, then one looked a bit silly for having bothered to demonstrate the obvious. One escape from this Scylla and Charybdis that appealed to many was to start with a nonobvious hypothesis, preferably the reverse of common sense, and demonstrate it in the laboratory. Had these young Turks appreciated that the real purpose of empirical confrontation is to explore the limits and discover the conditions under which any proposition may sometimes be true, their starting point would have been wisely chosen.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, these researchers were bound by the logical empiricist fallacy that one should deduce a hypothesis and then determine whether it is true or false by putting it to an experimental test. To find conditions under which their outlandish, nonobvious hypothesis was indeed valid, they often had to resort to a long series of (unreported) prestudies to get control of the situation or to have a happy facility for arranging laboratory conditions (often outrageously) so that the far-out hypothesis was indeed confirmed. The results were then reported as if the nonobvious hypothesis was generally true and—by implication—that the obvious hypothesis was generally wrong. The result was that other fun-and-games researchers were incited to top the previous study with a still greater outrage, whereas more Puritanical researchers poked along demonstrating their obvious hypotheses while looking (and perhaps feeling) slightly ridiculous and sometimes expressing outrage at the deception or stress or indignity to the participants or the poor replication score of this fun-and-games work on nonobvious hypotheses (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1745691613491270">Ring, 1967</xref>). In this era, the prestigious graduate programs in experimental social psychology were not those that were best at turning out good hypothesis testers, but those that were best at producing good stage managers who had a knack for setting up laboratory conditions so that the relationship came out right, even when it was contrary to common sense.</p>
<p>Had these fun-and-games researchers not been confused by the logical empiricist philosophy and understood the true nature of their own empirical work, they could have taken their nonobvious hypotheses and proceeded more perspicaciously to develop the sets of conditions under which the rather boring obvious relationship did not obtain and was indeed reversed. They would thus have avoided having to put forward real but secondary tendencies in human nature as if they were the dominant force; also, when designing the empirical test they would have endeavored to set up a more ecologically representative set of conditions to show when each of the contrary hypotheses obtained, rather than devising an outlandish situation in which the nonobvious hypothesis was confirmed and implying that it was representative of the usual situation.</p>
<p>Finally, when reporting the empirical research and discussing its theoretical implications, rather than suppressing the prestudies required before they finally got the experiment to come out “right,” they would have planned and reported the series of studies as a voyage of exploration that clarified the nature of the person rather than scoring winning points in a game. Thus, had they been more in touch with what they were actually doing in developing rather than testing knowledge through empirical work, they would not only have derived more fully the information inherent in their observations and reported it more usefully; they would also have avoided some corrupting preconscious alienation from their own work. As clever as they were, they could hardly have failed to experience the insincerity in what they were doing.</p>
<sec id="section9-1745691613491270">
<title>Once more, this time in the field</title>
<p>In the face of disenchantment with laboratory approaches, a solution was urged from the late 1960s on (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1745691613491270">McGuire, 1967</xref>) to move theory-oriented research from the laboratory into natural settings, thus having the best of both worlds— the guidance of theory and the ecological representativeness of the natural world. Behind this enthusiasm for field research was the notion that whereas almost anything can be demonstrated in the laboratory if one is so self-indulgent as to allow oneself to set up any situation (however outrageous), shifting research to the field would impose some reality constraints in that one would be required to test the hypothesis under natural conditions. I have argued elsewhere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1745691613491270">McGuire, 1973</xref>) that this shift to the field (more advocated in our graduate programs than implemented in our own research) was at best a cosmetic improvement.</p>
<p>The extraordinary events in nature as well as in the laboratory—perhaps “framed by nature in a mood prodigal”—made the natural ecology more flamboyant than the laboratories of the fun-and-games researchers. Now, the well-trained graduate student was able to not just stage manage the proper conditions in the laboratory but to find the special niche in the natural world in which the proper conditions obtained to make one’s hypothesis come out right. This researcher might intuitively perceive (or learn through experienced failure) that the hypothesis does not “work” in Boy Scout summer camps (e.g., see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1745691613491270">Sherif, Harvey, White, Hood, &amp; Sherif, 1961</xref>) but that it does work quite nicely in high school basketball teams or perhaps in Army tank crews. Now our forward-looking, field-oriented graduate programs are involved in turning out not good stage managers, but “good finders” (to use a New York City real estate agent term).</p>
<p>Here again, if one did not allow one’s concept of the wealth of information in the empirical side of science to be circumscribed by the logical empiricist philosophy, the field researcher would rejoice in finding that the hypothesis was sustained in some kind of real group situations and not in others. He or she would arrive at a fuller grasp of the nature of the person–situation interaction through the pattern of results, rather than reporting the “successful” confirmation and suppressing the unsuccessful prestudies.</p>

<title>Generality of the malaise</title>
<p>I have been stressing the unfortunate influence of the logical empiricist’s hypothesis-testing fallacy by taking examples from social psychology. This selection may be intrinsically justified in that the “experimental social psychology” movement during the 1950s and 1960s [and again in recent years] was particularly successful and flamboyant, so that the disenchantment was inevitably and deservedly most pronounced in this area. But my exclusive stress on social psychology reflects my own greater familiarity with this area and a recognition of the stultifying and corruptive influences of the logical empiricist fallacy in the area with which I am most familiar. But the problem is inherent, though possibly less recognized, in other branches of science, particularly those experimental fields in which the great leap forward allowed by logical empiricism’s liberating notions about the value of <italic>a priori</italic> theorizing has enshrined also its detrimental assumption that empirical observation is for testing rather than developing hypotheses.</p>

<title>Concluding Remarks</title>
<p>As regards the generality of this complaint, it should be recognized that the problem is not peculiar to the social and behavioral sciences but pertains also to the natural sciences, such as physics. Here again, one is led to absurdity in thinking of the empirical work as testing one’s hypotheses rather than developing them by making clear to ourselves and others the implicit limitations of austerely stated laws. For example, if one were to derive from classical physics certain hypotheses about the acceleration of falling bodies, mechanical advantage in an inclining plane, or trajectory of a moving object and then proceed with empirical observations as if they constituted tests of the hypotheses, progress would be slow indeed. Had Galileo twisted his way up the corkscrew slope of the Pisa tower and dropped an owl and a stone cannonball from the top, his hypothesis that falling bodies accelerate at a uniform speed regardless of mass would have been strongly disconfirmed. But of course there are qualifying assumptions in the physical theories (unfortunately, often left implicit in their statements and perhaps even hidden from the theorist himself or herself) that one is dealing with a vacuum, with a friction-free world, with intermediate distances where localized nuclear or large-scale galactic fields have appreciable effect, and so on.</p>
<p>Had Galileo’s more naive student rushed to the tower top on hearing the master’s laws, the simplicity of which had such austere beauty, and dropped the different weighted objects as a test, just to be sure, he would have been shocked that the outcome was not as hypothesized. If the master then explained that, of course, he was referring to the rate of fall in a vacuum and that his silly student had forgotten to take into account air resistance in the atmosphere, his student would have begun to grasp that what was wrong was not Galileo’s theory, but the logical empiricist’s assumption that empirical confrontation tests our theories. The real purpose of empirical confrontation is to clarify our theories to ourselves and others.</p>
<p>The study of falling bodies in a vacuum and the nature of friction and air resistance are each valid fields of inquiry that together give us a fuller understanding of the movement of physical bodies than either will alone. The problem for physicists in developing adequate theories of the movement of physical bodies is comparable in terms of complexity to the problem faced by social psychologists who are trying to account for movement in social groups and finding different results when studying high school basketball teams, tank crews, and Boy Scout summer camps. The paradigm of logical empiricism represented a step forward during the middle of the 20th century. However, it has now outlived its usefulness in that its corrective insights have been adequately absorbed by the field and its shortcomings are warping research practices and, therefore, scientific knowledge itself.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-1745691613491270">5</xref></sup></p>

<p>Karl Popper is one of the few philosophers that McGuire mentions by name, but he does not include any specific references to Popper’s writings. An anonymous reviewer of this article noted perceptively that “McGuire’s targets are popular stereotypes of [philosophers of] science, and they do not map simply onto philosophers writing professionally . . . [but] the stereotypes are exactly the right targets, because psychologists are influenced by them more than by technical writing in philosophy.” McGuire’s criticisms, one might add, apply at least as well to the views of Rudolf Carnap and Carl Hempel as to those of Karl Popper.</p></fn>

<p>On this point, an anonymous reviewer wrote that “The idea that honest intuitions will almost inevitably be true in some sense may be true of human social phenomena. It is manifestly not true of neuroscience, or the shape of the Earth, or the nature of the stars.” Such a response may be well-taken, but we should make clear that McGuire’s view (in this essay and elsewhere) was that the epistemological and other arguments against logical empiricism (and in favor of perspectivism) apply to the natural (or physical) sciences as well as the social and behavioral sciences.</p></fn>
