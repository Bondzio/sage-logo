<p>It is widely known that schools are becoming increasingly more diverse while the teaching force remains predominately White, middle class, and female. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0042085911436232">Henke, Peter, Li, &amp; Geis, 2005</xref>). Projections based on U.S. Census Bureau data suggest that by 2050 the population of ethnically diverse residents will grow with Hispanics increasing to 29% of the population, Asian/Pacific Islanders constituting 10%, while the population of non-Hispanic Blacks and Native Americans will remain steady at 13% and 1% respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0042085911436232">Hollmann, Mulder, &amp; Kallan, 2000</xref>). Teachers must be equipped to provide a sound education for students from different backgrounds with a variety of needs. While differences between teacher and student backgrounds do not always lead to challenges in the classroom, a lack of awareness of self and others can lead to bias and prejudice to the detriment of learners. The potential impact on student outcomes warrants a focus on increasing racial and cultural competence for all professional educators.</p>
<p><italic>Building Racial and Cultural Competence in the Classroom: Strategies from Urban Educators</italic> is a natural progression from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0042085911436232">Obidah and Teel’s (2001)</xref> earlier book, <italic>Because of the Kids: Facing Racial and Cultural Differences in Urban Schools.</italic> The current title pans back from the classroom-level where the editors grappled with their own feelings, experiences, and interactions in terms of race to provide a more macro-level view of how the personal and professional experiences of several contributing authors are affected by race. Two assumptions are made clear by their accounts: (a) the role and presence of the teacher greatly influences the classroom environment and participants; and (b) the discrepancy between who we are and what we espouse and ultimately do are significant factors in student achievement.</p>
<p>Teel and Obidah suggest that racism is pervasive and institutionalized and the efforts to overcome racial and cultural injustices must be ongoing. Furthermore, they indicate that competence in issues of race and culture are as essential to teaching as the ability to manage a classroom or deliver content and that racial and cultural competence may enhance teachers’ abilities in the aforementioned skills. In this text, Teel and Obidah use racial and cultural competence to elucidate how teachers position themselves with regard to power structures in their classrooms and their ability to tip the scales in favor of some (and not others) based on their own cultural and racial beliefs. Specifically, “racially and culturally competent teachers are willing and able to mediate such power imbalances by understanding, supporting, and advocating for students who have historically experienced ‘under achievement’ in American schools (p. 4).”</p>
<p>According to the coeditors, each chapter includes the personal and professional experiences of the contributing authors and offers suggestions to improve racial and cultural competence. In chapter 1, Teel and Obidah share the impetus for this book; two distinct needs expressed by students in Teel’s graduate courses—White students’ experiences of dissonance and experiencing validation and voice for students of color—asking for any compilations by diverse authors that extend Delpit’s (1995/<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0042085911436232">2006</xref>) discussion on teaching “other people’s children.” They set the stage in this chapter with a definition of racial and cultural competence and discussing how these competencies can arm teachers to significantly diminish the achievement gap, also referred to as the <italic>opportunity</italic> gap (Berlak, this volume). Teel and Obidah take care in describing how a “mosaic of voices” (p. 10) uniquely situates this book within the existing multicultural education literature. The authors have similar goals, yet their varied racial backgrounds and perspectives provide different lenses. Among the authors are teacher educators, K-12 educators, and teachers of students with special needs. All can be considered activists that are male and female, White, African American, and Latino. Their age range also provides a purview from different eras of schooling. After reading the 12 chapters and Epilogue, four themes emerged: Racial and ethnic identity development; understanding “the system” and identifying critical needs; coming into our own as racially/culturally competent educators; and finally, moving forward.</p>
<sec id="section1-0042085911436232">
<title>Racial and Ethnic Identity Development</title>
<p>Ann Berlak (chapter 2) begins by describing her own experience with race, racism, and White privilege as a child and how the experience of being the only Jew in most of her classes stimulated her growing awareness of conscious and subconscious acts of racism in social institutions. She goes on to discuss the experiences of resistance and how they serve to defend the hierarchy and status of Whites. If the journey to racial and cultural competence is undertaken, resistance is often accompanied by psychological feelings of trauma, guilt, and anxiety. As a teacher educator, Berlak structures experiences for her students to help them understand their own racial and cultural identity, become alert to their own conscious and unconscious racism displayed in their behavior, particularly in the classroom. She borrows the theory of <italic>adaptive unconscious</italic> from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0042085911436232">Wilson (2002)</xref> to describe the unconscious thoughts behind some of the behaviors exhibited that may conflict with our professed beliefs. If teachers are to dismantle the racial and cultural hierarchies they must actively respond in ways that bring their adaptive unconscious in line with their conscious beliefs and intentions. Berlak facilitates this practice by incorporating activities that purposely create cognitive dissonance such as quick writes, videos, presenters, and writing personal narratives.</p>
<p>In chapter 7, Christine Sleeter employs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0042085911436232">Helms’s (1990)</xref> theory of racial identity development to situate her own growth as a White activist educator. She reflects on her initial student teaching experience, in the <italic>contact</italic> stage, as her first true experience with a diverse group of students. As she progressed into her own classroom she moved from contact to <italic>disintegration</italic>, where she began to recognize that being liked by people of color was not enough. Her professional practice required more competence and concern. Sleeter’s transition through this stage was aided by her personal relationships and experiences living and working in a diverse neighborhood. She acknowledges the likelihood of <italic>reintegration</italic> as Whites can potentially regress at this stage because of discomfort and uncertainty about their range of feelings (i.e., anger, guilt, desire to “fix” racism). However, in her case her supportive network of diverse friends helped her to move successfully into pseudoindependence, characterized by intellectual growth and problem solving. Finally, Sleeter describes the final two stages of <italic>immersion</italic> and <italic>autonomy</italic>, as she actively sought out information and opportunities that led her to a long-term commitment for social justice and equity as a teacher educator, mentor, and scholar.</p>
<p>In the same vain, Edward Fergus (chapter 3) identifies an awareness of one’s own identity and that of others as imperative to racial and cultural competence. He describes his own experience as a Black Latino in American schools and the racialization he experienced and the students he has interviewed in his research continue to experience. He identifies the need to pan-ethnically categorize groups of people (e.g., Latino/Hispanic rather than Puerto Rican or Mexican), which presumes understanding of a heterogeneous group of people. As evidenced by the U.S. Census process, Latinos must identify as Black/Hispanic or White/Hispanic. Fergus points to the inherent power in forced-choice of discrete identity categories by asking, “Who am I, who am I allowed to be?, and what am I presumed to be (p. 37)?” For the individual, the situational context dictates which racial “self” will be presented from the individual’s “portfolio of identity.” Conversely, teachers determine which “self” will be validated. In the final section, Fergus offers two essential skills for racially and culturally competent professionals: confronting racism through “Opportunity to Learn” moments and creating cultural safety for academic success. Each of these skills involves being aware of students’ needs and providing them with the knowledge and skills to maintain their psychological health and cultural/ethnic identities.</p>

<title>Understanding “the System” and Identifying Critical Needs</title>
<p>Carl Grant (chapter 4) begins by discussing genres of narrative and indicates that each genre represents the vast resources needed to improve outcomes for culturally and linguistically diverse learners. Grant shares the experience of being a teacher educator, scholar, and grandparent dealing with the referral of his 9-year-old grandson for special education testing. He suspected that this was an example of the subtle acts of racism that continue to stifle the progress of students of color. The private psychologist hired to conduct the evaluation noted that his grandson was developing typically and questioned the necessity of the referral. Grant goes on to discuss the broader social system—the media in particular—and how it has the potential to shed light on racism as it did in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina. Grant argues that if we are to compete in a global society, these structures have to be identified and teachers have to be prepared to teach all students. To do this, he suggests being committed to and serious about the work through ongoing professional development, identifying allies, and being actively involved in the school and community. Most poignantly, Grant states that students must be taught the 3Rs along with the tools to be critical thinkers and doers. “Teaching from this perspective, and becoming racially and culturally competent, will make their instruction much more intellectual, culturally engaging, and academically enriching (p. 53).”</p>
<p>Jeffrey Duncan-Andrade (chapter 9), a scholar of European and Mexican descent, begins by discussing the divisive paradox of race as a social paradox. His sentiments of being defined by a “racial box” echoes the issues presented by Fergus (chapter 3 of this volume). He argues that inequalities have led to policies such as the No Child Left Behind Act but fails in attending to details such as clearly defining the “highly qualified teacher,” recognizing the complexities of the urban context, and the importance of a supportive professional climate. Duncan-Andrade provides a counternarrative involving 4 teachers who participated in a 3-year study on social justice pedagogy in urban schools. Aside from these teachers’ own teaching style, Duncan-Andrade gleaned four common tenets from their practice. He described them as five pillars of racial and cultural competence: Critically Conscious Purpose, Duty, Preparation, Socratic Sensibility, and Trust. Not only were the students of these teachers meeting traditional standards of achievement but were also seen as skilled in critical pedagogy. Duncan-Andrade is careful to point out that these teachers “humanized” education and sought out human resources and built relationships to support their professional development and the learning of their students.</p>
<p>In chapter 10, Kitty Kelly Epstein initiates her discussion of the systemic changes that must take place by telling of her own upbringing as the child of a “relatively nonracist White guy of Irish descent,” moving from a small home in a working-class neighborhood to a larger home in a more peripheral area of Los Angeles. Her uneventful college experience at UCLA was followed by a substantially more eye-opening and activist experience at San Francisco State University. It was there that Epstein says she became more politically and racially aware and involved. She described her professional foray into schools as a substitute teacher explaining that the “experience gave me fresh daily insights into racial discrimination, particularly the huge racial disparity between the teachers and the taught, and the awful overlooked problems that it caused (p. 128).” Currently a professor of social foundations, Epstein suggests that to be culturally and racially competent teachers must start by acknowledging the political as well as the personal. Furthermore, she posits that in addition to good teaching, three changes need to occur: teaching force demographics, appropriateness of curriculum and instruction, and stakeholder policy and programs focused on systemic change.</p>

<sec id="section3-0042085911436232">
<title>Coming Into Our Own as Racially/Culturally Competent Educators</title>
<p>Jennifer Obidah begins chapter 5 with personal reflection and a critical examination of the pervasiveness of race and racism throughout her life when her character and qualifications were challenged. She reflects on necessary processes that can aid in the transcendence from anger to freedom. Obidah asserts,</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>reflecting on my own identity, the influence of racism and the ways I’ve chosen along the way to actively address the negative influences of racism in my life, make me confident as a teacher educator, facilitating pre-service teachers’ learning about their identity and the influence of racism in their lives. (p. 58)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>She facilitates her preservice teachers’ development through a variety of activities that focus on identity, culture, positionality, and allies. The activities force participants to be reflective and honest with themselves and transparent with one another. Obidah specifically suggests journal writing, “I Am From” poems, the forced corners activity, A/B Line, and the Power Scatter. Once preservice teachers enter the classroom they will have to seek appropriate allies and mentors to continue their efforts to become racially and culturally competent teachers. Obidah states that this skill must also be taught.</p>
<p>Kimberly Mayfield’s (chapter 6) educational aspirations stemmed from grandparents who raised their children in the Jim Crow south and saw education as their opportunity for a better life. Her parents ensured her success by imparting the same values and enrolling her in diverse private and public schools. She acknowledges her earlier experiences as key to her racial and cultural competence. Mayfield discusses her research on the racial disparities in the teaching force and the professoriate and how these challenges affect learners in schools through the continued presence of dominant views in teacher education. She outlines five dispositions and behaviors to which educators seeking racial and cultural competence must aspire: critical reflection, flexibility, promoting student success, high expectations of students, and educational activism. Finally, Mayfield offers that these characteristics can be operationalized through professional dress, professional preparation, effective and open communication, limiting complaints, having a pluralistic view, a classroom environment conducive to learning, and simply enjoying the work.</p>
<p>In chapter 8 Tarika Barrett and Pedro Noguera acknowledge the importance of multicultural education and cultural competence that focuses on racial identity and family background, but they go on to indicate that it is an insufficiently narrow approach. They argue that multicultural education and teacher education, “ignore a more fundamental and existential question about the lives of the students we teach: What knowledge and skill are required to successfully educate the children we serve (p. 97)?” This question requires the teacher to continue asking questions and seeking solutions. Both of the chapter’s authors have experience teaching in urban schools. Barrett shares her experience of cultures within cultures, her own experience of being Jamaican American, and teaching Deaf students from racially diverse backgrounds. The nuances of the Deaf culture and being deaf shed a different light on cultural competence. Barrett’s students self-identified as Deaf, deaf, or hard of hearing, similar to the identification process of Latino students described in chapter 3 (Fergus). Noguera, on the other hand, worked to counter the “drug culture” among African American males in California. The time spent with these young men led to issues of social responsibility and the impact their lifestyle had on the community in which they lived. Both experiences underscored the need for truly effective teachers to listen to their students’ perspectives and engage them as allies.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0042085911436232">
<title>Moving Forward</title>
<p>In chapter 11 Karen Manheim Teel looks back to go forward. She describes her “former racist self” shaped by her experiences in all-White schools and communities. Her first real interactions with African Americans were as their teacher in a newly desegregated middle school. She received the low expectations offered to her for these students and in retrospect, sees the detrimental impact it probably had. As Teel pursued doctoral study, she became aware of the stereotypes and deficit-model thinking she had accepted from those she believed to be knowledgeable and began her journey to be racially and culturally competent educator and activist on behalf of culturally and linguistically diverse learners. As a result of Teel’s work as a teacher, teacher educator, and researcher she developed a conceptual framework for racial and cultural competence. This framework includes eight tenets to effectively educating students from a background different than one’s own. These tenets focus on student achievement through relationships, high expectations and levels of engagement, culturally relevant curriculum and instruction, and accountability through reflection and self-evaluation.</p>
<p>“It’s not my fault, but it is my problem (p. 155)” illustrates Sekani Moyenda’s (chapter 12) position on the skill, commitment, and passion needed to teach children in a high-poverty, high-crime neighborhood. She reflects on being ostracized in her own school and only sought as an “overseer” of children who presented challenging behaviors. However, her students and their parents understand that even though some may view her as radical, she is striving to empower her first graders. Moyenda provides her students with “learning choices” that carry varying degrees of privilege. Furthermore, she teaches them what she calls empowering characteristics that focus on faith, independence, ethical reasoning, forgiveness, and wisdom. She poses difficult questions regarding beliefs, values, character, and effort for anyone intending to become a racially and culturally competent educator. To conclude the chapter, Moyenda provides a listing of books that have shaped her own worldview and the way she approaches her work.</p>
<p>In the Epilogue, Teel and Obidah acknowledge that several authors in the volume addressed the “ghost of racism” and how it enables White privilege to persist. They go on to discuss how many of the contributors identified the social justice goals to which all educators must aspire to become racially and culturally competent. Lastly, they summarize the recommendations of the authors, which converge on being vulnerable and being invested.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0042085911436232" sec-type="conclusions">
<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>In conclusion, racial and cultural competence is a requisite skill for highly qualified teachers if they are to teach every child to perform at high levels. Becoming racially and culturally competent begins with reflection and requires persistent action to change our individual and collective behaviors. This anthology shows that engaging with allies who are also committed to change and social justice makes the goal of parity more attainable.</p>
<p>Teel and Obidah have assembled a powerful group of contributors to provide a unique, thought-provoking anthology. This book will be useful as a course text for preservice teachers or as a book study selection for in-service teacher professional development. Furthermore, this is essential reading for professionals engaged in teacher education and school reform efforts aimed at increasing student achievement in highly diverse schools. The diverse perspectives brought together in this volume serve nicely as a conduit for personal and collective reflection, critical dialogue, and agenda setting.</p>
