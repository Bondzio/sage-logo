<p>Half of all pregnancies in young adult women are unintended, but few interventions have been successful in encouraging contraceptive use. The group heterogeneity likely contributes to the lack of success. Segmenting based on theories that provide meaningful information may improve tailoring and targeting of behavioral interventions. Previous research has indicated that threat, efficacy, and fear were important factors in influencing intentions to use contraceptives; therefore, the extended parallel process model (EPPM) was used for this cluster analysis. A telephone survey of randomly selected 18- to 30-year-old women in Iowa was conducted (<italic>N</italic> = 401). The constructs of EPPM and age were used for conducting a K means cluster analysis with four clusters. The cluster analysis pointed to the importance of fear, perceived susceptibility, and age. All of the clusters had varying degrees of ambivalence about the severity of a pregnancy. Cluster 1 (27.8%) had high susceptibility, with little fear. Cluster 2 (23.8%) had high efficacy and higher fear. The third cluster (34.7%) was not fearful and had low susceptibility. The final cluster (13.8%) was younger than the other groups and had the lowest efficacy. Additional analyses were conducted to explore how the clusters varied on other variables. The clusters help campaign developers prioritize audiences and tailor messages.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The goal of this study was to show how the extended parallel process model (EPPM; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1524500412450490">Witte, 1994</xref>) could be used to segment audiences for social marketing campaigns or behavior change interventions. EPPM suggests that behavior can be influenced by a person’s evaluation of efficacy (self-efficacy and response efficacy) and threat (perceived severity and susceptibility). Segmenting audiences is an excellent way to ensure that interventions and messages are tailored to a more specific audience in order to be more effective. Few segmentation models use determinants of behavior for segmentation purposes, and even fewer use health behavior models or theories as frameworks for segmenting the audience into meaningful subgroups. Specifically, this article explores how EPPM can be used to group women into clusters based on their perceptions of threat and efficacy related to unintended pregnancy and contraceptive use.</p>
<p>Unintended pregnancy among adult women is a public health problem in the United States. Approximately half of pregnancies are unintended (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1524500412450490">Finer &amp; Henshaw, 2006</xref>). For women under the age of 30, this challenge is particularly critical. Women in this age group have higher unintended pregnancy rates compared to women over 30 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1524500412450490">Finer &amp; Henshaw, 2006</xref>). Specifically, unintended pregnancy occurs at the rate of 1 in 10 women in the 18–24 age group, which is twice the rate of unintended pregnancy for women overall, and about 50% of pregnancies to women under the age of 29 are unintended (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1524500412450490">Finer &amp; Henshaw, 2006</xref>). Much of the challenge is related to a lack of contraceptive use or inconsistent use. For instance, a national survey reports that 19% of unmarried young adults who were sexually active and not trying to get pregnant were not using contraception, and 24% of them were using contraception inconsistently (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1524500412450490">Kaye, Suellentrop, &amp; Sloup, 2009</xref>). The negative consequences of unintended pregnancy to the health of women and their children are significant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1524500412450490">Gipson, Koenig, &amp; Hindin, 2008</xref>), such as low birth weight and domestic violence, and results in increased medical, emotional, and financial costs to women, their families, and society (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1524500412450490">Brown &amp; Eisenberg, 1995</xref>).</p>
<p>Despite the negative outcomes and the importance of reaching adult women, little attention has been given to unintended pregnancy in this age group. In fact, very few interventions have been designed to prevent unintended pregnancies among 18- to 30-year-old women, and there are no published results on effective interventions. Health communication campaigns are one intervention that has the potential to reach a large number of women and target contraceptive behaviors. Audience segmentation is a part of effective behavior change interventions, including health communication campaigns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1524500412450490">Grunig, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1524500412450490">Rogers &amp; Storey, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1524500412450490">Salmon &amp; Atkin, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1524500412450490">Slater, 1996</xref>) and social marketing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1524500412450490">Kotler &amp; Lee, 2008</xref>). Audience segmentation is the process by which intervention developers and social marketers separate the audience into smaller subgroups. By segmenting the audience into smaller, more homogenous groups, it is possible to tailor interventions and messages more specifically to each subgroup and target each group with these tailored messages. This tailoring and targeting can produce more effective social marketing interventions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1524500412450490">Kotler &amp; Lee, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>Much of the previous segmenting done for health communication campaigns has used sociodemographic characteristics to segment the audience into smaller, more homogenous subgroups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1524500412450490">Andreasen, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1524500412450490">Kotler &amp; Lee, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1524500412450490">Slater, 1995</xref>). While this practice might be valuable when the behavior of interest is influenced greatly by age or race, this method does not always produce segments which are meaningful to behavior change. Some interventions have used more complex segmenting tools, such as Healthstyles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1524500412450490">Atkin &amp; Freimuth, 2001</xref>) or PRIZM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1524500412450490">Slater, 1995</xref>). Segmenting tools such as these are developed from large national samples that examine consumer behavior, media consumption and in the case of Healthstyles, health beliefs and behavior. The data collected from these national samples are used to develop profiles of segments of the U.S. population. Tools like these were not designed to segment audiences for specific behavioral interventions, but instead segment people on broader health and health behavior-related variables, including some theory constructs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1524500412450490">Slater, 1995</xref>). As a result, these tools fail to provide enough information about specific behaviors and do not provide details about message content. Therefore, the variables for audience segmentation should be based on the relationship of the variables to the outcome behavior of interest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1524500412450490">Rimal, Brown, Mkandawire, Folda, Bose, &amp; Creel, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1524500412450490">Slater, 1995</xref>). For this example, the behavior of interest is contraceptive use; therefore, decisions about audience segmentation were based on variables that were associated with contraceptive use. Segmenting on the determinants of a health behavior is an important step in developing meaningful audience groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1524500412450490">Slater, Kelly, &amp; Thackeray, 2006</xref>). By segmenting on behavioral determinants of a health behavior, the messages can be specifically tailored to a subgroup’s determinants. The specific determinants that are relevant to a subgroup can be addressed in tailored messaging. Additionally, segmenting audiences using health behavior theories or models can further inform message development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1524500412450490">Silk, Weiner, &amp; Parrott, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>Because segmenting should be based on the determinants of a health behavior, preliminary qualitative research was conducted on the possible antecedents of contraceptive use among women of age 18–30. Without this previous research, it is not possible to determine what potential antecedents to a health behavior should be included in a segmentation strategy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1524500412450490">Slater, 1995</xref>). Preliminary qualitative research (18 focus groups, <italic>N</italic> = 106, and in-depth interviews, <italic>N</italic> = 27) suggested that the EPPM would be an appropriate model for examining what was influencing contraceptive use behavior. These data collections were with the target population of 18- to 30-year-old women in Iowa in 2007–2009. In particular, the focus groups suggested that women had inaccurate perceptions of contraceptive methods, response efficacy, low perceptions of susceptibility related to the likelihood of unintended pregnancy, and feelings of ambivalence toward unintended pregnancy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1524500412450490">Campo, Askelson, Spies, &amp; Losch, 2010</xref>). Additionally, formative research with adolescent pregnancy prevention has also used EPPM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1524500412450490">Witte, 1997</xref>). The EPPM purports that threat (perceived severity and perceived susceptibility) and efficacy (response efficacy and self-efficacy) need to be at elevated levels to encourage behavior change or action. Perceived severity is the audience’s perception of how bad a negative outcome would be; in this case, how bad an unintended pregnancy would be for a woman. Perceived susceptibility is the perception a woman has of how likely an unintended pregnancy would happen to her. Response efficacy is a woman’s perception of how effective contraceptives are at preventing unintended pregnancies, while self-efficacy is a woman’s confidence in her ability to use contraceptives to prevent unintended pregnancy. According to the EPPM, if women only have elevated perceptions of threat, women will be unlikely to use contraceptives and will have higher levels of fear. Too much fear without enough efficacy, would be related to a maladaptive process, which would not encourage contraceptive use. High levels of response efficacy and self-efficacy need to accompany the threat in order to effectively motivate women to use contraceptives.</p>
<p>While the EPPM provided some determinants of contraceptive use, age is also an important determinant of both unintended pregnancy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1524500412450490">Finer &amp; Henshaw, 2006</xref>) and contraceptive use (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1524500412450490">Lindberg &amp; Singh, 2008</xref>). Consequently age needed to be included in the segmentation model.</p>

<title>Method</title>
<p>Data for this cluster analysis were gathered via a random digit dial telephone survey of 18- 30-year-old women (<italic>N</italic> = 619). The sampling frame for the survey was all residential telephone numbers for adult women of age 18–30, in Iowa. This data collection was designed to assess the knowledge, attitudes, and general behaviors related to reproductive health among adult women in this age range. The questionnaire took approximately 20 min for the respondents to complete and included 82 items that assessed knowledge, attitudes, and general behaviors related to reproductive health, in addition to a series of demographic items. The study was reviewed and approved by the Institutional Review Board. The response rate (RR3; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1524500412450490">American Association for Public Opinion Research, 2006</xref>) was 26% and the cooperation rate was 62% (COOP3; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1524500412450490">American Association for Public Opinion Research, 2006</xref>). The response rate is the ratio of interviews to eligible numbers dialed, and the cooperation rate is the ratio of interviews to all eligible respondents contacted.</p>
<sec id="section3-1524500412450490">
<title>Measures</title>
<p>The segmenting strategy was based on the EPPM and the measures were constructed from other standard EPPM measures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1524500412450490">Witte, Meyer, &amp; Martell, 2001</xref>). Self-efficacy and response efficacy were measured by asking women to report their level of agreement or disagreement with a statement (<italic>strongly disagree</italic> = 1, <italic>disagree</italic> = 2, <italic>neither agree or disagree</italic> = 3, <italic>agree</italic> = 4, <italic>strongly agree</italic> = 5). For self-efficacy, women were asked to respond to the statement, “I feel confident that I can use birth control consistently and appropriately every time I have sex” (<italic>M</italic> = 4.18, <italic>SD</italic> = 0.70). For response efficacy, women responded to, “Using birth control consistently and appropriately every time you have sexual intercourse will prevent pregnancies” (<italic>M</italic> = 3.59, <italic>SD</italic> = 1.13). Perceived severity was measured by asking women which statement best described how they would feel if they had an unintended pregnancy now. Women were presented with seven choices ranging from, “It would be the worst thing that could happen,’ to ‘It would be the best thing that could happen,” range 1 (<italic>worst</italic>)–7 (<italic>best</italic>), <italic>M</italic> = 4.67, <italic>SD</italic> = 1.21. Women were asked to imagine that, “sometime soon you were to have sexual intercourse with someone just once, you were able to become pregnant, but were unable to use any method of birth control for some reason. What is the percentage chance that you would get pregnant?” in order to measure perceived susceptibility. The mean response was 56.99% (<italic>SD</italic> = 31.84). Fear was measured by asking women to agree or disagree with the statement, “I fear having an unintended pregnancy” (<italic>strongly disagree</italic> = 1, <italic>strongly agree</italic> = 5; <italic>M</italic> = 2.48, <italic>SD</italic> = 1.18).</p>
<p>In order to measure women’s knowledge about contraceptives, women were asked to name as many methods as they could think of. The mean number of methods named was 5.13 (<italic>SD</italic> = 2.14). To assess women’s normative perceptions about contraceptive use among friends, women were asked to estimate the percentage of sexually active single female friends who use birth control (<italic>M</italic> = 74.34%, <italic>SD</italic> = 30.33) and the percentage of sexually active married female friends who use birth control (<italic>M</italic> = 69.08%, <italic>SD</italic> = 32.42). A woman’s position in stages of change was measured by asking women to select a statement that best represents their “thoughts and behavior about birth control.” The statements ranged from . . . <italic>don’t think about using birth control</italic> (1) to . . . <italic>used birth control every time</italic> (5). A higher score represented a stage closer to maintenance (<italic>M</italic> = 3.74, <italic>SD</italic> = 1.54). Women were also asked to describe their contraceptive behavior on a range from 1 to 4, with 1 indicating contraceptive use every time they had intercourse and 4 indicating rarely or never using birth control (<italic>M</italic> = 1.78, <italic>SD</italic> = 1.19). Women’s past behavior was measured by asking about contraceptive use during the most recent sexual intercourse. Seventy percent of women reported having used some type of birth control during the most recent sexual intercourse. Women were also asked to rate their intention to use contraceptives the next time they have sexual intercourse (1 = <italic>highly unlikely</italic>, 4 = <italic>highly likely</italic>; <italic>M</italic> = 3.21, <italic>SD</italic> = 1.27).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1524500412450490">
<title>Analyses</title>
<p>For this analysis, only the women who reported both being sexually active and not trying to get pregnant were included (<italic>N</italic> = 401). K means cluster analysis was selected as the method for defining the cluster, because this analysis allows for the researchers to select the number of clusters a priori. For this analysis, four clusters were selected because EPPM has four main constructs. In order to perform the cluster analysis, the variables were standardized so that they were on comparable metrics. The K means cluster analysis was stopped after 10 iterations. Missing cases were excluded listwise. The segmenting strategy used the EPPM (fear, self-efficacy, response efficacy, perceived susceptibility, and perceived severity) in addition to age. Following the K means cluster analysis, analyses of variance (ANOVAs) and chi-square tests were performed to determine how the clusters compared based on demographic variables: marital status (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1524500412450490">Finer &amp; Henshaw, 2006</xref>), having children (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1524500412450490">Lindberg &amp; Singh, 2008</xref>), experiencing an unintended pregnancy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1524500412450490">Bouchard, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1524500412450490">Finer &amp; Henshaw, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1524500412450490">Kuroki, Allsworth, Redding, Blume, &amp; Peipert, 2008</xref>), knowledge about contraceptives, normative perceptions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1524500412450490">Raine, Minnis, &amp; Padian, 2003</xref>), what stage of change (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1524500412450490">Andreasen, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1524500412450490">Grimley, Riley, Bellis, &amp; Prochaska, 1993</xref>) women are at, and contraceptive use and intentions.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>The mean age of the women in the study was 27.27 years old (<italic>SD</italic> = 2.64). Most of the women were married or living with a partner (90%). About 44% of the women had some post–high school education (including some college, technical college, or associates’ degree). Thirty percent of the women had a bachelor’s degree. Most (72%) of the women were employed and about one quarter (23%) had household incomes ranging from $50,000 to $75,000. The women were predominantly White (97.8%), which is reflective of the state’s demographic profile. Unintended pregnancy was common in this group. Fifty-eight percent of the women reported having experienced an unintended pregnancy. The mean number of unintended pregnancies was 1.07 (<italic>SD</italic> = 1.25).</p>

The largest cluster is Cluster 3, with 34.7% of the women in this cluster. Fear is higher in Cluster 2 compared to all the other clusters, while Cluster 1 had the lowest levels of fear. Self-efficacy is relatively high with Cluster 4 having the lowest levels. Cluster 4 also had the lowest levels of response efficacy. Cluster 3 had the lowest perception of susceptibility (32.4%), while Cluster 1 had the highest level (87.7%). Perceived severity levels were uniformly ambivalent. Only Cluster 4 differed on age, with this cluster being the youngest (mean age of 23).</p>

<p>When examining the differences between the clusters on other variables, additional variations are seen (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1524500412450490">Table 2</xref>). There are differences between the clusters based on marital status. Cluster 4 has the smallest percentage of married members (52.1%) and the smallest percentage of women with children (85.4%). All of the groups reported high rates of unintended pregnancy, with Cluster 4 reporting the highest unintended pregnancy rate (79.2%) and Cluster 3 reporting the lowest rate at 45.5%. There were no statistically significant differences in knowledge about contraceptives. All the clusters had a mean number of named contraceptives of about five. For normative perceptions, there were differences in the perceptions of both single female friends’ and married female friends’ contraceptive use. For the perception of single female friends’ contraceptive use, there were differences between Clusters 1 and 4 and Clusters 3 and 4. The mean percentage of female single friends who use contraceptives for Cluster 4 was 56.5%, which was lower than Cluster 1 (79.3%) and Cluster 3 (80.1%). For normative perceptions about married female friends’ contraceptive use, there were differences individually between Clusters 1, 2, and 3 when compared to Cluster 4. Again, Cluster 4 had a mean percentage of normative perception that was significantly lower than the other clusters (49.3% compared to 71.9%, 72.6%, and 70.4%). When examining where women in the clusters fall for readiness to change, there are multiple differences between the clusters in stages of change. Cluster 1 (<italic>You have used birth control somewhat regularly</italic>) is different from Clusters 3 and 4 (<italic>both represent You have not used birth control every time you have had sex, but have taken steps to do so in the future</italic>). Cluster 2 (<italic>You have used birth control somewhat regularly</italic>) is different from Cluster 3. For contraceptive use, three variables were examined for differences between the groups: general description of current use, use at most recent intercourse, and intention to use in the next time. Clusters 1 and 2 had described their contraceptive use as the most consistent, compared to Clusters 3 and 4. Specifically, Cluster 1 differed from Cluster 3 and Cluster 4, while Cluster 2 also differed from Clusters 3 and 4. There were also differences between the clusters in regard to whether or not they used contraceptives at the most recent intercourse. Cluster 4 reports the lowest levels of contraceptive use (50.0%) and Cluster 2 has the highest levels of use (81.9%). Levels of intention to use contraceptives the next time are also dissimilar. Clusters 2 and 3 differed, with Cluster 2 reporting the highest levels of intention and Cluster 3 reporting the lowest levels of intention.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The EPPM performs well as a model for segmenting audiences. Results indicate that it is important to use possible determinants of the health behavior in the segmenting model and the use of health behavior models and theories in segmenting should be encouraged. As discussed below, the clusters provide detailed information about how interventions and messages should be tailored to encourage contraceptive use.</p>
<p>As a segmenting strategy, EPPM with the addition of age performed well. Examining the results of the cluster analysis reveals the importance of fear, perceived susceptibility, and age, because these are the variables that had the most dissimilarity between the clusters.</p>
<p>Women’s perceptions of susceptibility also varied greatly between clusters. Increased perceptions of susceptibility have been shown to be important in health behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1524500412450490">Becker, 1974</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1524500412450490">Witte, 1994</xref>). For the severity measure, women’s responses were centered on the most ambivalent response that a pregnancy would be both good and bad at this time. Although ambivalence has been implicated as a influencer of contraceptive behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1524500412450490">Frost, Singh, &amp; Finer, 2007</xref>), there is little known about what drives this ambivalence and how ambivalence influences contraceptive behavior in relation to other variables and throughout a woman’s childbearing years.</p>
<p>Self-efficacy for contraceptive use was high among all clusters. This finding was not surprising due to the high levels of self-efficacy across all respondents and the resulting limited variance. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1524500412450490">Sable, Libbus, and Chiu (2000)</xref> have established that self-efficacy is an important factor related to contraceptive use; higher levels of self-efficacy should be related to better contraceptive use. Levels of response efficacy, women’s belief that contraceptive use is effective at preventing pregnancy, were mixed. Future research should examine what is driving response efficacy perceptions. Potential issues could be women’s experience with using contraceptives and becoming pregnant or their knowledge of other women having experienced this.</p>
<p>Fear, an important variable to monitor according to the EPPM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1524500412450490">Witte, 1998</xref>), varied greatly across the four clusters and ranged from low to high. According to the EPPM, when individuals are too fearful of a particular outcome or behavior, fear control processes dominate over danger control processes, which can lead to the practice of maladaptive behaviors or psychological reactance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1524500412450490">Witte, 1992</xref>). To alleviate fear of unintended pregnancy, the focus should be on self- and response efficacy related to contraceptive use. Specifically, how effective contraceptives are when used correctly and consistently. It is interesting to note that highest fear levels are in Cluster 2, which also had higher self-efficacy, the highest response efficacy but lower susceptibility and lower severity when compared to the other groups with lower levels of fear. This seems to indicate that the amount of efficacy and threat needed to generate either the danger control or fear control process might be very specific to a group even on the same health behavior.</p>

<title>Implications for Campaign Messaging</title>
<p>The results of the segmentation and the postsegmentation analysis provide rich detail for the design of campaign messages (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1524500412450490">Table 3</xref>). The following section examines each cluster individually and the possible campaign message implications of the results.</p>

</table-wrap>
<p>Cluster 1: When looking across all four clusters, this cluster may not be a high-priority audience. While this group feels highly susceptible to unintended pregnancy, these women have low levels of fear and report using contraceptives more regularly than other groups. This group is the furthest along the stages of change (action), has lower levels of previous unintended pregnancies, and describes their contraceptive use as fairly consistent. If messages are directed to this group, it would be important to support behavioral maintenance as indicated in previous stages of change research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1524500412450490">Prochaska &amp; DiClemente, 1983</xref>).</p>
<p>Cluster 2: The messages designed for Cluster 2 need to increase the perception of susceptibility while not increasing fear. This cluster needs higher levels of self-efficacy and response efficacy to decrease fear. Most women in this cluster are married and have children. Messages and images will need to portray married, older women with children in this age group. Many of these women also have previous unintended pregnancies. Care needs to be taken to not offend women who have had this experience. These women have higher levels of contraceptive use, are further along on the stages of change in the action stage, and have the highest levels of intention. These women should be targeted with messages that support and aid their continued decisions to use contraceptives and avoid an unintended pregnancy, while increasing their perception of susceptibility to unintended pregnancy and decreasing fear.</p>
<p>Cluster 3: This cluster has very low levels of susceptibility. This finding might be consistent with this group also having the lowest levels of unintended pregnancy. Messages need to increase this cluster’s levels of perceived susceptibility. The messages should also hit on response efficacy and self-efficacy in order to prevent fear increasing to levels that create a maladaptive process. The vast majority of women in this group are married and have children; therefore, messages need to represent their lives. Because this group has the lowest levels of unintended pregnancy, messages about susceptibility may need to be more explicit since the majority of these women do not have the experience of an unintended pregnancy. Messages need to be designed to move these women from their current stage of change (preparation) to the next stage and increase their likelihood of performing the behavior in the future. Because these women report lower levels of use at the most recent intercourse, messages about how risky their past behavior has been may be effective.</p>
<p>Cluster 4: This cluster would likely be a priority audience for a campaign to improve contraceptive use and prevent unintended pregnancy. This group is younger than the other clusters and most different from the other clusters on the greatest number of factors. Additionally, this group has the highest percentage of unintended pregnancies. Again, this group would benefit from messages that increase susceptibility, but these messages must be coupled with strong response efficacy and self-efficacy components. Without the efficacy components, this group would be in danger of increased fear and maladaptation because of the current low levels of response efficacy and self-efficacy. These women have extensive personal experience with unintended pregnancy and this experience does not appear to have impacted their level of susceptibility. This relationship between experience with an unintended pregnancy and perceptions of susceptibility needs to be examined before messages are finalized. This younger audience might also be important in determining channels, locations, and venues. Younger people in this age group may be more likely to be found in different locations such as postsecondary training, bars, and other entertainment venues. Due to this cluster being younger, only about half the women are married and they have the lowest percentage with children. Campaign materials would need to represent these women as younger, with some who are married and some who have children. Almost 30% of these women are living with a partner as well. These women have the lowest levels of normative perceptions about female friends’ use of contraceptives. Additionally, messages should be crafted to persuade women that contraceptive use is more normative than they believe. Perhaps testimonials from similar women or a social norms campaign would be important to consider. Messages need to support women’s more consistent contraceptive use, as these women are closest to the beginning of the stages of change in the preparation stage, and all of the variables examining contraceptive use indicate that the levels of use in this cluster are low. Women’s lower levels of response efficacy might be coupled with higher rates of unintended pregnancy. Perhaps pervious experiences with using contraceptives and becoming pregnant or knowledge about others who used contraceptives and became pregnant are influencing this finding.</p>
<p>All of the clusters reported perceived severity levels that indicated a high incidence of ambivalence about an unintended pregnancy. Messages need to clarify for women that being ambivalent about a pregnancy is not the same as intentionally planning pregnancies. Planned pregnancies have better outcomes for mothers and families.</p>

<title>Limitations</title>
<p>Although this article has numerous strengths, there are limitations that should be considered when interpreting the results. Only one measure per EPPM construct was used in the interests of length. Future studies may benefit from using more than one measure for perceived severity, perceived susceptibility, response efficacy, and self-efficacy. Additionally this study did not measure the age at which a woman experienced an unintended pregnancy. Future efforts should consider adding this variable. This study was conducted in a racially and ethnically homogenous state and future studies should examine more diverse populations and whether race and ethnicity is relevant to the clusters.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>The goal of this study was to show how it is possible to extend segmenting past traditional sociodemographic variables and use health behavior models or theories that are relevant to the target behavior. EPPM performed well as a segmenting strategy. Future segmenting projects should strive to ensure that the segmenting strategy is relevant to the audience and target behavior. </p>
