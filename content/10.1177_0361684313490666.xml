<body>
<p>Within academia, scholarship is often formulaically determined. Grammatically “correct,” formal writing, presented from an “objective” stance, is upheld as the nonpareil. Writing that falls outside this formula is often challenged on whether it is scholarly enough (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0361684313490666">Sword, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0361684313490666">Wolff, 2007</xref>). Certainly, texts have contested rigid restrictions on scholarly forms. <italic>Wish to Live: The Hip-Hop Feminism Pedagogy Reader</italic> is one such text.</p>
<p>Editors Ruth Nicole Brown and Chamara Jewel Kwakye set out a lofty aim for <italic>Wish to Live</italic>. Comprising an interdisciplinary assemblage of writings by professors, students, and youth, <italic>Wish to Live </italic>seeks to “radically reimagine the political utility of hip-hop-informed social justice efforts that insist on an accountable analysis of identity and culture” (back cover). The reader achieves this aim to a certain extent.</p>
<p>Many chapters clearly focus on hip-hop culture, particularly hip-hop music, and the gendered messages portrayed. In these chapters, hip-hop is presented as both content and process: Content in that hip-hop music is useful as a stimuli for student personal reflection and societal analysis (Chapters 4 and 26); process in that, through the analysis of hip-hop culture, youth can challenge hegemonic cultural values, explore internalized societal messages, and reposition themselves as constructors of the stories told within hip-hop culture (Chapters 3, 13, and 17).</p>
<p>In other chapters, hip-hop takes a back seat to general commentaries about the lives of young Black women and how these women’s lived experiences are often misrepresented or altogether silenced. These chapters variously denounce the consumption of young Black women’s bodies as objects for possession and restriction (Chapters 6, 11, 12, and 25), explore the intersection of multiple identities (Chapters 7 and 15), reveal the struggles of surviving in academia as a cultural other (Chapters 2 and 23), describe efforts to empower young Black women (Chapters 8, 10, 24, and 27), and challenge traditional research methods (Chapters 9, 16, 23, and 29).</p>
<p>Because of the varying attention to hip-hop culture, the intended focus of the reader is sometimes diffuse. Readers must search for the significance of hip-hop culture in some chapters and, as a result, may struggle to find coherence in the text as a whole. However, this diffusion opens up a greater purpose to the reader than the editors explicitly state. For what <italic>Wish to Live </italic>achieves is promoting and serving as an archetype of feminist scholarship. At its heart, feminist scholarship attends to the everyday experiences of individuals and to name what is often unnamed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0361684313490666">Maynard, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0361684313490666">Stanley &amp; Wise, 1993</xref>). In this way, feminist scholarship respects ways of being that are true for the individual. It is in its respect for various ways of being, and various presentations of knowledge, that <italic>Wish to Live </italic>triumphs.</p>
<p>
<italic>Wish to Live </italic>exemplifies feminist scholarship pragmatically because of the material included. Poetry, plays, personal narratives, and retelling of research projects are presented as valuable mediums for considering the lived experiences of Black women. These diverse presentations proclaim the worth of multiple modes of production and refute the constrained demarcations of what is considered scholarly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0361684313490666">Kimmel &amp; Crawford, 1999</xref>). Because of this, the book serves as a non-judgmental space where the collected works can both produce knowledge and promote dialogue.</p>
<p>Promoting dialogue seems to be <italic>Wish to Live</italic>’s significance as a reader. For youth, the book could stimulate discussion about the lived experiences of young Black women and how they have been positioned in society and by the media. For students and scholars, it could be used to reexamine traditional scholarship and challenge what knowledge is valued. For everyone, though, <italic>Wish to Live </italic>provides hope that dedicated efforts are occurring that challenge restricted images of the beauty and potential of young Black women.</p>
