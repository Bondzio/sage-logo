<abstract>
<p>A robust method for inducing bone formation from adipose-derived stromal cells (ADSCs) has not been established. Moreover, the efficacy of strong osteogenic inducers including BMP-2 for ADSC-mediated bone engineering remains controversial. Meanwhile, the buccal fat pad (BFP), which is found in the oral cavity as an adipose-encapsulated mass, has been shown to have potential as a new accessible source of ADSCs for oral surgeons. However, to date, there have been no reports that define the practical usefulness of ADSCs from BFP (B-ADSCs) for bone engineering. Here, we report an efficient method of generating bone from B-ADSCs using rhBMP-2. The analyses show that B-ADSCs can differentiate <italic>in vitro</italic> toward the osteoblastic lineage by the addition of rhBMP-2 to culture medium, regardless of the presence of osteoinductive reagents (OSR), as demonstrated by measurements of ALP activity, <italic>in vitro</italic> calcification, and osteogenic gene expression. Interestingly, adipogenic genes were clearly detectable only in cultures with rhBMP-2 and OSR. However, <italic>in vivo</italic> bone formation was most substantial when B-ADSCs cultured in this condition were transplanted. Thus, B-ADSCs reliably formed engineered bone when pre-treated with rhBMP-2 for inducing mature osteoblastic differentiation. This study supports the potential translation for B-ADSC use in the clinical treatment of bone defects.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>To date, bone-marrow-derived stromal cells (BMSCs) have been frequently used as a cell source in studies on bone engineering (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0022034512445633">Lecanda <italic>et al</italic>., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0022034512445633">Uchida <italic>et al</italic>., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0022034512445633">Agata <italic>et al</italic>., 2010</xref>). However, most BMSCs are heterogeneous cell populations, and BMSCs from bone-marrow aspirate contain relatively few uncommitted mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0022034512445633">Sacchetti <italic>et al</italic>., 2007</xref>). Furthermore, BMSCs lose some capacity to differentiate into osteoblasts during culture expansion and passage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0022034512445633">Agata <italic>et al</italic>., 2010</xref>). An ideal source of cells for culture and subsequent clinical use must (1) provide a substantial number of MSCs at initial harvest, and (2) be from an easily accessible donor site with minimal morbidity.</p>
<p>Adipose tissue contains uncommitted stem cells that are similar to bone-marrow MSCs. Moreover, adipose-derived stromal cells (ADSCs), like BMSCs, are heterogeneous populations, but they reportedly have on the order of 100- to 500-fold more MSCs than do BMSCs after initial harvest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0022034512445633">Fraser <italic>et al</italic>., 2006</xref>). Therefore, many recent studies have assessed the potential of ADSCs for bone engineering (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0022034512445633">Levi <italic>et al</italic>., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0022034512445633">Ying <italic>et al</italic>., 2012</xref>). ADSCs have shown their ability to differentiate into osteogenic lineage <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0022034512445633">Zuk <italic>et al</italic>., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0022034512445633">Lin <italic>et al</italic>., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0022034512445633">Quarto <italic>et al</italic>., 2008</xref>). However, their actual inducibility of <italic>in vivo</italic> bone formation is still under debate. Some previous studies reported that ADSCs may have an inferior potential for osteogenesis compared with BMSCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0022034512445633">Im <italic>et al</italic>., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0022034512445633">Yoshimura <italic>et al</italic>., 2007</xref>). For adipose tissue to become a potent source of MSCs for clinical use, efficient methods to apply ADSCs for bone engineering must be investigated further. Recently, Farré-Guasch <italic>et al</italic>. showed that the buccal fat pad (BFP) contains a population of stem cells that share a similar phenotype with ADSCs from abdominal subcutaneous adipose tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0022034512445633">Farré-Guasch <italic>et al</italic>., 2010</xref>). Under appropriate conditions, ADSCs from BFP (B-ADSCs) can differentiate to chondrocytes, osteoblasts, or adipocytes <italic>in vitro</italic>. Therefore, BFP might be a potential cell source for bone engineering in oral and maxillofacial areas, because it is easy to harvest and provides a reliable volume of tissue for oral surgeons.</p>
<p>It is well-known that the recombinant human bone morphogenetic protein-2 (rhBMP-2) enhances the effects of osteoinductive reagents (OSR) on osteogenic differentiation of BMSCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0022034512445633">Lecanda <italic>et al</italic>., 1997</xref>). However, it has been suggested that rhBMP-2 may not influence the osteogenic differentiation of ADSCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0022034512445633">Chou <italic>et al</italic>., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0022034512445633">Zuk <italic>et al</italic>., 2011</xref>). Moreover, though rhBMP-2 has been shown to significantly enhance bone regeneration directly, direct implantation of high doses is known to induce substantial swelling that may cause airway obstruction when applied to oral and cervical areas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0022034512445633">Jung <italic>et al</italic>., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0022034512445633">Patel <italic>et al</italic>., 2006</xref>). An efficient delivery method for the clinical use of rhBMP-2 also remains to be developed.</p>
<p>The aim of this study is to make progress toward establishing suitable cell culture and delivery conditions for B-ADSCs so they can be used for bone regeneration <italic>in vivo</italic>. Here, we analyzed the capacity of rhBMP-2 to induce osteogenesis in B-ADSC cultures and evaluated the efficiency of different culture conditions for B-ADSCs destined for transplantation.</p>

<title>Materials &amp; Methods</title>
<p>This study conformed to the tenets of the Declaration of Helsinki, and the protocol was approved by the Ethics Committee of Nagasaki University Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences.</p>
<p>ADSCs were isolated by enzymatic dissociation after the surgical removal of BFPs (on average, the volume of BFP is 10 mL) from patients with jaw deformity (ages 18, 20, 35 yrs) and cultured as described in previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0022034512445633">Zuk <italic>et al</italic>., 2001</xref>). Any genetic syndromes related to jaw deformity were not recognized in these patients. Briefly, BFPs from patients were digested with 0.1% type II collagenase (Wako, Tokyo, Japan) at 37°C for 40 min. Then, neutralized cells were centrifuged to separate mature adipocytes and the stromal-vascular fraction. Floating adipocytes were removed, and pelleted stromal cells were passed through a 70-µm cell strainer. B-ADSCs were cultured in D-MEM (Wako) containing 10% FBS, 2% antibiotic-antimycotic reagent (Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA) at 37°C in 5% CO<sub>2</sub>. Medium was replaced every 3 days. To ensure phenotypic uniformity, we used the third-passage cells in subsequent experiments.</p>
<p>For flow cytometry with a FACscan argon laser cytometer (BD, San Jose, CA, USA), cells were harvested in 0.25% trypsin/EDTA and fixed for 30 min in ice-cold 2% formaldehyde. The fixed cells were washed in flow-cytometry buffer (PBS, 2% FBS, 0.2% Tween-20) and incubated for 30 min in flow-cytometry buffer containing fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated monoclonal antibodies to Stro-1 (R&amp;D, Minneapolis, MN, USA) and CD antigens 45, 90, and 105 (Becton, Mountain View, CA, USA).</p>
<p>To confirm the presence of Vimentin and Stro-1 proteins in B-ADSCs, we performed immunofluorescence cytostaining. B-ADSCs were cultured in a chamber slide until 70% confluent. The slides were rinsed with PBS and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 30 min. After incubation for 30 min with PBS containing 5% donkey serum albumin (Jackson ImmunoResearch, Baltimore Pike, PA, USA) as a blocking reagent and 0.25% Triton X-100, cells were incubated with mouse monoclonal anti-human Vimentin (1:50) (Dako, Via Real, Carpinteria, CA, USA) or mouse monoclonal anti-human Stro-1 (1:400) for 2 hrs at room temperature (RT). The dishes were then washed with PBS and incubated for 30 min at RT with a secondary antibody (1:200) (FITC-conjugated donkey anti-mouse IgG; Jackson). After being washed 3 times with PBS, dishes were coverslipped with a mounting reagent (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA, USA).</p>
<p>Cell proliferation was measured with a WST-8 kit (Dojindo, Kumamoto, Japan) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Briefly, cells were incubated with medium containing 100 µL/mL of WST-8 for 1 hr. The absorbance was read on a spectrophotometer at 450 nm (SmartSpeck<sup>TM</sup>3000, BIO-RAD, Tokyo, Japan). Alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activities were measured according to the method of Lowry (1955). An aliquot of supernatant was added to p-nitrophenylphosphate containing MgCl<sub>2</sub> (Sigma), and the mixture were incubated at 37<sup>°</sup>C for 15 min. A 0.2-N quantity of NaOH was added to stop the enzymatic reaction, and absorbance was read at 415 nm with a spectrophotometer. ALP activity was expressed as µmol p-nitrophenol/cell. Cell proliferation and ALP activity were evaluated at 5, 7, 10, and 14 days after incubation with or without OSR (100 µM ascorbic acid, 10 mM β-glycerophosphate, and 10<sup>-8</sup> M dexamethasone) or rhBMP-2. On day 0, B-ADSCs were plated at a density of 1.0×10<sup>5</sup> cells/well in 6-well plates containing serum-conditioned D-MEM. On day 1, rhBMP-2 at the concentration of 0 or 300 ng/mL (donated by Astellas-Pharma, Tokyo, Japan) was added to each well, with or without serum-conditioned D-MEM containing OSR (for treatment groups, see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0022034512445633">Table</xref>). In advance, we performed a preliminary experiment to determine the optimum concentration of rhBMP-2, and it was found to be 300 ng/mL (data not shown). Each experiment was performed in triplicate for 3 samples.</p>

<p>On day 14, we assessed <italic>in vitro</italic> calcification by staining with Alizarin red (Sigma). Briefly, 40 mM of Alizarin red was prepared in distilled water and adjusted to pH 6.3 with ammonium hydroxide. Cell layers were rinsed with PBS, fixed in 70% ethanol, and air-dried. Cell layers were stained with Alizarin red at room temperature for 30 min. Cells were washed with distilled water and allowed to dry. Also, total RNA was extracted with TRIZOL reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) on day 14. RNA samples (1 µg) were reverse-transcribed with Revetra-Ace<sup>®</sup> reverse-transcriptase and oligo-dT primers (Invitrogen), according to the manufacturer’s protocol. To analyze gene expression, we used specific primers for PCR amplification as shown in the Appendix Table.</p>
<p>For transplantation, 1×10<sup>5</sup> B-ADSCs in 1 mL of D-MEM supplemented with 10% FBS were mixed with 30 mg of hydroxylapatite (HA) granules (PENTAX, Tokyo Japan), whose size was from 0.6 to 1 mm with 50% porosity, in a 14-mL polypropylene tube. For the next 13 days, cells were cultured in each treatment condition (Contl, OS, BMP, BMP-OS), and each of the conditioned media was replaced every 3 days. After being cultured, cell mixtures were washed in PBS and then transplanted into a 6-week-old female BALB/cAJcl-nu/nu mouse (Nihoncrea, Tokyo, Japan). Under anesthesia, 4 subcutaneous pockets were created in the back of each mouse, and cell-HA composites were transplanted for 8 wks. After the transplants were harvested, they were fixed with 10% formalin, decalcified, and embedded in paraffin wax. Sections were deparaffinized and stained with hematoxylin and eosin. The volume of newly formed bone-like tissue was analyzed with NIH J image software (NIH, Bethesda, MD, USA). The percentage of surface area occupied by bone-like tissues was assessed by light microscopy under 200x magnification in 6 sections from each of 5 specimens. At least 10 fields <italic>per</italic> section were counted. Bone area is expressed as percentage of total area.</p>
<p>Means were analyzed by one-way analysis of variance. Dunnett’s multiple-comparison <italic>t</italic> test was used to detect any significant differences within each group.</p>

<p>B-ADSCs had a characteristic spindle shape and formed a monolayer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0022034512445633">Fig. 1A</xref>). Immunofluorescence analysis revealed that human anti-Vimentin (mesenchymal cell marker) antibody reacted with cultured B-ADSCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0022034512445633">Fig. 1B</xref>), and anti-Stro-1 (multi-lineage stem/progenitor marker) antibody reacted with some cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0022034512445633">Fig. 1C</xref>). Cell-surface markers on B-ADSCs were characterized by immunofluorescence combined with flow-cytometric analysis. Many cells were positive for CD90 (86.28%) and CD105 (54.52%) (mesenchymal stem/progenitor cell markers), and there was a low level of Stro-1 expression (1.13%). In contrast, the expression of CD45 (hematopoietic cell marker) was almost absent (0.01%) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0022034512445633">Fig. 1D</xref>).</p>

<p>Proliferation rates of cultured cells in the rhBMP2 groups were relatively lower than those in other groups for 14 days in culture, but cell numbers in each group did not differ significantly on day 14 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0022034512445633">Fig. 1E</xref>). ALP activity in B-ADSCs was examined to determine optimum differentiation conditions before transplantation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0022034512445633">Fig. 1F</xref>). On day 10, cultured cells in BMP and BMP-OS showed significantly higher ALP activity than those in other groups. Moreover, ALP activities in BMP and BMP-OS were remarkably higher than those in Control and OS by day 14, and this activity in BMP was significantly higher than that in BMP-OS.</p>
<p>Formation of calcified nodules in B-ADSC cultures was examined with Alizarin red staining. ADSCs treated with 300 ng/mL rhBMP-2 (BMP) or treated with OSR and 300 ng/mL rhBMP-2 (BMP-OS) showed distinct and substantial calcified-nodule formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0022034512445633">Fig. 2A</xref>). However, B-ADSCs not treated with rhBMP-2 (Control and OS) showed indistinct and minimal calcified-nodule formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0022034512445633">Fig. 2A</xref>).</p>

<p>Expression of osteoblastic genes, <italic>runx2</italic> (pre-osteoblast-related gene), <italic>ocn</italic>, and <italic>opn</italic> (osteoblast-related genes), in B-ADSC cultures was assessed on day 14 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0022034512445633">Fig. 2B</xref>). Each osteoblastic gene was up-regulated in BMP and BMP-OS, and <italic>ocn</italic> and <italic>opn</italic> were highly expressed in BMP-OS. Furthermore, we investigated expression of 2 adipogenic genes (<italic>pparγ</italic>, adipocyte-related gene; and <italic>lpl</italic>, mature adipocyte-related gene) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0022034512445633">Fig. 2B</xref>).

<p>Transplantation of HA alone did not cause formation of any new mineralized tissues. Moreover, HA treated with 300 ng/mL rhBMP-2 alone did not form mineralized tissues (data not shown). Likewise, B-ADSCs with HA (Contl) did not induce any mineralized tissue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0022034512445633">Fig. 3A</xref>). Even when ADSCs were treated with OSR (OS), formation of mineralized tissues was not detected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0022034512445633">Fig. 3B</xref>). In contrast, bone-like tissues were detected in transplants from both groups, BMP and BMP-OS, in which ADSC cultures had been treated with rhBMP-2 with or without OSR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0022034512445633">Figs. 3C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0022034512445633">3D</xref>). The bone-like tissues formed by BMP and BMP-OS groups had osteocyte-like cell inclusion similar to those in natural bone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0022034512445633">Fig. 3E</xref>). Bone-like tissue in specimens from BMP occupied only approximately 13% of the area of each section (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0022034512445633">Fig. 3F</xref>). However, bone-like tissues occupied approximately 40% of area in specimens from BMP-OS.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Our findings demonstrated that human B-ADSCs were able to reliably induce engineered bone formation. Our outcomes were: (1) reliable enhancement of osteogenic induction of B-ADSC cultures with rhBMP-2, and (2) promotion of bone formation by a synergistic pre-treatment of rhBMP-2 and OSR.</p>
<p>Regarding the buccal fat pad as a stem cell source for bone engineering, a previous study demonstrated that the percentage of ADSCs from the BFP was slightly higher than that from abdominal subcutaneous tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0022034512445633">Farré-Guasch <italic>et al</italic>., 2010</xref>). Therefore, we focused on cells derived from the BFP, and investigated the suitable culture and delivery conditions to exploit the osteogenic potential of B-ADSCs. To establish efficient methods for regenerating bone by cell-based therapies, we have investigated different potential sources of stem cells, including human bone marrow, periosteum, dental pulp, and periodontal ligament (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0022034512445633">Agata <italic>et al</italic>., 2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0022034512445633">2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0022034512445633">Uchida <italic>et al</italic>., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0022034512445633">Ikeda <italic>et al</italic>., 2010</xref>). However, actual cultured cells derived from these tissues consist of a heterogeneous cell population, and contain a relatively limited number of uncommitted MSCs. Indeed, maintaining osteogenic ability in isolated cells harvested from a small amount of these tissues is extremely difficult during culture expansion and passage. So, we expected that adipose tissue would be superior for procuring a sufficient number of MSCs in culture. Previous studies have shown that 30 mL of bone-marrow aspirates produce approximately 1×10<sup>5</sup> cells, while liposuction aspirates yield approximately 3.3×10<sup>7</sup> cells <italic>per</italic> 100 mL of adipose tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0022034512445633">Dragoo <italic>et al</italic>., 2005</xref>). If a large number of MSCs can be harvested from initial tissues, MSC cultures can be expanded without severely diminishing osteogenic potential.</p>
<p>With regard to the reliability of enhanced osteoblastic induction in cultured ADSCs, our results indicated that rhBMP-2 strongly induced the osteogenic differentiation of human B-ADSCs. We found that, after 10 to 14 days in culture, ALP activity in rhBMP-2-treated cells (BMP and BMP-OS) was significantly higher than that in cells treated with only OSR. ALP activity is thought to be an accurate early indicator of osteoblastic differentiation in MSCs. Further, rhBMP-2 treatment induced distinct and substantial calcified-nodule formation and expression of osteogenic mRNAs in B-ADSC cultures. Regarding ‘only OSR’ treatment, although any distinct nodules were not observed at 14 days in culture, Farré-Guasch <italic>et al</italic>. have shown that OSR could induce the calcified-nodule formation at 21days in culture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0022034512445633">Farré-Guasch <italic>et al</italic>., 2010</xref>). This result indicates a superior effect of rhBMP-2 in inducing the osteoblastic differentiation of B-ADSCs. However, ALP activity in rhBMP-2-treated cells with OSR on 14 days was lower than that in cells treated only with rhBMP-2, though <italic>in vivo</italic> bone formation was most substantial when cultured with rhBMP-2 and OSR. Interestingly, expression of 2 adipogenic genes was observed in B-ADSCs treated with rhBMP-2 and OSR. OSR induced <italic>pparγ</italic> mRNA in B-ADSCs, and up-regulation of <italic>ppary</italic> and <italic>lpl</italic> expression may have been caused by synergistic effects of dexamethasone and rhBMP-2. The previous study demonstrated that addition of dexamethasone to growth medium in ADSC cultures resulted in adipogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0022034512445633">Yin <italic>et al</italic>., 2006</xref>). Therefore, some cells in B-ADSCs treated with rhBMP-2 and OSR may cause the direct adipogenic development. However, expression of mature osteoblastic genes such as <italic>ocn</italic> or <italic>opn</italic> was clearly detectable in B-ADSCs treated in this manner. This synergistic effect has apparently induced the maturation of osteoblastic differentiation from B-ADSCs rather than that of adipogenic differentiation. In fact, B-ADSCs pre-treated with rhBMP-2 and OSR generated abundant bone tissue upon <italic>in vivo</italic> transplantation; these B-ADSCs must have differentiated into mature osteoblastic cells while in culture. Pre-treatment that induces mature osteoblastic differentiation from B-ADSCs might be critical for promoting B-ADSC-mediated bone formation.</p>
<p>Our findings strongly indicated that rhBMP-2-mediated osteoblastic differentiation of B-ADSCs must occur in advance of transplantation for successful induction of bone regeneration. However, inducibility of B-ADSCs to form osteoblasts for bone formation still remains unclear, compared with that of other sources such as BMSCs. Additional investigations are needed to understand the practical usefulness of B-ADSCs for reliable bone engineering.</p>
