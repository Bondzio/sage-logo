<p>Shanghai’s peculiar status between 1842 and 1943, its sovereignty degraded in key ways, meant that it gave sanctuary to, and spawned, a wide range of nationalist activity and counteractivity. This essay examines five different layers of activity that the city hosted, and spawned, and explores how they interacted, and touches also on their legacies. It outlines the three key factors that gave shape to the city and to its overt and covert political communities: space, law, and time (or the calendar). The essay explores the interplay of the physical and administrative realms that cut across the city, the restrictions they imposed, and the opportunities they opened up, and shows vividly how nationalism and the urban intersected in this site of multinational imperial power.</p>

<p>A Shanghai policeman’s lot was always a busy one. The streets were full, crammed with rickshaws, wheelbarrows, motors, and trams and washed over always by pedestrians, peddlers, idlers, loafers, jaywalkers, streetwalkers. There were about four million residents by 1941, all on the move, and all chattering in a babel of tongues—fifty-two different nationalities at the most recent formal count in 1935, and those of no-nationality too, and more than fifty-two languages, including a much maligned but functional pidgin-English and numerous Chinese dialects. The jails were full, the courts were full to bursting.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0096144212449139">1</xref></sup> The calendar was full. The pocket diary issued to European members of the force that policed the foreign-run International Settlement in the city contained three full pages of Anniversaries and Holidays. The 1943 edition contains some anniversaries that might not have been listed in previous versions prepared before the onset of the Pacific War, for it very fully represents the holidays of the Japanese who had taken over the entire city on December 8, 1941, but its earlier incarnations would have noted many of them.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0096144212449139">2</xref></sup> This was no aide-memoire, of mildly interesting dates that a Shanghai policeman ought to be aware of: it was not a multicultural guide. This was a security brief, a reminder of flashpoints, of police leave to be canceled and duties to be doubled. This calendar was brim-full of trouble in this city brim-full of people. It was a call to police action, to batten down hatches, haul up barricades, check the sandbags, and prepare for the worst. These dates often marked the contentious recent past, and mapped out contentious futures. For the days came around again and again, inexorably.</p>
<p>What did these days mean <italic>in practice</italic> for a Shanghai policeman? Let us take August 9, for example, and let us do so before the Japanese takeover. On August 6, 1940, the chief of the Shanghai Municipal Police’s (SMP’s) uniform branch circulated a six-page outline of “precautionary measures” being adopted to deal with the third anniversary of the outbreak of Sino-Japanese hostilities at Shanghai on August 9, 1937. On the evening of the 5th as a curfew came into force, all available personnel, backed by the riot squad, had been raiding tea shops, lodging houses, and hotels, detaining “all known suspects, loiterers,” those “who fail to give a satisfactory account . . . of their presence in the Settlement.” All were to remain detained “at the discretion” of Senior officers. Five bridges were closed; twenty-one street intersection barricades were installed; traffic over four further bridges was to be inspected by police and military personnel. The Shanghai Volunteer Corps (SVC), the foreign militia, was mobilized, as was the “Special”—volunteer—police. Defence force units from five different foreign powers patrolled major streets. Special posts were established at newspaper offices, which had been a target for bomb attacks.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0096144212449139">3</xref></sup> Mobilization ahead of anniversaries had become a routine feature of settlement life well before the war. It was certainly inflected by the anomalous position of the settlement after 1937, an unconquered island surrounded by Japanese-controlled territory. But it involved a heightening of business as usual, and business as usual meant dealing with this congeries of incendiary dates.</p>
<p>Shanghai then was like any major global urban center, yet it was also unlike all of them. It was a palimpsest city, overlayered with different legal structures and policing agencies, and it was a city of borders. Urban diversity itself was not unusual. Over a third of New York City’s population in 1920 was foreign-born; in Buenos Aries the proportion was higher. But all those city residents were subject to one legal system: at Shanghai there were multiple layers of laws. Now, this singular city is not an everywhere, but on this relatively tiny but crowded Chinese stage was performed yearly all the theater associated with the ritual life of a bewildering array of empires and republics and their enemies. This was often presented as evidence of cosmopolitanism, of amicable multinational encounter, getting merrily along in a babble of tongues, for the diplomats and consuls and leading lights of the different communities, were all kept convivially busy attending each other’s shows and parades, spouting platitudes, raising toasts to mutual amity and regard. Here was a happy united nations in Chinese miniature, an augury of global harmony to come.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0096144212449139">4</xref></sup> But this performance of the nation was always also plainly competitive, and at times adversarial or revolutionary in intent. Shanghai was the site of Chinese, Indian, Taiwanese, Vietnamese, and Korean antiimperialist activism, and more besides, including a range of Zionist activity, the Comintern, and also, for good measure, a branch of a Russian Nazi Party. It was, one historian notes, the “crucible in which the Japanese Communist Party was forged.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0096144212449139">5</xref></sup> Activists plotted, students learned, spies hid, and policemen watched and searched.</p>
<p>Shanghai’s peculiarities gave sanctuary to, and spawned, a wide range of activity and counteractivity. This essay examines five different layers of activity that Shanghai hosted, and spawned, and explores how they interacted, and it touches also on their legacies. Before it does that it will first outline the three key factors that gave shape to the city and to its overt and covert political lives. Those factors are space, law, and time, or more specifically in the case of this last, the calendar. As the essay shows, the interplay of the physical and administrative realms that cut across the city, their restrictions and the opportunities they opened up—perhaps nowhere as clearly and so polyphonically as Shanghai—shows vividly how nationalism and the urban intersected. It was no melting pot, but it generated intense heat, transforming the aims and reach of nationalisms and their enemies.</p>
<sec id="section1-0096144212449139">
<title>Space</title>
<p>Increasingly in the twentieth century Shanghai was for people across China, and internationally, an idea, but it was also a (fractured) physical site, a node, a vector. But it was a space. At its basic level, Shanghai was one city, and always only one city. A thriving trading center, despite its low administrative importance, it was opened to foreign trade in November 1843 under the Treaty of Nanjing which ended the first opium war. A British settlement was laid out, along the riverfront northeast of the original walled city, largely because residents refused to rent property to the new arrivals. The French arrived soon after and claimed a settlement for themselves. The “English ground” grew, amalgamated with an American settlement, and became an “International Settlement,” under no single foreign authority, administered by an elected Municipal Council on which representation was, however, allocated by nationality (so many seats for Britons, so many for Americans, Japanese, Germans). The French zone took a different course, maintaining exclusivity and becoming a formal part of the French empire, under the authority of the Governor-General of Indo China. The Consul-General ran that concession with an advisory council.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0096144212449139">6</xref></sup></p>
<p>The original walled city and the new extramural suburbs were governed by an evolving form of pretty much fractured administration until, in 1927, the new National Government of the Guomindang established a single Special Municipality of Greater Shanghai. Its remit was to contest and control the authority of the foreign settlements, and prepare to supersede them.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0096144212449139">7</xref></sup> A key feature of the two foreign zones was that they expanded, officially, becoming far larger than their initial small sites, and they remained hungry for more. They bought land beyond the settlement, laid out roads, and then claimed policing and other rights along them, aiming to move to bring them and adjacent land into the settlements.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-0096144212449139">8</xref></sup></p>
<p>Shanghai was a modest port of no particular standing but with clear potential for greater international trade when it was opened. Foreign trade, war, and rebellion changed all this. Refugees from the Taiping rebels, and indeed Taiping refugees from the Qing, came into the settlements, an important part of the business of which switched to focus on serving these new communities, whose rents proved lucrative and presence long lasting. It was a property speculator’s dream. Refugees never stopped coming throughout Shanghai’s modern history: they came from the suburbs, from the Yangzi delta. They came in the 1920s from Russia, and in the 1930s from Europe. War, as ever, fueled an economic boom that survived a bust or two.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-0096144212449139">9</xref></sup> Shanghai became a new pole in China’s nineteenth century, and the site of much of China’s twentieth, before the country was brutally reshaped by the Chinese Communist Party after 1949.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-0096144212449139">10</xref></sup> This party was, naturally, founded in Shanghai. It was the industrial, financial, educational, and cultural capital of the country, sucking in students to schools, colleges, and universities, and drawing in laborers and, after 1895, factory hands. It was a point of arrival and departure for those studying overseas who often sojourned there before departure or sought employment there after returning. It was a publishing center churning out newspapers, journals, textbooks, translations. As Europe was diverted by the First World War, Shanghai boomed again. The value of its international trade doubled between 1912 and 1920, its manufacturing capacity greatly increased.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-0096144212449139">11</xref></sup> After 1927, the administrative capital of the republic was based at Nanjing, handily close enough for politicians and bureaucrats to weekend in the city. Others across China dreamed of being there. There was always much, much more to China than Shanghai, but for many of China’s best educated and most politically alert, not much more.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-0096144212449139">12</xref></sup></p>
<p>So this one bustling city was run by three administrations. But in fact there were by the 1920s about five or sometimes six distinct policing zones (seven if you count the harbor, under the jurisdiction of the Maritime Customs River Police).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-0096144212449139">13</xref></sup> Two of those were areas of at times fractiously if not bloodily contested sovereignty, for they were areas claimed by the foreign administrations, who asserted policing rights. All three councils had their own local rules, regulations, and byelaws. It functioned physically as one city nonetheless, in the daily lives of its foreign and Chinese residents. But obviously, there was great potential for playing games, for it was easy enough to hop over a “border,” and take advantage of different political climates from one zone to the next. The police forces negotiated “hot-pursuit” agreements, but it was a culture of wily location and relocation that flourished, although the absence of a single unified administration certainly helped stoke the rise of underworld gangs, who acquired tremendous power in the 1920s and 1930s.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn14-0096144212449139">14</xref></sup> War brought further changes and created new zones. After the Shanghai battles at the onset of the Japanese invasion of China in 1937, which crashed through the northern Chinese suburbs, Japanese forces retained control of the northern districts and eastern districts of the International Settlement, where the majority of Japanese residents lived.</p>
<p>We should also mention water, specifically the waterfront Bund, its riverside embankment, a front face, viewed as such, of symbolic importance and so a key site and location of memorials and quasi-public space. The Bund is important because this city in fact lacked other public space. There were no squares or piazzas, and no commons. Private gardens and parks were established, but only the Bund could function as a near public space. As a result, it was a site of display, and a site of reference and thereby a site of insistent contestation. Always across the water, moored opposite the Bund and downstream in the Huangpu were warships of the treaty powers, among the opium hulks, tea clippers, and other merchant vessels, river gunboats, ships of the British China station, or other European Asia squadrons. The city’s spatial peculiarity shaped its local politics, but also provided sites for various species of international politics and the performance there of politics imported from elsewhere in Asia and in Europe.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-0096144212449139">
<title>Law, laws</title>
<p>So, as we shall see, space matters. However, overlaying these physical boundaries and anomalies, which except in emergency were never fenced or gated, or even guarded, was a multiplicity of jurisdictions, twenty or so of them at their peak.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn15-0096144212449139">15</xref></sup> So at least twenty different sets of laws applied, as well as municipal regulations and byelaws. How so? Firstly, these two zones were not colonies. Their Chinese residents were not colonial subjects. To a greater or lesser extent, and in changing ways over time, Chinese subjects were always followed by Chinese national law around the entire city. Sometimes, of course, they were accorded a protection from the state by the foreign authorities, directly or indirectly. To protect its own autonomy, but also because of a sympathy with some currents of political thought, the international settlement buffered Chinese residents from the Chinese state. They could profit from a quasi status with little legal underpinning, which created space for Chinese activities, although it was insecure and the foreign authorities could be capricious.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn16-0096144212449139">16</xref></sup></p>
<p>Foreign nationals from recognized powers—those that had formal treaties with China—were subject to their consuls, in whichever section they lived or worked, or were arrested.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn17-0096144212449139">17</xref></sup> And many worked in one zone, and resided in another. A policeman’s job involved informing the relevant consular authorities without delay when he took into custody a treaty national. His diary gave the addresses of the consulates.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn18-0096144212449139">18</xref></sup> Not all non-Chinese had this status, but nationals of the treaty powers were the most numerous in the city (Russians aside). This was a licence for canny entrepreneurs on both sides of the law, but most obviously for crime, for playing games with extraterritoriality. A Spanish-owned, French-rented, American sublet, Mexican managed, Russian-, Spanish-, British-, and Chinese-staffed casino on an extra-settlement road could tie up lawyers and hamper effective policing. (This might seem absurd, but is in fact a recorded example.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn19-0096144212449139">19</xref></sup>) But in the same way a Chinese-language newspaper, registered at the U.S. consulate, because published, in some sufficient way, by an American national, could partly evade the full rigor of Chinese press laws. Law thwarted policing.</p>
<p>The treaty system across China—for it became a system, a veritable if weird architecture of treaty, agreement, protocol, and precedence—made new space physically and legally, a Chinese frontier zone in which much was uncertain, for the letter of the treaties failed to account for all the new possibilities of the China coast worlds. The virtue of the treaties in most foreign eyes, was not what they laid out in their simultaneously translated pages but what they did not outline. Vagueness was strength.</p>
<p>The casino example suggests that nonetheless there was such a thing as a clearly definable British or Dutch subject. But the British presence, like the Japanese or the French one, was multinational by design, by chance, or by opportunity. The British brought Sikhs to the city to police it, Sindhi traders came, Sephardis came from Bombay very early on.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn20-0096144212449139">20</xref></sup> The British were southeast Asian Chinese, Australian and West Indian Chinese, they were Dominions nationals and Chinese. The French brought Vietnamese. The “Japanese” in China could be Koreans, Taiwanese, even, Chinese. National status was not fixed, either. It might be pragmatically extended; it might be withdrawn from individuals and groups. It might be spuriously claimed as well, and often was, most notoriously by Eastern European women working as prostitutes in the early twentieth century, for foreign Shanghai preferred “American girls” in its brothels. As a result of the scandal this generated, the U.S. authorities eventually stepped in to clarify the situation, and restrict American status to genuine U.S. citizens.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn21-0096144212449139">21</xref></sup> And consular jurisdiction in some cases involved more than a consul with a law book. The Japanese developed a sophisticated Consular police service operating across China, with a large contingent in the city, adding another layer of policing.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn22-0096144212449139">22</xref></sup> These layers of legal dominion and actual structures sometimes interacted, and could conflict, and they provided a singular challenge for administration of any part of the city, and many singular opportunities.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0096144212449139">
<title>Time</title>
<p>To turn again to the calendar. Shanghai’s residents lived in one city, under different laws. Guide books and <italic>vade mecums</italic> helped them thread their ways around. They shared the days, but they lived in fact by different calendars. The republican Chinese state marked the years since its inception, in this case 1911, so that 1943 was Minguo 32 nian: the 32nd Year of the Republic, but that aside it marked the days in the Gregorian calendar, the “Western” style (and called it that): twelve months and fifty-two weeks. This was an issue of modernity and of a self-consciously modernizing nationalist project. In practice, this city, like all of China, worked on two calendars, even though one of these, the calendar of the lunar year, was illegal, supplanted officially after 1928 by the “modern” Western solar calendar. The SMP monitored the public use of the old calendar, enforcing the laws of the National Government, confiscating calendars from publishers.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn23-0096144212449139">23</xref></sup> The aim of this prohibition was a self-styled plan to “modernise” Chinese culture. After 1911, the republican state aimed to make republicans out of Chinese, and so tried to dispense with the agrarian year, which it deemed was unfit for twentieth-century China.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn24-0096144212449139">24</xref></sup> It still determined much of the annual cycle of life and business—debts were paid off, employees expected bonuses, the country shut down for the holidays. But the first President of the new republic was installed officially on January 1, 1912, a significant date in the foreign calendar deliberately chosen to mark a significant foundational event for the new Chinese order.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn25-0096144212449139">25</xref></sup></p>
<p>The Western year was itself already home to a multiplicity of calendars of course.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn26-0096144212449139">26</xref></sup> For every foreign nation officially active in Shanghai brought with it languages and anniversaries: the birthdays of monarchs, saints days, republican anniversaries, and national days. But the new Chinese state now also deliberately marked out a territory for nationalist action through the calendar.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn27-0096144212449139">27</xref></sup> It initiated this by building on understandings of republican civic culture overseas as well as that demonstrated on its doorstep, and it was in many ways one of the most obviously successful strands of the republicanizing project. Its enemies added fuel with every shooting, bombardment, or invasion, for they red-lettered new dates in the nationalist year, and as we have seen, dates were no mere anniversaries but sites of action.</p>
<p>The same year that the Western calendar was ordered to be used, 1928, the new Chinese government also set about populating it with official National days, mostly “National Humiliation” days, 26 of them in fact. Only December lacked one. May was the busiest month, the cruellest for policemen, the 1st, 3rd, 4th, 5th, 7th, 9th, and 30th all taken up.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn28-0096144212449139">28</xref></sup> So official nationalism was marked by these dates in the Western calendar, not by dates in the lunar year. There was a new political rhythm to the year and, most notably felt, to the Chinese urban year.</p>
<p>A humiliation day was supposed to be a day of consciousness-raising activity. There might be a public holiday, there might be covert events. Events on such a day might be party-led, or result from popular activism. Meetings would be held, songs sung, dramas might be performed. Handbills were distributed. Always there was a fear of their subversion by “radical elements.” Marchers progressed to sites of memorial. Even where a site had had to be established outside the International Settlement, a progression might symbolically tie it back in by marching through the foreign-controlled streets. The police developed a set of generic routines for “Anniversary days,” more or less operationalized as advance intelligence or the wider political situation suggested necessary.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn29-0096144212449139">29</xref></sup></p>
<p>So spatial simplicity, and spatial complexity, and the parallel simplicities and complexities of legal status, generated opportunity in this East China city. Modernizing projects provided a framework for making sense of the political year, indeed for making it a properly political year. And where the new republican state led, others followed, marking the days, waiting for the anniversary, waiting to swing into action. Hidden between or behind these lines are other dates, forgotten massacres, underground national days. Threading through all of three of these, of course, are Shanghai’s peoples, the fifty-two nationalities of the 1935 census. Sheer variety itself is of no import, nor is the fact of economic power being held by different national groups in the city. But there were distinctive features to the Shanghai situation: first, the link between nationality and formal power through control of municipal administrations, that is, the internationalizing of the politics of municipal affairs; second, the deployment to and in Shanghai of nonmetropolitan nationals by formal treaty nations for their own ends, and to destabilize their rivals; and third, the functioning of the city as a refugee haven, and the functioning of its different zones in different ways in that regard.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0096144212449139">
<title>Layers</title>
<p>We turn now to look at five layers of activity that populated this policeman’s calendar: settler nationalism, “cosmopolitanism” (or intraimperial solidarity), imperial and other nationalisms, antiimperialist nationalism, and Chinese activism in the city.</p>
<p>The first layer seems the most parochial, and the least noteworthy, but it is intimately tied to a wider world, and enmeshed in all other Shanghai developments. This was the development of a conscious local <italic>settler</italic> nationalism, a “Shanghailander” identity, a variant of the British settler or colonial nationalism more familiar to us from Rhodesia, Natal, or the Dominions. It was Anglophone, loyalist, and had autonomous ambition. Shanghai, in this view, ought to be a free city, a self-governing city republic, free of British and other diplomatic restraint. Unlike most of the treaty port administrations, the settlement at Shanghai was not under consular heel. It zealously guarded its sovereignty from the ordinary practices of the Chinese state, and from treaty consuls too. It called on the British state in times of crisis, but otherwise attempted to navigate its own way. This may seem absurd. But the hold of foreign consuls over the Council was constitutionally weak and underdefined. The Council took a mandate, in its eyes, from its—foreign—electorate. This was a logical outcome of the imprecision of treaty, and these dreams were pursued into the 1930s by local foreign actors and interests. On the whole, as long as the international settlement municipality delivered the goods for the British empire, principally stability, the British empire tolerated its local peculiarities and anomalies, sniggered at its pomp and pretension, and left it alone. When it failed to do so, most notably in May 1925, when the police shot dead twelve demonstrators, sparking a nationwide anti-British and antiimperialist movement, then the state attempted to move back in.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn30-0096144212449139">30</xref></sup></p>
<p>This identity had certain clear bounds. It was Anglophone, although it paid an important lip-service to “cosmopolitanism” and it had supporters in other national communities. It displayed all the features of a nascent Anglophone settler state. This ambitious parochialism attempted to build on the strong community of economic interests that enmeshed many of the Chinese and foreign local elite to incorporate some Chinese interests into its autonomous vision. It was never really going to succeed in that enterprise. But it was an identity aspired to by other national groups, whose marginal status left them intensely vulnerable, in particular Russians.</p>
<p>This was a “white” nationalism, embedded in a parochial community of interests, but race and imperial solidarities were part of the wider foreign establishment at Shanghai, as elsewhere in China, and this is my second layer. “Blood is thicker than water,” American naval Commodore Josiah Tattnall famously and dryly noted, defending his active involvement, though neutral, in the 1859 Dagu forts battle between British and Chinese forces.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn31-0096144212449139">31</xref></sup> And as news of the Franco-Prussian war hit the city on August 10, 1870, the response of the main English-language newspaper set this out clearly:
<disp-quote>
<p>Few in Shanghai knew how thoroughly recent events had separated them from home methods of thought and action, and how intense was the . . . feeling which bound them together, till the news of a general European war stalled the settlement last week. The feeling of half-amazement, half-incredulity, with which men who had daily been in communication regarded one another, on news that under other circumstances, they would be at deadly feud, was probably peculiar to Shanghai; as was also the consciousness that here, on the furthest limits of civilization, there might, without loss of patriotism, be substituted other aims and means.</p>

<p>“Recent events” referred to the massacre of French and other foreign nationals in June that year at Tianjin, but “peculiar” patriotism at Shanghai was often discussed. It was, noted one historian, a “deformed echo” of metropolitan norms, but that is also to say that it was a colonial norm for that always differed from “home methods.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn32-0096144212449139">32</xref></sup> Still, the French at Shanghai celebrated Napoleon’s feast day that August 15 with a gusto that was clearly heightened by the news of the war, and in turn, Germans in the settlement marked the Kaiser’s birthday the following March with all the show of a victory party, but in formal terms, solidarity held, though it was tested. “The glory of France,” declaimed the French Consul, directed that the ties which bound the “diverse communities and diverse nationalities”—European, white communities—should be maintained. He quoted approvingly the call from the British judge at Shanghai, for residents to remember, that “though you may be subjects of rival and hostile governments, your mutual relations are of a far more intimate and holy character.” This was the “holy character” of “whiteness” and Christian civilization.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn33-0096144212449139">33</xref></sup></p>
<p>Foreign Shanghai’s public cosmopolitan life was in many ways anodyne by necessity. It performed a type of rhetorical cosmopolitanism, which aimed at limiting the giving of offence, save in many ways to the overwhelmingly Chinese population of the city (although this was sometimes an explicit consideration in policy debates). In effect, Shanghai mostly followed Basil Fawlty’s wise dictum and didn’t mention the war, not in public at least, whichever the war that was going on. After the Japanese invasion of Manchuria in 1931, and especially after the onset of the full-scale but undeclared war in 1937, the police and local byelaws were used to suppress Chinese newspaper debate about the Japanese (so many publications reregistered as foreign-controlled interests).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn34-0096144212449139">34</xref></sup> After 1938, it also suppressed German and Austrian Jewish refugee criticisms of the Nazi regime, “owing to the international character of the Settlement.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn35-0096144212449139">35</xref></sup> And in fact it performed a bare minimum of specifically local communal events. The most well known was in 1893, when it commemorated its Silver Jubilee.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn36-0096144212449139">36</xref></sup> More often than not, its communal performances were restricted to annual parades and inspections of the volunteer militia, and to funerals. The Shanghai Volunteer Corps was a “cosmopolitan” corps under unified command, but it was organized by nationality, and each unit wore its national uniform.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn37-0096144212449139">37</xref></sup> The community marshaled solidarity at moments of crisis or in the aftermath of disaster. In 1896 a German naval gunboat, the SMS <italic>Iltis</italic>, freshly sailed from Shanghai, foundered on the Shandong coast. At Shanghai a memorial was built to the men, on a river-side plot donated by the big British firm Jardine Matheson. It was unveiled with all the paraphernalia of public, multinational, communal solidarity, but it was a German memorial, and was also accorded thereafter specific functions within the German community (on Heroes’ day) and for German visitors.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn38-0096144212449139">38</xref></sup></p>
<p>So there was no yearly cycle of display of Shanghai’s parochial cosmopolitan identity. On the whole, Shanghai’s foreign communities most strongly demonstrated their cosmopolitan ethos and interests when they assembled at the Shanghai Race Club for its Spring and Autumn meets. There they spoke the simple lingua franca of the turf. There they were undoubtedly happy in themselves.</p>
<p>The third layer has already been foreshadowed—the performance of national identity in an international city. This had different drivers. For a start, integrating colonial outposts into wider colonial circuits was always important to local interests, which needed to at least superficially normalize their local anomalies, to make sure that the diplomats (who they always greatly distrusted) were gingered up and alive to the importance of their task. The visit of royal or indeed republican celebrity was a crucial way to do this. There were the visits to Shanghai of the Duke of Edinburgh (1869), Grand Duke Alexis of Russia (1872), the Duke of Connaught (1890), Prussia’s Prince Henry (1898), Japan’s Prince Fushimi Sadanaru (1907), and of former U.S. President General Grant (1879). The foreign community turned out <italic>en masse</italic> and <italic>en fête</italic>, all participating. There were parades, salutes, lanterns lighting the waterfront, banquets, and addresses. There was music, there was cheering, and always there were fireworks. Ideally there would be some memorial to unveil on that riverside Bund, or a foundation stone to lay. The Duke of Connaught unveiled a memorial to the British diplomat Harry Parkes. Prince Henry unveiled the <italic>Iltis</italic> monument.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn39-0096144212449139">39</xref></sup> The visits of lesser celebrity were also important—General Charles Gordon’s, for example, in 1880. These public events were certainly more than simply excuses for a self-regarding treat; they were more than a little bit of fun and color to punctuate days “on the furthest limits of civilization.” They were designed to send messages far and wide about the place and meaning of Shanghai within wider British, German, French, or other worlds, and locally too.</p>
<p>More routinely, the Shanghai year was punctuated by national communal celebration marking royal birthdays and state holidays—notably July 4 and 14—and to a lesser extent (after its inauguration in 1903), Empire Day for Britons. The warships always in the harbor provided a supply of marines of sailors to bulk out the crowds, and add some military color and style. Royal jubilees and coronations were marked out with festivities, more soberly too the passing of monarchs. The pages of the August 1913 edition of a local illustrated magazine, <italic>Social Shanghai</italic>, show this routine life. Here are reports on July 4 and 14, the latter with a torchlight parade and fireworks, and earlier celebrations in June marking the Silver Jubilee of the ascension to the throne of Kaiser Wilhelm II, with electric illuminations of the buildings of the Bund, parades, thanksgiving services.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn40-0096144212449139">40</xref></sup> There was a clear competitive edge to this, as there was to service in the SVC. The bigger the British splash, and the more illuminating the German lights, the more surely, it was assumed, imperial rivals and Qing officials got a message about the British or the German state’s commitment.</p>
<p>This is all routine enough. It was important in the era of the new imperialism, in particular, for it shows how expatriate communities tried to fix themselves into the circuits of empires, the literal circuits of royal and celebrity tours, and the metaphorical circuits of ideas, rituals, and novel traditions of empires. But in the era of world war and the tense decades between the two wars, republican and imperial chauvinism could also provide reason for conflict. The norms of cosmopolitan practice proved impractical. For example, communal self-reliance had seen the creation of a Shanghai Volunteer Corps in 1854, which by the early twentieth century had a settled and routine form and key function in settlement defence plans. Between 1914 and 1917, China was a neutral power, and therefore its settlements and concessions were also neutralized.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn41-0096144212449139">41</xref></sup> Germans and Britons, the French and the Austrians, still lived and worked in the settlement. “No greater patriotism can be shown by the different communities gathered in Shanghai,” editorialized the <italic>North China Herald</italic> on August 8, 1914, “than in determining to respect each other’s feelings for the common good during the dark days of war.” The “common good” was their “heritage in Shanghai.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn42-0096144212449139">42</xref></sup> For three years thereafter, they had to ignore each other and to find ways of negotiating the streets and the business of the city, with minimal contact. This was difficult not least because many, especially Anglo-German, interests were tightly entwined and because their respective social headquarters both sat on the Bund. But also because of the integration of public life. The German company of the SVC kept on drilling, but tacit agreement saw Allied and Central power units of the SVC practice shooting each other in different parts of the city. At the furthest limits of civilization, it was as well to be civilized about such things.</p>
<p>With the end of the First World War, the dreams of White solidarity were themselves shot. On the early morning of December 1, 1918, “persons unknown”—French sailors largely—pulled down the <italic>Iltis</italic> monument, ripping up for good this public manifestation of white cosmopolitanism.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn43-0096144212449139">43</xref></sup> The German Club had been seized by the Chinese government, and thereafter became a bank. A deliberate travesty of the cosmopolitan ensembles and decoration that formerly marked the Settlement was held on November 21, when a victory parade made its way through the Settlement as part of three days of celebrations.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn44-0096144212449139">44</xref></sup> Trams were converted into floats bedecked with the flags of the victors, one contrasting a gauntleted fist grasping the globe—“The German Aim”—with a second globe, “Kept Free by Victory.” The Club Concordia was draped with a banner proclaiming “Hun Club,” picturing a silhouetted picklehaube-wearing figure arms raised in surrender. So cosmopolitanism was surrendered on the Bund.</p>
<p>Public commemoration of national days in the interwar years had its official round, but was now sometimes far more pointed. These routine functions always served their precise moment, swinging in and out of the forefront of public consciousness as the political landscape and situation suggested. In 1927 on the King’s Birthday, British troops staged a spectacular tattoo over two nights at the Shanghai Race Course ground, “burning” down the Kremlin as part of the show during their performance of the “1812 Overture.” The anticommunist message at this high tide of the Chinese revolution, and two months after the Guomindang’s decisively bloody anticommunist purge of April 1927, was all too obvious. Loyalty and empire “spirit” were usually less theatrically demonstrated on Empire Day and the King’s Birthday: this was triumphalism.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn45-0096144212449139">45</xref></sup></p>
<p>The growing fractures and tensions in the European ranks found other outlets. Cinemas are a case in point. While British soldiers marched and fired the Kremlin, Italian and French servicemen were mobilized to contest alleged slurs on national pride. French soldiers disrupted showings of <italic>Beau Geste</italic> in 1928, in parallel to French diplomatic efforts across the world to thwart showings of the film. Italian marines raided another cinema in January 1929, seized its copy of the film <italic>Street Angel</italic>, and burnt it publicly.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn46-0096144212449139">46</xref></sup> The quasi-public space of the cinema became a site for contestation. And very shortly afterwards was the site of similar attacks by Chinese activists on films deemed anti-Chinese.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn47-0096144212449139">47</xref></sup> Cinemas opened a new public space within the settlement that was fought over.</p>
<p>The embarrassments and problems of intraimperial conflict were clearly a feature in settlement life and politics. The problems of antiimperialist activity within the foreign community were too, and this is our fourth layer. An SMP Special Branch file notes the various arrangements made for March 29, 1932, the Birthday of the Japanese emperor. This was not entirely routine, for the nasty, short Sino-Japanese war in Shanghai had only just come to a close, and the Japanese were clearly intending this as a victory parade, but numbers of soldiers apart it was really still a fairly ordinary national event.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn48-0096144212449139">48</xref></sup> Troops were to march past the Japanese Minister to China, the Consul-General, senior military officials and others, assembled in the International settlement’s Hongkew Park. The Japanese community was to assemble; its children were to have an afternoon of games after the review had finished with a 101-gun salute.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn49-0096144212449139">49</xref></sup> This is what usually happened on national days. Soldiers marched, and there was always a party for the children. A twenty-three-year-old Korean, Yoon Bong-Gil, spoilt things, however, by bombing the dignitaries, killing two of them, and badly wounding others. As a Japanese subject, Yoon was able to enter the park—Chinese were excluded that day on security grounds—but while he will have made use of his extraterritorial status in Shanghai, he and about one thousand Korean residents in the city had pledged allegiance to the Korean Provisional Government, established in Shanghai in 1919 after the failure of the pro-independence March 1 Movement.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn50-0096144212449139">50</xref></sup></p>
<p>Either as a matter of deliberate policy, by deploying personnel or encouraging migration of communities, or else by virtue of the attractions and opportunities that it offered, the imperial presences in Shanghai were always multinational. This was their strength, but it was also a weakness. Colonial subjects came to the city under the colonial umbrella, and it became as a result a significant and worrying site of anticolonial activism. Shanghai housed at least this one government in exile, which sponsored activities across China and Manchuria, despite its own internecine and strategic conflicts and contradictions.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn51-0096144212449139">51</xref></sup> The Koreans were refugees in this refugee’s city. A Korean could arrive as a Japanese national, could stay safely in the French concession, but not the international settlement, where Japan had treaty rights, and the municipal police had to liaise with the Japanese consular police to harass the Koreans.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn52-0096144212449139">52</xref></sup> He or she could develop ties with Chinese nationalists and others. The size of the urban throng and the porosity of the administrative borders within the city meant that the entire city could still be traversed, albeit with a little caution. And all the benefits of siting this activity in an East Asian hub were clear—better Shanghai for them than a city further from the Japanese consular police, but less centrally placed as a cross-road of people, ideas, and print. Only with Japanese victory in the greater Shanghai campaign in late 1937 did the Koreans move out, heading west with the Chinese central government.</p>
<p>Indian nationalists came for different reasons, and their political geography of the city was different. They were mostly there as colonial security personnel, not refugees, or as economic migrants. Sikhs became an important part of the SMP and, as a result, of the wider security world in the city, as private watchmen for individuals and firms.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn53-0096144212449139">53</xref></sup> There was recurrent unrest over pay and conditions, but the slowly growing key issue for the British after 1914 was anti-British nationalism in the shape of the Ghadr movement, and then during the war through German actions to aid such revolutionaries. Shanghai, complained the Briton who was international settlement Commissioner of Police in 1915, was “a haven of refuge for the seditionist who is afraid to land in British territory,” despite the arrest of “many” there that year. Even so, he resisted any pragmatic active collaboration with British Indian intelligence, which established an office in the city the following year, to preserve the “international” character of the settlement police.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn54-0096144212449139">54</xref></sup> Eight years later, despite the introduction of new regulations to attempt to control the movement of Indians, he complained that those who had openly “Bolshevik tendencies . . . can vent their opinions and create discontent and alarm . . . with impunity” in Shanghai.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn55-0096144212449139">55</xref></sup> They could do so from the safety of Zhabei, under Chinese jurisdiction, where the anti-British Indian Youth League based itself.</p>
<p>In 1927, the Government of India detached an intelligence officer to the city, who worked closely with the SMP to monitor Indian nationalist activists. Links between Indian activists and the Guomindang and Comintern were feared, and with good reason. The SMP Special Branch established in 1927 an Indian Section, which by summer 1929 had developed files on a thousand men, 125 “subversives” among them, and photographs of another thousand. This period of intense surveillance was scaled back by 1930, but a persistent threat remained from the Indian Youth League, and other groups physically beyond British reach.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn56-0096144212449139">56</xref></sup> The Sikh was a figure of colonial power for Britons, and omnipresent on Shanghai streets. Chinese residents were often virulent, and racist, in their antipathy to this presence. Chinese nationalists could find allies within their community. And Sikhs, too, were a source of constant anxiety for the British.</p>
<p>These two examples are the most prominent, but there were others too. Vietnamese communist agents worked in the city to suborn colonial troops. As the “American girls” in the 1900s had forced a tightening up of U.S. consular power over its nationals, so in a similar way, Korean and Sikh activism dragged in new agencies of imperial states, prompted new regulations, and prompted networking across colonies within and between empires. Their own rivalries could hamper this, and both were hampered by the gray areas of law and jurisdiction that underpinned the Shanghai settlements. They took rough and ready action sometimes, when they felt like it, but on the whole were constrained by law.</p>
<p>The greatest fear was the mirror of that complacent assumption of White solidarity despite conflict. What if there was Asian solidarity, and an anticolonial solidarity? And of course, there was. For what better incubator of anticolonial resistance could there be than fragmented Shanghai. On March 1, 1929, the tenth anniversary of the Declaration of Korean independence, three hundred Shanghai Koreans assembled in a Baptist church in the French concession. A Korean detective from the International Settlement police recorded how they were addressed by leaders of the Provisional Government, but also by a Taiwanese revolutionary and, via a letter read to the meeting, by the Indian Youth League. “Members of the association hope for Korean independence,” it read, “as well as Indian independence because they are brothers in the same condition.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn57-0096144212449139">57</xref></sup> Some of the Koreans in the audience wore Chinese Nationalist Army uniform. This was the nightmare of empires: antiimperialist solidarity across nationalist movements, Asians talking to Asians. Show this report to the Japanese authorities, minuted the head of Special Branch. But they probably had it already (not least as they had spies in the SMP). But the Japanese consular police had been growing, although it had not reached its 1933 state of more than forty staff, outnumbering the SMP Special Branch. These were organized into sections devoted to the affairs of Taiwanese, Koreans, Russians, and Japanese (mainly communists), as well as Chinese affairs.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn58-0096144212449139">58</xref></sup></p>
<p>And of course, when a man held two different Belgian passports, and a Canadian one, but then claimed two different Swiss identities, he was playing Shanghai’s well-known game, but he was also operating as a well-trained Comintern agent. Jakov Rudnik, also known, among many other <italic>noms de guerre</italic>, as Hilaire Noulens, ran the organization department of the Far Eastern Bureau of the Comintern in the city until his exposure and arrest in 1931.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn59-0096144212449139">59</xref></sup> What better city was there in which to do so. The Comintern ran a legitimate trading company, registered at the German consulate, and Rudnik’s function was to support logistically the agents and recruits who passed through the city, sucked in from across East and Southeast Asia, heading to training in Russia, heading into the colonial field, organizing funds and housing for them. Agents like him, and like Richard Sorge, who spied for Soviet military intelligence, and foreign radicals and fellow travellers, were all as able to make use of the peculiar city as anyone else.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn60-0096144212449139">60</xref></sup></p>
<p>Anticolonialism was succored by the imperial enemies of empires as well as nationalists and internationalists. German agents worked to arm and finance Indian nationalists. The French seem to have encouraged or at least protected the Korean movement by default, although its own internecine politics kept it busy, until it became too seemingly associated with Comintern initiatives, and then they were harsher. But if it was useful in applying pressure on the Japanese, then why not let them rumble on.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn61-0096144212449139">61</xref></sup> The Japanese more systematically established a strategy of sponsoring, or suborning, different national and nationalist groups. This was part Pan Asian ideology and part pragmatic subversion. And all the powers devoted time and resources to surveillance of their own colonial subjects, and to propaganda work among them.</p>
<p>Colonial political policing devoted much energy to preventing the intermingling of colonized peoples, except on its terms, for example when it deployed men from one colony to another as security personnel. Shanghai provided a singular challenge. The Indian Youth League could sit safely in Zhabei, and could lodge representatives at Nanjing. The Guomindang could explore ties with the Indian National Congress. Japanese agents could sponsor the activities of Irish nationalists, or the “Independent” Australia League. Koreans could hide out in French town. The Comintern could establish itself covertly, setting the east ablaze from offices of the German Metropolitan Trading Company, or from the many quiet rooms rented across the city by “Professor” Noulens.</p>
<p>It may seem odd to leave until last the fifth and seemingly most obvious layer of Shanghai nationalism, that of its majority Chinese inhabitants. But this is a story now often told, although it bears a recap in this wider context. In doing so I want to highlight how its peculiarities were inflected, inspired, and influenced by the layers already described.</p>
<p>That parochial White settler nationalism had a lasting impact. Chinese Elites protested council policies on access to municipal space as early as 1881, a story which rumbles on even today.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn62-0096144212449139">62</xref></sup> Non-elite residents rioted over regulations of wheelbarrow traffic in the city. The settlement acted as a safe haven for some anti-Qing activity, but was itself the site of, and cause of, new protest in the early twentieth century, as the foreign scramble for China provoked a new nationalist scramble to save it. The assertive performance of autonomy by the international settlement administration, and the routine incompetence of complacent colonialism, prompted in time wave upon wave of nationalist reaction and contestation. Most notable were riots in 1905 over judicial sovereignty, and riots, boycotts and a general strike after police shootings on May 30, 1925.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn63-0096144212449139">63</xref></sup> But there were others, including politically inflected economic disputes, and contestations of colonial power by organized crime. The stark performance locally of national identity or racist discrimination also galvanized Chinese resistance and protest. National political movements found their most radical home in the city—the 1905 anti-American boycott movement, sparked by the renewal of racist immigration legislation, the 1919 May Fourth Movement, fueled by the inequities of the Versailles settlement.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn64-0096144212449139">64</xref></sup> The spaces of Shanghai helped grow this activity: its legal gaps and gray areas; its parks, which hosted overt meetings and clandestine conference; its teahouses, coffee shops, cinemas, hostels, and bookshops.</p>
<p>The consequence of these recurrent events and movements was contradictory. On one hand, a set of responses, links, alliances, and rituals of protest recurred. Each explosion had its familiar response. However, these alliances rarely held, and the nationalist politics of the city was fragmented—by class, economic interest, politics—and so weakened.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn65-0096144212449139">65</xref></sup> There was no sustained nationalist coalition that took on the foreign-run authorities. Plainly, however, the most impressive of these, the 1925 May Thirtieth Movement, showed how such a collaboration could have irrevocably reshaped the politics of the city. But even so, students and merchants, labor and finance, all knew what to do: how to hold a protest meeting, how to decorate it, run up posters, author slogans, revise the lyrics of popular songs, print and circulate handbills, orchestrate demonstrations and stoppages, and send agit-prop teams into the streets. They knew how to despatch public telegrams, secure press coverage, and find lawyers for those arrested. This was all embedded in the routine political culture of the city.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn66-0096144212449139">66</xref></sup> This is not to say it dominated it, for the apolitical commercial culture of the city was perhaps its major feature. Certainly, for those mocking the Shanghai scene, it was a capital not of heady political activism but of sex and excess. Students were represented not as young nationalist revolutionaries, but as feckless hedonists. The excitement of revolutionary activity, its conviviality, and its sexiness needs remembering.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn67-0096144212449139">67</xref></sup> But always in the background somewhere lurked the Sikh policeman, the Japanese gendarmerie squad, the drunk naval rating in a rickshaw, the warship in the harbor, a reminder of the potential for incident and conflict, for bringing out all the stuff of nationalist protest.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>Fragmentation created opportunity at Shanghai. These layers of activity overlap and interrelate, and shaped each other. If “cosmopolitan” as such was a sham, a coy euphemism for race-driven “holy solidarity,” then nevertheless a sort of common style of urban commemoration came to dominate. German, French, British, republican Chinese commemoration all looked pretty much the same, and took place on similar occasions: there were salutes and processions, addresses, and buildings were bedecked with flags by day, illuminated by night, first with gas jets, later with neon. There were lantern parades—light was pervasive as a vehicle, which is worth further research. We note easily stone and statue, but less often ephemeral illumination. There were rituals around memorials, and around memorials appropriately placed. It all looked pretty similar. This is one concluding observation: that there developed in the city this shared repertoire of commemorative practise.</p>
<p>A second would be that we learn also of the importance of these rituals and symbols, through the warfare waged against them, the police orders and plans, as well as the physical destruction inflicted on German memorials, and later on British ones during the Japanese occupation. Statues were dismantled, streets renamed, buildings confiscated and reallocated. A third also comes back to our policeman, to the inherent contradictions of the colonial moment at Shanghai, where the virtues of the peculiar place, with its own “aims and means,” were steadily matched as they grew by the inherent dangers of such laissez passez. This Shanghai gap needed better and better policing, for if you were a conspiracy hunter, an intelligence officer, it seemed to threaten the entire East and Southeast Asian region. As the new imperialism unraveled, imperial rivals and enemies exploited the city’s potential to attack each other by proxy. For all concerned, their enemy’s enemy was, in the short term, their possible friend. And in Shanghai they could find relative refuge, mingle, intersect, pass over funds, organize shipments of arms or of people. Everything was possible, which itself might be one definition of a city.</p>
<p>So, after 1916, intelligence and policing agencies, as they grew, began to liaise, to share information and tip-offs, to send agents to Shanghai, to build a system to cope with the happy destructive chaos of the city. Empire abhors a vacuum. These initiatives created what became a remarkable cross-national, cross-empires network. One intelligence historian has concluded that the only comparable “international clandestine entity” was in fact the Comintern, its key enemy, but on the whole, the anticommunist and antinationalist “system of imperial surveillance” that linked India, the British and European empires, and U.S. agencies, had the upper hand.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn68-0096144212449139">68</xref></sup> The same has been noticed for the solidifying relationship between Japanese domestic, military, and foreign ministry agents. There developed a “transnational chain of political security institutions stretching across northeast Asia.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn69-0096144212449139">69</xref></sup></p>
<p>If the “holy bonds” of race solidarity were shattered by the First World War, security organs reconstituted them in a functional alliance of surveillance, aimed at defending that common heritage of colonial mastery. Even taking into consideration the limitations placed on such developments, by finance, by lack of personnel and institutional and other jealousies and incompetencies, visions of the free-wheeling city of myth, the “paradise of adventurers,” “city for sale,” “Paris of the east,” need to factor in the pervasive presence in the city of the secret policeman. Somewhere there lurked the spy, policeman watching the door, the agent provocateur, and back in the office the clerks typing it all up and filing it away, sending telegrams to Singapore, Hong Kong, Tokyo, Britain, cross-referencing, trying to give shape to the city’s politics, and the region’s. The SMP Special Branch built up steadily and systematically its massive archive, adding photographs and fingerprints, checking passenger lists, building up its card-index. It broke the Comintern in 1931, but it never got Richard Sorge right. Its archive, on which this essay is largely based, and some of its tactics for dealing with street disorder, found lives in the post–Second World War, informing the work of the CIA—whose researchers were still working through the archive in the 1950s—and colonial policing in Cyprus and Singapore.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn70-0096144212449139">70</xref></sup> Shanghai fostered nationalisms and nationalists; it provided space and opportunities for solidarity, and for connecting. It also fostered their policing and their contestation, and opportunities and imperatives for police and intelligence agencies themselves to connect across space and indeed across time, in their own international, guarded, solidarity in surveillance, recording, analysis, and repression.</p>

<p>It is worth noting that the lunar calendar in Chinese understandings was situated within (basically) a wider 60-year cycle, which could also—in years deemed more or less auspicious—prompt, or at least provide additional conceptual preconditions for action. The “Gengzi year,” 1900, a transitional year in that cycle, is a case in point. Inchoate expectations of calamity fed into the political mix that fueled the anti-Christian/antiforeign Boxer uprising in North China. More widely on this, see Luke S. K.
