<abstract>
<p>Strategies used in requestive speech act and their effects on compliance have been the focus of a number of studies. Previous research, however, has dealt mainly with perceptive data elicited from one of the interlocutors involved in the use of mitigation. A sociolinguistic study could explore the perception of both the requestor and the requestee with respect to using such strategies. This article aims to study the possible correlation between request compliance and the use of mitigation devices. The question is what observable effects using mitigators have both on the requestor’s judgment of compliance and on prohibiting the requestee from rejecting the request. Four role-play interactions followed by stimulated recall procedures were used to collect the required data. The results obtained from the analysis of data revealed that, in similar situations, American requestors are comparably more certain than Iranians that the addressee would comply with their requests using fewer mitigation devices; while, as far as the requestees are concerned, Americans are more influenced by the use of mitigation devices on the part of requestors than Iranians.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Previous studies have demonstrated that there are cross-cultural differences between different speech communities vis-a-vis the type of request and the level of directness of request realization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1461445611433789">Blum-Kulka and House, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1461445611433789">Blum-Kulka and Olshtain, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1461445611433789">Eslami-Rasekh, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1461445611433789">Eslami-Rasekh and Abdolrezapour, 2008</xref>). Whereas most of these studies have dealt with appropriate request strategies based on the positive/negative politeness model proposed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1461445611433789">Brown and Levinson (1987)</xref>, research on how the use of mitigation devices, as a strategy to attenuate the face-threatening impact of the request, differs cross-culturally, has received far less attention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1461445611433789">Economidou-Kogetsidis, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1461445611433789">Márquez Reiter, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1461445611433789">Usó-Juan, 2007</xref>). In particular, the metapragmatic dimension of this issue is quite under-investigated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1461445611433789">Márquez Reiter, 2000</xref>). Previous studies have mainly focused on the type of mitigation devices used; however, the effects of mitigation devices on interlocutors’ perceptions have not yet been investigated. This study aims to contribute to the current body of research by investigating the effect of using mitigation devices on request compliance from both requestor and requestee’s viewpoints in American English and Persian cultures.</p>
<p>The main objective of this study is to examine the similarities and differences in the perceptions of using mitigations by educated native speakers of Persian and American English in four different situations. Taking into account the contribution of previous studies, we will address the following research questions:</p>

<title>Review of literature</title>
<p>Speakers use heterogeneous selections of linguistic expressions as strategies of positive and negative politeness to soften the impact of a face-threatening act. These expressions can be regarded as overt markings of metapragmatic awareness. This is best evident in mitigating a request, which, according to Brown and Levinson, is a face-threatening act in nature. Making a request is all too often accompanied by the use of some external or internal modifications whose function is to soften or minimize the face-threatening or impositive aspects of the request act. External modifications are optional clauses which occur in the immediate context of the speech act (e.g. <italic>I missed the previous lecture, would you give me your notes?</italic>) and indirectly modify the illocutionary force, while internal modifications occur within the speech act itself (e.g. <italic>Could you possibly give me your pen?</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1461445611433789">Blum-Kulka et al., 1989</xref>). Both kinds of modifiers (i.e. internal and external) could either soften or intensify the force of the whole request.</p>
<p>According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1461445611433789">Blum-Kulka (2005 [1992]</xref>: 267), internal modification largely appeals to positive politeness by stressing in-group membership, affect and involvement, whereas external modification ‘appeals to the interlocutor as a rational agent in need of persuasion as required by the principle of independence tenet of negative politeness’. Contrary to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1461445611433789">Blum-Kulka’s (2005 [1992])</xref> assertion, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1461445611433789">Economidou-Kogetsidis (2008)</xref> claims that internal modification can function as a negative politeness strategy with a focus on minimizing impositions, and that external modification can function as a positive politeness strategy emphasizing closeness and involvement. Similarly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1461445611433789">Brown and Levinson (1987)</xref>, who treat mitigation as synonymous with politeness, suggest that asking for and giving reasons for a speech act, that is, external modifications, is a ‘positive’ politeness strategy in that it ‘is a way of implying “I can help you” or “you can help me”, and, assuming cooperation, a way of showing what help is needed’ (p. 128).</p>
<p>At a sociopragmatic level, the amount and type of modification that one chooses have been shown to be affected by a number of social and contextual variables. Social distance, social power and the degree of imposition of the requested act are among the influential factors in various conventional norms. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1461445611433789">Brown and Levinson’s (1978</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1461445611433789">1987)</xref> main argument was that there is a direct and linear relationship among these social variables, such that the greater the hearer’s power, the social distance between interlocutors and the degree of imposition of the act, the greater the face threat will be and the greater the degree of indirectness and modification to be employed by the speaker. Following <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1461445611433789">Brown and Levinson (1978</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1461445611433789">1987</xref>), <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1461445611433789">Nikula (1996</xref>, cited in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1461445611433789">Salazar Campillo, 2007</xref>: 211) proposes the following five contextual factors that may affect the appropriate use of peripheral modification devices:<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1461445611433789">1</xref></sup></p>

</list>
<p>The notion of mitigation has been used technically since the late 1970s, when the concept of the illocutionary act was operationalized in discourse analysis. This term was introduced in pragmatics by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1461445611433789">Fraser (1980)</xref>, referring to those linguistic devices used by speakers to protect themselves against various interactional risks. Since then, some mitigation-related studies, though not necessarily using this particular term, have been carried out. One of the pioneering studies on mitigation is that of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1461445611433789">Edmondson (1981)</xref>, who applies the notion of mitigation in his model. Edmondson’s ‘H-supportive principle’, which he claims ‘governs our perception of conversational events, and underlies our perception and evaluation of social behavior in general’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1461445611433789">1981</xref>: 25), assigns a crucial role to the interlocutors’ adjustments to each other.</p>
<p>Investigating the form and function of requests in British English and Uruguayan Spanish, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1461445611433789">Márquez Reiter (2000)</xref> found that the Britons employed higher levels of modifiers across the role-play situations than the Uruguayans did and a preference for external over internal modification was observed. She concluded that Uruguayans, who used mitigation less frequently, appeared to be less motivated by considerations of ‘negative’ politeness as compared to the British.</p>
<p>In another study, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1461445611433789">Márquez Reiter et al. (2005)</xref> investigated whether requestors’ lower perceptions of request compliance by their requestees induces them to internally mitigate their requests. They observed that speakers appeared to be more certain of request compliance when no softening devices were used. Addition of a softening device led to a decrease in the degree of certainty expressed by their participants.</p>
<p>Analyzing ELT textbooks, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1461445611433789">Usó-Juan (2007)</xref> found that most of the requestive strategies taught were of a conventionalized type and a preference was observed for using internal over external modification. However, contextual variables in which the requests were embedded – that is, interlocutors’ age, social status, degree of intimacy and the degree of imposition of the request necessary for selecting the appropriate request form – were not included. The author concluded that the models offered in textbooks on how requests are realized have failed to provide appropriate input to promote learners’ communicative skills.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1461445611433789">Martínez-Flor (2007)</xref>, in a similar attempt, analyzed 10 American movies and found that in a total of 113 request situations only 7 did not contain any modification devices, whereas the rest of them contained a variety of modification devices with higher frequency of internal modifiers over the external ones. She concluded that different sociopragmatic variables, such as the speaker’s intentions, interlocutors’ relationship or the degree of politeness, are of paramount importance for the appropriate selection and the use of request modification devices.</p>
<p>Along the same lines, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1461445611433789">Economidou-Kogetsidis (2008)</xref> examined Greek learners’ use of internal and external mitigations. She investigated the way Greek EFL learners used lexical and phrasal downgraders and external supportive moves to soften requests in three power-asymmetrical situations. Results of her study revealed that the amount and type of modification used demonstrated deviations from native speakers’ use. As far as internal modifiers were concerned, Greek EFL learners underused the marker ‘please’ and employed more zero marking, and they overused external modifiers compared with native speakers. They also showed a higher preference for disarmers and preparators in order to externally mitigate their requests. Her results were partly confirmed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1461445611433789">Al-Ali and Alawneh’s (2010)</xref> findings in that the structure of requestive acts, type, frequency and linguistic realization utilized by Jordanian EFL learners differed from those of American native speakers.</p>
<p>Modifications can be in the direction of downgrading or softening the impact of the request (i.e. mitigation) or in the direction of upgrading or intensifying (i.e. reinforcement). Mitigations have been chosen as the focus of this study precisely because the low frequency of use of reinforcements in requests gives the impression that they are regarded as socially inappropriate. Thus, the aim of this study is to examine the effect of linguistic mitigation devices on interlocutors’ perceptions about the likelihood of request compliance. However, it should be pointed out that throughout the article we will use the terms ‘mitigation’ and ‘modification’ interchangeably. With the exception of few studies that have dealt with the use of mitigations with regard to requestors’ perception of compliance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1461445611433789">Márquez Reiter et al., 2005</xref>), the majority of studies in this line of research are concerned with the type and number of mitigation devices employed. This study contributes to current understanding of the types of mitigation devices and their roles in Persian and American English cultures. Moreover, the effect of social variables of power, familiarity and the rank of imposition of the request on the use of mitigators will be discussed.</p>
<p>The data for this article are drawn mainly from four role plays complemented by the comments that participants made in the stimulated recall session. In order to further clarify the type of mitigation devices used, we will discuss some examples from our role play data. The analysis of our data advocates the metapragmatic level, that is, the one of the speaker’s awareness, as the questions posed in our study is about the interlocutors’ perceptions with respect to using strategies. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1461445611433789">Caffi (2006)</xref>, the term metapragmatics is used in three different senses: the first sense pertains to the theoretical debate on pragmatics as a discipline and its corresponding epistemological foundations; the second sense concerns the reflection on pragmatic conditions; and the third sense deals with ‘the investigation of that area of the speaker’s competence that reflects judgments of appropriateness on one’s own and other people’s communicative behavior’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1461445611433789">Caffi, 2006</xref>: 625). The present study focuses on this latter sense of the term ‘metapragmatics’.</p>

<title>Methodology</title>
<sec id="section4-1461445611433789">
<title>Participants</title>
<p>Twenty-two native speakers of American English and 30 native speakers of Persian were selected based on a stratified sampling procedure. The informants were all university students and they varied in age from 18 to 26 years (Mean = 21). The American informants were students of biology, geography and history at Fresno State University (USA) and the Iranian informants were students of mathematics, history, biology, architecture and law at the University of Isfahan (Iran). Students were chosen as the target population in order to ensure as much homogeneity as possible in terms of educational background, age range, social class and their possible future occupation.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1461445611433789">
<title>Instrumentation</title>
<p>The data were collected via open role plays<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1461445611433789">2</xref></sup> and stimulated recall procedure. The role-play tasks comprised four situations resulting in the elicitation of requests and responses to these requests. The situations realized in the role plays were assessed before conducting the study to make sure that they were comparable across both cultures. Initially, we had six situations which were used mainly in the Iranian culture. As we needed comparable situations between the two cultures in terms of naturalness, we asked 10 informants from each culture, similar to the actual population of our study, to assess the naturalness of the situations by assigning a number from 1, indicating that the situation occurs rarely, to 5, showing that the occurrence of the situation is highly probable. <italic>T</italic>-tests were run to identify those situations in which there were differences, and as a result two situations were excluded. In this assessment the informants were also asked to assess the power difference and the degree of closeness between the interlocutors, as well as the rank of imposition of the requested act. The reason was that we intended to find balanced situations with big status difference, situations with difference in the degree of closeness and those containing a high degree of imposition.</p>
<p>The situations described in the role-play (see Appendix) reflect everyday occurrences of the type expected to be familiar to both American and Iranian university students. They vary according to the social distance between the speakers, the relative social power of the interlocutors and the rank of imposition of the request. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1461445611433789">Table 1</xref> presents a description of the contextual variables involved.</p>

<p>In the first situation (Borrow a book) a student needs a book and asks the lecturer to lend him/her the book; whereas the second situation (Type the letters) concerns the interaction between two friends: one asking his/her friend to type some letters for him. Two students are in the school bus in the third situation (Swap seats) with one requesting the other to swap their seats. And the fourth situation (Give a lecture) concerns the interaction between a lecturer and his/her student; the lecturer asking the student to give his/her lecture sooner.</p>
<p>In these situations, social distance is a function of how well interlocutors know each other: either close (-SD) or distant (+SD); social power, on the other hand, refers to the ‘vertical disparity between the participants in a hierarchical structure’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1461445611433789">Scollon and Scollon, 2001</xref>: 52).</p>

<sec id="section6-1461445611433789">
<title>Data collection and coding procedure</title>
<p>The informants participated in role plays in groups of two; every informant acted once as a requestor and once as a requestee. All role plays were audio-recorded. Immediately after each role play, informants were asked to participate in the stimulated recall procedure in which they listened to their own voices and talked about their perceptions of the request compliance while performing the role plays and while they were employing mitigation devices. Whereas the requestors were required to recall how the probability of being refused affected their use of mitigation devices, the requestees had to express their views about the effect of the mitigation devices on their acceptance or refusal. This part provided us with the answer of the first part of each research question (i.e. 1a and 2a).</p>
<p>The role play data were then transcribed and coded by two trained native speakers from each culture. Using the taxonomy of modifications developed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1461445611433789">Márquez Reiter (2000)</xref>, the coders independently coded all strategies used in each request utterance based on the request head act and the mitigation devices used. The classification was based on the type of mitigation devices used, that is, request with no mitigation, requests containing internal mitigation or requests with external mitigation devices. Then, in order to establish whether the frequency of the use of each type of mitigation differs significantly between these two cultures, that is, to answer the second part of the first research question (i.e. 1b), Chi-square tests of independence were used. The data collected through role plays were then compared with, and used to complement, the comments that requestees made in the stimulated recall session to find the effect of using mitigation devices on avoiding refusal. Chi-square tests of independence were run to establish whether there is a significant difference between these two groups regarding using mitigations and avoiding refusal (i.e. to answer 2b).</p>

<title>Certainty and the use of mitigation devices</title>
<p>In order to answer the first research question, role plays and the data obtained through stimulated recall technique were analyzed and the frequency of the use of each type of mitigation device was calculated. First, the taxonomy provided by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1461445611433789">Márquez Reiter (2000)</xref> was adopted to code the request modification devices identified in the data.

<title>External modification</title>
<p>The most frequent external modifiers found in these situations were reasons, preparators and disarmers.</p>

<list-item><p><italic>Reasons</italic>: Clauses provided by the requestor to justify his request (e.g. May I have the book you recommended me yesterday? <underline>I went to the library, but unfortunately it was closed.</underline>).</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Preparators</italic>: Clauses used to prepare the requestee for the ensuing request (e.g. <underline>Yesterday you suggested that I go to the library to get a copy of Hudson (1985) to do my research, I went to the library but it was closed.</underline> May I have your copy?).</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Disarmers</italic>: These clauses ‘disarm’ the requestee from the possibility of refusal (e.g. I’ve got some letters to type. <underline>Your work has already finished and you’ve got nothing to do now</underline>, I wonder if I could ask you to type the letters for me.).</p></list-item>

<title>Mixed modifications<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-1461445611433789">3</xref></sup></title>
<p>In this study, the combination of mitigators – that is, both internal and external – was taken as mixed mitigation. Here is an example of these combinations which is made up of <italic>downtoners</italic> and <italic>giving reasons</italic>:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Would you <underline>possibly</underline> (downtoner) give your lecture tomorrow? <underline>I have to attend a conference</underline>. (reason)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>However, since in the stimulated recall procedure we canvassed participants’ opinions about using internal and external modifications, and not about mixed modifications, this category, which was observed twice in the role play interactions, was not included in our statistical calculations.</p>
<p>Here, some extracts from the corpus are provided for each situation with the conventionally indirect utterances written in bold and the mitigation devices used underlined. Examples 1 and 2 concern the interaction between a student (A) and his professor (B) in which the student is asking for a book that is not available in the library.</p>
<p>Example 1: (Borrow a book, Americans)</p>

<p>In the above situation, most Iranian informants used mitigated requests and the external mitigators were prevalent in the role play interactions. Most of the informants said that it was the social power of the professor that led them to externally mitigate their requests and that the use of mitigation is somehow prefabricated in such situations. One response that most of them gave in the stimulated recall session regarding their preference for using external mitigations when requesting is given below:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Bishtar say dâshtam ke moadabâne darkhâste khodamo matrah konam va ye jur neshun bedam ke be ketâb niâze fori dâram chun injuri ehtemâle rad shodane darkhâstam kamtar bud.</p>
<p>English translation:</p>
<p>I was trying to politely let him know that I needed to take the book as the chances of being refused were lower in that case.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The number of American informants who opted for the internal mitigation in this situation was equal to those who chose external mitigation. One of the American informants who had used internal mitigation stated that:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>I think the use of the word <italic>possibly</italic> made my request less imposing.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In the second situation, two friends are interacting, (A), who is in charge of a project, asking the other (B) to type the letters. Two examples, one for each culture, of the results of the role plays obtained for this situation are given below.</p>
<p>Example 3: (Type the letters, Americans)</p>
<array>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>A:</td>
<td>Jack, <bold>would you type these letters for me?</bold> (conventionally indirect request)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>B:</td>
<td>Well, I have to send these mails, I will type them then. Is that ok with you?</td>

<tr>
<td>A:</td>
<td>That’s all right.</td>

</tbody>
</array>
<p>Example 4: (Type the letters, Iranians)</p>

<tr>
<td>B:</td>
<td>Sure…. I would be happy to do something for this project.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</array>
<p>When asked to explain the reason why they used such a strategy, both groups of informants claimed that the two interlocutors had the same social power, one of the addressee’s duties was to do the requests of his supervisor and all the members of the group should help each other to finish the project. In this case again, more external modifications were used by Iranian informants. In the following, we will go through the response provided by one of the Iranian informants regarding the rationale behind using external mitigation in this situation:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Bâ inke har domun midoonim ke yeki az vazâyefe un shakhs type kardane nâmehast vali behatre ke dalile darxâkhtam az un ro begam.</p>
<p>English translation:</p>
<p>Though both of us know that one of his duties is typing the letters, it is better to mention the reason of requesting him.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In the third situation one informant (A) was asked to have the role of a student asking the other one (B) to swap their seats. Examples taken from the corpus are provided here:</p>
<p>Example 5: (Swap seats, Americans)</p>
<array>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>A:</td>
<td>Excuse me …. <bold>Could you move so that my friend can sit next to me?</bold> (reason)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>B:</td>
<td>Sure.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>A:</td>
<td>Thanks.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</array>
<p>Example 6: (Swap seats, Iranians)</p>
<array>

<tr>
<td>A:</td>
<td>Bebakhshid…. <bold>Mishe shomâ berid ruye un sandali beshinid? <underline>Mano dustam mikhâstim kenâre ham beshinim</underline></bold>. (reason)</td>

<p>English translation:</p>
<array>

<tr>
<td>A:</td>

</tr>
<tr>
<td>B:</td>
<td>Um…. Ok.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>A:</td>
<td>Thanks.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</array>
<p>In this situation, Iranian informants showed the same tendency toward external mitigation as the internal one. They said that although they did not know the interlocutor well, they were asking for a small favor and it was highly likely that the addressee would comply with their request. The American informants, however, expressed the view that they did not know the addressee well and thus did not know how s/he was going to react; so there was a higher tendency toward using external mitigation over the internal one.</p>
<p>One of the Iranian informants gave the following response regarding her logic in using internal mitigation in the stimulated recall session:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Be khâtere inke un shakhs ham sene mane va jâbejaee ham kâre sakhti nist fekr nemikonam ke darkhâste mano rad kone faghat behtare ke yekam doostâne darkhâstamo begam.</p>
<p>English translation:</p>
<p>Since we are at the same age and swapping seats is not a difficult task, I don’t think that he will refuse my request, just it is better to ask him in a friendly way.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>And here is the response provided by one of the American informants regarding the use of external modification device:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>It seems odd to ask someone to change the seat without providing him the reason, so he might refuse to change his seat.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The fourth situation concerned the interaction between a lecturer (A) asking his student (B) to give his/her lecture sooner. Examples are given here:</p>
<p>Example 7: Situation 4 (Give a lecture, Americans)</p>
<array>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>A:</td>
<td><bold>Can you <underline>perhaps</underline> give your lecture tomorrow?</bold> (downtoners)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>B:</td>
<td>Definitely.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>A:</td>
<td>Thanks.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>B:</td>
<td>You’re quite welcome.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</array>
<p>Example 8: (Give a lecture, Iranians)</p>
<array>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>A:</td>
<td>Aghâye Rezaee… <bold>Mishe lectureto zudtar âmâde koni?</bold> (conventionally indirect request)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>B:</td>
<td>Hatman ostâd</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</array>
<p>English translation:</p>
<array>
<tbody>
<tr>

<td>Mr. Rezâee…. <bold>Can you prepare your lecture sooner?</bold></td>
</tr>
<tr>

<td>Sure professor</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</array>
<p>The analysis of the actual language employed by Iranian informants in this situation shows that Iranian informants preferred internal modification over the external one and some of them displayed a tendency toward using conventionally indirect requests (i.e. requests with no mitigation). When asked to explain what caused the use of internal mitigation, they said that most students, by virtue of the higher power of the professor, tend to avoid refusing his/her request, so they had a high expectation of compliance by the addressee and internal mitigation was used as a strategy to soften the impositive nature of the request. The American informants, however, said that having higher power would not necessarily lead to being more certain that the request would be granted and that using external modification might be needed in some cases. They regarded it as sign of negative politeness. Of interest to us was the fact that the frequency of each type of mitigations used in this situation by Americans was the same as that of situation one, which might be indicative of the relatively lower significance of power difference in this culture.</p>
<p>One response that most of the Iranian informants gave in the stimulated recall session regarding their low tendency toward using mitigations when requesting is given below:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Mogheiate ejtemâee yek ostâd bâes mishe ke dâneshju darkhâstesho rad nakone hatâ age anjâme un kâr barâsh sakht bâshe say mikone mokhâlefat nakone. Va dâdane tozihe ezâfe zaruri be nazar nemirese.</p>
<p>English translation:</p>
<p>The social power of the instructor led to the fact that the student won’t refuse him even though doing that work is difficult; he would do his best to not refuse. And providing additional information doesn’t seem necessary.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Analyzing the situations revealed that the differences in the type of mitigation used were due to social power of the requestee and the degree of imposition concerned, that is, in situation one where there was an interaction between the professor and student (+SP) and situation two which involved a high degree of imposition.</p>
<p>Then, the answers provided by the informants were analyzed to find the percentage of each type of modification used (i.e. request without modification, request with internal modification and request with external modification). To establish whether the percentage differences were statistically significant, Chi-square procedures were performed (this part provides us with the answer to the second part of first research question, 1b). Results point to significant differences for requests with no modification and externally modified requests, and insignificant difference was found for internally modified requests (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1461445611433789">Table 2</xref>).</p>

<p>As demonstrated in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1461445611433789">Table 2</xref>, there is a striking difference in terms of variety and frequency of mitigators between the two groups. The analysis of the role play data shows that American requests in all four situations were mainly characterized by the use of the internal modifications such as <italic>downtoners</italic> (e.g. <italic>possibly</italic>) and conventionally indirect utterances (e.g. <italic>Could you give your lecture sooner</italic>), and in a few cases external modification such as <italic>reasons</italic> (e.g. <italic>Could you move so that my friend can sit next to me?</italic>) was observed. Data collected from the role plays in Persian reveal two important points: a) Iranians tended to use external modifications such as <italic>reasons</italic> (e.g. <italic>raftam ketâbo az ketâbkhoone begiram vali baste bood</italic> which can be translated as: I went to the library to get the book but it was closed) and <italic>preparators</italic> (e.g. <italic>midoonam saret sholughe va kolli kâr dâri vali inâro bâyad zood tahvil bedim</italic> which is translated as: I know you have a lot of affairs to do but we should deliver these letters soon) more than internal ones such <italic>downtoners</italic> (e.g. <italic>Age emkânesh hast</italic> which is the equivalent of <italic>possibly</italic>); and b) in most cases modifications were used by Iranian informants. These points were more evident in situations in which social power of the requestee was higher than the requestor.</p>

<title>The use of mitigation devices and avoiding refusal</title>
<p>The second question aimed to investigate whether requestors’ use of mitigation devices and indirect strategies have any effect on requestees’ compliance. To find the answer, in the stimulated recall procedure the informants were asked to voice their reactions toward the use of mitigation devices by requestors. Then, the frequency of their compliances with each type of mitigation in each case was calculated. A Chi-square test was performed to examine whether the type of mitigation devices chosen is independent of cultural background; in other words, whether the mitigation type chosen is different for Iranians (Ir) and Americans (Am). A significant test value in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1461445611433789">Table 3</xref> addresses a difference between the two cultures in their compliances with requests.</p>

<p>The statistically significant difference found between the types of mitigation devices chosen by the informants in these two groups (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05) is supported by the responses given by both groups of informants (with the role of a requestee) during their role play interactions. Note that, as mentioned in the previous section (the results obtained from role play interactions), with the exception of situation two (Type the letters), where some of the Iranian informants chose requests with no mitigation, Iranian requestors preferred providing mitigations, especially external mitigations, throughout the situations of the role plays. This tendency was most significant in situation one (Borrow a book), where 24 of the Iranian informants went for external mitigations. The results obtained from requestees’ perceptions were rather different. Here, Iranian requestees intended that professors would do their best to help their students and they have no problems whatsoever in facilitating materials to students, so even the use of a conventionally indirect strategy might lead to request approval; while American requestees preferred providing <italic>reasons</italic> or internal mitigation devices such as <italic>downtoners</italic> by the requestors.</p>
<p>In general, in all four situations, the use of conventionally indirect requests by speakers was not favored by American requestees. In the stimulated recall session, Americans said that when more effort is made by the requestor, which is normally satisfied by the use of external mitigations in these cases, they will do their best to avoid refusing.</p>

<sec id="section13-1461445611433789" sec-type="discussion">
<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The current study was designed to find the effects of the wording of the requests, and more specifically, the effect of using mitigation devices on interlocutors’ perception of request compliance. This section will first summarize the findings of the study and then each finding will be discussed in light of the relevant theoretical issues.</p>
<p>The first research question dealt with the use of mitigation devices to avoid being refused by both groups of speakers. The frequency of English requests with internal modification was more than requests with external modification, which accords with the findings of previous studies in relation to ELT materials (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1461445611433789">Usó-Juan, 2007</xref>) and American movies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1461445611433789">Martínez-Flor, 2007</xref>). Apparently, unlike Iranians who demonstrated a preference for using external modifications (50.83% as opposed to 41.66%), Americans made use of internal modifications (35.27% as opposed to 30.68%) more frequently.</p>
<p>American informants stated that conventionally indirect requests could be used to: a) maintain positive face and b) guarantee compliance. They believed that overusing mitigation devices might be taken as a flattering strategy by the requestee and using conventionally indirect strategies (e.g. <italic>Could you?</italic> etc. with or without additional mitigating devices), which in Searle’s terminology is called ‘indirect’ speech act, might function as a mitigation device in its own right. So, even using the conventionally indirect request amounts to resorting to mitigation and, in the case of ‘no modification’ which is used by 34.09% of American requestors, modification is used in the form of a conventionally indirect strategy which is regarded as the request head act. In a way, this finding chimes with that of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1461445611433789">Usó-Juan (2007)</xref>, namely a preference for conventionally indirect strategies and internal modification over the external ones in ELT textbooks.</p>
<p>Our analysis of participants’ retrospective comments revealed that the imposition of the request was the main factor which induced American speakers to internally mitigate their requests. By using internal mitigation they tried to reduce the degree of imposition of the utterance. Social power of the addressee was chosen by only one of the informants as a leading factor to mitigate the request, which was contrary to what Iranian informants mentioned. Interestingly, this tendency of the Americans to neglect the social power factor is in contrast to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1461445611433789">Brown and Levinson (1978</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1461445611433789">1987)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1461445611433789">Nikula’s (1996)</xref> assertion.</p>
<p>Stimulated recalls, which were conducted immediately after the role plays, revealed that Iranian informants felt obliged to use mitigation devices to soften the face-threatening effect of their requests. Most observably, in situations of unequal power (e.g. asking the professor to lend his book) and when the degree of imposition was high (e.g. asking someone to type the letters), they felt that mitigation – especially external mitigation – would lead to a higher degree of probability of compliance. Some mentioned that they mitigate out of uncertainty, caution or consideration. And most of the informants believed that internal mitigation indicated more politeness and external mitigation guaranteed compliance. For instance, in the case of swapping seats they said that if no reason was given, the addressee would refuse to swap seats, since he would regard it as an unnecessary act. In this respect, our findings support <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1461445611433789">Brown and Levinson (1987)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1461445611433789">Economidou-Kogetsidis (2008)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1461445611433789">Nikula’s (1996)</xref> argumentation that the rank of imposition of the request and social power of the addressee are determining factors in using mitigation devices. This part of our study is at odds with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1461445611433789">Fukushima’s (2000)</xref> results, as these variables <italic>alone</italic> were chosen for the use of mitigation devices (as Brown and Levinson claim). Fukushima’s conclusions seem to indicate that there are other factors (one he refers to as gender difference) involved in the generation of politeness apart from these three variables.</p>
<p>The interlocutors’ perceptions about the use of external modification devices indicated that its functions vary in different situations. For instance, when requesting a professor, <italic>preparators</italic> were provided by the requestor as a negative politeness strategy to minimize the face-threatening effect of the request and as a way to show consideration for the addressee, which was in line with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1461445611433789">Blum-Kulka’s (2005)</xref> assertion mentioned in the review of literature section (i.e. external modifications are a negative politeness strategy). On the other hand, when asking a friend to type the letters, <italic>preparators</italic> were used to show closeness in that the requestor expects the requestee to be more understanding and willing to cooperate, which seems to confirm <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1461445611433789">Economidou-Kogetsidis’s (2008)</xref> findings regarding the adherence of external modifications to positive politeness. Some diminutives such as <italic>Ye kami</italic> were used by Iranians both as a device to seem friendly and as a way of minimizing impositions depending on the request posed. So, from the data collected in our study, we can conclude that the use of external mitigation devices depends on the specific social situation and the way downtoners or supportive moves are used, as well as the important role played by nonverbal means (in particular, smiles and postures); also, prosodic features should not be neglected. Thus, neither <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1461445611433789">Blum-Kulka’s (2005 [1992])</xref> nor <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1461445611433789">Economidou-Kogetsidis’s (2008)</xref> assertions hold true for the cultures studied here, in that both external and internal modifications could either be related to positive and/or negative politeness strategies.</p>
<p>The second research question concerned the possible effect of using mitigation devices on requestees’ compliance. As <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1461445611433789">Table 3</xref> shows, Iranian informants tended to be more influenced by external modifications used by the requestors and the conventionally indirect head acts had little influence on their compliance. As can be seen in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1461445611433789">Table 3</xref>, 15% of the requestees said that they would agree with requests with no modification, which was in a conventionally indirect form. Iranian informants considered several factors when responding to a request in asymmetric situations. In the stimulated recall procedure, most of the Iranian requestees said that they were conscious of the difference in power and tried to comply with the request of a higher status requestor (+SP).</p>
<p>Contrary to what we expected, American requestees did not comply with requests that had no modification. Based on the results obtained for the first research question, 34.09% of the informants used a conventionally indirect strategy to make a request and impress the requestee, but it seems that this form had little effect on the requestee or in forcing him to accept the request. Based on the replies provided in the stimulated recall procedure, most of the American informants (with the role of a requestee) believed that the use of external modifications increased the probability of compliance.</p>
<p>Our findings show that both groups were more influenced by the use of external modifications by requestors: <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1461445611433789">Table 3</xref> shows 48.33% of Iranian and 53.40% of American requestees complied with the request when external modification was used. And according to the Chi-square test results (i.e. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1461445611433789">Table 3</xref> requests with external modifications) the difference between the two cultures is non-significant (<italic>p</italic>-value = 0.46 &gt; 0.05).</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>In this article, the use and perception of using mitigation devices by Iranian speakers have been examined and compared with those of American English native speakers in a number of power-asymmetrical social situations.</p>
<p>The study revealed that Iranian requestors, by and large, use more mitigation devices and specifically more external mitigation devices, which give them more certainty of compliance, compared with Americans. The importance of mitigation devices in Persian requests lies primarily in the Persian speakers’ desire to guarantee the compliance rather than showing politeness and saving face. Interlocutors’ power and degree of imposition are the key factors for certainty of compliance as the degree of mitigation devices used correlates positively with the power of the requestee and imposition of the request. From a sociolinguistic perspective, Iranian society is built around hierarchical relations and social power is one of the most important factors that people consider when they engage in conversations.</p>
<p>Furthermore, American requestors use mitigation devices less frequently and in most cases use conventionally indirect requests with no modification. They internally mitigate their requests with a high degree of imposition. Moreover, they are less concerned about the power of the requestee and consider themselves at the same social level with no interlocutor exerting power over the other. This can be shown by the fact that even in the last situation the professor who had higher power was concerned about not being complied with.</p>
<p>Overall, mitigation devices reflect different social meanings in American English and Persian; while Iranians consider them as a means to get compliance, Americans regard them as a flattering device. These differences should be taken into account in EFL instruction and in cross-cultural studies. Suggestions are made to investigate the linguistic realization and social strategies of participants of different ages, sexes, educational levels and socio-economic backgrounds. Moreover, qualitative examination of internal and external modification devices could be more insightful and the important role played by nonverbal means in mitigation, which was left aside in this study, could be the focus of future research.</p>

<p>Open role plays were used to collect data as they are closer to naturally occurring speech events and they give us the opportunity to record and/or videotape them for further careful analysis.
