<abstract>
<p>This article describes translation problems found in Acts 13.1–12 in nine very different languages (four from Russia, two from Thailand, and one each from Morocco, Papua New Guinea, and the Solomon Islands). The most widespread problem encountered was the handling of personal and place names, and other problems included the rendering of symbolic religious actions and the choice of appropriate verbs of motion.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>One of the most eagerly awaited activities at UBS Triennial Translation Workshops was the Fun Night that came at the end. As a regular feature of several of these Fun Nights, a very entertaining performer was Roger Omanson, who, in addition to all his other skills, is an accomplished amateur magician. So when the invitation came to submit an article for an edition of <italic>The Bible Translator</italic> honouring Roger, what was more natural than to think about translation problems in a New Testament passage dealing with another (albeit rather less reputable) magician? Accordingly, this article will focus on translation problems I have actually encountered in a variety of languages in Acts 13.1–12, the story of Elymas and the conversion of Sergius Paulus, the Roman governor of Cyprus.</p>

<sec id="section2-0260093513481148">
<title>The Data</title>
<p>My translation checking session notes on this passage come from nine different languages, four in Russia, two in Thailand, and one each in the Solomon Islands, Papua New Guinea, and Morocco. The actual languages are as follows.</p>
<p>First in Russia, where they are all written in modified forms of Cyrillic script:
<list id="list1-0260093513481148" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p><italic>Yakut</italic>, a Turkic language of eastern Siberia (Acts checked in September 1995, New Testament published 2004);</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Kalmyk</italic>, an Altaic language of the Mongolian subdivision spoken west of the Caspian Sea (Acts checked in November 1996, New Testament published 2002);</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Chechen</italic>, a North Caucasian language spoken in the Caucasus (Acts checked in May 2001, New Testament published 2007);</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Khakas</italic>, a Turkic language of southern Siberia (Acts checked in October 2006, New Testament published 2009).</p></list-item></list></p>
<p>In Thailand the languages, both written in modified forms of Thai script, and both members of the Mon-Khmer language family, are:
<list id="list2-0260093513481148" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p><italic>Mal</italic>, spoken in Nan Province in the eastern part of north Thailand, and also in Laos (Acts checked in May 1990, New Testament published 1994), and</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Lawa</italic>, spoken in the Maesariang area of Maehongson Province in the western part of north Thailand (revision of Acts checked in November 1991, revised New Testament published 1993).</p></list-item>
</list></p>
<p>The Solomon Islands language is <italic>Kahua</italic>, a Malayo-Polynesian language written in Roman script and spoken in eastern parts of the island of Makira, also known as San Cristobal (Acts checked about 1978, New Testament published 1986).</p>
<p>The Papua New Guinean language is <italic>Iai</italic>, a non-Austronesian language spoken in the Gulf Province of Papua, and written in Roman script (Acts checked and published as a portion 1979).</p>
<p>The Moroccan language is <italic>Tashelhayt</italic>, a Berber language spoken in the southwest of the country (Acts checked in March 1993, New Testament published 1998). There is a traditional script, but it is not widely used nowadays, and the New Testament is printed in a modified form of Arabic script.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0260093513481148">1</xref></sup></p>

<title>The Text</title>
<p>Obviously the different languages encountered different problems, and no problem was common to all; some problems were culturally related, or related to accidental features of a specific language. The note-taking procedure was also somewhat haphazard. Where there is no problem, there is no need to make a note, and the same may be true if there is a relatively simple solution to a frequent or obvious problem. Thus my notes happen to be more extensive in the languages of Russia and Thailand than in the others. Notes tend to be made where more thought was needed, or the problem was unusual, or just where something happened to interest the consultant, who after all is a human being with his own fads and fancies, not to mention his own cultural baggage. The simplest procedure in this article is to go through the pericope of Acts 13.1–12 verse by verse and comment on what arose in each verse. Citations in English will be from the Revised Standard Version (RSV) unless otherwise stated.</p>
<sec id="section4-0260093513481148">
<title>Verse 1</title>
<p>The multitude of names in this verse was a fertile source of problems.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0260093513481148">2</xref></sup> Place names often present difficulties in minority languages in Thailand, where it is normal to prefix unfamiliar names with a “classifier” to show whether the name refers to a town, village, river, mountain, island, and so on. The problem in many such languages is that whereas English has numerous terms for human settlements of different size and importance (metropolis, conurbation, city, town, village, hamlet, etc.), they have only two terms. Generally, one refers to a metropolis like Bangkok, and the other to virtually all other settlements. This kind of contrast does not transfer well into the historical and cultural setting of the Bible, where even quite large towns were relatively small by modern standards. Especially in the Old Testament, what the Hebrew text calls “cities” (because they had a wall) would often be classed as no more than villages in Thai minority languages. What many translators have done is to apply the term for a larger settlement to places of importance in the narrative, even if they were not very large in absolute terms. Thus in Lawa, Antioch, which is of considerable significance in Acts, is given the label for the larger size of settlement (<italic>wiang</italic>).</p>
<p>The next problematic name was Symeon, as it is written in RSV (GNB, NJB, and NIV all have Simeon). In Lawa, it was felt desirable to have a spelling here that was different from that used for the apostle Simon Peter, so the name here was written <italic>Sime’on</italic> (in the modified Thai script used in Lawa), as opposed to <italic>Simon</italic> in, for instance, Acts 15.14. A more widespread difficulty arose with handling Symeon’s second name (or nickname?), “Niger” (RSV). As GNB indicates with “called the Black,” this name carries a meaning, and some translators may decide that in such a case a translation of the meaning is more relevant than a transcription of the spelling. It is interesting that in this case, <italic>Niger</italic> is a Latin word which is retained in the Greek text and is not translated into Greek, as it easily could have been. Perhaps the fact that the Latin name was used even in a predominantly Greek-speaking cultural context is an indication that Symeon came from an area where Latin was more commonly spoken, such as North Africa. As to the significance of this name or nickname, one can only speculate. It could well reflect Symeon’s ethnic origin: he might have been a black man either from Africa himself or of African descent, presumably through his father. He might perhaps just have had a darker complexion than most of his fellows. Or <italic>Niger</italic> might have been a completely irrational nickname for which there was no remembered explanation. The fact that Symeon is mentioned next to “Lucius of Cyrene,” who explicitly came from North Africa and also has a Latin name, suggests (though it does not prove) that Symeon may have been from that area too.</p>
<p>The translations on which I have notes vary considerably in their decisions on how to handle <italic>Niger</italic>. In Kalmyk, the translators considered translating the meaning of the name, but eventually decided that for readers with no Christian tradition, it was simpler just to transcribe the Latin form into the modified Cyrillic script that the language uses, with no footnote or other explanation. In Yakut, where there is an Orthodox Christian tradition, the decision was to keep <italic>Niger</italic>, but to add an explanatory phrase “that is, Black.” In Kahua and Tashelhayt a similar explanatory phrase was included. In Khakas, the name <italic>Niger</italic> was translated by the Khakas word for black, <italic>Khara</italic>, which happens to be a name in Khakas anyway and causes no problems. In Mal, the translators discussed the possibility of translating <italic>Niger</italic> not by the Mal word for “black” but by the Thai word for black (<italic>dam</italic>), which happens to have become a nickname in Mal whereas the Mal word has not. In the end they decided to retain the form <italic>Niger</italic>, adapted to the phonology of Mal.</p>
<p>In Kalmyk, the next name, “Lucius,” also gave rise to some discussion because of its similarity to the name of Luke, the companion of Paul and author of the Gospel and probably the Book of Acts. “Lucius” became <italic>Luki</italic> in contrast with <italic>Luka</italic> for “Luke” in such places as 2 Tim 4.11. This problem does not arise in the other three minority languages of Russia because their rendering of “Lucius” is based on the Russian form <italic>Lutsiy</italic>, which is significantly different from the Russian form of “Luke.” The handling of the place name “Cyrene” shows interesting differences between the two languages from Thailand and the four from Russia. The languages from Russia all form words based on the Russian word that begins <italic>Kirin-</italic>, which is derived directly from the Greek. The English form “Cyrene” is derived indirectly from Greek, being mediated through the Latin Vulgate. The two languages of Thailand form words based on the Thai form <italic>Sairin</italic>, which in turn is based on the English pronunciation of the form “Cyrene” rather than on the Greek spelling or pronunciation. Lawa takes over the Thai form unchanged, but Mal makes further adaptations as required by its own phonology, and the name becomes <italic>Saylin</italic>. The Mal form is thus at three removes from the Greek, being mediated through Latin, English, and Thai. Iai and Kahua both use the form <italic>Sairini</italic>, taken directly from English pronunciation.</p>
<p>The name “Manaen” (spelt thus in most English versions—the RSV spelling “Mana-en” seems to be an oddity, which NRSV has dropped) gave rise to a very different kind of problem. For some reason unknown to me, this name has come into the Russian Synodal Version (widely accepted by both Orthodox and Protestant Christians in Russia) as <italic>Manail</italic>, and in so far as this name is familiar at all, it is in this form. Translators in Russia therefore had to decide whether to follow the Greek form of the name or the Russian form. In Yakut and Khakas, where there are Christian traditions, the decision was to follow the Russian form. In Chechen (with a Sunni Muslim tradition), the decision was to follow the Greek form. In Kalmyk (with a Tibetan Buddhist tradition) the decision was to go back to the Hebrew form underlying the Greek, which is “Menahem.” This comes out sounding better in Kalmyk, and is a valid, though rather unusual, option. Iai used the form <italic>Manaina</italic> based on English pronunciation, whereas Kahua adapted the name to <italic>Maneni</italic> to fit its own phonology.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0260093513481148">
<title>Verse 2</title>
<p>The only note on this verse arose from the Tashelhayt translation. The question was how best to translate the Greek word λϵιτουργούντων, which RSV renders “worshiping.” The classical origin of the verb λϵιτουργέω lies in reference to community services of various kinds. In the Septuagint it is used of priestly service (for instance in Exod 29.30; Num 16.9). So what is the meaning here in Acts 13.2? The translators decided that in this context the focus was on worship and prayer in a general sense rather than on the kind of ritual activities common in the Old Testament context, or on public service in the wider community.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0260093513481148">
<title>Verse 3</title>
<p>The concept of fasting may or may not be familiar in a given culture. In Iai fasting as a means of gaining spiritual power is known, but not frequently practised. Likewise in Lawa, such action is not alien, but what the Christian leaders were doing in this verse needs to be distinguished from the more ritualised type of fasting mentioned for instance in Matt 9.14.</p>
<p>In Kalmyk, some explanation was needed for the laying of hands on Saul and Barnabas and sending them off, so the translation made it explicit that the other church leaders “laid their hands on them in blessing” and “sent them on God’s service.” In Mal, “sent them off” could be mistaken as a brusque dismissal, so this verb was rendered as “released them,” which carried more of the idea of commissioning them to go.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-0260093513481148">
<title>Verse 4</title>
<p>The places names were again a problem in this verse. In Mal, Seleucia was given the label of a city (<italic>myang</italic>) just as Antioch was in Lawa in v. 1, but in Lawa it was given a different label according to its lesser importance in the narrative. In both Mal and Lawa, Cyprus was given the label of “island” both in the text and in the section heading (using the Thai word for island, <italic>ko’</italic>). In Lawa the status of the island of Cyprus was further clarified by referring to it as a “province,” using another Thai word (<italic>jangwat</italic> in Lawa script).</p>
<p>In the four languages from Russia, the name “Cyprus” is based on the Russian form of the name (<italic>Kipr</italic>), which is derived directly from Greek in both spelling and pronunciation (omitting the Greek case ending). In Mal and Lawa, the derivation is more complicated, and again comes from English pronunciation via Thai spelling. The Thai spelling is <italic>Saipras</italic>, but a word-final <italic>s</italic> in Thai is pronounced <italic>t</italic>, so the Lawa form becomes <italic>Saiprat</italic> and the Mal form <italic>Saypad</italic>. In Iai the name is based on the English pronunciation and written <italic>Saiparo</italic>. This was evidently not influenced by the trade language of the Gulf of Papua, Hiri Motu, which has a form <italic>Kupro</italic> that appears to be taken directly from the spelling of the Greek. In Kahua, the form became <italic>Saipero</italic>. In Tashelhayt, the form is <italic>Quprus</italic>, which is presumably influenced by Arabic.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-0260093513481148">
<title>Verse 5</title>
<p>Salamis is classed as a village in both Mal and Lawa.</p>
<p>In Lawa John is referred to by his fuller name “John Mark” (as stated in 12.25) in order to make it clear that the same individual is referred to in both places. The same full name is used again in Lawa in 13.13. Kahua and Iai also used the full name in 13.5, 13. In vv. 4 and 5 in Mal, where only Saul and Barnabas have been mentioned, the verbs were in the dual form, but after John joined the apostles, the verbs had to become plural.</p>
<sec id="section9-0260093513481148">
<title>Verse 6</title>
<p>In Kahua, unsurprisingly for an island language, there is a basic contrast in verbs of motion between travel by land and travel by sea. In v. 4 it was explicit that Barnabas and Saul “sailed” to Cyprus, but once on the island, did they travel around by sea or by land? The translators assumed that the statement that they travelled “through the whole island” implied travel by land, and used the appropriate verb. In my own journeys to reach the Kahua-speaking area from the nearest airstrip at Kirakira, I travelled the twelve miles once by boat and once on foot (fording two rivers on the way), but that was only because the usual boat was out of service. In retrospect, I wonder if it seemed strange to the Kahua readers for the evangelists to choose to travel overland if boats were available? I do not know the answer to that question.</p>
<p>Lawa and Mal differed in the way they classified Paphos. In Lawa, it was, like Salamis in v. 5, a village, but in Mal it was a city, presumably because it was the seat of the Roman governor.</p>
<p>In both Lawa and Mal, there was discussion over the term “false prophet.” In Lawa the magician “claimed he could divine” (with the implication that the claim was false), whereas Mal was more explicit, saying that he was “one who divines to deceive others.” In Mal culture, divining is done by counting grains of rice. Mal also had an interesting feature in the way it transcribed the name “Bar-Jesus.” It came out as <italic>Bayesu</italic>, and though unfamiliar, it sounded like a name because <italic>Ba</italic> is a title similar to “Mr” in English.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-0260093513481148">
<title>Verse 7</title>
<p>A major decision in this verse is how to render the term for the Roman government rank “proconsul,” as it is found in many English versions. This is the Latin term of which the Greek word used here (α,νθύπατος) is the recognised equivalent. In the Russian Synodal Bible, the Latin word <italic>proconsul</italic> is also retained, but this term is not current in the minority languages. In Yakut the term <italic>proconsul</italic> was kept, but an explanatory phrase was added. In Khakas and Kalmyk a more generic term was used, rather like the term “governor” in GNB. In Kalmyk, there was discussion about whether the traditional term <italic>khan</italic> could be used, but this was rejected because it had already been used to describe “Herod the tetrarch” in v. 1.</p>
<p>Also in Kalmyk there was discussion whether in the name Sergius Paulus the second element was a personal name or a family name. My notes do not record what decision was taken, but in the published New Testament, the name appeared as <italic>Pavel-Sergey</italic>. In Acts 23.26 the similarly structured name “Claudius Lysias” appeared in the published New Testament as <italic>Klaud Lus’ya</italic>, and in 24.27 “Porcius Festus” came out rather engagingly as <italic>Pork Pest</italic>, so it appears that there was some inconsistency in the way the three names were handled—and that this escaped the notice of the Translation Consultant!</p>
<p>The Latin name <italic>Sergius</italic> gave rise to a wide variety of forms: in the Roman script languages it became <italic>Sekio</italic> in Iai (presumably based on the Latin pronunciation), and <italic>Seresio</italic> in Kahua (presumably based on the English pronunciation). In the Thai script languages it came out as <italic>Sĕji’ad</italic> in Mal (related both to Thai spelling and Thai pronunciation, with a shewa vowel in the first syllable), and <italic>Seraki’o</italic> in Lawa (possibly related to the Latin pronunciation). The Cyrillic script languages all used forms derived from the Russian <italic>Sergey</italic>. In the modified Arabic script of Tashelhayt, it was written <italic>Sarjius</italic>, probably based on English pronunciation.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-0260093513481148">
<title>Verse 8</title>
<p>In this verse the man introduced in v. 6 as Bar-Jesus is given another name, “Elymas.” The meaning of this name is not clear, and it is certainly not a translation of “Bar-Jesus.” RSV “Elymas the magician (for that is the meaning of his name)” implies that Elymas means “magician,” and this view is made more explicit in NIV and NJB. “Elymas” may indeed be derived from a Semitic root and carry a similar meaning to the Greek word μάγος, but GNB is less specific, and says simply “(that is his name in Greek).” Mal and Kalmyk both followed the example of GNB at this point, whereas Yakut and Chechen both followed the pattern of NIV and NJB. Lawa simply stated that Elymas was another name for the same person. In Kalmyk the word used for “magician” means “deceiver, cheat, charlatan.” The Greek term μάγος may have a more positive meaning of “wise man” or “astrologer” as in Matt 2, but here the meaning is plainly negative, as shown by the explanatory term “false prophet” in v. 6.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-0260093513481148">
<title>Verse 9</title>
<p>Perhaps surprisingly, the change of name from “Saul” to “Paul” did not cause any problems that came to my attention. In some cultures, it is not uncommon for a person to change their name, and there may even be events such as the death of a close relative that demand a change of name.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0260093513481148">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>The concept of Paul being “filled with the Holy Spirit” is often difficult to express. In Lawa this was rendered as “the Holy Spirit was in him in a full way.”</p>
<sec id="section13-0260093513481148">
<title>Verse 10</title>
<p>Paul’s stern rebuke to Elymas is expressed in strong terms that may not transfer easily into other languages and cultures. For instance in Mal, the opening expression “You son of the devil” came out as “You person on the side of evil spirits.”</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section14-0260093513481148">
<title>Verses 11–12</title>
<p>“The hand of the Lord is upon you” may be ambiguous in some cultures, not least because a similar expression was used in 11.21 to indicate blessing. In some languages it is therefore necessary to drop the metonymy and to make it explicit that punishment is in view here. Thus Kalmyk says, “The Lord will punish you.” In Mal the result of Paul’s imprecation is that “Darkness came over him.”</p>
<p>In Lawa, the question arose over the identity of “the Lord” in vv. 11 and 12. In v. 12, “the teaching of the Lord” is evidently a reference to the content of the gospel message as proclaimed by Barnabas and Paul, so “the Lord” there is fairly clearly the Lord Jesus. This is shown for instance in the NJB rendering “what he had learnt about the Lord.” So who is referred to in the phrase “the hand of the Lord” in v. 11? Here it seems rather unlikely that it is the Lord Jesus, so in Lawa, the translation made use of a vernacular idiom for punishment and said that Elymas would “feel the hand of God.”</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>The notes on which this article is based, fragmentary though they are, do serve to show what a fascinating variety of questions arise in different languages and cultures as translators try to make the same story clear, pronounceable, and relevant to their varied readers and hearers. It is impossible to remember all the questions that come up in one language when one is working in a completely different language and culture, in some cases over twenty-five years later. If I had the opportunity to work with all the projects over again after preparing this article, I would have a lot more questions to ask, and no doubt the translators would have some reactions from readers of the published text that they could not have anticipated at draft stage. No translation is ever perfect, but those translators who give many years of their lives to making the Bible available in languages that have never had it before surely deserve the title of “magi” in the best sense of the word.</p>
