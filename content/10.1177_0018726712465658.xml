<abstract>
<p>Retirement involves a set of institutional arrangements combined with socio-cultural meanings to sustain a distinct retirement phase in life course and career pathways. In this Introduction to the Special Issue: ‘Reinventing Retirement: New Pathways, New Arrangements, New Meanings,’ we outline the historical development of retirement. We identify the dramatic broad-based changes that recently have shaken this established construct to its core. We describe the main organizational responses to these changes, and how they have been associated with shifting, multiple meanings of retirement. Finally, we present a model that frames two general forms of reinvention of retirement. The first involves continuation of the idea of a distinct and well-defined period of life occurring at the end of a career trajectory, but with changes in the timing, the kinds of post-retirement activities pursued, and meanings associated with this period of life. The second represents a more fundamental reinvention in which the overall concept of retirement as a distinct period in an individual’s life is challenged or rejected, whether because it is not appealing or no longer realistic. We provide examples of how both types of reinvention may manifest in individuals’ careers and lives, and suggest future research directions that follow from our model.</p>

<p>The purpose of this Introduction to the Special Issue: ‘Reinventing Retirement: New Pathways, New Arrangements, New Meanings’ is to first provide some background on the historical and social context of retirement as a concept – how it emerged and became established as a function of the interaction of government, trade union and organization policies and practices, career and adult development theory, and socio-cultural meanings. Next we identify some of the most dramatic broad-based forces of change that in recent years have shaken this established construct to its core, and we give examples of the kinds of resulting ramifications. We also offer an overview of different kinds of organizational response to these changes and then explore some of the current multiple meanings of retirement. Finally, we frame two general forms that any <italic><underline>reinvention</underline></italic> of retirement might take. One involves continuation of the idea of a distinct and well-defined period of life occurring at the end of a career trajectory, but with changes in the timing, the kinds of post-retirement activities pursued, and meanings associated with this period of life. The second type of reinventing of retirement is a more dramatic, divergent path that involves challenging or rejecting the overall concept of retirement as a distinct period in an individual’s life, whether because it is not appealing or no longer realistic. We then provide examples of how this type of reinvention may manifest in individuals’ careers and lives.</p>
<sec id="section1-0018726712465658">
<title>Historical and social context</title>
<p>Mass retirement is an <italic><underline>invention</underline></italic> of the late 19th century, one that did not reach full maturity until after the Second World War. Its extension through the 20th century, with the building of institutional arrangements to provide retirement income, represents one of the major shifts in life course patterns over the past 200 years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0018726712465658">Anderson, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0018726712465658">Hardy, 2011</xref>). The experience of retirement as a distinctive life stage was not widespread before government, firm, and occupational pension schemes became common, along with well-defined retirement ages. Instead, people’s later lives were largely extensions of their earlier experiences with adjustments to physical decline, whether gradual or catastrophic. For those in privileged social positions, later life tended to continue the round of mixing business and pleasure that had become their habit as adults, albeit somewhat less strenuously. The working classes of the industrializing capitalist world rarely have had any prospect of retirement; instead, they could look forward to declining capacity to satisfy the demands of employers, and the likelihood of disability and unemployment as they aged. With great local variability, employers might offer lighter duties with pay that included a component of welfare, as the capacities of faithful employees declined (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0018726712465658">Conrad, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0018726712465658">Ransom and Sutch, 1986</xref>).</p>
<p>Indeed, for 19th century social reformers, the inconsistency of these arrangements, and the emergence of incontrovertible evidence that working-class aging was strongly associated with poverty among the old, produced strong pressure to act. Even this impulse was far from conceiving old age as retirement; the emphasis was on responding to the inevitable disability and resulting poverty of advancing years, rather than providing a period of leisure and freedom following a lifetime of toil. In general, reducing the risk of poverty in old age was the impetus for the range of late 19th and early 20th century state aged pension systems that emerged across the industrializing world (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0018726712465658">Arza and Johnson, 2006</xref>). Similarly, the friendly society, union based, and occupational pension schemes that sprang up at a similar time were focused much more on assisting the working class to provide for disability in old age than on offering a time of life to enjoy the fruits of their labor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0018726712465658">Sass, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>If retirement was an idea that generally did not apply to the independently wealthy and the working class in the 19th century, its relevance for the burgeoning ‘new’ middle classes of salaried white collar workers increased rapidly. Military pension systems had long existed, and became an important model. Pension schemes became established in the rapidly expanding 19th century state bureaucracies. One view is that they represented an aspect of the rationalization of state administration by supporting the formation of an independent, trustworthy, professionalized cadre of civil servants. Instituting a mandatory retirement age, which was usually integral to these schemes, also provided a mechanism for retiring older, ineffective civil servants. Other views might see such schemes more as evidence of the emerging power of the ‘new’ middle class. Whatever the case, the British civil service plan of 1859 was widely emulated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0018726712465658">Arza and Johnson, 2006</xref>). It involved most of the key elements of ‘defined benefit’ pension arrangements that became widespread in the 20th century: pensions were partially funded by employee contributions, but represented a payout that was significantly greater than the value of contributions plus interest; pensions became available at a standard retirement age with substantial loss of benefit if a worker left early; and pensions were an annuity for life following retirement, and they were based on the employee’s salary and years of service. As industrial firms grew in size, they too offered their white collar employees pensions on this model. Blue-collar workers in large firms were more commonly provided with industrial insurance, which provided a mechanism for insuring against death, disability, accident, and age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0018726712465658">Sass, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>Through the 20th century, with the extension of such private schemes and state pension schemes to cover more and more employees, most citizens came to view a distinct period of life in which they were ‘retired’ as at least a possibility, if not a right. The salience of this new phase of life increased along with growing longevity, so that more and more people could expect to reach retirement age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0018726712465658">Arza and Johnson, 2006</xref>). It is worth emphasizing that, although retirement was well established in the public imagination quite early in the 20th century, the necessary institutional supports to provide retirement incomes to most workers in the high-income countries were not actually in place until after the Second World War (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0018726712465658">Hardy, 2011</xref>). In the immediate post-war period, industrial capitalist societies adopted one or other of the ‘Bismarckian’ or ‘Beveridgean’ models. In the ‘Bismarckian’ model, state or quasi-state provided benefits varied according to pre-retirement income and were funded through contributions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0018726712465658">Myles and Quadagno, 1997</xref>). In the ‘Beveridgean’ model, employer arrangements were the core of the system, with state pensions funded from general revenue providing a safety net for workers without or with limited employer pensions.</p>
<p>The impact of these arrangements on life pathways, and the fact that retirement was far from universal even in the mid-20th century is illustrated by the pattern of decline in the proportion of British men over 65 who were in paid employment. It was 65 percent in 1891, 56 percent in 1911, 48 percent in 1931, 31 percent in 1951, and 13 percent in 1981 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0018726712465658">Thane, 2006</xref>). Of course, at the same time declining mortality meant that the proportion of the British population 65 or over was steadily rising. Pension schemes and mandatory or quasi-mandatory retirement ages became fundamental institutional supports for the development of a widespread experience of retirement as a distinctive life stage. In sharp contrast with their forebears in the 19th century for whom aging represented an increasingly difficult struggle to maintain their capacity to work, most men who reached the age of 65 in the 1970s and 1980s experienced a major life transition when they moved from full-time paid work to retirement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0018726712465658">Moen, 1996</xref>). Women’s experience of retirement was always more differentiated than men’s. However, by the 1960s and 1970s it had become a distinct life stage for most women too, whether because of a shift in their roles and responsibilities as homemakers when their husbands retired, or because they themselves retired from paid work. In short, retirement had become one of the main life stages in the ‘standardized’ life course that came to define the pathways of most people from childhood through education and paid work to family formation, retirement, and eventual death and decline (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0018726712465658">Anderson, 1985</xref>).</p>
<p>In this context, the meaning of retirement tended to resolve in one of two directions. On the one hand, retirement came to be constructed as a period of unparalleled freedom. Retirees with secure pension-based incomes were seen as able to engage in whatever leisure activities they chose, and that were within their capabilities. No longer burdened by the demands of paid work and child-rearing, they could shape their own lives according to their heart’s desire. On the other hand, for the less well-off, who did not benefit from generous contributory pensions and were left to rely on residual welfare arrangements, retirement loomed as a time of straitened circumstances and increasingly limited possibility. Between these opposites, retirement was also often seen as a time for supporting children in their own transition to adulthood and family formation. Studies of the meaning of retirement also tapped a darker vein of feelings of increasing irrelevance as retirees experienced loss of status and responsibilities. Of course, the meanings associated with retirement came to be much more subtle than this brief outline suggests (e.g. see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0018726712465658">Savishinsky, 2001</xref>), but they nevertheless tended to flow along these broad lines.</p>

<title>Forces of change and ramifications</title>
<p>A number of broad-based societal level and organizational changes have occurred in recent years and have led to disruptions in how retirement has been experienced by individuals, as well as how organizations try to regulate and control the exit of late career workers. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0018726712465658">Figure 1</xref> provides a model illustrating: a) the invention of retirement as a concept; b) the forces of change acting to disrupt the established conception and practice of ‘retirement’; and c) two different kinds of reinvention of retirement that are emerging. In the center is a representation of the key features of the history of the invention of retirement summarized above; below is the framing of two different kinds of reinvention of retirement; and in the circles around the margins are broad forces of change proposed to be key factors in reinvention of this distinct period of life. Below we elaborate on the six different forces of change depicted in the model and describe some of the resulting ramifications with respect to retirement.</p>

<p>First of all, life expectancy and health status of adults over 60 has increased dramatically in recent years. For example, between the years of 1990 and 2009, the average global life expectancy at birth increased from 64 to 68. Specifically, we see this age increase from 69 to 75 in the Western Pacific Region (including Australia and New Zealand), from 71 to 76 in the Americas, and 71 to 75 in the European Region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0018726712465658">World Health Organization [WHO], 2012</xref>). In addition, the global population aged 60 years can expect to live another 19 years on average in 2009, compared with another 18 years in 1990 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0018726712465658">WHO, 2012</xref>). The increased life expectancy and longer good health among mature adults delays the impact of age-related effects on health that have previously affected employees’ physical and cognitive capacity related to work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0018726712465658">Wang and Shultz, 2010</xref>). Increased longevity and health have also created a much longer period of time spent ‘in retirement’ in good health before death. With the average age of retirement in the USA declining from over 70 in 1960 to under 65 in 2004 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0018726712465658">OECD, 2005</xref>), while life expectancy was increasing to 79 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0018726712465658">WHO, 2012</xref>), this means that a typical adult could easily expect to spend 20–30 years in retirement. This macro level shift in life expectancy has had two big ramifications. First, it has taxed the capacity of private and public pension/superannuation plans to pay for the increased average time they must support pensioners after retirement. Second, it has challenged individuals’ conceptions of what retirement is all about, whether they want to or can afford to retire, and if they do, how they want to spend the remaining time they have in life.</p>
<p>Two other broad-based societal trends with existing and ongoing impacts on retirement pathways are the gender revolution and the de-standardization and individualization of the life course. The gender revolution has meant a dramatic increase in the participation of women in the labor force and shifting family patterns and marital ideologies. The dual-earner family is the norm, and fathers and mothers must juggle responsibility for career and family; career moves must be engineered around spousal career needs as well as children’s social and educational needs. The fact that individuals typically live ‘linked lives’ with spouses or significant others, who also have careers, means that varying family circumstances (e.g. working spouses, dependent children/parents, and health of these important persons, etc.) will dictate different retirement pursuits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0018726712465658">Moen, 2001</xref>). Furthermore, new research on the meanings of retirement for women (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0018726712465658">Price and Nesteruk, 2010</xref>) as well as the impact of rising separation/divorce rates on women’s and men’s financial circumstances at ‘standard’ retirement ages is likely to reveal new challenges to traditional retirement.</p>
<p>The de-standardization and individualization of the life course means that past age-driven predictable patterns of education, work, marriage, and family no longer reign (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0018726712465658">Macmillan, 2005</xref>). There is much greater heterogeneity in the workforce in the sequencing of these events, which has an effect ultimately on late career pathways. For example, a woman who starts a career in her 20s and postpones marriage and family until age 40, has a very different career and life trajectory than a woman who marries and has children in her 20s, stays at home awhile, then goes back to school and enters the workforce at age 40. The de-standardization of the life course is coupled with chronological age losing its predictive power to estimate individuals’ activities, needs, and wants across the lifespan. Traditional theories of adult development and career stages have been grounded in the power of age to determine motivation, individual choices, and transitions, as well as achievement. Yet age is no longer the ultimate determining variable. For example, some go back to school mid-career, others even in late career. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0018726712465658">Han and Moen (1999)</xref> have made it clear that women’s career patterns involve interruptions and/or late launch or part-time work so that for them ‘late career’ is 65–75 in terms of comparable number of years spent working.</p>
<p>Other examples of variation in retirement patterns can be interpreted as evidence of de-standardization and individualization of the life course. Some research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0018726712465658">Johnson et al., 2009</xref>) has shown that many choose second or even third careers over age 55 that may involve not just a change in employer but a change in occupation (‘recareering’). We also know that some retirees take on significant responsibility for child care of grandchildren, or start entrepreneurial or philanthropic ventures. Others look like they are ‘retiring’ but find ways to work reduced-load or part time or other customized work arrangements to allow them to cut back to find balance in their lives while staying highly engaged and continuing to use their skills and knowledge and make an important contribution. Research on kaleidoscope careers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0018726712465658">Sullivan and Mainiero, 2008</xref>) has moved toward disentangling age from different stages in individuals’ careers over time, also examining differences in women and men’s career patterns.</p>
<p>A fourth societal trend that has influenced changing retirement patterns is the general aging of the population, as well as the increased level of education in the population. The aging of the population and the pressure on pension plans has led to changes in government regulations about mandatory retirement ages. While countries such as Canada and the USA for the most part have abolished mandatory retirement, in Europe, the situation is somewhat different. Some countries have default retirement ages of 65 (e.g. Ireland, Denmark, and France), while Sweden and Norway have moved from 65 to 67. On the other hand, in some countries long-standing employment protection laws, collective agreements, and state pension rules create significant disincentives for those planning to stay at work beyond 65 (e.g. in France, Germany, and some Eastern European countries). In the UK, legislation in 2011 means that businesses need to objectively justify any compulsory retirement age still in place to avoid legal claims of age discrimination. As highlighted by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0018726712465658">Flynn, Upchurch, Muller-Camen and Schroder (2013)</xref> in this Special Issue, trade unions in the UK and Germany have also responded to these changes by shifting their policies from protecting early retirement toward promoting older persons’ employability, particularly in the UK retail sector. German trade unions have focused more on a dual strategy of protecting early retirement routes (across sectors) and negotiating age equality policies (at the national level).</p>
<p>More highly educated individuals are part of the growth of new retirement pathways such as pursuit of ‘bridge employment’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0018726712465658">Kim and Feldman, 2000</xref>), which means pursuing employment <italic>after</italic> retirement. Bridging represents a proposed new interim career stage or new transition to retirement, depending on one’s perspective (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0018726712465658">Feldman and Ng, 2007</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0018726712465658">Wang et al. (2009)</xref> found that 50 percent of their sample retiring between 2002 and 2006 engaged in bridge employment at some point over the following eight years. In this Special Issue, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0018726712465658">Pleau and Shaumann (2013)</xref> find that the odds of making a transition from retirement to employment are greatest among younger retirees. Moreover, college educated men and women are also more likely to enter re-employment than men and women with less than a high school education. From a race perspective, non-whites are also more likely to re-enter the labor force than whites, which is consistent across men and women.</p>
<p>A fifth major set of changes is represented by much more frequent and unpredictable change in the large organizations that employ most workers. This includes globalization, increased competitiveness, delayering of levels of management, abandonment of corporate internal labor markets for promotion, and increased uncertainty in the external environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0018726712465658">Osterman, 2010</xref>). Management scholars have theorized about the growth of boundaryless careers and protean careers, which do not take place within one or two organizations, but rather involve a great deal of strategic movement requiring individual agency and networking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0018726712465658">Arthur and Rousseau, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0018726712465658">Hall, 2004</xref>). Although these new kinds of careers have been touted as having some advantages from an individual perspective, there is much debate on this issue, and some scholars are now questioning the validity of some of the associated constructs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0018726712465658">Inkson et al., 2012</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0018726712465658">Martin and Lee (2012)</xref> have recently theorized that late career pathways among managers are determined by different kinds of employment relationships sustained over time, because of autonomy dispositions that develop as a result of the kind of expertise and experience exercised; these dispositions are then proposed to influence activities in retirement. Whether careers are more boundaryless or not, there has been a decline in organizational stability and guarantee of long-term employment, which has led to less certainty around workers’ reaching the age of maximum pension benefits for retirement. A recent study of retired baby boomer managers and executives in Canada showed that more than half of the sample had been through a major organizational change (e.g. merger, acquisition, downsizing, restructuring) that affected the timing and terms of their exit from the organization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0018726712465658">Vough et al., 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>The final global trend driving change in individual retirement plans and organizational policies and practices is global economic turbulence. One of the major organizational ramifications has been the move from defined benefit (DB) to defined contribution (DC) pension schemes, in order to reduce financial risk to the organization. Most employers in the private sector in North America have replaced DB pensions with DC plans. In the USA many have also eliminated health care benefits for retirees (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0018726712465658">Wang and Shultz, 2010</xref>). While DB plans have traditionally meant some sort of promise from the employer in return for long-term loyal service, DC plans on the other hand are not based on a promise of a pension based on future earnings. In the latter case employers make current contributions, the value of which at retirement will be based on market performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0018726712465658">Gough and Arkani, 2011</xref>). Thus, there is no bonus for long-tenured employees, as was the case with DB plans. All this has also meant the shift from a more relational to a transactional contract between employer and employee. Clearly, DC plans are less costly for the organization, and they are not founded on the sense of loyalty or commitment in their employees.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0018726712465658">
<title>Organizational response</title>
<p>Traditionally, organizations have developed policies and practices around retirement as a specific kind of employee exit over which they could have some control. In fact, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0018726712465658">Wang and Shultz (2010)</xref> suggest that organizations have tended to try to manage retirement of their employees in order to increase the predictability of employee behavior and better attain organizational objectives. In this sense, retirement policy and practice is part of the human resource management system in organizations aimed at creating a desirable flow of talent and developing the necessary skills and knowledge throughout the organization at acceptable costs. The extensive and multi-faceted changes discussed previously have created new challenges for organizations seeking to strategically orchestrate retirement. Some organizations have responded by offering different retirement options. So how do organizational factors and practices shape employees’ options in late career? To answer this question, we pay particular attention to organization size, proactivity, flexibility, I-deals, and age-inclusive organizational cultures.</p>
<p>Organizational factors, such as size, are likely to increase the variability of career ending timing. Results from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0018726712465658">Post, Schneer, Reitman and ogilvie’s (2013)</xref> research in this Special Issue indicate that employees’ working in larger organizations expect to retire earlier than those working in smaller organizations. They argue that smaller organizations may be more flexible in accommodating novel retirement plans.</p>
<p>Organizations are also realizing the challenges related to managing a multigenerational workforce, and some realize the need for tailor-made approaches that will respond to the unique needs of each generation. Organizations vary in the approach they take to addressing differential needs of their employees (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0018726712465658">Armstrong-Stassen and Cattaneo, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0018726712465658">Claes and Heymans, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0018726712465658">Midtsundstad, 2011</xref>). Some will engage in more proactive approaches, characterized by strategic planning that consists of analyzing and forecasting business needs, as well as considering the specific needs of the aging workforce. This is often done through surveys, and mutual exchange. Others may take a much more passive approach and wait for issues to present themselves; these organizations may see less urgency and be less willing to re-evaluate their approach and implement any changes.</p>
<p>In the former group, the more proactive organizations are viewing management of mature workers through the lens of a ‘business case.’ They are finding unique ways to accommodate this population, thereby perceiving this segment of their workforce as a unique asset worthy of investment. They are often focusing on individualization of working arrangements in which individual agreements are made between an employee and the organization (e.g. idiosyncratic deals or I-deals, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0018726712465658">Rousseau, 2005</xref>). Some argue that the effectiveness of customized work arrangements, sometimes known as ‘I-deals,’ is dependent on the work unit climate. In general, organizations that are more ‘developmental’ in orientation establish more effective work flexibility arrangements that positively influence the motivation to continue working (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0018726712465658">Bal et al., 2012</xref>). While these informal selective retention strategies may work well for some employees, they also empower employers to segment the mature workforce. This is likely to lead to increased inequality as employees with greater human capital leverage it so as to make themselves more attractive, while the majority of mature workers are not in this position. For example, in the UK, reduced emphasis on official, formal HR policies and practices sits alongside opportunities for mature workers to stay employed by making specific, individual arrangements with their immediate managers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0018726712465658">Flynn, 2010</xref>). As a result, through these more informal I-deals, employers may exercise much choice and power over the type of mature worker they seek to retain. Under these arrangements, despite various management practices in place, whether employees stay or go depends much more on an employee’s direct manager than on specific programs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0018726712465658">Piktialis, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>A further issue is whether changes in retirement arrangements and pathways are enabled or hindered by organizational culture. This is best seen in situations where cultural biases and age-based stereotypes prevail and pose barriers to implementation and successful use of new initiatives and practices. These ‘established retirement cultures’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0018726712465658">Flynn, 2010</xref>) may require a complete culture change, both in terms of classic conceptions about mature workers as well as ‘institutionalized time clocks’ that involve age-based expectations about retirement occurring between 62 and 65 years of age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0018726712465658">Moen, 2007</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0018726712465658">Moen (2007)</xref> argues that these schedules, with their ‘lockstep convoy of time,’ may be responsible for creating age segregation and related discrimination in our institutions. Unfortunately, some organizations persist in having a culture of discriminating and may be marginalizing mature workers, thus preventing them from staying longer and denying them flexible options or continuity around retirement schedules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0018726712465658">Piktialis, 2007</xref>). Moulaert and Biggs (in this Special Issue, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0018726712465658">2013</xref>) call for a new discourse of aging that embraces everyday life-tasks that arise in older age, mature life course development and social contribution, rather than thinking about older workers solely in terms of economic productivity. Indeed, viewing older workers primarily in economic terms may be considered a new form of ageism.</p>
<p>As described earlier, providing special arrangements and accommodating mature workers to work longer is far from a simple matter. Arguably, it is now more imperative than ever for organizations to realize the value of dialogue between their mature workers and management. Even if employers have the best intentions, employees’ wishes and plans will vary, and some standardized initiatives will waste organizational resources without preventing the loss of valuable human capital. In particular, employers may need to focus on understanding what ‘flexibility’ means to late career employees, as this will likely be very different in meaning to other segments of the working population. Mature workers may want arrangements that involve working less than earlier in their careers, but engaging in meaningful assignments and opportunities for mentoring and coaching. At the same time working less will have to be offered in relation to their specific needs outside of work, such as taking care of elderly parents. Some organizations are realizing the value of these unique flexible arrangements and have focused on providing diverse options such as: flexible scheduling in the form of half shifts, ‘snow bird’ programs, and extended time off for travel and family visits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0018726712465658">Piktialis and Morgan, 2003</xref>), while others are still a long way away from establishing these practices and re-assessing their organizational culture to be age- inclusive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0018726712465658">Seike et al., 2012</xref>). In the next section we turn to examine contemporary meanings of retirement.</p>

<title>Multiple meanings of retirement</title>
<p>Extended, contracted and alternative retirement trajectories, the changing nature of women’s workforce participation and notions such as productive aging mean there has been a distinct shift in what it means to retire. Underpinning this shift is an important scholarly debate about what retirement is. In reviewing the literature <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0018726712465658">Denton and Spencer (2009)</xref> recognize that retirement is predominately described by what people are <italic>not</italic> doing – not working. Rightly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0018726712465658">McVittie and Goodall (2012)</xref> propose that we need to take fuller account of the cultural, developmental, and social understandings of retirement if we are to better comprehend the diversity of meanings of retirement. The nature and form of identity work in retirement and even resistance to retirement, herald novel ways of understanding retirement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0018726712465658">Sargent et al., 2011</xref>). It is these new meanings that are worthy of attention, because they shed new light on how individuals maintain, negotiate or re-invent the self in retirement.</p>
<p>Contemporary retirement is marked by consumption (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0018726712465658">Gilleard et al., 2005</xref>), which is in sharp contrast to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0018726712465658">Walker’s (2006)</xref> perspective on producer-based aging. Consumption relates to embracing lifestyles that include leisure, pleasure, experiences, and the use of goods, knowledge and services, as well as education. Being producer-based refers to being engaged in market-based activities – working for pay as well as socially productive activities that contribute to the well-being of society such as the provision of volunteer services (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0018726712465658">Denton and Spencer, 2009</xref>). These two alternative constructions of retirement provide insight into the forms and types of retiree identities.</p>
<p>Recent research studying retired managers has highlighted both consumer and producer-based retirement identities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0018726712465658">Sargent et al., 2011</xref>). Interestingly, those who were working in retirement were doing so to maintain their pre-retirement professional identity. They also sought to distance themselves from leisure-based consumer identities. For example, they rejected ‘winters in Florida’ and stigmatized these types of identities. By doing so they were securing for themselves a positive, active retirement identity, retaining power and status in their own eyes, and not ending up on the ‘dust heap’ of inactivity by forfeiting long-held social, human and cultural capital. Thus, one way to resist aging is to keep working; by doing this mature workers combat invisibility and ‘stay young’ by ‘staying active’. Other managers reported defying age through active self-work and disciplining the body through exercise and keeping fit. Here the body is treated as an on-going project for improvement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0018726712465658">Bourdieu, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0018726712465658">Slevin, 2010</xref>). There is potential for a vicious cycle of disciplining the body and technologies of self-presentation (coloring greying hair, cosmetic surgery, regimes of vitamin tablets, and fitting attire) to remain an ‘attractive’ commodity for the labor market (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0018726712465658">Ainsworth and Hardy, 2008</xref>). The risk of such an approach is a new form of ageism that involves viewing older persons only in terms of economic productivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0018726712465658">Moulaert and Biggs, 2013</xref>).</p>
<p>A more critical appraisal of consumption and production practices is certainly warranted because of their links to images of what ‘good, moral’ citizens ought to do in western societies, which have emerged just as people’s experiences become more precarious, individualized, and risky (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0018726712465658">Moulaert and Biggs, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0018726712465658">Rudman, 2006</xref>). These regimes also have the potential to shape inclusion and exclusion in later life as highlighted by Moulaert and Biggs’ analysis of ‘active aging’ (in this Special Issue, 2013). As mentioned earlier in this introduction as well as in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0018726712465658">Phillipson’s (2013)</xref> commentary on the articles in this Special Issue, retirement as it was practiced in the last half of the 20th century is unraveling, as are the systems of retirement at the state level, as exemplified in the repealing of welfare and state-based pensions or extending the age at which they are accessible. Rudman (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0018726712465658">2006</xref>: 195) argues that neo-liberalism aims to minimize the state’s intrusion in individual lives. Hence, mature workers need to care for themselves, not be reliant on the state and ‘to govern themselves in responsible ways.’ Being productive and active may well extend lives; however, to what extent does this deepen inequality, diminish quality of life, and create the illusion of freedom and emancipation in retirement?</p>
<p>Feminist researchers have focused on the unique experiences of women, given the potential for discontinuities in women’s careers due to the family and work cycles, the extended longevity of women, as well as the financial consequences of their life courses in terms of accrual of resources for retirement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0018726712465658">Price, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0018726712465658">Price and Nesteruk, 2010</xref>). While women’s experiences of retirement are different from men’s, it has only been recently that these distinctions have been articulated, and interestingly from a range of disciplinary perspectives. Application of the kaleidoscope career model demonstrates that women employ ‘authenticity’ (women focused on taking care of themselves) in novel ways in late career and beyond (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0018726712465658">August, 2011</xref>). This took a variety of forms: maintaining personal relationships, exercising, focusing on medical needs, reprioritizing their lives, or engaging in generative work that provided deeper, more connected meaning that was reported as intensely challenging. The latter was considered a surprising finding. However, it is consistent with Australian findings that identified a sub-group of women as being transformative in terms of their mode of retirement in that they created post-retirement careers, doing different kinds of work compared with their previous employment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0018726712465658">Everingham et al., 2007</xref>). This transformative mode is distinct from the other two modes of retirement that emerged in the study: 1) <italic>gateway retirement</italic>, which mimics a ‘traditional male’ retirement as the end of working life; and 2) <italic>transitional retirement</italic>, which involves extending working life through flexible work practices – an easing out of working life.</p>
<p>A recent US study of women’s retirement paths also provides evidence of women being employment-focused (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0018726712465658">Price and Nesteruk, 2010</xref>). For some, work was necessary to supplement funds in retirement; while for others it related to wanting a challenge as well as being socially engaged. Thus, being economically productive in retirement had a range of different drivers. In addition to being economically productive, women also described being socially productive through being family and service-focused. Consistent with a consumption orientation, others reported being recreationally oriented. Finally, a group of women also spoke of being disenchanted with retirement. Those disenchanted with retirement had experienced health problems, financial insecurity, and death of a spouse or significant caregiving responsibilities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0018726712465658">Price and Nesteruk, 2010</xref>). These experiences in retirement foreshadow a darker vein of loss and unforeseen circumstances shaping meaning in retirement.</p>
<p>Another interesting aspect of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0018726712465658">Price and Nesteruk’s (2010)</xref> study was their finding that some women who were recreation-focused in retirement reported feeling like they were putting their interests and desires before the needs of others for the first time – an emancipation of sorts. This finding resonates with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0018726712465658">August’s (2011)</xref> assertion of the importance of authenticity in late career and beyond and is also linked to the article by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0018726712465658">Loretto and Vickerstaff (2013)</xref> in this Special Issue on the domestic and gendered context of retirement. They found that women wanted freedom from the ‘carer’ role of their gender contracts with partners, whereas the male partners viewed retirement as a reward for their long years of work and a time to pursue hobbies. For many women, retirement was not a life stage but rather an evolving process depending heavily on changing circumstances and domestic context. This provides a much more nuanced understanding of contemporary meanings of retirement, and demonstrates that these constructions are shaped by institutional arrangements, life courses and socio-cultural meanings as highlighted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0018726712465658">Figure 1</xref>. Loretto and Vickerstaff’s article also highlights that retirement is not gender-neutral.</p>

<sec id="section5-0018726712465658">
<title>Reinvention of retirement</title>
<p>In general, the forces for change emphasized earlier in this article and the contemporary constructions of retirement might lead to two broadly contrasting kinds of <italic><underline>reinvention</underline></italic> of retirement, which are also presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0018726712465658">Figure 1</xref>: (1) reinvention with the idea of a distinctive experience sustained; and (2) reinvention in which retirement loses its character as a distinctive life stage, and thus its distinctive institutional supports and meanings.</p>
<p>First, <italic><underline>reinvention</underline></italic> could involve <italic>change</italic> to one or more of the institutional arrangements supporting retirement, the patterns of life course pathway into retirement, or the meanings associated with retirement. But such changes would occur without threatening the viability of retirement as a distinctive life experience. Thus, for example, a shift from the dominance of defined benefit towards the dominance of defined contribution models of pension provision could increase the variability of the age at which people retire, as it reduces penalties for early retirement and makes retirement incomes more subject to the vagaries of financial markets. This change in pension models may also lead more retirees to become active investors of their own retirement funds, thus shifting the notion of what people typically do in retirement.</p>
<p>Another example of a kind of reinvention of retirement that does <italic>not</italic> alter the concept of retirement as a desirable and unique stage of life is simply more variation in how individuals use their time once retired. So, for example, there has been a growing trend toward ‘bridge employment’, or individuals becoming involved in providing care for grandchildren or elderly parents, or individuals committing to significant and long-term social contributions through volunteer work, often utilizing skills and knowledge from their careers. Some research has even suggested that some retirees engage in more ‘consumer’-oriented activities, whether it is purchasing goods, travel or adventures, or education and culture; whereas others engage in more ‘producer’-oriented activities, for example, employment or volunteer work or even home improvement or writing a book.</p>
<p>Finally, it could be argued that forms of reinvention of retirement that do not threaten the basic essence of the idea include activities generated from shifts in socio-cultural meanings associated with this distinctive time of life. So, in addition to the traditional associations of retirement being a period of freedom to choose how one spends one’s time and a period for pursuit of leisure, or being a time of curtailed opportunity and possibly dependency as a result of reduced financial resources, reinvention of retirement is also associated with individuals wanting to make a meaningful contribution to society, to embrace a period of giving back. Though some might argue that this is a novel approach to retirement, it is still grounded in the basic framework of retirement as a distinctive experience and as a period of life facilitated by the financial stability provided as a result of a traditional career and pension.</p>
<p>But <italic><underline>reinvention</underline></italic> of retirement could have a more fundamental and, arguably, more profound meaning if it leads towards a breakdown of the distinctiveness of retirement as a well-defined, and virtually universal, life stage. What would this kind of reinvention look like if based on a scenario of retirement losing its cache as a desirable goal in life, or being abandoned or simply found irrelevant, or perhaps even unrealistic by an increasing number of segments of the population?</p>
<p>One manifestation might simply be an ironic resurrection of 19th century patterns in which, say, retirement was only for people of a certain social position. Due to the lack of institutional arrangements, education or ‘lot in life’, individuals might need to assume they will need to work indefinitely. Or people’s life patterns might come to combine activities (paid work, leisure, family responsibilities) in much more varied ways throughout their lives than in the last century, so that a distinctive phase of ‘retirement’ becomes less and less meaningful. For example, women’s typical life course patterns of combining periods of full-time work with breaks and/or part-time work might become more common among men and women. Individuals might expect to participate in the labor force for 30–40 years between the ages of 30 and 80, but in a variety of different sequences depending on family responsibilities and spousal work. The idea would be to combine different aspects of life in satisfactory ways all along the life span and at different ages, instead of work and career being concentrated into certain periods, followed by rest and recuperation afterwards or sabbatical style leave.</p>
<p>Alternatively, retirement as a separate and distinct period of time could cease to be of interest if people were able to pursue multiple careers over time, doing the kind of work they enjoy and learning new skills along the way, making adjustments based on their evolving interests and needs and depending on their circumstances, including the domestic and gendered contract at home. For some, the connotation of retirement as a time to do nothing, to sit back and relax, etc., has no appeal. As changing institutional pension arrangements create more uncertainty and individuals are forced to take on more risk and responsibility for financing of retirement if they want it, many may reject this life stage and choose instead a more extended period of work, especially if they are able to customize how they work to suit their goals; for some there will be little choice and they will undertake more precarious forms of employment late in life. Hopefully individuals will not be a slave to the dominant discourses of <italic>active</italic> and <italic>productive</italic> aging, and we echo calls for attention to different notions of <italic>desired</italic> aging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0018726712465658">Moulaert and Biggs, 2013</xref>), whatever form that takes.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0018726712465658">
<title>Future research directions</title>
<p>Future research about retirement will be challenged by the shifting sands of the institutional arrangements that support it, the changing patterned pathways people follow into and through retirement, and the variety of meanings they give to it.</p>
<p>The institutional arrangements that support retirement continue to be a key area for research. New financial risks and uncertainties loom large, as national and corporate pension arrangements are reconfigured to deal with ongoing financial turmoil. For many older workers, these are reasons for working longer or returning to paid work from retirement. At the same time, many see growing question about the capacity of trade unions, professional associations and the like to limit negative institutional reconfigurations, or provide alternatives. These shifts may further exacerbate the problems faced by many retirees, as opportunities are reduced for using collective action to resist discrimination and exploitation. Of course, just how these changes work out in practice is complex, as the contribution of Flynn et al. in this Special Issue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0018726712465658">2013</xref>) demonstrates. Moreover, new arrangements may emerge serendipitously, as employers and employees, each for their own reasons, seek to mitigate the risks faced by retirees. Overall, there can be little doubt of the need for careful research unpacking the complex character and impacts of broad institutional change.</p>
<p>At the level of organizations, there is much research to be done about emerging and innovative models of retirement. The growing demand for skilled and experienced workers in many areas will focus the attention of many organizations on how to retain such workers, given emerging shortages of younger workers in countries with aging workforces. As we have noted, existing research certainly demonstrates the very patchy emergence of new organizational models of late career and transition to retirement, and their often idiosyncratic origins. But is it possible to identify a range of innovative late career roles and employment relationships that yield benefits to both employees and employers? Can they be theorized systematically? Under what conditions do particular models appear, and what determines whether they are successful? Being able to answer questions like these might lead employers to innovate more freely and successfully, to the mutual benefit of themselves and their employees.</p>
<p>Understanding how retirement pathways are changing, and what is influencing them will remain a challenging research task. Institutional changes will be important, but are far from the only influences. Changing demographic patterns should be of central interest. Longer life spans may lead to new possibilities for later life innovation, while at the same time making people more at risk of the constraints of new caring demands. How do those nearing and entering retirement balance their own aims and desires against the needs of ailing partners and spouses, or the childcare needs of their adult children? Undoubtedly, there will be great variation in these patterns with different contexts. Moreover, new retirement generations, such as the Baby Boomers, have gendered experiences and expectations built around women’s increased participation in paid work. As Loretto and Vickerstaff demonstrate in this Special Issue, careful research on the gender context and patterning of retirement is essential. It will undoubtedly become more so as the gendered experiences and expectations of past generations give way to those of the Baby Boomers and subsequent generations.</p>
<p>Many people approaching retirement will be centrally concerned with the meanings they and others give to retirement, even whether retirement should be a distinct period of their lives with special meaning. Indeed, the results of research about the shifting and varied meanings of retirement may turn out to have as much real world impact as research on any other aspect. New meanings may involve new social engagements, such as social entrepreneurship or volunteering, or self-exploration, or other as yet unimagined possibilities. As people live longer lives, there is much to be learnt about generativity, learning, and development and how the life course and ‘shocks’ shape the pathways taken. Shifting and developing concepts of what retirement can be will be central here. Indeed, research documenting and elaborating meanings may find a ready market among those nearing retirement age who are contemplating at least a decade or two of active, engaged life ahead of them and looking for inspiration and models of how to ‘do’ their later lives. Perhaps even the impact of retirement research on older citizens may itself become a topic of research!</p>
<p>As the articles in this Special Issue illustrate, the challenges of understanding retirement will require the full range of research strategies and techniques the social sciences have to offer. Our belief is that researchers will need to adapt their research strategies, and remain open to those they are unfamiliar with (possibly even unsympathetic to), if the dynamic and critical approaches needed to investigate retirement are to emerge. Read together, the articles in this Special Issue demonstrate the capacity of research – using approaches ranging from critical discursive, to grounded qualitative, to middle range survey, to sophisticated large scale statistical analysis – with each serving to illuminate the other and to suggest the next interesting and uncomfortable research questions.</p>
<p>In the end, of course, those living retirement and those impacted by it do not experience the analytical dimensions of retirement we have described – institutional supports, patterned life course pathways, and meanings – as separated or necessarily even distinct. Those who may use this research, from conscientious policy makers to engaged elders themselves, will be faced with the daunting task of using research focused largely on one or other dimension to inform policies or life strategies that support the seamless lived experience of retirement. Perhaps this is the greatest challenge of all for researchers – how to talk to each other across analytical foci and divergent research strategies. This is not a call to reach some grand consensus on all the important issues, but rather for researchers to develop an enlightening dialogue that openly confronts uncertainties, disagreements and contradictions in research outcomes. Some issues may be resolved through such a process. But the most useful contribution researchers can make on other problems, perhaps the most difficult, may be to engage in open dialogue and debate that lays bare all of the dilemmas and uncertainties that the future holds. For the ultimate consumers of research – whether they are active individual citizens, organized groups, or policy makers – this may be the ‘added value’ committed social science researchers can offer.</p>
