<p>Many scholarly publications on contemporary China become outdated after publication, as a result of rapid changes in China. The book under review is a typical example. The subject of this book is the Chinese state’s retreat from health services. However, it should be pointed out that China kicked off a new round of health-care reforms in 2006 – characterized by World Bank scholars as ‘re-engagement of the state’.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the book is still valuable, as it attempts to explore two important issues. The first is the extent of state retreat in China’s health-care sector before the new health-care reforms were implemented. The other concerns the factors that caused the retreat, which seems rather puzzling against the background of China’s authoritarian political system.</p>
<p>The book has six chapters. The first chapter addresses the research questions and develops an explanatory framework by drawing insights from studies on the retrenchment of the welfare state in comparative politics. Chapter 2 sets the historical background for the book by describing the development of China’s state-run health-care system between the 1950s and 1980s. Chapter 3 describes the decline of the government’s budgetary spending on health since the 1980s. Chapter 4 examines the state’s retreat from health security in the countryside, mainly the rapid demise of rural cooperative medical schemes across China. Chapter 5 looks at the so-called ‘retrenchment in urban health insurance’, primarily the collapse of the workplace-based free health-care system and the emergence of social health insurance in urban areas. Chapter 6 offers a summary, which basically argues that retrenchment in China’s health-care sector was shaped mainly by bureaucratic stakeholders.</p>
<p>The analytical framework developed by the book combines historical institutionalism and a state-centred approach. The decline of the Chinese state’s role in both budgetary financing of public providers and the protection of financial risks borne by the Chinese were shaped by ideological, ideational, and interest changes among bureaucratic actors, mainly government departments. Among many variables, the Chinese Party-state’s neoliberal shift in economic policy was a big driving factor. In contrast, societal actors were relatively less influential or even without influence.</p>
<p>This is absolutely true, not only in the health sector but also in almost all sectors in China. Yet to articulate this well is not sufficient. The book fails to integrate studies in market transition, health politics, and state transformation.</p>
<p>First, while drawing insights from retrenchment politics in Western welfare states, the author pays little attention to the fact that the transformation of China’s welfare state began at a very different starting point, that is, from a planned economy. Health-care services were organized by the government in a huge hierarchy, and all aspects of their operation including budgeting were subject to the control of government planning. Health-care professionals were either state employees or members of collectivist communes, and health-care services were delivered at extremely low price levels by the government.</p>
<p>Inherent in the logic of the market transition which took place was the unleashing of market forces, and inevitably the state’s role (including its financial role) in socioeconomic life declined. Moving out of the ‘command-and-control system’ is an integral part of market transition. In this sense, the political logic of state retreat in transition countries is quite different from that in Western welfare states. Although the author makes reference to publications on transition countries, the relevance of the historical context to retrenchment politics in China is underestimated.</p>
<p>Second, the book has overlooked findings in comparative health politics, in particular those related to public hospital reforms. In many countries, the health-care service system had long been dominated by public hospitals under a command-and-control system. Since the 1980s, however, public hospital reforms have become a global trend. Many public hospitals have been transformed from government budgetary units into autonomous, corporatized, or even privatized entities. As such, the state’s role – in particular its role in financing or compensating operational costs of public hospitals – has declined.</p>
<p>‘Autonomization’ (a term used by some World Bank scholars) of public providers also took place in China. This has increased their own scope of generating and retaining revenue. At first glance, autonomization has resulted in state retreat, and public hospitals in China operate like private providers. Yet, as many Chinese scholars (including this reviewer) argue, the autonomization of public hospitals in China has not led to genuine marketization, let alone privatization. Rather, it can be characterized as ‘bureaucratic marketization’. State retreat has occurred to some extent in the fiscal relationship between the government and public providers, but not in many other aspects.</p>
<p>Third, successful market transition has to be accompanied by a restructuring of the social protection system as well as state–market–society relations. In this sense, to return to the command-and-control system is not an option, and state retreat, to some extent, is an inevitable choice. The decline of direct government subsidies to public providers and the establishment of a universal social health insurance system have been major forces in China’s new health care reforms. Among the responsible factors were the state’s retreat from urban risk protection and the emergence of social health-insurance schemes targeting urban employees before 2000. Basically, the multifaceted implications of this aspect of state transformation have been ignored by the book.</p>
<p>Besides lacking in sophisticated analysis, the book is not empirically grounded. Despite the abundance and availability of statistical data on health and social health insurance, the book fails to engage and utilize such data. Reference should be made to methodologically and empirically sound academic research published in Chinese; the lack of such an engagement would lead to a compromise in the quality of research on contemporary China.</p>
