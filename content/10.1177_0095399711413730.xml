<abstract>
<p>The previous research on goal ambiguity has suggested some methodological issues, such as the lack of a clear concept of program goal ambiguity, the use of single-dimension goal ambiguity, the exclusive dependence on perceptual data, and the lack of large-sample empirical studies. Recognizing these issues and identifying goal components or contents (target, time limit, and external evaluation) of goal-setting theory and of the program goal system in the Program Assessment Rating Tool (PART) of the U.S. federal government, this study conceptualizes program goal ambiguity and its three subdimensions: target-specification goal ambiguity, time-specification goal ambiguity, and program evaluation goal ambiguity. In addition, this study develops the objective measures of the three new dimensions of program goal ambiguity and then provides the empirical evidence of the validity, including the convergent or concurrent and discriminant validity, and reliability of the three new measures. The intention of this study is to develop a means to empirically demonstrate goal ambiguity in the U.S. federal programs and, furthermore, build a foundation for the future research related to program goal ambiguity in public administration. To this purpose, the current research focuses on the U.S. federal programs, using a sample consisting of 767 programs.</p>

<p>Regarding goals in public management and public policy, we can encounter the well-established assertion that the public sector has more ambiguous goals than does the private sector, and thus, the public sector has difficulties in evaluating goal achievements or performance (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0095399711413730">Allison, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0095399711413730">Dahl &amp; Lindblom, 1953</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0095399711413730">Downs, 1967</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0095399711413730">Drucker, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0095399711413730">Heinrich, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0095399711413730">Lowi, 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0095399711413730">Lynn, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0095399711413730">Matland, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0095399711413730">Ripley &amp; Franklin, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-0095399711413730">Wildavsky, 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-0095399711413730">Wilson, 1989</xref>). Goal ambiguity theorists have related this goal characteristic of public organizations to other important organizational characteristics such as red tape, motivation, organizational control, and performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0095399711413730">Chun &amp; Rainey, 2005a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0095399711413730">Rainey, 2010</xref>). Furthermore, goal ambiguity theory in public administration has played a role as a background theory for the reforms of the U.S. government in recent history, such as Management by Objectives (MBO) in the 1970s, the Government Performance and Results Act (GPRA) in the 1990s, and the Program Assessment Rating Tool (PART) in the 2000s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0095399711413730">Chun &amp; Rainey, 2005b</xref>).</p>
<p>The ambiguity of policy (program) goals is an inevitable result of political relationships and process in policy implementation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0095399711413730">Baier, March, &amp; Saetren, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0095399711413730">Behn, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0095399711413730">Berman, 1978</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0095399711413730">1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0095399711413730">Matland, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-0095399711413730">Wilson, 1980</xref>). One of the top-down policy implementation suggestions is clarification and consistency of policy goals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0095399711413730">Mazmanian &amp; Sabatier, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-0095399711413730">Van Meter &amp; Van Horn, 1975</xref>). It is difficult, however, to make policy goals explicit, clear, and consistent in the policy process. The reason is that the top-downers’ desire and call to make policy goals less ambiguous conflict with the conditions in which legislation is passed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0095399711413730">Matland, 1995</xref>). Specifically, policy administrators tend to avoid specificity and clarity of policy goals, as they must consider multiple interests and pressures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0095399711413730">Chun &amp; Rainey, 2005b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0095399711413730">Lindblom, 1959</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0095399711413730">Lowi, 1979</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0095399711413730">1</xref></sup> Because of goal ambiguity, there can be room to interpret the same goal and directive in different ways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0095399711413730">Matland, 1995</xref>). Thus, policy goal ambiguity can be negatively associated with conflicts among multiple actors in the process of policy. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0095399711413730">Regan (1984)</xref> showed this relationship between program goal ambiguity and conflict in her study on personal information policies in the United States and Britain. She pointed out a dilemma of policy implementation. The dilemma is that clearer and more explicit policy goals lead to higher threats to the turf of multiple actors, more conflicts among the actors, and more limited range of policy changes. In addition, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-0095399711413730">Wilson (1989)</xref> pointed out that policy goal ambiguity contributes to maintaining bureaucratic power.</p>
<p>Some policy scholars have argued that goal ambiguity is a critical antecedent that directly influences program performance or success (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0095399711413730">Matland, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0095399711413730">Ripley &amp; Franklin, 1982</xref>). The reason is that “goal ambiguity is seen as leading to misunderstanding and uncertainty and therefore often is culpable in implementation failure” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0095399711413730">Matland, 1995</xref>, pp. 158-159). According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0095399711413730">Ripley and Franklin (1982)</xref>, program implementation processes are surrounded by the following five features, as illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0095399711413730">Figure 1</xref>:<disp-quote>
<p>Implementation processes involve many important actors holding diffuse and competing goals and expectations who work within a context of an increasingly large and complex mix of government programs that require participation from numerous layers and units of government and who are affected by powerful factors beyond their control.

<p>These five political characteristics of the implementation processes, including ambiguous goals, could influence the success or failure of the program.</p>
<p>Despite the empirical efforts of some scholars and its academic and practical importance in the public sector, empirical goal ambiguity theory has not yet been well established (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0095399711413730">Chun &amp; Rainey, 2005b</xref>). What are the reasons? First, this study pursues the answers for this question through examining some methodological issues of the previous research on goal ambiguity. Based on the methodological issues and the goal components or contents (target, time limit, and external evaluation) of goal-setting theory and of the program goal system in the PART provided by the U.S. Office of Management and Budget (OMB), this study conceptualizes program goal ambiguity and its three dimensions: target-specification goal ambiguity, time-specification goal ambiguity, and program evaluation goal ambiguity. Next, this study develops the objective measures of the three dimensions of program goal ambiguity and then examines the validity, including the convergent or concurrent and discriminant validity, and reliability of the new program goal ambiguity measures. The intention of this study is to develop a means to empirically demonstrate goal ambiguity in the U.S. federal programs and, furthermore, build a foundation for the development of goal ambiguity theory and the future research by filling the void in large-sample empirical research developing objective measures of goal ambiguity. To this purpose, the current research focuses on the U.S. federal programs in the PART, using a large sample consisting of 767 programs.</p>

<title>Methodological Issues</title>
<p>This study is based on <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0095399711413730">Goggin, Bowman, Lester, and O’Toole’s (1990)</xref> arguments related to the development of policy implementation research. For a more vigorous testing or refinement of the research, they offered recommendations, such as clarifying key concepts, looking at a larger sample, and proposing measures for future testing and hypotheses. Despite the empirical efforts of the previous studies and their important findings such as the positive influence of organizational goal ambiguity on role ambiguity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0095399711413730">Pandey &amp; Wright, 2006</xref>) and public managers’ greater perception of emphasis on rules, channels, and procedures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0095399711413730">Lan &amp; Rainey, 1992</xref>), the previous goal ambiguity research has suggested methodological issues for the development of empirical goal ambiguity theory, based on the recommendations of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0095399711413730">Goggin et al. (1990)</xref>. First, prior to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0095399711413730">Chun and Rainey’s (2005b)</xref> research on organizational goal ambiguity, scholars in public administration and public policy had not tried to clearly conceptualize goal ambiguity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0095399711413730">Rainey &amp; Bozeman, 2000</xref>). Without clarifying the concept, it is difficult to develop its subdimension measures for the development of empirical goal ambiguity theory. At the public program level, the concept “program goal ambiguity” needs to be clarified. The second issue is that most of the previous empirical studies have taken a single-dimensional approach to goal ambiguity by depending on perceptual data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0095399711413730">Bozeman, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0095399711413730">Perry &amp; Porter, 1982</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0095399711413730">2</xref></sup> One explanation offered by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0095399711413730">Rainey and Bozeman (2000)</xref> was that “maybe the questionnaire items asking for simple, direct responses about the clarity and measurability of organizational goals are too simple to assess this dimension” (p. 452). Furthermore, as goal is a multidimensional construct (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0095399711413730">Bandura, 1989</xref>), goal ambiguity as one of the goal contents is also a multidimensional construct (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0095399711413730">Chun &amp; Rainey, 2005b</xref>). As described in the following paragraphs, public program goals have multiple dimensions such as target, time limit, and evaluation. Thus, scholars need to develop more refined multiple subjective (question items) or objective measures to reflect the reality of program goal systems better. The newly developed measures need validity and reliability tests. Regarding goal ambiguity, “The literature is virtually devoid of cases in which existing generalizations have been used, prospectively and prescriptively, to develop an implementation plan” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0095399711413730">Kelman, 1984</xref>, p. 77). Case studies or small-sample studies have low external validity and are not replicable for different situations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0095399711413730">Goggin, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0095399711413730">Goggin et al., 1990</xref>). Against these backgrounds, this study examines almost all the federal programs included in the 2006 PART data (<italic>n</italic> = 767).</p>

<title>Goal-Setting Theory and Definition of Program Goal Ambiguity</title>
<p>The development of program goal ambiguity in this study is based on goal-setting theory. The underlying premise of the theory is that one’s goals influence what one accomplishes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0095399711413730">Latham &amp; Locke, 1991</xref>). A goal is the aim of an action to attain a target within a specified time limit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0095399711413730">Latham, 2004</xref>, p. 126). For the definition of a goal, a target and a time limit are important components. In addition, external evaluation can be an integral part of any goal or job (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0095399711413730">Shalley, 1995</xref>). The reason is that external evaluation can increase external interactions and distractions and decrease employees’ work motivation and performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0095399711413730">Oldham &amp; Brass, 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0095399711413730">Shalley, 1995</xref>). Therefore, based on goal-setting theory, this study focuses on three goal components or contents, which specify what is supposed to be achieved: target (specificity), time limit (proximity), and external evaluation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0095399711413730">Bandura, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0095399711413730">Lee, Locke, &amp; Latham, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0095399711413730">Shalley, 1995</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0095399711413730">3</xref></sup> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0095399711413730">Bandura (1989)</xref> argued that goals do not automatically facilitate motivation or performance. Different properties of goal structures can affect employees’ motivation and their job or organizational performance differently.</p>
<p>Based on goal-setting theory, first, this research defines <italic>program goal ambiguity</italic> as the extent to which a set of goals of the federal programs allows lack of clarity in deciding work related to target, time limit, and external evaluation. Program or policy can be defined as “the governmental activities formulated in response to an authoritative decision” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0095399711413730">Matland, 1995</xref>, p. 154). In addition, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0095399711413730">Latham (2004)</xref> defined goals as the aims of actions to attain targets within a specified time limit. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0095399711413730">Feldman (1989)</xref>, ambiguity means “the state of having many ways of thinking about the same circumstances or phenomena” (p. 5). She also argued that a decision with lack of clarity is related to a process of interpretation, the process that gives meaning. Furthermore, similar to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0095399711413730">Cyert and March’s (1963)</xref> argument that all organizations tend to have multiple goals, most programs in the federal agencies also have various goals, as can be seen in the PART data. Therefore, when program goals allow lack of clarity in decision making and invite room for different interpretations, they are regarded as ambiguous (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0095399711413730">Chun &amp; Rainey, 2005b</xref>). Goal ambiguity theory in public administration suggests that ambiguous goals in the public sector can make it difficult to motivate public employees and evaluate performance. Yet scholarship does not bear this out (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0095399711413730">Huber &amp; Shipan, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0095399711413730">Radin, 2006</xref>). In some cases, ambiguity appears to leave substantial discretion to bureaucrats and may actually enhance program performance—particularly when it comes to complex programs.</p>
<p>This study tries to apply goal-setting theory and the three goal components or contents to the goal systems of the PART in the U.S. federal government. It defines program goal ambiguity and develops three concepts of program goal ambiguity by employing three properties of program goals—target specificity, time specificity, and the possibility of external evaluation. Therefore, the criteria for goal ambiguity need to be discussed. This analysis does not take into account the potential different criteria, including public employees’ perception of their program goals. Employees’ perception, which can be influenced by their education or administrative experience, can also be a significant criterion. The reason is that a program with minimal target ambiguity, minimal time ambiguity, and minimal program evaluation ambiguity would still produce ambiguity about the goals in practice, according to employees’ education and other experiences. The criteria for goal ambiguity here are the existence or objective percentages of goals, which do not show concrete targets, time limit, or the possibility of external evaluation. This study does not argue that goal ambiguity rests in the specification related to target, time limit, and external evaluation alone, that it rests in just the practice of interpretation, and that only quantifiable measures eliminate or reduce ambiguity. Rather, the primary purpose of this study is to develop and suggest just a means to empirically demonstrate goal ambiguity and its variation among the U.S. federal programs.</p>

<title>Development of New Program Goal Ambiguity Dimensions</title>
<p>Program goal ambiguity, which is developed from multiple goal properties, can have multiple dimensions. The next step in developing the subdimensions of program goal ambiguity would be identifying the goals in each federal program. In relation to goal-setting theory, one can see that there are three dimensions of performance goals in the PART data—target, time limit, and external evaluation. As the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0095399711413730">OMB (2006)</xref> asserted, “Because of the importance of performance measures, the OMB and agencies must agree on appropriate measures early to allow for review with relevant stakeholders, if needed” (p. 8). The OMB provided the guidance for completing the PART throughout the process for related public employees, such as the OMB program associate directors, agency budget performance integration leaders, and agency PART contacts. In terms of performance goals, this guidance for the completion of the PART shows basic concepts and categories of performance measures or goals (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0095399711413730">Table 1</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0095399711413730">4</xref></sup> This guidance is for all the U.S. federal programs and is related to goal-setting theory and its goal components or contents. Thus, this study tries to develop new concepts and measures of program goal ambiguity applicable to all the U.S. federal programs.</p>

<title>Developing the Concept and Measure of Target-Specification Goal Ambiguity</title>
<sec id="section5-0095399711413730">
<title>New concept</title>
<p>In this study, target-specification goal ambiguity refers to the lack of clarity in deciding on the quantity and/or quality of work toward the achievement of a program’s performance goals. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0095399711413730">Heinrich (2003)</xref> argued that public organizations’ choices for performance goals are critical for the complex job of deciding quantitative measures of performance goals because ambiguous objectives make it more challenging to specify precise and informative measures. Furthermore, some goal-setting theorists have posited that more specific goals lead to higher motivation and performance (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0095399711413730">Bandura, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0095399711413730">Lee et al., 1989</xref>). As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0095399711413730">Bandura (1989)</xref>, a goal-setting theorist, explained, “Explicit standards regulate performance by designating the type and amount of effort required to attain them by furnishing unambiguous signs of accomplishments” (p. 42). Some public management scholars have contended that explicit and specific performance measures are critical motivators and guides for public managers who facilitate major changes for the policies of their agencies (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0095399711413730">Heinrich, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0095399711413730">Khademian, 1995</xref>). Researchers analyzing the specification of goals use the concept of <italic>goal specificity</italic>, which refers to “the degree of quantitative precision required by the goal” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0095399711413730">Lee et al., 1989</xref>, p. 299). The concept <italic>goal specificity</italic> has been measured by respondents’ perception of the goal. Therefore, target-specification goal ambiguity needs to be newly developed as a more objective and comprehensive concept related to target-specification for individual public programs with multiple goals or objectives.</p>

<title>Identifying targets in the program goal system</title>
<p>According to the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0095399711413730">OMB (2006)</xref>, target refers to the “quantifiable or otherwise measureable characteristic that tells how well a program must accomplish a performance measure” (p. 81). In the PART, all the federal programs should provide performance goals or measures. In terms of targets, although some performance goals report concrete targets, others do not. For example, in the “Delta Regional Authority” program in the 2006 PART, the performance measures, such as “average time from receipt of full grant applications from States to disposition (explanation: number of days)” and “average unemployment rate in all eight states (explanation: increasing employability is a proxy for the self-sufficiency of the region),” report concrete targets of “30 (days)” and “5.6%,” respectively. However, some program performance goals do not report a concrete target or indicate “N/A.” Therefore, one can find variations of the percentage of performance goals reporting a concrete target among the federal programs with multiple performance goals in the PART, that is, the federal programs will vary in the degree to which they can clearly describe performance targets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0095399711413730">Chun, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0095399711413730">Gable, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0095399711413730">Smith, 1999</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-0095399711413730">
<title>New objective measure</title>
<p>Performance assessment systems, such as the PART, assume that performance goals of individual programs need to be specified quantitatively or qualitatively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0095399711413730">OMB, 2006</xref>). The PART also assumes that, with goals represented by concrete targets and actual achievements, individual programs can be appraised, and they should receive budget increases according to the degree of achievement of performance goals. Thus, they should include concrete targets. For some programs, the PART reports state targets for most of the goals. However, the PART reports for a number of programs provide no such information for some of their goals. This implies that officials representing those programs do not exert sufficient efforts to state quantitatively or qualitatively specific targets or cannot do so because of various difficulties. This concept of goal ambiguity reflects the presence of unclear targets for program goals. Therefore, it is measured by the percentage of performance objectives without concrete targets among the total number of performance objectives in individual federal programs.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0095399711413730">5</xref></sup></p>

<title>Developing the Concept and Measure of Time-Specification Goal Ambiguity</title>
<sec id="section9-0095399711413730">
<title>New concept</title>
<p>Time-specification goal ambiguity refers to the lack of clarity in deciding on the distinction between annual and long-term goals in each program. According to the report of the U.S. Government Accounting Office (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0095399711413730">GAO, 1997</xref>), executives in public agencies argued that it is quite difficult to predict the result levels for long-term goals and to translate the long-term goals into annual performance goals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0095399711413730">Heinrich, 2003</xref>). Thus, we can expect that there will be significant variations of time-specification goal ambiguity among the federal public programs.</p>
<p>In terms of time span, the absence of a clear hierarchy of objectives can lead to goal conflict in public programs with multiple objectives (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0095399711413730">Pandey &amp; Garnett, 2006</xref>). Goal ambiguity, lack of goal clarity, is characterized by the vagueness of hierarchy and conflict among goals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0095399711413730">Pandey &amp; Garnett, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0095399711413730">Rainey, 1993</xref>). According to goal-setting theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0095399711413730">Bandura, 1989</xref>), proximate goals, such as annual goals, are more helpful in activating self-influences than are distant goals, such as long-term goals; thus, the former heighten performance more than the latter. Yet distant goals, such as long-term goals, provide less effective incentives to facilitate current motivation and performance. However, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0095399711413730">Bandura (1989)</xref> argued that when long-range goals are employed as the comparative standards and where there is clarity about the progressive steps for the complete achievement, present achievements can mobilize intrinsic interest, and long-range goals can be helpful to increase motivation and performance. Based on goal-setting theory, we can expect that annual performance objectives will have effects different from long-term performance objectives on motivation and performance. Unlike annual performance objectives, long-term performance objectives need to offer progressive steps to attain final targets for higher performance in public program management. When long-term and annual goals are clearly distinct and show necessary progressive steps, public programs can have lower goal ambiguity and improved performance.</p>

<sec id="section10-0095399711413730">
<title>Identifying time limit in the program goal system</title>
<p>Time limit in performance goals refers to whether a program performance goal is long term or annual. The federal programs’ PART reports sometimes specify annual performance objectives and sometimes specify long-term performance objectives. Sometimes they state the same objectives as both annual and long term without any explanations and any progressive steps to attain final targets. This study refers to these performance objectives as duplicate objectives. Duplicate objectives do not simply imply duplication but include duplication related to the time limit for the achievement of the objectives. Therefore, the ambiguity results from the possibility of different interpretations of the time limit—annual or long term—for the same objectives. For example, in the “Border Patrol” program, the performance measure “border miles under operational control” is clearly stated as long term and the performance goal “apprehensions and seizures at checkpoints” as annual. However, some performance goals can be classified as duplicate because they are stated as both long term and annual without any reasonable explanations. They are ambiguous in that some employees can recognize them as annual, whereas others can perceive them as long term. Furthermore, public managers can claim that the goals are not achieved in 1 year because they interpret them as long term.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-0095399711413730">
<title>New objective measure</title>
<p>In terms of time limit, based on the above description, performance objectives in the PART can be classified into three categories: long term, annual, and duplicate. In this case, we can see the variations in the percentage of the duplicate goals, which can be recognized as ambiguous in terms of time limit, among the federal programs in the PART. Thus, the measure of time-specification goal ambiguity is calculated as the percentage of duplicate performance objectives among the total number of performance objectives in individual federal programs.</p>

<title>Developing the Concept and Measure of Program Evaluation Goal Ambiguity</title>
<sec id="section13-0095399711413730">
<title>New concept</title>
<p>For <italic>program evaluation goal ambiguity</italic>, this study follows <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0095399711413730">Chun and Rainey’s (2005b)</xref> definition of evaluative goal ambiguity, referring to the level of interpretive leeway that a program goal allows in evaluating the progress toward the achievement of the goal, although the measuring methods of the two empirical studies are different.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0095399711413730">6</xref></sup> The logic for the two kinds of evaluation goal ambiguity is the same for both federal agencies and federal programs. This concept is related to the possibility of external evaluation; that is, when a program uses more outcome-oriented performance measures, which have higher possibility of external evaluation than output-oriented performance measures, it can be recognized as having lower evaluative goal ambiguity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0095399711413730">Chun &amp; Rainey, 2005b</xref>). According to goal-setting theory, external evaluation can negatively influence employees’ work motivation and performance by facilitating external interactions and increasing distractions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0095399711413730">Oldham &amp; Brass, 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0095399711413730">Shalley, 1995</xref>). In addition, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0095399711413730">Grizzle (1982</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0095399711413730">2002</xref>) argued that program managers should transform program goals into performance indicators and targets for performance evaluation. From the standpoint of a rational model of decision making, identifying the goals on which comparing performance is to be based would be the first stage for the development of a performance measurement system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0095399711413730">Heinrich, 2007</xref>). Therefore, program goals can become performance yardsticks to make judgments of the program results. Some federal programs have more outcome-oriented indicators, whereas others have more output-oriented indicators. Some scholars (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0095399711413730">Bohte &amp; Meier, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0095399711413730">Chun &amp; Rainey, 2005b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0095399711413730">Grizzle, 2002</xref>) have argued that the lack of objective outcome performance measures might lead to avoiding results or outcome measures and using workload or output indicators.</p>

<sec id="section14-0095399711413730">
<title>Identifying evaluation in the program goal system</title>
<p>Regarding program performance evaluation, similar to organizations, the federal programs can vary in the degree to which they can use objective performance indicators in identifying the possibility of accomplishing the performance target (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0095399711413730">Chun, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0095399711413730">Gable, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0095399711413730">Smith, 1999</xref>). The PART includes four kinds of performance indicators, in relation to performance evaluation: outcome, output, outcome-oriented efficiency, and output-oriented efficiency measures. Outcomes refer to the events or conditions that are external to the program or activity and that are of direct importance to the intended beneficiaries and/or the public (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0095399711413730">OMB, 2006</xref>, p. 8). The OMB gives as an example the goal of a job training program, which provides people with training in skills necessary to get a job. One outcome measure is the number and percentage of people getting a job within 1 year after finishing the job training program. Another outcome measure is the increase in their income after training. In addition, outputs refer to the <italic>internal</italic> activities of a program, such as the products or services delivered (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0095399711413730">OMB, 2006</xref>, p. 8). In the case of the job training program, an output measure indicates how many people complete the job training program. However, “efficiency measures capture skillfulness in executing programs, implementing activities, and achieving results, while avoiding wasted resources, effort, time, and/or money”(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0095399711413730">OMB, 2006</xref>, p. 9). The amount of money spent for achieving a unit of output represents one type of efficiency indicator, an output-oriented efficiency measure, which refers to a measure that captures improvements in a program output for a given level of resource use (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0095399711413730">OMB, 2006</xref>, p. 10). Yet the OMB also designates outcome-oriented efficiency measures. For example, the “Space and Flight Support” program in NASA states outcome-oriented efficiency measures. The program indicates the performance measure, “ratio of reduction in long-term environmental liability to amount spent on cleanup,” as an outcome efficiency measure, which is defined as a measure that captures improvements in a program outcome for a given level of resource use (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0095399711413730">OMB, 2006</xref>, p. 9).</p>

<sec id="section15-0095399711413730">
<title>New objective measure</title>
<p>As explained earlier, this concept of program goal ambiguity is associated with external evaluation of performance goals. The more output-oriented performance goals, instead of outcome-oriented ones with higher possibility of external evaluation, the higher the evaluative goal ambiguity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0095399711413730">Chun &amp; Rainey, 2005b</xref>). Based on this logic and the four categories of performance indicators, program evaluation goal ambiguity is measured by the percentage of output and output-oriented efficiency measures (opposed to outcome and outcome-oriented efficiency measures) among all performance indicators for each federal program.</p>

<title>PART as the Data Source</title>
<p>The PART refers to the Program Assessment Rating Tool provided by the U.S. OMB for assessing the performance of the federal programs. The 767 federal programs investigated in this study represent a variety of the U.S. federal programs that are different from each other in various ways; that is, they represent an array of goals and functions. The <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0095399711413730">OMB (2006)</xref> argued that the PART data illustrated efforts to assess and improve the U.S. federal program performance to achieve better results. To that end, the OMB requested the federal agencies to submit goals, performance measures, and program improvement plans for their federal programs. Therefore, the PART data provided the necessary information this study analyzes for program goal ambiguity.</p>
<p>Scholars have raised conflicting arguments about the validity of the PART data. The OMB Watch, a nonprofit organization that monitored the PART process, pointed out that it was difficult to determine whether the PART measured the right types of outcomes and whether it measured the federal programs accurately and in a value-neutral way (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0095399711413730">Radin, 2006</xref>). In addition, the PART has some problems, such as variation in the OMB examiners’ expertise, insufficient or inconsistent program definition across the federal programs, and evidence of unequal standards for highly or lowly graded programs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0095399711413730">Lewis, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>However, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0095399711413730">Lewis (2008)</xref> asserted that because the PART system attempted to consider variations in the environment of program management, “we have performance data on a sample of programs and managers that is large enough and representative enough to make statistically reliable claims” (p. 42) about performance goals and performance scores of the U.S. federal programs. The reason is that it was with a degree of outside involvement and transparency unusual for the OMB that the PART was developed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0095399711413730">Frederickson &amp; Frederickson, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0095399711413730">Moynihan, 2008</xref>). Specifically, some independent groups, including the Performance Measurement Advisory Council and a group from the President’s Council on Integrity and Efficiency, brought in experts on performance management to review and comment on the questionnaire of the PART (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0095399711413730">Moynihan, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0095399711413730">OMB, 2004</xref>). Then the National Academy of Public Administration arranged a workshop to obtain feedback (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0095399711413730">Moynihan, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0095399711413730">OMB, 2004</xref>). After these processes, the PART was published and the OMB solicited comments from researchers, agencies, and others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0095399711413730">Moynihan, 2008</xref>). Based on these processes, some scholars recognized that the PART is systematic, evidence based, and transparent (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0095399711413730">Frederickson &amp; Frederickson, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0095399711413730">Lewis, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0095399711413730">Moynihan, 2008</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0095399711413730">Moynihan (2008)</xref> pointed out that “the OMB has worked to ensure consistency, designing standardized questions, training raters, providing a ninety-two-page guide, and even forming a team to conduct a consistency check on 10 percent of the assessments” (p. 127).</p>
<p>Therefore, the criticisms do not diminish the usefulness of the PART system in measuring and evaluating comparative program goal ambiguity. The use of the PART data affords several advantages that help to alleviate methodological complications that have often hindered the previous studies on goals. The first advantage is the standardization of terms, which addresses a frequent problem in gathering organizational data from archival sources (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0095399711413730">Chun &amp; Rainey, 2005b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-0095399711413730">Van de Ven &amp; Ferry, 1980</xref>). All the federal programs prepared the data for the PART under the same guidelines offered by the OMB. In addition, the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0095399711413730">OMB (2006)</xref> made it clear that federal programs should describe their goals based on statutory mandates. This links goal statements more directly to statutes than in cases where researchers have had to rely on goals identified indirectly from formal mandates (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0095399711413730">Meyers, Riccucci, &amp; Lurie, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0095399711413730">Perry, Thomson, Tschirhart, Mesch, &amp; Lee, 1999</xref>).

<title>Validity<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-0095399711413730">8</xref></sup> and Reliability of New Program Goal Ambiguity Measures</title>
<p>The three new measures need evidence of validity and reliability, as they are newly developed and have not been used (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0095399711413730">Campbell &amp; Fiske, 1959</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0095399711413730">Campbell and Fiske (1959)</xref> provided two components for the establishment of construct validity: convergent and discriminant validity. Convergent validity refers to “the degree to which multiple attempts to measure the same concept are in agreement” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0095399711413730">Bagozzi, Yi, &amp; Phillips, 1991</xref>, p. 425). The basic idea is that if two or more measures of the same concept are valid, they should be statistically and significantly correlated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0095399711413730">Bagozzi et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0095399711413730">Campbell &amp; Fiske, 1959</xref>). Discriminant validity is defined as “the degree to which measures of different concepts are distinct” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0095399711413730">Bagozzi et al., 1991</xref>, p. 425). The fundamental logic is that if two or more dimensions or concepts are distinct, there should not be a high correlation between the valid measures of each one (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0095399711413730">Bagozzi et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0095399711413730">Campbell &amp; Fiske, 1959</xref>). Another is concurrent validity which refers to “the similarity between the target measure and another measure for which validity is known” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0095399711413730">Feldman, Haley, &amp; Coryell, 1990</xref>, p. 603). Next, reliability is “the agreement between two efforts to measure the same trait through maximally similar methods” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0095399711413730">Campbell &amp; Fiske, 1959</xref>, p. 83).</p>
<p>This study is not without its limitations. These limitations are related to the tests of convergent and concurrent validity for the three new goal ambiguity measures. The analysis units of this study on program goal ambiguity are the federal programs. However, the validity test is demonstrated at the agency level, as the data for the alternative measures of the new goal ambiguity measures are not available for the federal programs; that is, the validity tests are conducted on the program goal ambiguity level of the federal agencies (calculated as the percentage of ambiguous program performance goals among the total ones in each federal agency) and not on the program goal ambiguity level of the federal programs themselves. Yet assessing the convergent and concurrent validity at the agency level instead of the program level can be a meaningful and acceptable method to establish the validity of the new measures because program performance goals are most of the federal agencies’ performance goals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0095399711413730">OMB, 2006</xref>).</p>

<title>Convergent and Concurrent Validity of Program Target-Specification Goal Ambiguity Measure</title>
<p>For assessing the convergent and concurrent validity of the target-specification goal ambiguity measure, this study uses two alternative measures. The first alternative measure is the “transparency” score, one of the three types of performance scores for the U.S. federal agencies reported on the 9th Annual Performance Report Scorecard provided by the Mercatus Center at George Mason University in 2007 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0095399711413730">Chun, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0095399711413730">Mercatus Center, 2007</xref>). This scorecard assesses the information quality of performance reports by the 24 U.S. federal agencies<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-0095399711413730">9</xref></sup> covered under the Chief Financial Officer Act, in terms of three dimensions: transparency, public benefits, and leadership (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0095399711413730">Mercatus Center, 2007</xref>). The “transparency” dimension, which is rated on a 20-point scale, consists of four evaluation criteria about performance measures or data: accessibility, readability and understandability, reliability and verifiability, and provision of performance measures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0095399711413730">Chun, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0095399711413730">Mercatus Center, 2007</xref>). This study assumes that the “transparency” score of the performance report would have a significant and negative correlation with target-specification goal ambiguity, which means the degree to ambiguously express targets of program performance measures. To test the convergent validity of the target-specification goal ambiguity measure, this research measures target-specification goal ambiguity again for the 24 federal agencies included in the scorecard by calculating the percentage of performance goals without concrete targets among the total performance goals in all the programs that each federal agency includes. Then, this study conducts a correlation analysis between this target-specification goal ambiguity measure and the “transparency” score in the performance scorecard. The correlation coefficient is −.35 and is significant at the .05 level. Showing that the transparency score of the performance report would change in the opposite direction of target-specification goal ambiguity, this result provides the evidence of the convergent validity of the target-specification goal ambiguity measure.</p>
<p>Next, this study also uses the percentage score of performance measures with reported results out of all the performance measures for 24 U.S. federal agencies on the 9th Annual Performance Report Scorecard of 2007 as an alternative measure for the concurrent validity of the target-specification goal ambiguity measure. Considering that it would be difficult for performance measures without concrete targets to report results, it is assumed that the percentage score would be negatively correlated with the target-specification goal ambiguity measure. For the 24 U.S. federal agencies, the correlation coefficient between the target-specification goal ambiguity measure and the percentage of measures with reported results is −.81 and is statistically significant at the .01 level. Therefore, the convergent and concurrent validity of the target-specification goal ambiguity measure is demonstrated through the statistically significant results of the two correlation analyses.</p>

<title>Concurrent Validity of Program Time-Specification Goal Ambiguity Measure</title>
<p>To demonstrate the concurrent validity of the time-specification goal ambiguity measure, the alternative measure is the number of suborganization units that directly report to the top leader in 25 federal agencies randomly selected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0095399711413730">Chun, 2003</xref>). This study collects the data from the organizational charts that the federal agencies post on their websites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0095399711413730">Chun, 2003</xref>). Although this measure may not be an exact measurement for time-specification goal ambiguity, it can be closely related for several reasons: For each federal agency, different subagency units directly reporting to the top leader of the agency should represent different priorities in terms of time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0095399711413730">Chun, 2003</xref>); the time-specification goal ambiguity measure is about the degree of ambiguity in expressing the priorities of performance goals in terms of time limit, as shown in its definition; the more subagency units, as a proxy variable of organizational size, the more conflicts or the higher complexity of goals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0095399711413730">Bandura, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0095399711413730">Senge, 1990</xref>). Therefore, this study expects that the alternative indicator will be positively correlated with the time-specification goal ambiguity measure because more subagency units will represent more diverse goals and thus will increase time-specification goal ambiguity. To assess the concurrent validity, time-specification goal ambiguity is measured again for the 25 federal agencies randomly selected by calculating the percentage of duplicate performance objectives among the total number of performance objectives in all the programs that each federal agency includes. The correlation coefficient between the number of subagency units and the time-specification goal ambiguity measure is .37 and is statistically significant at the .05 level. This means that the more subagency units in the federal agencies, the higher the time-specification goal ambiguity of the agencies. The result provides support for the concurrent validity of the time-specification goal ambiguity measure.</p>

<title>Convergent Validity of Program Evaluation Goal Ambiguity Measure</title>
<p>To provide evidence for the convergent validity of the program evaluation goal ambiguity measure, this study uses as the alternative measure the “public benefits” score, one of the three types of performance scores for the U.S. federal agencies reported on the 9th Annual Performance Report Scorecard provided by the Mercatus Center at George Mason University in 2007 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0095399711413730">Chun, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0095399711413730">Mercatus Center, 2007</xref>). The “public benefits” dimension, which is rated on a 20-point scale, consists of four evaluation criteria about performance measures or data: outcome-oriented goals, outcome measures, agency-affected outcomes, and linkage to costs related to public benefits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0095399711413730">Mercatus Center, 2007</xref>). This study assumes that the “public benefits” score of the performance report will have a significant and negative correlation with program evaluation goal ambiguity, which means the degree to which a program or an agency uses more output-oriented goals than outcome-oriented goals. To test the convergent validity of the program evaluation goal ambiguity measure, this research measures program evaluation goal ambiguity again for the 24 federal agencies on the scorecard by calculating the percentage of output-oriented performance measures among the total performance indicators in all the programs that each federal agency includes. This study also conducts a correlation analysis between this program evaluation goal ambiguity measure and the “public benefits” score on the performance scorecard. The correlation coefficient is −.37 and is significant at the .05 level. As expected, this result demonstrates the convergent validity of the program evaluation goal ambiguity measure, showing that program evaluation goal ambiguity is negatively correlated with the “public benefits” score of performance report.</p>
<p>To sum up, for the three new measures of program goal ambiguity, this study demonstrates their convergent or concurrent validity by conducting correlation analyses using relevant alternative measures. Next, the other validity test for construct validity is conducted through a correlation analysis among the three new measures of program goal ambiguity.</p>

<p>As one of the two types of validity for establishing construct validity for newly developed measures, discriminant validity means “the degree to which measures of different concepts are distinct” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0095399711413730">Bagozzi et al., 1991</xref>, p. 425). If two or more dimensions of one concept are distinct, the valid measures of each dimension should not be highly correlated with each other (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0095399711413730">Bagozzi et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0095399711413730">Campbell &amp; Fiske, 1959</xref>).</p>
<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0095399711413730">Table 3</xref> provides zero-order correlations among the three newly developed measures of program goal ambiguity. The discriminant validity, or the multidimensionality, of program goal ambiguity is supported by the weak correlations among the program goal ambiguity dimensions. The target-specification goal ambiguity measure does not have a statistically significant correlation with both the time-specification goal ambiguity measure and the program evaluation goal ambiguity measure. This result indicates that target-specification goal ambiguity is distinct from the other two dimensions. The program evaluation goal ambiguity measure is negatively correlated with just the time-specification goal ambiguity measure (<italic>r</italic> = −.1128, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05). However, the correlation is weak. Thus, these results show that the three new measures are distinct dimensions of program goal ambiguity; that is, this study achieves the discriminant validity of the three new measures of program goal ambiguity through the correlation analysis.</p>

<title>Reliability of the Three New Dimensions of Program Goal Ambiguity</title>
<p>Critical for newly developed measures, “reliability is the agreement between two efforts to measure the same trait through maximally similar methods” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0095399711413730">Campbell &amp; Fiske, 1959</xref>, p. 83). For assessing the reliability, the internal consistency, of the three newly developed measures of program goal ambiguity, this study uses the interrater reliability method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0095399711413730">Hoskisson, Hitt, Johnson, &amp; Moesel, 1993</xref>).

To demonstrate the reliability of the three new measures of program goal ambiguity, a doctoral student<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-0095399711413730">10</xref></sup> specializing in public management independently coded the performance measures or goals composing the three new dimensions of program goal ambiguity for 30 federal programs randomly selected. Then, this study conducts correlation analyses between the two raters’ coded scores for the three new measures. The correlation coefficients are .97 for the target-specification goal ambiguity measure, 1.00 for the time-specification goal ambiguity measure, and 1.00 for the program evaluation goal ambiguity measure. All the coefficients are statistically significant at the .001 level. These correlation results show that the reliability of the three new measures of program goal ambiguity is achieved.</p>

<title>Discussion and Conclusion</title>
<p>This study presents the multidimensional conceptualizations and the objective measures of program goal ambiguity for a large sample, 767 U.S. federal programs. Based on the goal components or contents (target, time limit, and external evaluation) of goal-setting theory and of the goal system in the PART, the new three dimensions of program goal ambiguity are target-specification goal ambiguity, time-specification goal ambiguity, and program-evaluation goal ambiguity. The purpose of this study is to develop a means to demonstrate program goal ambiguity in the U.S. federal government and, furthermore, build a foundation for the development of empirical goal ambiguity theory, the future empirical research on program goal ambiguity, and theoretical assertions related to goal ambiguity by overcoming the conceptual and methodological limitations (e.g., the lack of efforts to clarify the concept of program goal ambiguity, unidimensional approach to this goal characteristic, exclusive dependence on perceptual survey data, and the lack of large-sample empirical research) of the previous empirical research on goal ambiguity, recognizing the important theoretical and practical implications of goal ambiguity.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the results of this study provide the empirical evidence of the convergent or concurrent validity, the discriminant validity (or multidimensionality), and the reliability for the three new program goal ambiguity measures. This empirical evidence from a large sample raises the need for goal ambiguity research approaches that use multidimensional concepts of program goal ambiguity. A review of the previous research on goal ambiguity in public administration suggests that much of the literature is divorced from empirical findings. In light of the findings reported here and the modestly accumulated findings on goal ambiguity, we can now say that we are moving closer toward the unification of the literature, including the theoretical argument, and empirical findings as well as toward the development of goal ambiguity theory by providing multiple objective measures of goal ambiguity, based on the analysis on a large sample; that is, this study can be a foundation for more refined methodology for goal ambiguity research. The trend of the previous research on goal ambiguity was to use single dimensionality of goal ambiguity and to suggest hypotheses about the relationships between goal ambiguity and certain antecedent variables (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0095399711413730">Chun, 2003</xref>). Future research needs to take into account that the subdimensions of program goal ambiguity can be differently related to different antecedents and different consequential variables, such as performance, motivation, and job attitudes. In addition, the possibility of developing different dimensions of goal ambiguity should always be considered. For example, the number of performance objectives without concrete targets, in addition to the percentage of them, can be considered another measure for target-specification goal ambiguity.</p>
<p>Such research using the subdimensions of program goal ambiguity discussed in this study can provide a foundation for strengthening the validity for the new measures and refining empirical goal ambiguity theory. Some of the theoretical presuppositions about goal ambiguity (e.g., a negative influence of goal ambiguity on public service motivation or public employees’ work motivation) are far lacking in any empirical support (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0095399711413730">Perry, 2000</xref>). Thus, if the empirical studies offer results supporting theoretical assertions and hypotheses about goal ambiguity, the results can be evidence supporting scholars’ arguments that the inconsistency between theory and evidence in goal ambiguity occurred due to the lack of conceptualization of goal ambiguity and dependence on survey data (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0095399711413730">Bozeman, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0095399711413730">Chun, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0095399711413730">Perry &amp; Porter, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0095399711413730">Rainey &amp; Bozeman, 2000</xref>). Furthermore, the multidimensionality of program goal ambiguity will have practical implications. If the clarification of program goals is required for improving the accountability and performance in public programs or public organizations, understanding the multidimensionality of program goal ambiguity can be the basis of developing effective strategies for clarifying program goals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0095399711413730">Chun, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0095399711413730">Chun &amp; Rainey, 2005b</xref>).</p>

<p>Here may be a little confusion between ambiguity and generality or inclusiveness. There may seem to be a modest difference between the two concepts. Policy generality or inclusiveness “refers to the belief that public participation in policy decisions should be maximized” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0095399711413730">Lubell, 2004</xref>, p. 347).” Therefore, often the politically motivated and even rational response is policy or program generality and inclusiveness. This is not the same thing as deliberately muddying up the water by providing goals with multiple meanings (the lexical definition of ambiguity).</p>

<p>Dependence on survey data led to anomalous results. Unlike one of the important propositions of goal ambiguity theory that public organizations have greater goal ambiguity than private companies, many scholars did not find empirically any significant difference in the goal ambiguity level between the public sector and private companies by using survey data (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0095399711413730">Bozeman &amp; Kingsley, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0095399711413730">Lan &amp; Rainey, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0095399711413730">Rainey, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0095399711413730">Rainey &amp; Bozeman, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0095399711413730">Rainey, Pandey, &amp; Bozeman, 1995</xref>).</p>

<p>According to the definition of goals in goal-setting theory, there are two fundamental attributes—content and intensity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0095399711413730">Lee et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0095399711413730">Locke &amp; Latham, 2002</xref>). Goal intensity refers to “the process of setting the goal or of determining how to reach it” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0095399711413730">Lee et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0095399711413730">Locke, Shaw, Saari, &amp; Latham, 1981</xref>, p. 127). This attribute would be measured by factors, such as the importance of the goal and the degree of effort required. Goal intensity may have a relationship with goal content. For example, the process needed to set and attain complex goals requires a more intense psychological effort than the process needed to set and achieve simple goals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0095399711413730">Lee et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0095399711413730">Locke et al., 1981</xref>).</p>

<p>One can find this fact from goals or plans of the federal programs in the PART and that federal programs focus on target, time frame, and evaluation of their goals.

<p>Following a reviewer’s suggestion that maybe there are threshold effects reflected in numbers of performance objectives without concrete targets rather than percentages, this study also considered the number of them as another specification goal ambiguity measure. Both specifications were tested. A correlation analysis showed that the percentages were more distinct with the time-specification goal ambiguity measure and the program evaluation goal ambiguity measure than the numbers. Next, the current research related both specifications to program size. The results suggested that the percentages had a stronger relationship with program budget size than the numbers. Therefore, the percentages, instead of the numbers, were considered a target-specification goal ambiguity measure in this article. This does not deny that the numbers can be a measure for target-specification goal ambiguity.</p>
