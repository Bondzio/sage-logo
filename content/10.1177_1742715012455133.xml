<p>The notion of leadership – servant-leadership – is taking the world by storm. For a long time, how to carry the masses along in leadership and politics has been a dominant issue in different fields: leadership studies, management, politics, academia, human relations and public service. Leadership is one of the greatest challenges facing humanity. In the present era, ‘everybody agrees that there is less of it (leadership) than there used to be’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1742715012455133">Bennis and Nanus, 2007</xref>: 1). Nevertheless, there is no place that the quest for a better leadership paradigm is more needed than in Africa, where images of leaders invoke terror, brutality, oppression, and evil, as well as master–servant relations with respect to leadership. The former president of the World Peace Foundation, Robert I. Rotberg, in his stimulating piece ‘The roots of Africa’s leadership deficit’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1742715012455133">Rotberg, 2003</xref>) sees leadership as thus in Africa thus: ‘leadership in Africa is typified more by disfiguring examples – the Idi Amins and Robert Mugabes – than by positive role models such as Nelson Mandela and Seretse Khama’ (2003: 28). The Nigerian political economist Claude Ake summed up the issue of leadership in Africa as the privatization of the public sphere and power personalization as well as pandering to the allure of zero-sum game in political leadership and public service. Similarly, in his foreword to Richard Dowden’s recent book on Africa, <italic>Altered States, Ordinary Miracles</italic> (2009), the Nigerian novelist Chinua Achebe speaks of Africa’s failed, anti-people leadership style as the reason for her ‘tormented history’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1742715012455133">Achebe, 2009</xref>: xv).</p>
<p>Rather than use the instrument of leadership to torment the people, like most African leaders do, in <italic>Conversations with Myself</italic>, Nelson Mandela challenges African leaders to envision leadership as service to humanity, as well as an experience that ought to bring collective dividends and development to the continent. This theorization of leadership resonates with what might be called ‘the human side of leadership’. The leadership style Mandela envisions here is in tandem with Robert <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1742715012455133">Greenleaf’s (2002 [1977])</xref> servant-leader paradigm. Within this frame, servant-leadership is about re-conceptualizing African politics as service to humanity. In <italic>Conversations with Myself</italic>, Nelson Mandela engages his readers with a medley of personal encounters (letter exchanges, personal diaries, interviews, notes, books, reading preferences and personal convictions) that percolate his public image. In the book, Mandela takes his readers on roller-coaster odysseys of deep, private conversations and experiences, which shaped and continue to frame his leadership credo. This is indexed by servant-leadership.</p>
<p>As Mandela contemplates, it is only through personal example, which connects with the people through intimacy, service, engagement, motivation and altruistic relationship to act without coercion or pressure, that humanity might be galvanized to act by consent. This is what John Kotter in his <italic>A Force for Change</italic> (1990: 64) calls ‘energy surge’; in Gandhi’s words, this constitutes ‘the silent force’, the harbinger of truth, trust, symbolic and transformational leadership. As <italic>Conversations with Myself</italic> teaches, the process of servant-leadership radiates light, morals, ethical, authentic leadership and a people-centred approach to political leadership, which are needed for humanity’s development, empowerment and well-being. It is to this end that Gary Yukl in his <italic>Leadership in Organizations</italic> (2010) considers a servant-leader as thus:<disp-quote>
<p>The servant leader must empower followers instead of using power to dominate them. Trust is established by being completely honest and open, keeping actions consistent with values, and showing trust in followers. Greenleaf believes that the followers of such leaders are inspired to become servant leaders themselves. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1742715012455133">Yukl, 2010</xref>, p. 340)</p></disp-quote>In taking this further, President Barack Obama, in his foreword to <italic>Conversations with Myelf</italic>, stated that he has come to admire and respect Nelson Mandela primarily because of Mandela’s selfless service to humanity: ‘Over the years, I continued to watch Nelson Mandela with a sense of admiration and humility, inspired by the sense of possibility that his own life demonstrated, and awed by the <italic>sacrifices</italic> necessary to achieve his dream of justice and equality’ (p. xi).</p>
<p>Rather than see political leadership or public office as personal sacrifice and selfless service for the emancipation of the populace as Mandela enjoins, African leadership has chosen the path of the blade, self, inhumanity and personal enrichment; these variables are antithetical to the ideals of servant-leadership, which are the overarching message in the book. Mandela testifies to the same notion that President Obama touches on when he was approached by three African National Congress (ANC) leaders to stand as president if they ‘won the election’ (p. 353). Mandela’s statement demonstrates modesty, consideration for others and servant-leadership, even in the face of opportunity to lead. Mandela’s response was:<disp-quote>
<p>… I had always admired men and women who used their talents to serve humanity, and who were highly respected and admired for their efforts and sacrifices, even though they had no office whatsoever in government or society … I urged the three senior leaders that I would prefer to serve without holding any position in the organisation or government. One of them, however, put me flat on the carpet. He reminded me that I had always advocated the importance of collective leadership … (p. 354)</p></disp-quote>The above excerpt is food for thought for African leaders who seem not to see leadership as distributed, shared and collegial. Thus, as Mandela remarked, it is only through the ascendency of post-heroic leadership, what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1742715012455133">Lipman-Blumen (1996)</xref> characterized as ‘connective leadership’, a corollary of shared vision for collective ‘goal achievement’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1742715012455133">Fitzsimons et al., 2011, p. 315</xref>) that Africa could be liberated from inhuman (political) leadership, the monster that has unflinchingly kept her at the periphery in the comity of nations. This is also part of the reason Africa is considered to be underdeveloped. In continuing the conversation, Mandela remarked in an unpublished sequel to his autobiography <italic>A Long Walk to Freedom</italic> that ‘my general impression after reading several autobiographies is that an autobiography is not merely a catalogue of events and expressions in which a person has been involved, but that it also serves as some blueprint on which others may well model their own lives’ (Mandela, 2010, p. 408). He has done the same in <italic>Conversations with Myself</italic>; the lesson therein is for African leaders to resist the allure of self-serving leadership style and by so doing serve humanity.</p>
<p><italic>Conversations with Myself</italic> is a book of 14 chapters arranged in four parts: Part one is themed ‘pastoral’, part two is about ‘drama’, part three is focused on ‘epic’, and part four deals with ‘tragicomedy’. The book also has paratextual information such as foreword written by President Barack Obama and the introduction penned by Verne Harris. The book also has additional details in the appendices that include a timeline, maps, places, abbreviations for organizations and an index. In total, it is a book of 454 pages. The book synthesizes Mandela’s voyage on earth, which for the most part is relayed in his autobiography <italic>A Long Walk to Freedom</italic> (1995) and <italic>No Easy Walk to Freedom</italic> (2002), a cavalcade of Mandela’s collection of articles, letters and speeches from underground, as well as the transcripts from his trials, which clearly reveal the personality, charisma and doggedness of a soaring leader in the struggle for racial equality in South Africa. In addition, <italic>Conversations with Myself</italic> extends beyond the confines of Mandela’s autobiography, <italic>A Long Walk to Freedom,</italic> through annotated pieces that further illuminate as well as deepen the insights and conversations presented in <italic>A Long Walk to Freedom</italic>. The book is a trajectory of values that accentuated Mandela’s rise, the roadmap to his leadership victory and sermon on service through servant-leadership. Mandela’s travails that crystallize in his phenomenal prison sentence without conviction as well as iron-clad will not to waver in the vortex of life’s vagaries and tempest, make him stand out as a genuine, selfless leader, which is the hallmark of servant-leadership.</p>
<p>Within Greenleaf’s frame, a servant-leader is first and foremost an individual or leader who is predisposed to serve: ‘The servant-leader is first servant. It begins with the natural feeling that one wants to serve. Then conscious choice brings one to aspire to lead’ (p. 27). Mandela’s letter to his ex-wife, Winnie Mandela, whilst in Kroomstad Prison in 1975 is a testament to his ideal of service to humanity:<disp-quote>
<p>… the cell is an ideal place to learn to know yourself, to search realistically and regularly the process of your own mind and feelings. In judging our progress as individuals we tend to concentrate on external factors such as social position, influence, wealth, and … But internal factors may be even more crucial in assessing one’s development as human beings. Honesty, sincerity, simplicity, humility, pure generosity, absence of vanity, readiness to serve others – qualities which are within easy reach of every soul – are the foundation of one’s spiritual life. (p. iii)</p></disp-quote>As a window into the private life of Nelson Mandela (see the book’s blurb), <italic>Conversations with Myself</italic> offers a panoramic snapshot of Mandela’s personal ethos that finds expression in his public image and leadership characteristics. As Mandela averred in his <italic>No Easy Walk to Freedom</italic> (2002) there is no cheap march to freedom anywhere. And many of us will have to pass through the valley of the shadow of death several times before we reach the zenith of our desires in life. This statement encapsulates the whole conversations in <italic>Conversations with Myself</italic>. There is no better way to review this book than to make allusion to Mandela’s personal life as a reflection of servant-leadership as espoused by Robert Greenleaf. It is also within this same conversation that we can see the book as a teaching on the human side of politics for a re-invented African style of holding public office that will impact political leadership and public service in a positive way.</p>
<p>Critically looking at the book, it is beleaguered with sanctimonious statements and personal encounters that have given rise to Mandela’s hero status, which might not appeal to everybody, as well as disparate situations. From the angle of contingency leadership theory, Mandela might have handled differently some of the events and situations that brought him to global recognition, as well as made him a statesman. Mandela seems to universalize his experiences by offering a lodestar for a better-led Africa. The book is also a patchwork as well as pastiche of earlier information we know about Nelson Mandela. It is for the most part an annotated version of his autobiography, <italic>A Long Walk to Freedom</italic>. Nevertheless, <italic>Conversations with Myself</italic> is a bold attempt by the South African leadership champion, Nelson Mandela, to once more let us have a taste of his leadership genius: servant-leadership.</p>
