<abstract>
<p>Brachymetatarsia is an abnormal shortening of a metatarsal. It causes disruption of the normal metatarsal parabola, resulting in metatarsalgia, calluses and dislocation of the digits. Patients often express discontent with the appearance of their feet. Lengthening by distraction osteogenesis and 1-stage intercalary bone grafting procedures are the mainstays of operative treatment. We present a modified 1-stage technique, combining the use of a Chevron osteotomy of the fourth metatarsal with shortening osteotomies of the second and third metatarsals. Bone removed from the third metatarsal was used to lengthen the fourth. The Chevron segments provided mediolateral, dorsoplantar, and rotational stability. The technique was used on both feet of 1 patient. The mean increase in AOFAS score was 34.5 (right foot, 46; left foot, 23.) There were no complications. A 1-stage technique does not require an external fixator or postoperative manipulation and has a quicker healing time. Taking the bone graft from neighboring metatarsals decreases the discrepancy between metatarsal lengths. A smaller increase in the length of the fourth ray is then required, and the chance of neurovascular injury as a result of soft-tissue stretching is minimized. This technique allows restoration of the metatarsal parabola and provides good correction, immediate stability, and good integration.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Brachymetatarsia is an abnormal shortening of a metatarsal, typically of the fourth toe.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1938640012463059">1</xref></sup> Its etiology can be acquired, idiopathic congenital, or associated congenital.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1938640012463059">2</xref></sup> The acquired condition is caused by premature closure of the epiphysis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1938640012463059">3</xref></sup> A female predominance is reported for this condition (24.5:1), which may be skewed by an increased tendency for women to present, seeking surgery for cosmetic reasons.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1938640012463059">1</xref></sup></p>
<p>The deformity causes a disruption of the normal metatarsal parabola, resulting in metatarsalgia, painful calluses, and dislocation of the digits. Patients often express discontent with the appearance of their feet.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1938640012463059">4</xref></sup> Corrective surgery is typically offered where conservative measures have not alleviated ongoing symptoms.</p>
<p>Many surgical procedures for correction have been described, but gradual lengthening by distraction osteogenesis and 1-stage intercalary bone grafting procedures have become the mainstays of operative treatment for brachymetatarsia.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1938640012463059">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1938640012463059">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1938640012463059">6</xref></sup> Acute lengthening of up to 23 mm has been reported with few complications in patients undergoing 1-stage lengthening.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1938640012463059">5</xref></sup></p>
<p>Several 1-stage methods are described in the literature, but there is no consensus as to which is the best. Autogenous bone grafts from the tibia, calcaneus, iliac crest, and neighboring metatarsals have been reported.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1938640012463059">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1938640012463059">7</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1938640012463059"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1938640012463059">9</xref></sup></p>
<p>It is the opinion of the authors that acute lengthening procedures are technically challenging. This is partly because of the instability caused by tension in the soft tissues, which tends to create a deforming force. This is magnified by the insertion of a graft, which results in 2 interfaces where displacement can occur. Furthermore, the surgeon needs to control displacement in 3 places: medial-lateral, dorsoplantar, and rotational areas.</p>
<p>We present a variation of the previously described 1-stage technique combining the use of a Chevron osteotomy of the fourth metatarsal with shortening Chevron segment osteotomies of the second and third metatarsals. The bone removed from the third metatarsal was then used as a graft for lengthening the fourth metatarsal. The Chevron segments provided mediolateral, dorsoplantar, and rotational stability.</p>

<title>Case Report</title>
<p>A 54-year-old female patient was referred to our institution with bilateral painful, deformed feet with fourth toe shortening, present since adolescence. The pain had worsened over several months and made mobilizing difficult. Prolonged periods of standing at work exacerbated her symptoms despite the use of orthotics. Cosmesis was not a primary concern. Examination revealed a shortened fourth ray with overriding of the fourth toe on the third consistent with brachymetatarsia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1938640012463059">Figure 1</xref>). The patient was tender around the third and fourth metatarsal heads. The signs and symptoms were similar bilaterally. Plain radiographs confirmed examination findings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1938640012463059">Figure 2</xref>).</p>

<sec id="section3-1938640012463059">
<title>Operative Procedure</title>
<p>Preoperative planning was undertaken. The greatest concern was that the patient was 3 decades older than the average patient normally undergoing the procedure, and as a result, an acute lengthening in excess of 1 cm would have risked significant complications with noncompliant vasculature. A gradual lengthening procedure was considered, but the patient did not wish to undergo a procedure involving an external fixator. The second and third metatarsals were noted to be long, and the ideal length of each metatarsal was calculated in comparison with the normal metatarsal parabola (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1938640012463059">Figure 3</xref>).</p>
<fig id="fig3-1938640012463059" position="float">
<label>Figure 3.</label>
<caption><p>Preoperative Planning was Undertaken to Calculate the Lengths of Each Metatarsal and to Determine How Best to Restore Normal Parabola.</p></caption>
<graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1938640012463059-fig3.tif"/>
</fig>
<p>This would have resulted in the fourth metatarsal being lengthened in excess of 1 cm. Therefore a modified parabola was planned, with shortening of the second and third metatarsals and lengthening of the fourth metatarsal. This was planned in such a manner that the shortening of the third metatarsal was equal to the lengthening of the fourth metatarsal.</p>
<p>Both feet were operated on in a staged manner, with 9 months between each operation. The patient was positioned in the supine position under general anesthetic, and a thigh tourniquet was applied. A dorsal longitudinal incision was placed over the second Web space to enable access to both the second and third metatarsals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1938640012463059">Figure 4</xref>). The fourth metatarsal was exposed through a second longitudinal dorsal incision directly over the bone. The extensor tendons to the second and third metatarsal were left intact, whereas a <italic>Z</italic>-lengthening was performed of the extensors to the fourth toe.</p>

<graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1938640012463059-fig4.tif"/>
</fig>
<p>The bones were then prepared for the Chevron cuts. In the second and third metatarsals, two 1.2-mm k-wires were inserted parallel to each other in the center of the midshaft of the metatarsal separated by a distance equal to the planned shortening (right second metatarsal, 6 mm; third metatarsal, 8 mm; left second and third metatarsals, 5 mm.) In the fourth metatarsal, a single 1.2-mm k-wire was inserted in the midshaft parallel to the other k-wires. The k-wires were then removed and a 120° Chevron cut was created using the k-wire holes as the apex of each Chevron. The bone from the second and third metatarsals were then removed and stored for later (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-1938640012463059">Figure 5</xref>). Shortening of these bones was then performed, and the bones were held with memory staples.</p>

<graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1938640012463059-fig5.tif"/>
</fig>
<p>The fourth metatarsal was then distracted, and the bone that had been removed from the third metatarsal was placed in the gap. The lengthened metatarsal was stabilized using a minifragment T plate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-1938640012463059">Figure 6</xref>).</p>

<graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1938640012463059-fig6.tif"/>
</fig>
<p>Finally the fourth metatarsophalangeal joint was released using a dorsal capsulotomy and collateral ligament release. The extensor tendons were repaired in the lengthened position at appropriate tension, and the wounds were washed out and closed.</p>
<p>Postoperatively, a below-knee cast with toe extension was applied for 12 weeks, and the patient was prevented from bearing weight on the foot. This was followed by 1 month in an aircast boot to facilitate gradual weight bearing. At 6 months postoperative follow-up, the patient was happy with both the functional result and the cosmetic appearance, whereas radiographs demonstrated union of all osteotomies and integration of the bone graft (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-1938640012463059">Figure 7</xref>). The American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Society Score (AOFAS Score) was 44 preoperatively and 90 at one year follow up. The left foot scored 64 preoperatively and 87 at the 18-week follow-up.</p>

</fig>
<p>The procedure did not have any adverse affects on the first ray. The patient did not complain of any transfer metatarsalgia or limitation of movement at the hallux MTP joint. The procedure as described restores the normal parabola of the metatarsal lengths and helps restore weight-bearing dynamics of the foot.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>McGlamry and Cooper<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1938640012463059">8</xref></sup> were the first to use an autogenous bone graft for the treatment of brachymetatarsia. They used a graft from the lateral aspect of the calcaneus to lengthen the hypoplastic metatarsal. Kashuk et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1938640012463059">10</xref></sup> were the first to combine a simultaneous lengthening and shortening procedure when they encountered a hypoplastic fourth metatarsal and an elongated fifth metatarsal. Our technique builds on these methods and uses a combination of the best methods to gain optimal results.</p>
<p>A small number of studies have compared 1-stage lengthening and lengthening by distraction osteogenesis for the treatment of this condition. Lee et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1938640012463059">5</xref></sup> compared the outcomes in 153 patients across 3 groups. In 1 group, lengthening was performed by 1-stage intercalary bone grafting secured by an intramedullary Kirschner wire. In the second group, lengthening was obtained gradually using a mini–external fixator after performing osteotomy with a saw. In the third group, lengthening was achieved with a mini–external fixator after undertaking an osteotomy using an osteotome through predrilled holes. They found the mean gain in length was smaller in the bone graft group (13.9 mm) compared with the 2 groups in which lengthening was obtained gradually (17.8 mm in group 2 and 16.8 mm in group 3.) However, bone healing was significantly quicker in the bone graft group in terms of the mean fixation time. The main complications in the 1-stage lengthening group were skin necrosis and stiffness of the metatarsophalangeal joint. In the other 2 groups, they encountered problems with pin-track infections, external fixator damage, and complete failure of bone formation.</p>
<p>Kim et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1938640012463059">7</xref></sup> treated 18 feet in 12 patients by 1-stage lengthening with interpositional bone grafts or by gradual lengthening with callostasis combined with shortening of the adjacent metatarsals and phalanges. They advocated the use of a 1-stage procedure with interpositional bone graft in a patient with fourth brachymetatarsia when the target length after adjacent bone shortening was 15 mm. The main problems they encountered in the 1-stage group were neurovascular problems and a failure to achieve target length. Insufficient callus formation and axial deviation were problems associated with gradual lengthening. It is important to note that they stated that combining lengthening of the affected ray with shortening of adjacent rays was beneficial because it minimized the amount of lengthening required.</p>
<p>Alter et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1938640012463059">9</xref></sup> described the use of a Chevron graft harvested from the tibia. The use of Chevron-shaped segments increases mediolateral, dorsoplantar, and rotational stability. However, the use of a tibial graft does not combine shortening of the neighboring metatarsals. The result of this is that a larger overall increase in length is required, leading to an increased risk of neurovascular complications.</p>
<p>Goo and Moon<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1938640012463059">1</xref></sup> advocated the use of the 1-stage procedure as a result of a decreased overall period of treatment when compared with callostasis. They suggested that gradual distraction of the osteotomies should be performed for 20 to 30 minutes intraoperatively to decrease the risk of neurovascular complications.</p>
<p>Giannini et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1938640012463059">6</xref></sup> obtained good results using a 1-stage allograft technique. The drawbacks of this technique are the need to have access to a bone bank and the risk of infection transmission from donor to host.</p>
<p>A combined shortening and lengthening procedure has previously been shown to obtain excellent results. Kim et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1938640012463059">3</xref></sup> used bone grafts from normal metatarsals to increase the length of a shortened neighboring metatarsal. All patients in this study had their metatarsal parabolas restored with good functional outcomes, and no complications were reported. Our technique builds on this method through the use of the Chevron segments.</p>
<p>In summary, a 1-stage technique has the benefit of not requiring an external fixator or postoperative manipulation. It is also important to note that healing time is quicker with the 1-stage technique. The drawbacks of this technique are donor-site complications, a smaller gain in overall length, and neurovascular damage from rapid stretching of the soft tissues.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1938640012463059">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1938640012463059">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1938640012463059">11</xref></sup></p>
<p>Most patients with this condition present with altered forefoot mechanics and loading with transfer metatarsalgia. The combined lengthening and shortening procedure restores the normal metatarsal parabola, thereby addressing this issue.</p>
<p>By taking the bone graft from the neighboring metatarsals, the discrepancy between the lengths of the metatarsals can be reduced. A smaller increase in the length of the fourth ray is then required. By this method, the chance of neurovascular injury and chronic stiffness as a result of soft-tissue stretching is reduced.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1938640012463059">9</xref></sup> Grafts taken from adjacent metatarsals are naturally optimally shaped and require very little shaping. Tissue trauma and graft damage are therefore minimized.</p>
<p>The use of Chevron grafts increases stability in transverse and frontal planes while preventing rotational instability. The Chevron shape also increases the surface area of bone-on-graft contact, which facilitates more rapid healing.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1938640012463059">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1938640012463059">12</xref></sup> <italic>Z</italic>-plasty lengthening of the extensor tendon prevents subsequent contracture of the fourth toe.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1938640012463059">13</xref></sup></p>
<p>This 1-stage technique for treating brachymetatarsia demonstrated successful outcomes, with a significant increase in the AOFAS. Lengthening the fourth metatarsal in conjunction with second and third metatarsal shortening restores the metatarsal parabola. The single-stage procedure reduces patient morbidity and provides an efficient and successful resolution to this debilitating condition. The modified Chevron intercalary grafting technique that we present has the advantage of good correction, immediate stability, and good integration.</p>
