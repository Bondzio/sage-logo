<abstract>
<p>The research herein uses a mixed methods approach to examine how organizational phenomena at the macro level of analysis translate into phenomena at the micro level. Specifically, the research attempts to explain how cultural institutions may translate into individual attitudes and actions, such as public school teachers’ decisions about using instructional practices prescribed by reform. The findings suggest that public school teachers rationalize their instructional practices by drawing on the logics of three core cultural institutions: bureaucracy, democracy, and markets. When the logics of these institutions are violated, teachers reduce their reported use of prescribed instructional practices.</p>

<p>Teacher interpretations have become increasingly important to understanding the dynamics of school reform (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1558689812468792">Coburn, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1558689812468792">Louis, Febey, &amp; Schroeder, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1558689812468792">Spillane, 1999</xref>). Often, teachers’ interpretations of reform are assumed to be dispositional traits related to teacher background and demographic characteristics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1558689812468792">Evans, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1558689812468792">Fullan, 2001</xref>). Alternatively, teachers’ interpretations of reform are attributed to their organizational contexts, such as the cultural norms of the school or the professional communities of which teachers are a part (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1558689812468792">Coburn, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1558689812468792">Fullan, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1558689812468792">Louis, Marks, and Kruse, 1996</xref>). These existing explanations offer a compelling micro-level and meso level perspective on teacher interpretations and reactions to school reform. However, the current work suggests that teacher interpretations of reform may also be rooted in more macro-level phenomena.</p>
<p>Individuals’ interpretations of issues and events are driven by both dispositional factors, such as their personal background and experiences, and situational factors, such as organizational context (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1558689812468792">Davis-Blake &amp; Pfeffer, 1989</xref>). However, organizational context is not the only situation in which individuals are embedded. Individuals, including teachers, are embedded in a broader societal context—communities, regions, and nations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1558689812468792">Friedland &amp; Alford, 1991</xref>). In the same way that organizational contexts influence interpretations, one might expect that broader societal contexts also affect teacher interpretations and perhaps in a more fundamental way. In other words, teacher interpretations of school reform may be driven, in part, by the cultural norms of the broader societal context. The current work aims to understand the extent to which broader cultural norms play a role in teachers’ interpretations of reform and how culturally grounded interpretations may influence teachers’ decisions about adopting practices prescribed by school reform.</p>
<p>For example, many macro-level researchers suggest that cultural institutions, such as democracy, bureaucracy, the professions, and markets, affect organizations and influence the issues that individuals in organizations deem to be important (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1558689812468792">Friedland &amp; Alford, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1558689812468792">Thornton &amp; Ocasio, 2008</xref>). However, to the extent that cultural institutions influence individual attitudes and, thus, potentially affect individual actions, the question is <italic>how</italic> the norms of macro-level cultural institutions become translated into individual attitudes and actions at the micro level. In particular, one of the most persistent challenges for sociologists, and organizational theorists specifically, has been determining how phenomena at one level of analysis translate to other levels of analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1558689812468792">DiMaggio, 1991</xref>). One way to address this question of macro–micro translation is by taking an epistemological and ontological approach that facilitates a conversation between macro and micro approaches. For example, the current research uses a sequential mixed methods research design to explore how public school teachers rely on the logics of cultural institutions to interpret state education reforms and to make decisions about using practices prescribed by reform.</p>
<p>Epistemologically speaking, mixed methods research helps create a conversation between macro and micro research by integrating the preferred empirical approaches for studying the two different levels of analysis. Researchers who study micro-level dynamics, such as individual attitudes and actions, often privilege the importance of psychology, decision making, and agency, whereas researchers who study macro-level dynamics, such as cultural norms, tend to privilege the importance of institutions, structure, and routine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1558689812468792">Clegg &amp; Hardy, 1999</xref>). Correspondingly, the study of micro and macro phenomena varyingly emphasizes positivism or constructivism, quantitative or qualitative data, and large or small <italic>n</italic> analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1558689812468792">Clegg &amp; Hardy, 1999</xref>). Understanding how cultural institutions manifest themselves in the attitudes and actions of individuals in organizations requires both approaches. Thus, mixed methods research provides a uniquely appropriate epistemological lens for bridging this micro–macro divide in organizational research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1558689812468792">DiMaggio, 1991</xref>). Moreover, the mixed methods approach used in the current research helps illustrate how mixed methods can be used to elucidate complex phenomena related to culture and the meaning individuals make of it (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1558689812468792">Newman, Ridenour, Newman, &amp; DeMarco, 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>Ontologically speaking, there are any number of philosophical perspectives that might illuminate the phenomenon of school reform (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1558689812468792">Clegg &amp; Hardy, 1999</xref>). The current work focuses on the theory of <italic>institutional logics</italic>. The theory of institutional logics helps create a conversation between macro and micro research by explaining how cultural institutions, which exist at the broadest levels of social analysis, become meaningful for individual attitudes and actions at the micro level.</p>
<sec id="section1-1558689812468792">
<title>The Logics of School Reform</title>
<p>Institutional logics are the sets of beliefs, values, norms, and practices that are associated with core cultural institutions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1558689812468792">Friedland &amp; Alford, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1558689812468792">Thornton &amp; Ocasio, 2008</xref>). For example, the work of cultural sociologists and social psychologists interested in elemental forms of social relations suggest there are six core cultural institutions: (a) the family, (b) markets, (c) democracy, (d), bureaucracy, (e) the professions, and (f) religion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1558689812468792">Boltanski &amp; Thevenot, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1558689812468792">Fiske, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1558689812468792">Friedland &amp; Alford, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1558689812468792">Thornton &amp; Ocasio, 1999</xref>).</p>
<p>Representing the global and historical complexities of social relations in a six-point framework necessarily simplifies many of these complexities to develop a model that might generalize across a diversity of global and historical contexts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1558689812468792">Higgins, 2004</xref>). Consequently, the diverse ways in which families, markets, democracy, bureaucracy, the professions, and religion unfold in different contexts can become essentialized and obscured. However, it is important to note that frameworks for describing social relations are not intended to be prescriptive but descriptive. In other words, the concept of institutional logics does not argue that the above described institutions should exist or that individuals in a society should be instructed to conform to and advance these institutions (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1558689812468792">Bobbitt, 1924</xref>). Instead, the argument is that the beliefs, values, norms, and practices observed in a variety of societies appear to be described by a set of six underlying logics associated with the core cultural institutions that exist in various societies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1558689812468792">Friedland &amp; Alford, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1558689812468792">Thornton &amp; Ocasio, 2008</xref>). Thus, an understanding of institutional logics helps clarify the kind of broad cultural norms that may drive the understandings, actions, and interactions of individuals across societies. And as the current work suggests, institutional logics may also help clarify how broad cultural norms drive understandings, actions, and interactions within organizations and among individuals.</p>
<p>For example, the logics of the family have been described as stressing the importance of beliefs, values, norms, and practices, such as loyalty, trust, obligation, collective responsibility, intimacy, pooled resources, and tradition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1558689812468792">Boltanski &amp; Thevenot, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1558689812468792">Fiske, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1558689812468792">Friedland &amp; Alford, 1991</xref>). Conversely, the logics of the market are associated with rational choice, accumulation, commoditization, competition, opportunism, controlled emotions, and the values of production and exchange (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1558689812468792">Boltanski &amp; Thevenot, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1558689812468792">Fiske, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1558689812468792">Friedland &amp; Alford, 1991</xref>). The logics of democracy privilege the importance of community, consensus, participation, common good, fairness, popular control, and the consent of the governed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1558689812468792">Boltanski &amp; Thevenot, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1558689812468792">Fiske, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1558689812468792">Friedland &amp; Alford, 1991</xref>).</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the logics of bureaucracy privilege order, productivity, planning, measures for outcomes, technical expertise, and routines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1558689812468792">Fiske, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1558689812468792">Friedland &amp;Alford, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1558689812468792">M. Weber, 1921/1968</xref>). The logics of the profession stress the importance of prestige, personal reputation and influence, technical expertise, and relationships among craftsmen and colleagues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1558689812468792">Boltanski &amp; Thevenot, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1558689812468792">Friedland &amp; Alford, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1558689812468792">Thornton &amp; Ocasio, 1999</xref>). Finally, the logics of religion privilege passion, the pursuit of truth and moral principles, asceticism, faith, the attainment of grace, and guidance by a higher power (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1558689812468792">Boltanski &amp; Thevenot, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1558689812468792">Friedland &amp; Alford, 1991</xref>).</p>
<p>If institutional logics in society influence understandings and actions among organizations and individuals, then one would expect the beliefs, values, norms, and practices associated with logics to be reflected in organizational and individual decision making. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1558689812468792">Thornton and Ocasio (1999)</xref> demonstrate the role of institutional logics in shifting the organizational aims and dominant practices of educational text book publishers. Similarly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1558689812468792">Lounsbury (2007)</xref> demonstrates how institutional logics have influenced financial practices for managing mutual funds in different geographic regions. In the schools context, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1558689812468792">Russell (2010)</xref> illustrates how the practices of kindergarten education have shifted over time as predominant logics have shifted from emphasizing the beliefs, values, norms, and practices of the family to those of bureaucracy and markets.</p>
<p>The above examples of institutional logics translating from society to the organization level of analysis suggest that institutional logics may also translate to the individual level of analysis. In the context of school reform, teachers might react to reform policies by raising issues related to one or more logics. For example, teachers may reject a prescribed practice because it does not encourage shared decision making or because the practice does not nurture the whole child (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1558689812468792">Poetter, Wegwert, &amp; Haerr, 2006</xref>). Such reactions would suggest that teachers’ attitudes are informed by the logics of democracy, which advocate participation, and the logics of the family, which stress nurturing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1558689812468792">Fiske, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1558689812468792">Friedland &amp; Alford, 1991</xref>). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1558689812468792">Figure 1</xref> illustrates the argued conceptual link between institutional logics and individuals’ use of work practices inside organizations.</p>

</fig>
<p>Examining the role of institutions and logics in teachers’ reactions to reform and their subsequent instructional decisions is important for understanding school reform and also organizational dynamics, more broadly. With respect to understandings of school reform, if teachers’ attitudes and actions are grounded in institutional logics then this may help explain why school reform is such a persistent challenge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1558689812468792">Payne, 2008</xref>). In particular, teacher resistance to reform is often explained by deficits in instructional leadership, teacher training, or professional communities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1558689812468792">Fullan, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1558689812468792">Coburn, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1558689812468792">Louis et al., 1996</xref>). However, teacher resistance to reform may be rooted more deeply in the logics of institutions. This is to say, that teachers may resist reform because prescribed practices violate the fundamental beliefs, values, norms, and practices instilled by core cultural institutions. If so, then one would expect teachers’ resistance to reform to be particularly persistent and difficult to overcome. Similarly, when one considers that school reform is a specific case of more general phenomena—namely, organizational and institutional change—lessons about teacher resistance being grounded in underlying institutional logics may also help explain broader patterns of resistance to change in other kinds of organizations (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1558689812468792">Bridwell-Mitchell &amp; Mezias, 2012</xref>).</p>
<p>Given the potential role and importance of institutional logics in teachers’ interpretations of school reform and decisions about prescribed instructional practice, the current work has three operational research questions:</p>

<title>Overview</title>
<p>To answer the above three research questions, the current work employs a two-stage, sequential mixed methods design that first conducts an exploratory qualitative case study to understand teachers’ interpretations of the main issues involved in school reform (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1558689812468792">Creswell, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1558689812468792">Yin, 2008</xref>). The findings from the case study are then used to develop a set of propositions about the way salient issues reflect institutional logics and the way logics influence teachers’ instructional decisions. Next, the propositions are tested by surveying 286 teachers from five schools about their opinions regarding issues related to reform. Then confirmatory factor analysis is used to determine the extent to which teachers’ issues with reform are explained by an underlying set of factors, where identified factors are assumed to be indicators of institutional logics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1558689812468792">Child, 2006</xref>).<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1558689812468792">2</xref>
</sup> Finally, the identified factors are used to determine the extent to which institutional logics explain teachers’ reported decisions about appropriate instructional practices. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1558689812468792">Figure 2</xref> summarizes the key components of the sequential mixed methods research design.

<title>Stage 1 Qualitative Study: Data Collection</title>
<p>Data were collected from November 2004 to June 2005 in one school in a large northeastern U.S. city. The school, referred to throughout this work as Turnaround Elementary, was selected from 31 schools mandated to implement specific curricular and instructional reforms spelled out in a school review and report produced by the State Department of Education. Despite being located in a large urban city, Turnaround Elementary is surrounded by the quiet activity of what many would describe as a suburban community. Yet it shares all of the features of most schools required to implement state-prescribed instructional practices. At Turnaround, 93% of students were “non-White,” with the same percentage eligible for free or reduced lunch, 75% of students were below grade level in English language arts, and 82% were below grade level in mathematics</p>
<p>The primary data collection strategy at Turnaround Elementary was ethnographic observation. The observations were structured to account for typical social moments at the schools by sampling 2-hour observation periods, stratified by morning and afternoon hours, and occurring in multiple social spaces in the school (e.g., Tuesday, December 14, from 9 a.m. to 11 a.m. in the teachers’ lounge). This strategy resulted in 160 hours of formal observations. As a secondary strategy designed to contextualize the initial understandings of the field, which were emerging from observations, I conducted interviews with 19 of the school’s 33 teachers, who were solicited by selecting their names randomly from the school’s organization chart. Interviews lasted between 25 and 60 minutes and were semistructured, using prompts to engage respondents in a general conversation about the overall changes taking place at their schools; these prompts are illustrated in the <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-1558689812468792">appendix</xref>.</p>

<sec id="section5-1558689812468792">
<title>Stage 1 Qualitative Study: Data Analysis</title>
<p>The issues practitioners identify have been demonstrated to be an important indicator of institutional logics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1558689812468792">Thornton &amp; Ocasio, 1999</xref>). Therefore, the aim of the qualitative data analysis was to explore the kinds of issues teachers raised when making reference to prescribed practices. The first step in the analysis was to review interview transcripts and field notes in order to identify teachers’ references to prescribed instructional practices. The content analysis software NVivo was used to review transcribed field notes and interviews to identify units of text referring to instructional practices. As the coding system evolved, it was refined so that code names and definitions could be consistently applied across interviews and field notes. This review of the data resulted in 23 initial thematic codes referring to the different kinds of instructional practices to which teachers made reference. Some examples of the codes include “individualized instruction,”“hands-on learning,”“cooperative learning,”“the workshop model,” and “student-centered instruction.”<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1558689812468792">Table 1</xref> provides examples of text assigned to these codes. It should be noted that the assignment of text to codes was not mutually exclusive since a segment of text might refer to multiple instructional practices. Thus, some segments of text were assigned to more than one code (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1558689812468792">Krippendorf, 2004</xref>).</p>

<p>The second step in the qualitative analysis was to review the content of text assigned to and surrounding each code for instructional practice in order to identify the kinds of issues teachers focus on when discussing prescribed practices. The iterative process of reviewing assigned text, comparing codes to one another, and identifying emerging themes also involved a return to the scholarly literature for insight on emerging themes and their potential relevance for the research questions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1558689812468792">Krippendorf, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1558689812468792">Miles &amp; Huberman, 1994</xref>). This second-stage analysis and literature review suggested four main themes in the issues teachers raised about prescribed instructional practices. These themes were the availability of resources for reform, the effectiveness of reforms, the extent to which reforms conformed to professional norms and standards, and the intensity of regulatory pressures to implement reforms. Thus, a second set of etic codes that represent phenomena as they are relevant to emerging theory and the disciplinary background of the researcher was developed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1558689812468792">Headland, Pike, &amp; Harris, 1990</xref>). Text from field notes and interview transcripts were assigned to the four etic codes based on the relevance of their content. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1558689812468792">Table 1</xref> illustrates the assignment of text to the four etic codes representing the main issues teachers raised about reform and prescribed instructional practices. These four issues and their proposed relationship to institutional logics are the main findings from the case study and are described further in the section on findings.</p>

<title>Stage 2 Quantitative Data Collection</title>
<p>Data for the second-stage study were collected as part of a larger research project investigating the dynamics of school reform in the same large northeastern city school system in which Stage 1 of the study was conducted. Data were collected from 286 teachers at five elementary schools from October 2005 to June 2007. Because differences in school performance and pressures for reform were expected to influence the salience of different institutional logics and also teachers’ perceptions and use of practice, it was important to construct a sample of teachers that might best reflect the variation in the general population. Therefore, the five schools in the study were selected by soliciting a subset of schools with the strong, weak, and typical performance and regulatory pressures for reform.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-1558689812468792">3</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>During the 2-year research period, teachers received six surveys polling them about their opinions about reform, their use of state prescribed instructional practices, and their demographic data, such as their school, primary subject, and grade level taught, as well as whether they were a main or supporting teacher. The survey was administered at the beginning, middle, and end of each school year. This longitudinal data collection strategy makes it possible to address how teachers’ opinion about reform and reported use of practice might vary throughout the school year, given early-year drive and student nescience, midyear testing pressures, and end-of-year fatigue and cumulative student learning. The average response rate across schools and administrations is 72.43%. The 12 items used to poll teachers about their opinions of reform were developed from the qualitative study and are illustrated in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1558689812468792">Table 2</xref>. Responses were based on a 7-point Likert-type scale ranging from <italic>totally agree</italic> (7) to <italic>totally disagree</italic> (1). The relationships between these items and the extent to which the items reflect underlying institutional logics are part of the findings of the current work and are presented in the section on findings.</p>

<p>The practices on which teachers were polled about their reported use of practice were identified by reviewing 3 years of policy reports that the State Department of Education compiles after reviewing schools it deems as having a high need for reform. Each report lists the specific instructional practices the state prescribes for a school. The 19 selected practices, illustrated in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1558689812468792">Table 3</xref>, met four criteria: (a) they were listed in more than 1 year of reports; (b) they were listed for more than one school; (c) they were relevant to teachers in all subject areas; and (d) they overlapped with practices advocated in local policy initiatives. The survey for the current research asked teachers to report how frequently they used each practice based on a 7-point Likert-type scale ranging from using a practice <italic>not at all</italic> (1) to using a practice <italic>in every lesson</italic> (7). It should be noted that teachers’ reports of practice cannot be assumed to be a measure of actual use. Instead, teachers’ reported use of a practice should be interpreted as a function of their general attitudes about a practice, their actual use, which might be motivated or constrained by factors other than attitude; and the extent to which practices are deemed socially desirable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1558689812468792">Podsakoff, Mackenzie, Lee, &amp; Podsakoff, 2003</xref>).<sup>

<title>Stage 2 Quantitative Data Analysis</title>
<sec id="section8-1558689812468792">
<title>Variable constriction–instructional practices</title>
<p>Though the primary goal of the analysis in the Stage 2 study is to examine the relationship between issues about reform and institutional logics, teachers’ reported use of instructional practice is also examined in order to construct an appropriate outcome measure for the predictive models. An exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis was conducted for the 19 items used to measure teachers’ reported use of state prescribed practices. The exploratory factor analysis revealed only one factor, and a series of nested confirmatory factor analyses suggest that single-factor model was the best fit for the data (root mean square error of approximation [RMSEA] = .041; <italic>p</italic> of close fit [PCLOSE] = .530; parsimony-adjusted comparative fit index [PCFI] = .734; Tucker–Lewis index or nonnormed fit index [TLI/NNFI] =.896). The factor score for the 19 items is used as the measure of teachers’ reported use of practice in the predictive models.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-1558689812468792">
<title>Variable constriction–institutional logics</title>
<p>The main analytical goal of the second-stage study is to determine the extent to which institutionalized rationales, which are reflected in the issues teachers raise about reform, reflect underlying institutional logics. One way to accomplish this goal is to explore whether teachers’ opinions about the issues of school reform are described by underlying factors, which reflect existing theoretical understandings of institutional logics. Thus, the second stage of analysis conducted a series of exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses of the 12 items measuring teachers’ opinions about the issues of school reform. Because the data are longitudinal and have repeated measures for persons and schools, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1558689812468792">Muthen’s (1994)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1558689812468792">Dyer, Hanges, and Hall’s (2005)</xref> method is used to correct for the underlying structure in the data before conducting the factor analyses. Because the confirmatory factor analysis for reform issues tests propositions developed from the Stage 1 study, the results are reported in the section on findings.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-1558689812468792">
<title>Predictive models</title>
<p>The goal of the predictive analysis is to determine the extent to which violations of institutional logics influence teachers’ reported use of instructional practices. Violations of institutional logics and their effects on teachers’ reported instructional practice are examined by estimating a set of maximum likelihood random effects models for pooled, cross-sectional time series data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1558689812468792">Greene, 2003</xref>). The first model is the “empty model,” which examines only the effects and fit of the demographic covariates. The remaining models examine the effects of violations of institutional logics. Note that institutional logics are measured by the identified factors and that the <italic>violation</italic> of logics is operationalized by reverse scoring the items related to each logic. The measure for each logic is entered stepwise into the regression models, such that the final model examines the effect of each logic controlling for all other logics as well as the demographic covariates. The results of these analyses are reported in the section on findings and are illustrated in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-1558689812468792">Tables 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-1558689812468792">5</xref>.</p>

<title>Qualitative Findings: Institutions and Teacher Interpretations of School Reform</title>
<p>Turnaround Elementary is located in a large northeastern city but situated in an isolated community reached by limited public transportation. The neighborhood served by the school is one of the few in the area composed mostly of people of color as well as the poor and working class. As with many schools serving poor children of color, Turnaround Elementary had a history plagued by student behavior problems. For example, Ms. Baron, the reading specialist at Turnaround, described the school’s history before reform by saying,
<disp-quote>
<p>Behavior problems [at this school] were rampant. Kids were lashing out at teachers. [There was] a lot of physical violence, a lot of verbal disrespect to the teachers, as well as to the administrators and to other students. It was a very chaotic place to work. (TAr015)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Although student behavior issues were undeniable, the state attributed such problems to teachers’ low expectations for students. For example, the state report detailing reform requirements for the school said that “many, if not all of the school’s adults have low expectations for students’ academic performance, particularly as evidenced by staff comments” (State Review Report, Turnaround Elementary, 2003, p. 3). To counter teachers’ low expectations and the resulting poor quality of instruction, the state prescribed new instructional practices, such as cooperative groups, incorporating multicultural materials into lessons, and differentiating instruction to meet diverse student needs.</p>
<p>The central claim of the current work is that teachers’ reactions to state reform and their use of prescribed instructional practices are driven, in part, by the underlying logics of cultural institutions. If this is the case, then one would expect the beliefs, values, norms, and practices associated with institutional logics to be reflected in the issues teachers raise in response to reform. The findings from the qualitative case student provide evidence to support this claim.</p>
<p>Specifically, the findings suggest that Turnaround Elementary teachers raise four main issues about instructional practices prescribed by reform—issues about the extent to which (a) resources are available to implement practices, (b) prescribed practices are effective, (c) prescribed practices are consistent with professional norms, and (d) regulatory mandates to use practices are strongly felt. Teachers raise these four issues to provide reasoned justifications for using or not using prescribed instructional practices (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1558689812468792">Townley, 2002</xref>). And, as described below, these justifications are drawn from the logics of different institutions. For example, the issues teachers raise about resources and effectiveness appear to be justifications drawn from the productivity logics of bureaucracy and markets. Issues about professional norms appear to be justifications drawn from the technocratic logics of the professions and bureaucracy. Issues about regulatory mandates appear to be justifications drawn from the participatory logics of democracy.</p>
<sec id="section12-1558689812468792">
<title>Productivity Logics</title>
<p>Both markets and bureaucracies are concerned with productivity. However, bureaucracy is mainly concerned with the means, methods, or processes of production in that accomplishing goals in a well-planned, rational manner is just as important as the goal itself (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1558689812468792">Ouchi, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1558689812468792">M. Weber, 1921/1968</xref>). Meanwhile, markets are concerned with the ends or outcome of production and especially with outcomes producing measurable value for consumers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1558689812468792">Fiske, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1558689812468792">Ouchi, 1980</xref>). Thus, productivity logics, which borrow both from bureaucracy and the markets, suggest that practices in an organization should be well-planned and rational and produce a valuable output for consumers. When practices do not meet these criteria, it becomes difficult to justify their use.</p>
<p>For example, Turnaround Elementary teachers describe how their instructional practices depend on the availability of material resources, such as books of different genres, on human resources, such as training, and on social resources, such as “trust,”“leeway,” and “respect” from administrators (TAr017, TAr019, TAr014, fnTA.16.6.22.05).<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-1558689812468792">5</xref>
</sup> When the state initiates reform, it provides schools with additional supplies, increased professional development, and additional administrative support and feedback. Even so, many Turnaround teachers, such as Ms. Darby, a recently hired third-grade teacher, argue that “there isn’t enough books to do a whole class lesson . . . you have to read a certain amount of different types of genre books, you don’t have enough copies for all these students in your class” (TAr002). Similarly, although teachers emphasize the importance of additional training, they also argue that the pace of training can feel like a “whirlwind” or “a rush” (TAr005; TAr015), which makes it difficult to learn new practices. Likewise, aggressive support from administrators generates a sense of pressure and monitoring. Ms. Mahoney, a veteran science teacher, explains this by saying, “Those that do not come on board, those are who the administrator follows . . . they stay in those classrooms and eventually they [the teachers] are going to start doing something” (TAr019).</p>
<p>In addition to making resource availability important, productivity logics also make the effectiveness of instructional practices important. For Turnaround teachers, effectiveness is measured in three ways. First, teachers are concerned with the effect of practices on the overall school. For example, after her mathematics lesson, Ms. Cartwright explains, “I feel the overall community of the school should be evaluated [to determine] if change is effective or not, if parental involvement changes . . . how students feel about coming to school” (TAr007). Teachers’ second measure of effectiveness is that practices raise standardized test scores. For example, Ms. Cantone, who offers specialized instruction for students with special needs, explains the use and importance of test score increases as a measure of effectiveness by saying, “Everything seems to be working great; it’s [reform] helping our scores to go up” (TAr013).</p>
<p>Teachers’ final measure of effectiveness makes an explicit distinction between instructional practices raising test scores versus actually increasing student learning. For example, teachers, such as Ms. Peters, a sixth-grade classroom teacher, often criticize reform by saying, “I think that we need to bring the curriculum back to where they’re actually learning and not just testing” (TAr011). Many Turnaround teachers share this sentiment and argue that student learning depends on creativity, mastery of the fundamentals, and students having limited distractions or interruptions. In contrast, prescribed practices requiring a scripted curriculum, removing practice workbooks, and seating students with potential combatants undermine learning (fnTA.10.12.06.04).</p>
<p>Teachers’ rationales about resource availability and effectiveness suggest that teachers may be relying on the productivity logics of bureaucracy and markets. In particular, the importance of having resources for accomplishing stated goals reflects the productivity logics of bureaucracy, which privilege rational planning and order (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1558689812468792">Friedland &amp; Alford, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1558689812468792">M. Weber, 1921/1968</xref>). The importance of practices being effective reflects the productivity logics of the markets, which stress outcomes and performance. Because logics reflect the rules of core cultural institutions, practices that violate logics may be seen as inappropriate and thus should not be used. In other words, instructional practices that seem inconsistent with the beliefs, values, norms, and practices of a given cultural institutions have little cognitive legitimacy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1558689812468792">Suchman, 1995</xref>). Thus, to the extent resource availability and effectiveness reflect productivity logics, insufficient resources and perceived ineffectiveness violate productivity logics and discourage teachers from using prescribed instructional practices.</p>

<title>Technocratic Logics</title>
<p>Technocratic logics refer to the set of beliefs and practices that reinforce the importance of a community of experts governing decisions and actions in an organization. Technocratic logics are core to bureaucracy, which places a high value on technical expertise and on experts knowing best how organizational goals should be accomplished (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1558689812468792">M. Weber, 1921/1968</xref>). Similarly, the professions, as an institution, privilege the importance of experts and their codified domain of knowledge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1558689812468792">Abbott, 1988</xref>). Moreover, the professions also place a high value on the relationships and traditions that have evolved among a given community of experts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1558689812468792">Thornton &amp; Ocasio, 1999</xref>). Thus, rationales that draw on technocratic logics suggest that the judgments of a community of experts—in other words, professionals—are most important for determining whether practices are appropriate to use.</p>
<p>For example, at Turnaround, teachers raise concerns about the extent to which prescribed practices are consistent with the best practices of the teaching profession and with those used by other teachers. Ms. Peters, a kindergarten teacher and the union leader at the school, explains the importance of practices being consistent with best practices by saying,
<disp-quote>
<p>Really? You give them [students] the mini lesson and the kids are really teaching themselves? At this age they already teach themselves. Okay? Like my daughter goes to a public high school which is for students who do well and they don’t want somebody to take advanced physics . . . to teach themselves. (TAr016)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>However, the appropriateness of practices is not determined only by teachers at other schools but also by teachers in their own school. Ms. Hamilton, a veteran science teacher for the upper grades who often brings lunchtime snacks in to share with colleagues, explains this by describing the normative pressure colleagues place on each other to use specific practices. She says, “I think [teachers in my grade] try to help you be better . . . but, and I have to say, if somebody resists, continually resists then, maybe they’re not thought of as highly (TAr004).</p>
<p>In addition to making comparisons with colleagues in other schools and peers in their own school, Turnaround teachers also determine what is professionally appropriate by referring back to teaching practices that are familiar to them from their own schooling experiences. For example, Ms. Mahoney explains, “When I went to school . . . we were never, ever using test sophistication skills or strategies to help us pass a test. If you’re a good teacher, they [students] will be able to pass a test” (TAr019). This teacher’s reference to the practices of “a good teacher” and Ms. Hamilton’s references to colleagues’ practices and preferences indicate the importance teachers place on experts’ judgments about what should be taught in the classroom. The privileged place of experts suggests a reliance on technocratic logics. When practices are inconsistent with existing expert knowledge, this violates technocratic logics and suggests that teachers’ may not be able to justify using prescribed practices.</p>

<sec id="section14-1558689812468792">
<title>Participatory Logics</title>
<p>Democracy, as an institution, has a number of core logics that reinforce the importance of consent and participation by the governed. For example, democracy stresses the importance of consensus, having an equal say, equal treatment, and the common good being valued over particular interests (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1558689812468792">Fiske, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1558689812468792">Friedland &amp; Alford, 1991</xref>). At the heart of democracy logics is a belief in the free will of individuals to choose what is best for them, and thus individuals should be able to determine their own fates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1558689812468792">Locke, 1690/1986</xref>). This fundamental belief suggests that the imposition of the will of elites, even elites with formal authority, undermines the participatory logics of democracy. The experience of Turnaround teachers suggests that one indicator of the imposed will of elites is a feeling of being pressured to use prescribed instructional practices.</p>
<p>This kind of pressure is expressed by Ms. Peters and other Turnaround teachers, who say, “They [the state] tell you to do this, do this, do this, and then you get sick of being told what to do; just let me teach . . .” (TAr016). Similarly, Ms. Goodrich, a former para-professional who began working at the school when her daughter was enrolled at Turnaround comments, “I feel like a lot of our freedom as teachers has been taken away, a lot of our teachable moments have been taken away” (TAr014). Ms. Frazier, who teaches fourth graders down the hall from Ms. Goodrich, suggests how interference from the state may lead teachers to reject working in the school system altogether. She says, “Because you don’t have a voice in it . . . your creativity sometimes is taken away from you. It makes you feel sort of inadequate . . . some teachers have talked about leaving the system—the profession” (TAr002).</p>
<p>This sense of pressure and constraint imposed by the state also manifests as a sense of time pressure. For example, some teachers, such as Mr. Long, one of only two male teachers at Turnaround, criticize state reform by saying, “it’s too fast paced . . . it’s sort of a time frame where you do one thing but he [the student] hasn’t learned that skill but you go on to another thing . . . it really bothers me” (TAr012). For Turnaround teachers, the sense of pressure from the mandate, from strict monitoring, and from time constraints provides a strong rationale for <italic>not</italic> using practices because these pressures are inconsistent with the participatory logics of democracy.</p>

</list>
<p>The above-described findings about the issues teachers raise about reform suggest that teachers interpret reform by engaging with specific institutional logics. In particular, the findings suggest that teachers rely on logics to make reasoned justifications about which practices are appropriate and actionable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1558689812468792">Townley, 2002</xref>). Teachers’ reliance on institutional logics suggests that macro-level cultural institutions may become translated into individual attitudes and actions at the micro level by providing individuals with <italic>institutionalized rationales</italic>, which are reasoned justifications for action that are drawn from the logics of different institutions.</p>
<p>The three sets of inductively derived propositions presented above specify the way in which institutionalized rationales about resources, effectiveness, expert endorsement, and regulatory pressure are related to institutional logics (i.e., Propositions 1a, 1b, 2a, and 3a). The propositions above also suggest how institutional logics may a be a source of teacher resistance to reform since the perceived violation of logics may result in teachers’ lower reported use of prescribed instructional practice (i.e., Propositions 1c, 2b, and 3b). The findings from the second-stage quantitative study further illustrate and assess the proposed relationships between institutionalized rationales and institutional logics. The quantitative study also assesses the argued effects of institutional logics on teachers’ reported decisions to use instructional practices.</p>

<title>Quantitative Findings: The Rationalizing Logics of Public School Reform</title>
<p>If teachers’ rationales are related to institutional logics, as argued above in Propositions 1a, 1b, 2a, and 3a, then the survey items measuring the issues teachers raise about reform should be described by a single factor that reflects the relevant institutionalized rationale and its underlying logic. More specifically, items measuring teachers’ opinions about the issues of resource availability and effectiveness would be described by a single factor that indicates productivity logics. Items measuring teachers’ opinions about expert endorsement of practices would be described by a single factor that indicates technocratic logics. The items measuring teachers’ opinions of regulatory pressures would be described by a single factor that indicates participatory logics. The hypothesized factor structure for institutionalized rationales and logics is illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1558689812468792">Figure 3</xref>. The model that is the best fit for the data, given the results of the structural equation models and goodness-of-fit tests from the confirmatory factor analysis, is illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1558689812468792">Figure 4</xref>.</p>

</fig>
<p>The results of the confirmatory factor analysis of the model presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1558689812468792">Figure 4</xref> provide evidence for a three-factor structure representing institutional logics. However, in contrast to the proposed relationship between institutionalized rationales and institutional logics, the results of the confirmatory factor analysis suggest that the relevant logics guiding teachers’ rationales for practices are participatory logics and productivity logics. However, the results also suggest there are two types of productivity logics: (a) productivity logics related to the means, methods, or process of production; and (b) productivity logics related to the ends or outcome of productivity. A series of goodness-of-fit measures suggest that the model illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1558689812468792">Figure 4</xref> is the best fit for the data (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1558689812468792">Browne &amp; Cudeck, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1558689812468792">Kenny, 2012</xref>)</p>
<p>For example, for Model 2, the RMSEA, which should be nonsignificant and less than .05, provides evidence of good model fit (RMSEA = .046; PCLOSE = .780). Compare this with the fit of Model 1 (RMSEA = .131; PCLOSE &lt; .001). Similarly, the PCFI for Model 2 is close to 1, suggesting a good fit (PCFI = .723), especially when compared with Model 1 (PCFI = .575). The TLI/NNFI is also close to 1, suggesting a good fit (TLI/NNFI = .960), especially compared with Model 1 (TLI/NNFI = .657). Finally, the Akaike information criterion (AIC) is substantially smaller in Model 2 (AIC = 212.8) than in Model 1 (AIC = 1153.92), which suggests Model 2 is a comparatively better fit for the data.</p>
<p>Thus, the findings from the confirmatory factor analysis provide partial support for Proposition 1a, which states that rationales about the availability of resources for prescribed practices reflect productivity logics. Specifically, rationales about resource availability appear to reflect productivity logics related to the means or methods of production since items related to training (β = .66, <italic>p</italic>≤ .001), materials (β = .63, <italic>p</italic>≤ .001) and administrative support (β = .68, <italic>p</italic>≤ .001) are related to a single factor. Items related to improving the school (β = .67, <italic>p</italic>≤ .001) as well as increasing test scores (β = .75, <italic>p</italic>≤ .001) and student learning (β = .85, <italic>p</italic>≤ .001) are related to a single factor that appears to reflect productivity logic related to the ends or outcome of productivity. Thus, there is partial support for Proposition 1b. The item measuring teachers’ opinions that practices match their existing knowledge is also related to the ends of productivity logics (β = .72, <italic>p</italic>≤ .001) and not to technocratic logics, as proposed.</p>
<p>In fact, the results of Model 2 provide no support for teachers’ reliance on technocratic logics since the item measuring peer enforcement is related to participatory logics (β = .54, <italic>p</italic>≤ .001). The item for other schools using practices had an indeterminate loading, which resulted in nonunique solutions for the estimates and reduced model fit, so this item was removed from the model. Thus, Proposition 2a is rejected. However, there is strong support for Proposition 3a. In particular, the items related to regulatory mandates to use prescribed practices, including time pressure, managerial pressure, and state mandate are related to participatory logics (β = .47, <italic>p</italic>≤ .001; β = .78, <italic>p</italic>≤ .001; β = .57, <italic>p</italic>≤ .001, respectively).</p>
<p>Propositions 1c and 3b respectively asserted that when productivity logics and participatory logics are violated, teachers have lower reports of using prescribed practices. These propositions are tested with a series of maximum likelihood regression analysis for three predictive models. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-1558689812468792">Table 4</xref> provides descriptive statistics for the variables of interest. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-1558689812468792">Table 5</xref> provides results of the predictive models. The models treat productivity logics related to the ‘means’ of productivity and productivity logics related to the ‘ends’ of productivity as two separate logics. Note that Proposition 2b is not examined because there was no evidence for teachers’ reliance on technocratic logics.</p>
<p>The results of Model 1, the empty model, suggest that in the current study, demographic traits do not significantly affect teachers’ reported use of prescribed practices. Similarly, a preliminary multivariate regression analysis of the effects of demographic covariates on the three institutional logics provided no evidence for demographic traits influencing teachers’ perceptions that institutional logics are being violated. The results of Models 2 and 3 examine the effects of violated logics on teachers’ reported use of prescribed practices. Model 2 provides weak support for Proposition 1c, which asserted that the violation of productivity logics resulted in teachers’ lower reports of using prescribed practices. In particular, the effects for the violation of logics for the means of productivity are in the expected direction but are marginally significant (β = −.06, <italic>p</italic>≤ .1). The effects of logics for the ends of productivity are not significant. However, the results in Model 2 do not account for the potential effects of participatory logics on teachers’ reported use of practices, which is controlled for in Model 3.</p>
<p>Model 3 provides partial support for Proposition 1c and strong support for Proposition 3b. Specifically, when the competing effects of all logics are controlled, the violation of productivity logics related to the means of productivity has a significant negative effect on teachers’ reported use of prescribed practices (β = −.07, <italic>p</italic>≤ .05). Additionally, the violation of participatory logics has a significant negative effect on teachers’ reported use of prescribed practices (β = −.09, <italic>p</italic>≤ .01). The violation of productivity logics related to the ends of productivity has no significant effect on teachers’ reported use of practices.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The findings from the qualitative case study suggested that teachers invoke institutions to make meaning of reform and to rationalize their use of instructional practices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1558689812468792">Townley, 2002</xref>). The qualitative findings also suggested that teachers construct institutionalized rationales by drawing on the logics of four institutions: the professions, which provide technocratic logics for rationalizing practices; markets and bureaucracies, which provide productivity logics for rationalizing practices; and democracy, which provide participatory logics for rationalizing practices. The quantitative findings support the general pattern of findings from the qualitative study by confirming the role of institutions and logics in teachers’ instructional decisions. However, the quantitative findings also suggest a refinement in the qualitative study’s findings about which institutions and logics were most consequential.</p>
<p>Specifically, the quantitative findings suggested that both markets and bureaucracy play an important role in teachers’ instructional decisions. However, the two institutions provide empirically distinct productivity logics—one related to the ends or outcomes of productivity, the other related to the means or methods of productivity (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1558689812468792">Kalberg, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1558689812468792">M. Weber, 1921/1968</xref>). Furthermore, only logics for the means of productivity, which are associated with bureaucracy, have a significant effect on teachers’ reported use of instructional practice. The qualitative findings also suggest that the logics of the professions were important to teachers’ instructional decisions. However, the rationales one might expect to be consistent with the logics of the professions, such as colleagues using practices and practices matching with existing knowledge, were more strongly associated with the logics of democracy and markets.</p>
<p>One important question to ask about the findings is why some institutions and logics appear to be more prevalent and impactful in teachers’ instructional decisions than others. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1558689812468792">Russell’s (2010)</xref> study of kindergarten education suggests that logics associated with the family would play an important role in school contexts. Similarly, researchers such as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1558689812468792">Ravitch (1983)</xref> have described the critical role that the teaching profession plays in school reform. Thus, one might expect the logics of the professions to be more prominent in the current work. However, because teachers in the current study have students who are older than kindergarteners, a focus on nurturing and development associated with the logics of the family may be less important. Alternatively, market and bureaucratic logics may now be so widely accepted that logics associated with the family are nearly absent in current school contexts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1558689812468792">Ravitch, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>With respect to the role of professions, it may be the case that the logics of the profession were inadequately operationalized in the current research, which is a limitation of the study: in particular, the wording of the survey item asked teachers to report whether practices matched their “existing knowledge about good instruction.” This wording may have conflated indicators of effectiveness (e.g., good instruction) with indicators of expert endorsement (e.g., existing knowledge of instruction). However, it may also be the case that the logics of professions are inextricably intertwined with other logics that one would expect to see in formal organizations— namely, the logics of bureaucracy and markets. In other words, concerns about productivity—both means and ends—may be as much concerns of the profession as they are of bureaucracy and increasingly efficiency driven school organizations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1558689812468792">Ravitch, 2010</xref>). Meanwhile, for teachers, practices being used in other schools or being enforced by peers may be an indicator of increasing state encroachment rather than the diffusion of professional best practices.</p>
<p>Finally, it may be surprising that productivity logics related to ends or outcomes have no significant effect on teachers’ reported use of prescribed practices. One explanation for the lack of findings may be that teachers vary too greatly in their opinions about the effectiveness of state prescribed practices. Consequently, productivity logics related to producing specific ends or outcomes have a limited effect. Alternatively, productivity logics related to ends or outcomes might also be considered “performance logics,” associated with markets. Thus, the lack of effects for such logics may reflect teachers’ reticence to place market-driven student performance above other equally important schooling experiences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1558689812468792">Ravitch, 2010</xref>).</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>The current work began with an interest in how phenomena at the macro level of analysis, such as cultural institutions, translate to phenomena at the micro level of analysis, such as understandings and actions of individuals inside organizations. A central premise of the research was that mixed methods research offers a uniquely appropriate epistemological lens for examining this question because it combines the preferred empirical approach of macro and micro research. Indeed, the findings from the current mixed method study reveal how a combination of qualitative and quantitative methods can be used to illuminate and refine patterns in complex phenomena, such as the way individuals make meaning of culture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1558689812468792">Newman et al., 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>For example, a typical macro-analytic approach for understanding the role of institutions in school reform contexts may have focused on the way the cultural meanings of institutions provided teachers with understandings about appropriate practice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1558689812468792">Clegg &amp; Hardy, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1558689812468792">Russell, 2010</xref>). The main conclusion of this approach in the current study would suggest that teachers rely on to rationalize their instructional practices. A typical micro-analytic approach would focus on how teachers’ interpretations of reform motivated their classroom practices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1558689812468792">Clegg &amp; Hardy, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1558689812468792">van den Berg, 2002</xref>). The main conclusion of this approach in the current study would suggest that resource availability and regulatory pressure have the most influence on teachers’ reported use of instructional practices. However, the conclusions from a typically macro-analytic or micro-analytic approach are incomplete.</p>
<p>As the current work illustrates, a complete understanding of the role of institutions in school reform contexts and teachers’ motivations for instructional practices requires the integration of macro and micro approaches. In particular, although the current research has demonstrated that the logics of core cultural institutions do play an important role in instructional decisions, institutional logics may have more nuanced dimensions than one would otherwise expect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1558689812468792">Thornton &amp; Ocasio, 2008</xref>). Furthermore, all logics may not have an equal weight on instructional decisions. For example, the current work demonstrates that productivity logics associated with bureaucracy and markets are important to teachers’ interpretations of reform and decisions about practice. However, productivity logics appear to have at least two dimensions—one related to the means of production, the other to the ends or outcomes of production. Moreover, only productivity logics related to the means of production appear to influence teachers’ reported use of instructional practices.</p>
<p>Although the violation of logics for the means of productivity has a significant negative effect on teachers’ reported use of instructional practices, violations of participatory logics had a stronger effect. In other words, when teachers reported feeling too much pressure from peers, administrators, the state, and the pacing of implementation, they reported using prescribed practices <italic>less</italic> often. This is an important finding because it suggests that the kinds of education reforms intended to increase accountability may impose pressures that violate the participatory logics of democracy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1558689812468792">Poetter et al., 2006</xref>). As a result, overly stringent accountability reforms may, in fact, undermine their own aims by reducing teachers’ intention to use prescribed instructional practices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1558689812468792">Ravitch, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>Understanding the nuanced dynamics and impact of institutional logics helps provide better explanations of school reform. In particular, the current work suggests that teachers’ resistance to prescribed instructional practices, and the general intractability of school reform, may be rooted in underlying institutional pressures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1558689812468792">Payne, 2008</xref>). However, these pressures are not entirely imposed from outside the school. Consider, for example, that when institutional pressures are described as being important for school reform, the focus often is on the way in which symbolic versus substantive changes are driven by diffusion processes that result in school organizations becoming more and more similar (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1558689812468792">Meyer &amp; Rowan 1992</xref>). In other words, institutional dynamics are characterized as external factors or pressures that constrain organizational forms and practices from the outside. In contrast, the current work suggest that institutional pressures are not only imposed from the outside but also emerge from inside schools as teachers rely on the logics of institutions to rationalize and make decisions about the practices they will use in their classrooms. Consequently, teachers become agents who not only inhabit institutions but also continually enact the cultural institutions in which they are embedded (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1558689812468792">Hallett, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1558689812468792">K. Weber &amp; Glynn, 2006</xref>).</p>

<p>I focus on the issues teachers raise in response to reform because past work suggests that institutional logics are revealed by the issues that are most salient to organizational actors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1558689812468792">Thornton &amp; Ocasio, 1999</xref>). Furthermore, contentious issues require individuals to justify their positions and so would especially illuminate underlying beliefs and the way such beliefs draw on fundamental social arrangements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1558689812468792">Boltanski &amp; Thevenot, 1999</xref>).</p>

<p>One potential limitation of the current research is the assumption that identified factors reflect institutional logics. The subjective interpretation of factors is unavoidable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1558689812468792">Child, 2006</xref>). However, the validity of factors as measures of institutional logics is grounded in existing theory and in the way logics might manifest as issues about reform, given insights from the qualitative study.</p>

<p>Schools with the strongest performance and regulatory pressure were identified as being in the lowest quartile of performance on statewide standardized tests and subject to federal, state, and local education reforms (<italic>N</italic> = 19). Schools with typical performance and regulatory pressure were identified as being in the second and third quartile of performance on statewide standardized tests and regulated only by federal and local reform policies, which is the modal type of regulation and performance in the population (<italic>N</italic> = 258). Schools with the weakest performance and regulatory pressure were identified as being in the highest performance quartile, with a waiver from all reform initiatives (<italic>N</italic> = 63). Letters of invitation to participate in the study were sent to all the schools in the three strata. The first two schools responding to the invitation were selected, one of which was Turnaround Elementary. One school from the midlevel-performance, modal regulation strata withdrew from the study shortly before data collection, resulting in five remaining schools. Note: The total population of elementary schools is 718. The 378 schools not represented in the sample frame fall outside the criteria used to construct the strata. This includes schools in the highest performing quartile but subject to federal and local reform initiatives as well as schools in the middle two quartiles subject only to local reforms.</p>

<p>Attempts were made to minimize common methods bias arising from self-reported measures on both the independent and dependent variables. This was accomplished by designing the survey so that questions about teachers’ opinions of reform and use of practices were separated by two other sections in the survey, which were not related to instructional practices. The potential problem of common methods bias was also examined using Harman’s single-factor test to determine the extent to which items for the dependent and independent variable are described by a single factor or by one factor that accounts for the majority of variance in survey items. The results of the analysis do not provide strong evidence for common methods variance.</p>

<p>The convention for citing quotes uses “TA” to indicate Turnaround Elementary. This is followed by the respondent’s coded identifier number. The convention for citing observations from field notes uses “fn” for field notes, followed by the school abbreviation, and then a time, day, month, and year stamp approximated to the nearest hour. Thus, “fnTA.14.12.14.04” refers to field notes from Turnaround Elementary at 2 p.m. on December 14, 2004.</p>
