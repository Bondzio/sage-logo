<p>This work is a compelling read on the topic of policing and the control of social dissent specifically in the form of mass protest. It is an appropriate supplemental reader for a graduate class in policing or in a general course on the sociological study on social control. The work could serve as a central text in a seminar on social protest or organized social movements such as the recent <italic>Occupy Wall Street</italic> movement. It integrates a discussion of the policing tactics used to control large-scale social protests with a theoretical discourse on social control literature. The result is a disturbing treatise on the power of the state to control the expression of social protest.  The global success of police tactics to control, subvert, infiltrate, and ultimately disempower the process of political protest is a bit frightening to contemplate if one values free speech and the exercise of public demonstration.</p>
<p>The authors write from the perspective of participant–observers in the contemporary <italic>alterglobalization</italic> movement. Alterglobalization is a social movement that challenges postmodern capitalism in a transnational arena. Its ideological roots can be traced to postcolonial class struggles and organized labor movements. The movement operates in global space to challenge the hegemony of postmodern capitalism. Alterglobalization mass protests are inspired by the traditions of civil disobedience and direct action. Alterglobalization dissent and protest seek to disrupt the preconceived notions of class and incite the multitudes of the globe into a response to the constricting embrace of hegemonic capitalism. Some of the more visible manifestations of the alterglobalization movement are the mass protests at global capitalism events such as the G8, World Trade Organization (WTO), and G20 international meetings.</p>
<p>The work is written from the perspective of the authors’ personal observations and interviews with participants in protests to 20 global summits. Their earliest observed event was the WTO Summit in Seattle, 1999, and the latest was the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) summit meeting in Strasbourg, April 2009. The work combines personal insights, specific details from individual protests as exemplars of discussion points, a substantive review of the efficacy of police tactics, and a theoretical review of social control literature.  The authors are themselves from a diverse professional and global background. They integrate their perspectives well and the work flows in a readable and richly textured narrative.</p>
<p>A major point in the work is an analysis of the governance of space. Control of the space of protest includes events before, during, and after the protest; and in widening zones of control from the center of the protest. Within the construct of the space of protest, social control can be discussed in terms of political economy, the geography of control, and the use of violence at the scene.</p>
<p>What the authors have achieved is a successful application of the theoretical construct of space to the arena of dissent and law enforcement response. It is a classic juxtaposition of inductive learning from trial and error on the part of the police in their after-action debriefings and willingness to communicate and learn from other agencies’ policies, as explicated by the deductive application of social control theory from Foucault and others. The result is a more complete understanding of law enforcement tactics and protestor response prior to and at the actual scene of the protest.</p>
<p>While the authors are most decidedly in support of social dissent and protest, their discussion of police tactics leaves little doubt as to the success of those tactics. Law enforcement, in what has become an increasingly consistent global response, has learned from past practices and seems to now have a successful stratagem for controlling the space of alterglobalization protests. Law enforcement tactics increasingly control the scene of the protest with physical barriers and police violence; and, even more importantly in terms of a wider social audience, control the media images released from the protest which are used to portray the protesters as illogically violence-prone and, thus denigrate the message of the protest to the populous….</p>
<p>When one compares this coherent, well-funded state response to the adaptive, sometimes spontaneous, often individualistic actions of the dissent; one feels sorry for the protestors. The police now control the space of the protest both at the site of the conference itself and in the preliminary staging processes prior to the event. The authors paint a picture of dispirited and fragmented social protest organizations infiltrated by police undercover agents, whose e-mails and cell phone calls are monitored, and where any member is subject to police harassment, scrutiny, and possible arrest. The result is organizational paranoia, distrust between organizations, and miscommunication among members as they fear to speak out because of state monitoring. Perhaps, the most significant impact of state surveillance and police attention is the loss of donor funding and volunteers, as others outside the organization either view the organization as criminal, due to the police attention, or see the costs of participation and decide they are not up to committing that much effort to the cause.  </p>
<p>In conclusion, the authors urge the use of class action litigation to combat the insidious effects of the process of criminalizing social protest. Protestors must not be treated as violent insurrectionists and state control of protest should not be militarized. Democracy is based on public discourse. Intimidation of public protest by state authority is not congruent with the foundations of democracy. The courts may be the next space of protest for the alterglobalization movement.</p>
