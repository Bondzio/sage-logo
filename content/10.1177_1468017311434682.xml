<p>In recent decades the public welfare sector has been subjected to major structural changes. Cutbacks and a growing emphasis on cost efficiency as well as more process-oriented, decentralized ways of working have changed working conditions for employees. The restructuring of human service organizations into leaner organizations also appears to have brought increased work demands. Many employees in this sector perceive their situation as being characterized by high workload and insufficient resources to satisfactorily carry out the work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1468017311434682">Demerouti, Bakker, Nachreiner, &amp; Shaufeli, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1468017311434682">Hellgren, Näswall, Sverke, &amp; Söderfeldt, 2003</xref>). The workload has increased in terms of both the amount of work and the complexity of assigned work tasks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1468017311434682">Peeters &amp; Le Blanc, 2001</xref>). Several studies on the work conditions of various occupational groups within the public welfare sector have reported high and increased workload as well as decreased employee control (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1468017311434682">Härenstam &amp; MOA Research Group, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1468017311434682">Härenstam, Bejerot, Leijon, Schéele, &amp; Waldenström, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1468017311434682">Petterson, Hertting, Hagberg, &amp; Theorell, 2005</xref>). Available data also indicate a stable trend of a high prevalence of work-related stress among occupations in the public welfare sector (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1468017311434682">European Agency for Safety and Health at Work, 2009</xref>). Social work stands out as a particular exposed occupational group among human service professions. In a comparison with other human service professions, social workers and especially child welfare social workers report higher workload and more difficult demands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1468017311434682">Tham &amp; Meagher, 2008</xref>). Several studies of work conditions in social work have found that this group experience high workload as one of the main sources of stress at work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1468017311434682">Balloch, Pahl, &amp; McLean, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1468017311434682">Coffey, Dugdill, &amp; Tattersall, 2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1468017311434682">2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1468017311434682">Collings &amp; Murray, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1468017311434682">Huxley et al., 2005</xref>) and high work demands seems to be associated with depression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1468017311434682">Stanley, Manthorpe, &amp; White, 2007</xref>). Insufficient resources leading to unmanageable workload have also been found to be an important reason to why people leave their occupation in social services (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1468017311434682">Audit Commission, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1468017311434682">Healy, Meagher, &amp; Cullin, 2009</xref>). In Sweden, as in many other countries, problems with recruitment as well as retention of social workers have been reported. In a Swedish study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1468017311434682">Tham, 2007</xref>) of child welfare social workers it was found that although 54 percent of the sample had been at their current workplace for two years or less, 48 percent intended to leave their jobs. The most important reason for intending to leave was however not high workload, but lack of human resource orientation in the organization, that is, the extent to which employees were rewarded for a job well done, felt taken care of and where the management was interested in their health and well-being.</p>
<p>Another general trend in human service work and in modern working life in general, concerns the deregulation and decentralization of responsibility, demanding a greater independence and self-regulation from employees (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1468017311434682">Allvin, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1468017311434682">Hellgren, Sverke, &amp; Näswall, 2008</xref>). This increased individual responsibility for work, combined with high workload and insufficient resources, brings employees’ coping strategies to the fore in understanding stress and employee health in human service work.</p>
<p>In this article, the aim is to identify different patterns of coping strategies adopted by human service workers for managing the imbalance between work demands and resources, and then to investigate what impact these coping strategy patterns have on outcomes in employee health and service quality. The hypothesis tested in this study is that people confronted with situations of imbalance between demands and resources develop different, more or less beneficial and constructive ways to cope with these situations, and depending on what kind of strategies they adopt, their health and the service quality of their work is affected in a positive or negative way. In order to investigate this, the first objective of the study was to identify patterns of coping strategies connected to excessive work demands, and second, to distinguish differences between these coping clusters (regarding background characteristics, working conditions, health and perceived service quality). Third, we analyze the impact of these coping strategy clusters in relation to the work conditions with regard to outcomes in health and perceived service quality.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec2-1468017311434682"><title>Coping strategies</title>
<p>Contemporary coping research related to job stress draws to a large extent on the contextual and cognitive approach presented by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1468017311434682">Lazarus (1966)</xref>. His approach set a new course in including thoughts and behaviors that people use to manage demands that are appraised as stressful, and also addressing the problems causing the distress. Several researchers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1468017311434682">Mickelson, Lyons, Sullivan, &amp; Coyne, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1468017311434682">Peiró, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1468017311434682">Pienaar, 2008</xref>) have pointed out that the models used to understand relevant phenomena at work, concerning coping, stress and employee health, need to be enlarged and redefined. A main critique concerns the individualistic perspective that has focused on the individual’s appraisal of stress, isolated from its social context (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1468017311434682">Hobfoll, Dunahoo, Ben-Porath, &amp; Monnier, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1468017311434682">Länsisalm, Peiró, &amp; Kivimäki, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1468017311434682">Newton, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1468017311434682">Mickelson et al., 2001</xref>). Accordingly, one of the emerging research fields being emphasized presently, is the development and use of more socially contextualized theoretical models and approaches that move beyond simplistic models not acknowledging the differences between the contexts in which coping takes place.</p>
<p>Another issue that is emphasized in the ongoing coping debate is how to bridge the gap between coping research and practice, how to find models and methodologies that allows us to make practical use of the extensive amount of coping research that are carried out. Several researchers argue the need for using alternative approaches as a complement to traditional methods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1468017311434682">Dewe &amp; Trenberth, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1468017311434682">Lazarus, 2000</xref>). According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1468017311434682">Dewe and Trenberth (2004)</xref> coping research need to make better use of transactional theories of stress and coping linking the individual to the environment, and to adopt measurement methods that are more ecologically sensitive, person- and meaning-centered and narrative in application.</p>
<p>We believe that a good understanding of the coping process and the factors relevant to this process is crucial for interventions such as risk analysis and prevention as well as the promotion of employee health and organizational performance. With this follows a more contextualized approach, where the individual’s appraisal of stress is linked to its social context. The present study employed a socially contextualized approach in the sense that it was based on the stressors and means of coping relevant to the study population, consisting of human service workers within social work, child care and elderly care. The coping strategy measurements in the questionnaire, that this article is based on, derive from results from a comprehensive qualitative, narrative analysis of a sample of in-depth interviews conducted within the project. The qualitative part of the project included 59 individual interviews and nine group interviews with another 51 individuals. During the interviews, the respondents were asked to describe a number of situations at work that they perceived as difficult and stressful and were also given supplementary questions about how they dealt with each particular situation. The vast majority of respondents described stressful situations concerning different kinds of imbalance situations at work, such as periods of excessive workload and insufficient time or uncertainty about how to handle difficult problems. The results of the interviews were grouped, categorized and finally operationalized into a set of items regarding the respondents’ ways of coping with excessive workload (a more detailed description of the items is found under the headline ‘Method’).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec3-1468017311434682"><title>Work conditions and coping</title>
<p>In the present study, we used the Job Demands-Resource (JD-R) model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1468017311434682">Bakker &amp; Demerouti, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1468017311434682">Demerouti et al., 2001</xref>) to investigate demands and resources, adding also the impact of different coping strategies (on outcomes in health and service quality) adopted by individuals to manage the imbalance between resources and work demands. The JD-R model incorporates specific (contextualized) risk factors as well as addresses general work related problems associated with the imbalance between work demands and resources. The JD-R model is consistent with the demand-control model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1468017311434682">Karasek &amp; Theorell, 1990</xref>) in proposing that job resources may buffer the impact of job demands on job strain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1468017311434682">Bakker, Demerouti, Taris, Schaufeli, &amp; Schreurs, 2003</xref>), but expands this model by claiming that several different job resources can act as a buffer for several different job demands. The risk factors are classified into two general categories: job demands and job resources. Job demands refer to those physical, psychological, social or organizational aspects of the job, requiring sustained physical and/or psychological effort or skills and therefore being associated with certain physiological and/or psychological costs. Job resources refer to those physical, psychological, social or organizational aspects of the job that are either functional in achieving work goals and reducing job demands (as well as the associated physiological and psychological costs), or stimulating personal growth, learning and development.</p>
<p>Based on the definition offered by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1468017311434682">Lazarus and Folkman (1984)</xref>, coping, in this study, is defined as constantly changing cognitive and behavioral efforts to manage the internal and external demands of transactions that strain or exceed a person’s resources. The aim of the present study was to identify different <italic>patterns</italic> of coping strategies adopted by human service workers to manage the imbalance between work demands and resources. This pattern approach is in line with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1468017311434682">Lazarus (1999)</xref>, stating that coping strategies should never be thought of in either/or terms, but as a complex of interconnected thoughts and actions. The intention of the coping strategy measure in the present study was to capture coping behavior in relation to relevant and important stressors in the specific context of the studied groups and at the same time add to a broader, generalized understanding of the dimensions of coping, significant to human service work. Using the JD-R model allowed incorporation of specific risk factors in the study population and at the same time addressing general work related problems associated with the imbalance between work demands and resources that is a wide spread problem in human service work.</p>

<sec id="sec4-1468017311434682" sec-type="methods"><title>Method</title>
<sec id="sec5-1468017311434682"><title>Data collection and sample characteristics</title>
<p>The participants were employees in the public welfare sector taking part in a larger project that included nine case studies concerning strategies for health and service quality. Data for the present study were collected during the period spring to autumn 2008 by means of a questionnaire to the total staff (<italic>n</italic> = 247) at the nine workplaces; three workplaces within home care work, three within social work and three within child care work. Participation was voluntary but encouraged by the employers. Completed questionnaires were received from 195 (79%) employees after three reminders. Of these, 192 persons had completed all questions concerning strategies and this material was used for cluster analysis of coping strategies. The majority of the participants were females (91%) and the mean age was 46.7 years (SD = 11.0). Home care workers entailed 35.6 percent of the participants, 38.2 percent were social workers and 26.2 percent were child care workers.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec6-1468017311434682"><title>Measures</title>
<p>The questionnaire was designed to capture demographic characteristics, such as age, sex and information about employment characteristics (permanent/temporary, type of work and occupational tenure, full-time/part-time employment), working part-time because full-time is perceived as too demanding (yes/no), days on sick leave (none or less than one week/one week or more), occasions of sick leave (none or one to three times/four times or more), vacation instead of sick leave (never/one time or more) and sickness presence (never or once/two times or more). The questionnaire also included measures of health behavior such as smoking (yes/no), exercise (never or a few days per month/once a week or more) and physical activity (never or a few days per month/once a week or more).</p>
<p>Finally, the questionnaire also measured experiences of the working conditions, strategies to cope with excessive work demands and difficulties in work, perceived service quality and health. A detailed account for these variables is presented below.</p>
<sec id="sec7-1468017311434682"><title>Strategies</title>
<p>Coping strategies were assessed by 13 items regarding the respondents’ ways of handling excessive workload and difficulties at work. The items were constructed based on the results from an extensive qualitative analysis of 59 individual in-depth interviews, relatively evenly distributed among the nine workplaces, and nine group interviews with another 51 individuals. In the interviews the respondents were asked to describe a number of situations in work that they perceived as difficult and stressful, supplemented with questions about how they dealt with each particular situation. As already mentioned, the vast majority of respondents described stressful situations concerning different kinds of imbalance situations in work, such as periods of excessive workload and insufficient time or uncertainty about how to handle difficult problems. The content of the interviews were initially grouped in different categories regarding strategies to cope with excessive workload, work conditions, health and service quality. After further groupings within each category, several distinct themes emerged. Regarding coping strategies, the themes that were identified included giving voice, seeking support, using compensatory efforts and trying in different ways to reduce work demands. Each of these themes, in turn, comprised several sub-themes that in the next step were operationalized into a set of items regarding the respondents’ ways of handling excessive workload. To increase validity, all groupings and categorizations were carried out by two persons independent of each other. In total, 13 items were constructed for the questionnaire. Examples of items were ‘In order to complete my job I skip lunch and breaks’, ‘I voice my dissatisfaction about problems at work’, ‘I ask colleges for help when workload is high’ and ‘I lower the demands for quality in order to manage the work tasks to be done’. All strategies were assessed using scales ranging from 1 (very seldom/never) to 5 (very often/always). The qualitative analysis of the interviews revealed that respondents often tended to use several types of strategies. Therefore, a cluster analysis was applied to identify patterns of coping strategies among the respondents. For the predictive analysis of effects of strategy profiles on health and service quality, two categorical dummy variables were constructed following recommended procedures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1468017311434682">Aiken &amp; West, 1991</xref>). Compensatory and quality reducing strategies (1 = compensatory and quality reducing cluster, 0 = others) self-supporting strategies (1 = self-supporting cluster, 0 = others), with the voice and support seeking cluster as the comparison group.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec8-1468017311434682"><title>Work conditions</title>
<p>A principal component analysis with varimax rotation of items measuring work demands and resources indentified three factors: <italic>complex work demands</italic>, <italic>social support</italic> and <italic>control of resources and demands</italic>. The items primarily originate from the QPS Nordic questionnaire (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1468017311434682">Dallner et al., 2000</xref>) but also from the Swedish Work Environment Survey (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1468017311434682">Arbetsmiljöverket, 2008</xref>). All items were assessed using scales ranging from 1 (very seldom/never) to 5 (very often/always). A mean value index of six items was constructed to measure <italic>demands</italic>, covering <italic>complex work demands</italic>, and two indexes to measure <italic>resources,</italic> consisting of a mean value of three items for <italic>social support</italic> and a mean value of two items for <italic>control of resources and demands</italic>. Originally, 17 items were included in the principal component analysis, but six of the items were discarded from the final analysis because of double loading or not loading highly on either factor. All items with factor loadings are accounted for in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1468017311434682">Table 1</xref>.

<sec id="sec9-1468017311434682"><title>Health indicators</title>
<p>The present study includes three different indicators of health. First, a shortened version of the recuperation-scale was used (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1468017311434682">Aronsson, Svensson, &amp; Gustafsson, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1468017311434682">Gustafsson, Lindfors, Lundberg, &amp; Aronsson, 2006</xref>). In the present study, the index measuring lack of recuperation and fatigue was used, including six of the eight items that measure mental fatigue and recuperation only. The internal consistency (Cronbach’s α) of the original scale varied from .85 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1468017311434682">Gustafsson et al., 2006</xref>) to .84 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1468017311434682">von Thiele, Lindfors, &amp; Lundberg, 2006</xref>). The Cronbach’s α for the shortened version of the recuperation scale in the present study was .86. Second, a single item was used to measure work related sleeping problems: ‘Have you during the last three months had difficulties sleeping due to thoughts of work?’ Recuperation and work related sleeping problems were assessed using scales ranging from 1 (very seldom/never) to 5 (very often/always). Third, stress related symptoms were measured using an index (α = .90) assessing a number of psychological symptoms, that is, irritability and worry, symptoms most commonly reported by women and men in population-based studies and used in a Swedish longitudinal cohort study (SLOSH), focusing on the relation between work organization, work conditions and well being (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1468017311434682">Kinsten et al., 2006</xref>). The scale measured symptoms during the last three months with responses ranging from 1 (never) to 5 (every day).</p>

<sec id="sec10-1468017311434682"><title>Service quality</title>
<p>A mean value index of four items was constructed to measure subjective service quality. The items were the following: ‘Do you think your work group accomplishes a good quality for your clients?’ ‘Do you think that your clients are satisfied with the quality they receive?’ ‘Do you feel proud of the work that you and your colleges accomplish?’ ‘Are you satisfied with the quality of your own work?’ Cronbach’s α for the index was .83. The responses ranged from 1 (very seldom/never) to 5 (very often/always).</p>

<sec id="sec11-1468017311434682"><title>Statistical analyses</title>
<p>The first objective of this study, to identify different patterns of coping strategies, was addressed using cluster analysis. The Quick cluster procedure in SPSS (Version 16.0) was used to perform a cluster analysis of the 13 items in the coping strategy measure. A K-means cluster analysis identifies homogeneous groups of cases based on selected characteristics; in this case the strategy items, using an algorithm based on nearest centroid sorting. This means that a case is assigned to the cluster with the smallest distance between the cluster centroid and the case (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1468017311434682">Aldenderfer &amp; Blashfield, 1991</xref>). K-means cluster analyses require specification of the number of clusters. Based on results from the qualitative analysis of the interviews, a three-cluster solution was assumed. Additionally, cluster solutions with two, four and five clusters were calculated. However, the three cluster solution generated the most homogenous profiles. Furthermore, a residual analysis (Stem-and-Leaf and Boxplot) was used to detect outliers, resulting in one extreme case (≥5.0) being omitted from further analysis.</p>
<p>In order to compare differences between the three strategy profiles a Univariate analysis of variance (ANOVA) was performed on background characteristics, work conditions, health indicators and perceived service quality. <italic>F</italic>-tests and Sheffé post hoc tests were furthermore performed. For variables assessed as categorical variables, a χ<sup>2</sup> test was used.</p>
<p>For the predictive analysis of effects of working conditions and strategy profiles on health and perceived service quality, a hierarchical regression analysis was performed on each of the dependent variables. The data were screened for outliers, multicollinearity and tolerance levels to ensure that the requirements for multiple regressions were met.</p>
<p>In each of the performed regressions, individual background variables (age and occupational tenure) were first entered into the model to control for their effect on the dependent variables. In the second step, <italic>complex work demands, social support</italic> and <italic>control of resources and demands</italic> were included in the model in order to investigate whether differences in these working conditions explained variances in health and service quality while controlling for age and occupational tenure. In step three, strategies were added to the model in order to test whether strategies had any additional significant effect on the outcome variables.</p>

<p>The cluster analysis resulted in three clusters. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1468017311434682">Figure 1</xref> describes the patterns of the three cluster profiles in terms of their mean values of the items in the strategy measure. Mean values for all items included in the strategy measure differed significantly between the three clusters. The three strategy profiles were: <italic>compensatory and quality reducing</italic>, <italic>self-supporting</italic> and <italic>voice and support seeking</italic>. The compensatory and quality reducing cluster consisted of 68 persons and was characterized by an extensive use of compensatory strategies. They included: working more intensively, skipping lunches and other breaks, bringing work home on leisure time and taking on more work than they had time for. Individuals in this cluster also tended to think about work during their leisure time. All these compensatory strategies were significantly more common in this cluster profile compared to the other two. In addition to these typically compensatory strategies, they also lowered their demands for quality and asked supervisors to prioritize among the work tasks significantly more often than the two other profile groups.
<fig id="fig1-1468017311434682" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p>Mean value of strategy items for three clusters with distinct stragegy profiles.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1468017311434682-fig1.tif"/>
</fig></p>
<p>The voice and support seeking cluster consisted of 80 persons and was – rather than using compensatory strategies – characterized by giving voice and more proactively asking others for help. These strategies involved seeking support from colleagues when facing difficulties at work and also asking colleagues for help when workload was high. Individuals in the voice and support seeking cluster were also seeking help from supervisors to prioritize among work tasks, objecting when the workload was too excessive and giving voice to dissatisfaction as well as actively trying to find solutions to problems in the work group.</p>
<p>The self-supporting cluster consisted of 43 persons and was characterized by using fewer coping strategies than the other two cluster profiles. The individuals in this cluster did not use compensatory strategies very often, except for working more intensively and thinking about work during leisure time (significantly more often than the individuals in the voice and support seeking cluster but significantly less often than the individuals in the compensatory and quality reducing cluster). Moreover, they did not prioritize among work tasks or reduced the quality. The label <italic>self-supporting</italic> refers to this strategy profile’s tendency not to ask colleagues or supervisors for support, help or to prioritize. In addition, they did not voice dissatisfaction or object to excessive work demands.</p>
<p>Comparing demographic factors, there was no significant difference between cluster groups regarding age (<italic>F</italic>(2, 188) = .557, <italic>p</italic> = .574), gender (χ<sup>2</sup>(2) = 1.390, <italic>p</italic> = .499) or type of employment (χ<sup>2</sup>(2) = 1.870, <italic>p</italic> = .393) (permanent/temporary). Almost half of the self-supporting cluster comprised part-time workers (48.8%), compared with one third of the voice and support seeking cluster (31.2%) and only one fifth of the compensatory and quality reducing cluster (22.1%) (χ<sup>2</sup>(2) = 8.720, <italic>p</italic> = .013). Among those working part-time, around 50–60 percent of the three clusters did so because full-time was perceived as too demanding (χ<sup>2</sup>(2) = .480, <italic>p</italic> = .787).</p>
<p>The individuals in the compensatory and quality reducing cluster had significantly fewer years of experience in the occupation than those in the voice and support seeking cluster (compensatory and quality reducing cluster mean = 12.4 years, SD = 9.1 years; voice and support seeking cluster mean = 17.9 years, SD = 10.8 years; self-supporting cluster mean = 13.4 years, SD = 11.5 years) (<italic>F</italic>(2, 189) = 5.565, <italic>p</italic> = .004]. A greater proportion of the compensatory and quality reducing cluster members was employed in the social services (63.2%), whereas the self-supporting cluster included a greater proportion of home care workers (60.5%) and the voice and support seeking cluster included a higher proportion of child care workers (41.2%) (χ<sup>2</sup>(4) = 40,328, <italic>p</italic> = .000).</p>
<p>Regarding the number of days (χ<sup>2</sup> (2) = .473, <italic>p</italic> = .789) and occasions (χ<sup>2</sup> (2) = 4.114, <italic>p</italic> = .128) on sick leave, there were no significant differences between the cluster groups. However, a greater proportion of the individuals in the compensatory and quality reducing cluster tended to work despite sickness (64.7%) compared to the voice and support seeking cluster (32.9%) and self-supporting cluster (46.5%) [χ<sup>2</sup>(2) = 14.834, <italic>p</italic> = .001]. The compensatory and quality reducing cluster further differed from the other two cluster groups in taking vacation instead of sick leave; 41.2 percent of these individuals had taken vacation instead of sick leave more than once, compared to 18.2 percent of the self-supporting cluster and 20.3 percent of the voice and support seeking cluster (χ<sup>2</sup> (2) = 10.196, <italic>p</italic> = .006).</p>
<p>Concerning health behaviors, there were no significant differences between the cluster groups regarding physical activity (χ<sup>2</sup> (2) = 1.880, <italic>p</italic> = .391], exercise (χ<sup>2</sup> (2) = .313, <italic>p</italic> = .855) or smoking (χ<sup>2</sup> (2) = 3.610, <italic>p</italic> = .164). More than half of the full sample (51.4%) exercised a couple of times a week, 76.8 percent were doing some kind of physical activity a couple of times a week and three-quarters (75.3%) of the full sample were non-smokers.</p>

The <italic>F</italic>-tests revealed significant differences for all job conditions, while the Sheffé post hoc tests showed that the level of complex work demands differed between all three clusters with the highest level in the compensatory and quality reducing cluster and the lowest in the self-supporting cluster. The post hoc tests also revealed that the compensatory and quality reducing cluster had lower levels regarding control of recourses and demands than both the self-supporting and voice and support seeking cluster. The compensatory and quality reducing cluster also expressed lower levels of social support than the voice and support seeking cluster.

<p>Furthermore, the <italic>F</italic>-tests displayed significant differences regarding health, that is, lack of recuperation/tiredness, stress related symptoms and sleeping difficulties due to work. The Sheffé post hoc tests uncovered that individuals in the compensatory and quality reducing cluster had sleeping problems, stress related symptoms as well as experienced tiredness/lack of recuperation significantly more often than individuals belonging to both the self-supporting and voice and support seeking cluster. Finally, the <italic>F</italic>-tests also disclosed significant overall differences regarding service quality. The post hoc tests unveiled that individuals belonging to the compensatory and quality reducing cluster were less satisfied with quality than individuals in both the self-supporting and the voice and support seeking cluster.</p>

The second step, in which the working conditions were added, demonstrated a rather large increase in explained variance (<italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> change = .22, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001). Complex work demands were positively related and social support were negatively associated with lack of recuperation. In step three, the coping strategies were added (with the voice and support seeking cluster as the comparison group), significantly increasing the overall explained variance of the model (<italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> change = .04, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01). Those in the compensatory and quality reducing cluster, experienced lack of recuperation significantly more often, compared to those in the voice and support seeking and the self-supporting cluster. Regarding stress related symptoms, background characteristics in step one exhibited a significant association (<italic>R</italic><sup>2 </sup>= .06, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01), but none of the separate background characteristics reached significance. With the background characteristics being held constant, there was a significant increase in the explained variance when job conditions were added in step two (<italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> change = .15, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001). Social support was negatively correlated to stress related symptoms. In step three, strategies significantly increased the explained variance (<italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> change = .02, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05). Again, the compensatory and quality reducing cluster reported stress related symptoms significantly more often than the voice and support seeking cluster as well as the self-supporting cluster.

<sec id="sec15-1468017311434682" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title>
<p>The intention with the coping strategy measures was to investigate coping behavior in relation to relevant and important stressors in the specific context of the studied groups. The approach adopted in this study, that is, identifying and comparing homogenous patterns of coping strategies rather than studying coping as single variables or factors, was based on previous research stating that coping strategies never should be thought of in either/or terms, but as a complex of interconnected thoughts and actions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1468017311434682">Lazarus, 1999</xref>). The use of cluster analysis was furthermore justified by the results of the qualitative analysis of the interviews, revealing that respondents often tended to use several types of strategies. Analysis of the linear association between single variables, such as comparisons between emotion-focused versus problem-focused coping and different outcome variables has been widely endorsed in coping research. However, questions still remain about possible consequences of different patterns of strategies on the outcome variables. There is also a psychometric issue related to this, which concerns the presumption that the factors in a (multifactorial) coping scale should be independent of one another. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1468017311434682">Folkman and Moskowitz (2004)</xref> point out that distinct kinds of coping (such as, for example, problem-focused versus meaning-focused coping) conceptually seem to be entwined, suggesting that these two forms of coping facilitate each other. Thus, using for example factor analysis and expecting that the coping factors should be uncorrelated may actually result in a reduction of the validity of the measure and also mask important differences <italic>within</italic> the categories. As described in the introduction, we are not using an established coping inventory or categorization for our coping strategy measure. In order to uncover coping strategies relevant to the studied population, the most appropriate solution rather seemed to be to start with the narrative approach, and from that point define items relevant for the quantitative measure.</p>
<p>In our study, we identify three coping strategy patterns connected to excessive work demands and difficulties at work, namely the <italic>compensatory and quality reducing</italic> cluster, the <italic>self-supporting</italic> cluster and the <italic>voice and support seeking</italic> cluster. The <italic>compensatory and quality reducing cluster</italic> was characterized by an extensive use of compensatory strategies, but also lowering the demands of quality. In contrast, the <italic>voice and support seeking cluster</italic> was characterized by giving voice and asking colleagues and supervisors for help and support. Instead of using compensatory strategies, they objected when the workload was to excessive, sought help to prioritize work tasks and actively tried to find solutions to problems in the work group. Finally, the <italic>self-supporting cluster</italic> was characterized by using few coping strategies and appeared self-supporting in their tendency not to ask colleagues or supervisors for support, help or to prioritize. Furthermore, they did not voice dissatisfaction or object to excessive work demands. At the same time, the use of compensatory strategies was limited to working more intensively and thinking about work during leisure time. Noticeable however, is that almost 50 percent of the persons in the self-supporting cluster worked part-time compared to a third in the voice and support seeking cluster and only one fifth in the compensatory and quality reducing cluster. As around 50–60 percent of those working part time did so because they perceived full-time work too demanding, one must also consider that the self-supporting cluster included individuals that were using part-time as a strategy to reduce their total workload, which may be an alternative for using strategies at work.</p>
<p>There are also interesting differences between the clusters regarding how they handled sickness and absence from work. The compensatory and quality reducing cluster distinguished from the other two in a negative way, by tending to work despite being sick and taking vacation instead of sick leave. Sickness presenteeism can also be conceived as a type of compensatory strategy. Previous studies have reported that working conditions increasing the probability of sickness presenteeism are: time pressure, insufficient resources to accomplish a good quality as well as the work not being done by someone else while the employee is on sick leave (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1468017311434682">Aronsson &amp; Gustafsson, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1468017311434682">Aronsson, Gustafsson, &amp; Dallner, 2002</xref>). Recent research shows that sickness presenteeism appears to be an independent risk factor in terms of future poor general health (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1468017311434682">Bergström et al., 2009a</xref>) as well as future sick leave (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1468017311434682">Bergström, Bodin, Hagberg, Aronsson, &amp; Josephson, 2009b</xref>). Despite these behavioral differences, there were no differences between the clusters in health behaviors such as physical activity, exercise or smoking.</p>
<p>The results of the comparative analyses indicates that the most interesting clusters from a health and quality perspective, is on the one hand the compensatory and quality reducing cluster as being a ‘risk group’, and on the other hand the voice and support seeking cluster that seems to have adopted more beneficial strategies. Overall, the compensatory and quality reducing cluster differed from the other two clusters, but also the voice and support seeking cluster singled out from one or both of the other cluster profiles in some aspects. One interesting aspect concerns number of years in the occupation, where the compensatory and quality reducing cluster had significantly fewer years in the occupation than the voice and support seeking cluster. With extended tenure, the possibility of establishing social relationships and developing more extensive networks also increase. In the present study, fewer years in the occupation of the compensatory and quality reducing cluster, may explain their overall more disadvantageous strategies.</p>
<p>Concerning the work conditions, the highest level of complex work demands was found in the compensatory and quality reducing cluster. In addition, the compensatory and quality reducing cluster had less control of resources and demands than the other two strategy clusters, and also reported less social support than the voice and support seeking cluster. Drawing on the JD-R model, an imbalance between job demands and resources may result in negative outcomes in health. As presented above, post hoc tests disclosed that the individuals in the compensatory and quality reducing cluster suffered from sleeping problems, stress related symptoms and experienced tiredness/lack of recuperation more often than the individuals in the other two coping clusters. According to the JD-R model, several different job resources may play the role of buffer to several different job demands. However, social support is probably the most well known situational variable found to have both a direct and buffering effect on job strain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1468017311434682">Viswesvaran, Sanches, &amp; Fisher, 1999</xref>). In our study, the voice and support seeking cluster reported the highest levels of social support.</p>
<p>The health consequences associated with compensatory strategies may also be analyzed within the cognitive-energetical framework of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1468017311434682">Hockey’s (1997)</xref> compensatory regulatory-control model. According to this model, employees under high workload face a compromise between the protection of their performance goals and the mental effort that has to be invested in order to accomplish these goals. When job demands increase, compensatory effort has to be mobilized to deal with the increased demands whilst maintaining performance levels. This additional compensatory effort is associated with physiological and psychological costs such as increased sympathetic activity. Continuous mobilization of compensatory effort drains the employee’s energy and might therefore lead to burnout and ill-health (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1468017311434682">Hockey, 1997</xref>). An alternative response to excessive work demands according to this model is to adopt strategies involving downwards adjustment of performance goals. Hockey’s model states that the regulation process of excessive work demands is intra-individual and does not include the option of for example using external resources such as help from colleagues in handling the workload, which in our study occurred within the voice and support seeking cluster. Nevertheless, in accordance with Hockey’s model, the individuals in the compensatory and quality reducing cluster obviously used compensatory efforts in order to achieve their work goals and consequently suffered from reduced health. But the response according to Hockey’s model, adopting strategies involving downwards adjustment of performance goals, was in our study used only <italic>in combination</italic> with the compensatory effort, not as an alternative. However, according to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1468017311434682">Hockey (1997)</xref> fatigue is a natural consequence of compensatory effort, but when it is associated with chronic stress fatigue may also reflect a baseline reduction in adaptive capacity. The sensitivity of fatigue to high work demands and most kinds of illness might according to Hockey indicate an adaptive role in shifting behavior towards less effortful strategies. The performance–cost trade-off depicted in the model, that is, the relationship between compensatory performance protection and increased sympathetic activity has been found in laboratory studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1468017311434682">Lundberg &amp; Frankenhauser, 1978</xref>) as well as field studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1468017311434682">Gustafsson, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1468017311434682">Rissler &amp; Elgerot, 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1468017311434682">Rissler &amp; Jacobson, 1987</xref>). Thus, based on previous research and theory, the relationship between coping patterns and various health indicators were in an expected direction, and strengthen the validity of the study.</p>
<sec id="sec16-1468017311434682"><title>Strategies in an organizational context</title>
<p>Comparisons between the identified coping clusters displayed differences in coping patterns between the three studied organizations. A greater proportion of the compensatory and quality reducing cluster were social workers, whereas the self-supporting cluster included a greater proportion of home care workers and the voice and support seeking cluster included a higher proportion of child care workers. Looking at these coping strategies in an organizational context, the differences appear coherent. For instance, the child care work in this study was organized in teams of three to four employees, attending to and having a mutual responsibility for a group of children. Communication and cooperation between team members were of vital importance to accomplish the work and to achieve quality. Home care work on the other hand, was to a very large extent based on individual performances. After a short meeting in the morning where tasks and clients were distributed in the group, the rest of the work day was spent without colleagues in the homes of the clients. The home care work consisted of a relatively small amount of time interacting with colleagues and supervisors in group meetings and similar activities. Thus, the possibilities for voice and support seeking strategies were limited. Finally, the social workers were organized in specialized teams and also had a number of different meetings with colleagues such as team meetings, team supervision, workplace meetings, etc. This kind of organization ought to give room for voice and social support strategies, but this was probably hampered by the extreme workload that characterized the work situation. When all team members are equally overloaded with work, the actual scope for voice and support seeking strategies may be perceived as minimal and the use of compensatory and quality reducing strategies therefore considered as the only alternative.</p>
<p>A greater proportion of the compensatory and quality reducing cluster members in this study were social workers and it was also in this cluster that the highest levels of complex work demands were found. These results are coherent with other empirical studies. Social work stands out as a particular exposed occupational group among human service professions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1468017311434682">Tham &amp; Meagher, 2008</xref>) and several studies of work conditions in social work have found that this group experience high workload (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1468017311434682">Balloch et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1468017311434682">Coffey et al., 2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1468017311434682">2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1468017311434682">Collings &amp; Murray, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1468017311434682">Huxley et al., 2005</xref>). In Sweden, social workers are one of the occupations with the largest proportion of stress-related disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1468017311434682">National Work Environment Authority &amp; Statistics Sweden, 2010</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec17-1468017311434682"><title>Predictions of health and quality</title>
<p>The third objective of the present study was to investigate whether the use of different strategies contributed to the prediction of employee health, in terms of stress related symptoms, tiredness/lack of recuperation and sleeping problems due to work as well as employees perception of service quality. The results confirm that strategies affected all health outcomes as well as perceived service quality. The use of compensatory and quality reducing strategies was without exception negatively related to health, even though known explanatory factors such as work demands and recourses as well as background characteristics were taken in to account. Limits of the study may be the cross-sectional design that possibly restricts causal interpretation as well as the risk of common method variance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1468017311434682">Podsakoff, McKenzie, Lee, &amp; Podsakoff, 2003</xref>). Self-reports collected by means of questionnaires are considered as appropriate measures to reflect individual perception of work conditions, coping strategies, well-being and perceived quality, but they carry the risk of common method variance, artificially inflating the association between the measured constructs. In order to reduce potential risks of common method variance, we followed recommendations for suitable questionnaire techniques such as anonymity, instructing participants that there is no right or wrong answers as well as changing the response format (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1468017311434682">Podsakoff et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1468017311434682">Spector, 2006</xref>). Nevertheless, future studies may benefit from employing different design strategies in order to further investigate the relationship of the variables presented here (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1468017311434682">Spector, 2006</xref>). The cross-sectional design in this study does not allow for any causal conclusions. However, the interpretation of a causal relationship between compensatory strategies and reduced health is theoretically and empirically supported by similar studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1468017311434682">Gustafsson, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1468017311434682">Hockey, 1997</xref>). For future research, a longitudinal design would indeed contribute to the understanding of how strategies contextually develop in a long-term perspective. It could, for example, be hypothesized, given no major contextual changes, that individuals maintain the more beneficial voice and support seeking strategies while individuals with compensatory and quality reducing strategies would change, since these strategies are not sustainable in the long run. As high turnover and retention of staff in social work is a significant international problem (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1468017311434682">Audit Commission, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1468017311434682">Glisson, Dukes, &amp; Green 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1468017311434682">Healy et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1468017311434682">Lidell, Donnegan, Goddard, &amp; Tucci, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1468017311434682">Tham, 2007</xref>), an interesting question concerns whether the direction of change for those with compensatory and quality reducing strategies would be either towards more beneficial strategies or towards exit strategies, such as turnover or long-term sick leave.</p>

</sec>
<sec id="sec18-1468017311434682"><title>Conclusions and practical implications</title>
<p>Summing up, the contextual approach applied in this study adds to coping theory by the identified compensatory and quality reducing strategies that are not described previously in the coping literature. In this article we have presented results that indicate that in order to promote good health and service quality, it is vital to consider the decentralized and deregulated work conditions that, in situations with an imbalance between demands and resources, enforce the individual to take on the responsibility for maintaining performance levels as well as being compelled to compromise the standards of quality. The results illustrate the risk that individuals start using compensatory efforts to deal with increased demands in trying to maintain performance levels, and when the compensatory efforts are not enough, the individual may also be compelled to make downward adjustments of the aspired level of service quality. Applied in practice, the identified strategy clusters might help detect and distinguish ‘risk behaviors’ from more beneficial strategies. If, for example, compensatory and quality reducing strategies are frequent in an organization, it might be an indicator that employees are pushing themselves too hard in order to fulfill perceived obligations and duties. In this way, interventions could be targeted to those in most need. The results also point toward the importance of providing work conditions and organizational structures that allow employees to voice their opinions and criticisms, as well as to collaborate and support each other. For future research, there is a need for more research dealing with interventions to find ways to create sustainable work environments that support employees in developing strategies that neither jeopardize their health nor impair service quality. There is also a challenge to expand the knowledge about the interplay between strategies and work environment factors that may restrict the individual’s scope of action.</p>
