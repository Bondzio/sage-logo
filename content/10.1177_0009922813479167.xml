<title>Case Presentation</title>
<p>The patient was a 24-day-old male infant who presented with periumbilical erythema and swelling. The umbilical cord detached at 18 days, 6 days prior to admission, following dry cord care. The mother and father noted excessive “flakiness” following detachment, which prompted them to apply alcohol with q-tips for the next 2 days. On day 3 postdetachment, they noted redness in the periumbilical region, which progressed over the next 3 days, extending out laterally and described by the mother as “bumpy and streaky.” There was no discharge noted by the parents.</p>
<p>The parents denied any other symptoms and reported that the child had been generally well. In particular, they denied any fever, fussiness, problems feeding, vomiting, or changes in urine output. The mother stated that he may have been somewhat more sleepy over this time and somewhat more “gassy.” There were no sick contacts or contact with skin irritants other than the rubbing alcohol.</p>
<p>The patient was born via spontaneous vaginal delivery that was completely uncomplicated. The mother was negative for Group B strep or other infectious agents and had no signs of infection such as fever or maternal or fetal tachycardia. Rupture of membranes occurred at 9 cm dilation. The placenta was noted to be normal. The patient was transferred to the neonatal ICU (NICU) for 6 hours after birth secondary to a depression in body temperature following his newborn bath. He rapidly returned to a normal temperature and was released from the NICU.</p>
<p>Prior to admission, the patient had a history of hyperbilirubinemia, reaching a concentration of 20.6 mg/dL at about 1 week of age. This resolved with the substitution of formula feedings for a 24-hour period, leading to a presumptive diagnosis of breast milk jaundice.</p>
<p>Physical exam revealed a well-developed, healthy, and active looking baby boy in no apparent distress. Vital signs were as follows: weight, 3.9 kg (31st percentile); length, 50.8 cm (8th percentile); head circumference, 38 cm (85th percentile); temperature, 97.9°F; heart rate, 145/min; respiratory rate, 32/min; and blood pressure, 94/46 mm Hg. There was periumbilical erythema extending more laterally than longitudinally (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0009922813479167">Figure 1</xref>). It was described initially as “streaking.” There was slight induration immediately around the umbilicus and only slight tenderness in that region. There was no drainage of the umbilicus on initial presentation, but a scab lateral to the umbilicus was removed, and some small clear drainage was noted. This was swabbed for Gram stain and culture. The rest of the physical exam was normal.</p>

<p>Laboratory assessment included a complete blood count, comprehensive metabolic profile, and C-reactive protein, all of which were within normal limits. A blood culture and urine culture were taken in the emergency department. A lumbar puncture was also attempted but was unsuccessful. No other investigations were ordered at this time.</p>

<title>Hospital Course</title>
<p>The patient was admitted to the hospital with a presumptive diagnosis of omphalitis. He was started on ceftriaxone and clindamycin for broad spectrum and MRSA coverage. On hospital day 1, the erythema was somewhat improved. The infectious disease service was consulted and concluded that the infection was funisitis rather than omphalitis, based on a lack of systemic symptoms and the normal appearance of the umbilical stump, thereby precluding the necessity for repeat lumbar puncture. On hospital day 2, the umbilical swab grew out <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic>, and on day 3, it was shown to be methicillin sensitive. The child was switched to oral cephalexin and discharged home.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>There are a number of presentations for infections of the umbilical region.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0009922813479167">1</xref></sup> These may range from superficial skin and skin structure infections, which can be managed with topical or oral therapy in the outpatient setting to infections that put the neonate at risk for septic umbilical arteritis, portal vein thrombosis, necrotizing fasciitis, and death.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0009922813479167">2</xref></sup> Because of this variability, it is important to carefully determine the nature of an infection when planning further management. Unfortunately, although the severity of the infection can generally be determined clinically, limitations of the nomenclature make reporting the severity of an umbilical infection confusing and may lead to misinterpretation, particularly with referrals.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0009922813479167">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>There are 2 diagnoses associated with umbilical and periumbilical infections: <italic>funisitis</italic> and <italic>omphalitis</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0009922813479167">3</xref></sup> Etymologically, the words refer to infection of the cord and the navel, respectively. In practice, there is some ambiguity in the use of these 2 terms. Various attempts have been made to clarify the nomenclature used for umbilical and periumbilical infections, but there does not appear to be a universally agreed on classification system.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0009922813479167">1</xref></sup> One of the consequences of this is that studies relating to incidence, management, and consequences of omphalitis and funisitis may be misleading, misinterpreted, or difficult to compare.</p>
<p>Funisitis may be defined as any infection limited to the umbilical cord.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0009922813479167">4</xref></sup> This definition has been used to discriminate between a benign infection of the neonate limited to the umbilicus and the more severe omphalitis, which involves surrounding structures.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0009922813479167">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0009922813479167">5</xref></sup> Confounding this definition of funisitis, however, is the application of the term to an earlier, intra-amniotic infection of the umbilicus—part of a continuum of chorioamnionitis indicating potentially adverse fetal outcomes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0009922813479167">6</xref></sup> A PubMed search of funisitis demonstrates that the overwhelming majority of articles relating to or directly addressing funisitis refer to this intra-amniotic presentation—with emphasis of research and management on prenatal screening and interventions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0009922813479167">7</xref></sup> Despite this predilection in research, certain texts continue to use the term <italic>funisitis</italic> to refer to both early, potentially significant umbilical inflammation and late, likely benign inflammation of the umbilicus.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0009922813479167">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0009922813479167">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0009922813479167">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0009922813479167">9</xref></sup> To avoid confusion, it may be best to reserve the term funisitis only for the earlier, intra-amniotic inflammation.</p>
<p>Because this narrows the definition of funisitis, it is necessary to use a somewhat broader definition of omphalitis—traditionally considered a serious neonatal infection necessitating full septic workup and aggressive management. By excluding the benign presentation of limited cord inflammation from the definition of funisitis, it is necessary to work this presentation into the definition of omphalitis without exaggerating the severity of infection. Some have used a descriptive approach to do so, breaking up infections into moist cord, “smelly” cord, uncertain omphalitis, true omphalitis, and complicated omphalitis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0009922813479167">2</xref></sup> Here, the first 2 are benign and would previously have fallen under the description of funisitis. Uncertain omphalitis is poorly defined, and management is left to the clinician’s judgment. When the infection includes erythema, edema, and tenderness of the tissues surrounding the cord, it would be identified as either true omphalitis or complicated omphalitis, depending on systemic involvement and other complications.</p>
<p>Another approach, used in one study of the incidence of omphalitis in Oman, is to divide it into 4 discrete entities based on presentation and severity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0009922813479167">10</xref></sup> A modified version of that classification system is presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0009922813479167">Table 1</xref>. The classes are listed in order of increasing severity, with funisitis listed as a distinct entity. Class I omphalitis is comparable to the benign cord conditions listed earlier and may be managed conservatively with local antimicrobials. Alcohol swabs alone are ineffective in preventing omphalitis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0009922813479167">11</xref></sup> Class II is defined by erythema of the surrounding tissue and is still a local inflammatory process. Class III includes either class I or class II with systemic involvement. Because early signs of sepsis can be subtle and nonspecific, the clinician should have a low threshold for advancing a class I or II infection to class III.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0009922813479167">5</xref></sup> Class IV infections include any presentation from class I to III with necrotizing fasciitis. Even with aggressive therapy, the mortality for class IV infections is high.</p>

<p>Omphalitis is often polymicrobial with predominant bacteria including <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic>, Group B <italic>Streptococcus</italic>, and Gram-negative rods.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0009922813479167">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0009922813479167">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0009922813479167">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0009922813479167">14</xref></sup> Classically, omphalitis was an infection of <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> and Group B <italic>Streptococcus</italic>, but with increasing use of antiseptic cord care, Gram-negative bacteria, particularly <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>, have become more common etiological agents.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0009922813479167">10</xref></sup> For all cases where antibiotics are necessary, broad coverage should be initiated, being narrowed as cultures and sensitivities are received.</p>
<p>Because of the range of infections that may be considered omphalitis, studies that report incidence or management approaches can be difficult to interpret. Therefore, applying a more robust classification system opens up the opportunity to better report on the management, incidence, and prognosis of umbilical infections. Potential topics of interest may include the management of class I infection with topical antimicrobials versus systemic antibiotics; clinical utility of blood, urine, and cerebrospinal fluid cultures in the infant with class II infection; frequency of complications such as portal vein thrombosis for each class; and rates of progression from class I or II infections to class III or IV infections. The management of these classes is based on recommendations from various sources that describe approaches based on similar presentations—no studies have been done matching a management approach to any given class of infection, necessitating individualized management by the responsible physician.</p>
<p>With the advent of aseptic delivery techniques and antimicrobial cord care, omphalitis is rare in the developed world, though the vague diagnostic criteria have made it difficult to assess.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0009922813479167">2</xref></sup> In developing countries, umbilical infections remain an important cause of neonatal disease and death.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0009922813479167">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0009922813479167">10</xref></sup> This disparity emphasizes the importance of aseptic technique and proper cord care. There remains controversy surrounding the use of dry cord care and antiseptics in developed countries, but the use of chlorhexidine or maternal health education and umbilical cord packs have been shown to significantly reduce rates of omphalitis in developing countries.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0009922813479167">14</xref></sup> In all settings, antiseptic agents reduce colonization, particularly of <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> and <italic>Streptococcus pyogenes</italic>, though there is less evidence in developed countries for the prevention of omphalitis because the incidence in these countries is already low. Agents that have been shown to effectively reduce colonization include triple dye, chlorhexidine, povidine-iodine, silver sulfadiazine, and Bacitracin.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0009922813479167">14</xref></sup></p>
