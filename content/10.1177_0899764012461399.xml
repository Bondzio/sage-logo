<abstract>
<p>Nonprofits theory on the role of organizational context focuses on generalizing principles such as neoinstitutionalism and institutional isomorphism. Organizational culture theory focuses on internal organizational culture, ignoring the larger community culture that influences nonprofit behavior. Relying on anthropological understandings of culture as comprising both the values and symbols of a community and its structures and practices, this article describes three support systems for faith-based nonprofits that come out of founding religious traditions. Using comparative case studies across 81 faith communities and FBOs in the United States, research suggests that systems are generalizable across religions and localities, but they come out of specific religious cultures adapted to fit the U.S. system.</p>

<p>The nonprofits literature on faith-based organizations (FBO) has focused primarily on independent organizations, seeing their supporting faith communities as a source of funding and in-kind resources like volunteers (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0899764012461399">Cnaan, Boddie, Handy, Yancey, &amp; Schneider, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0899764012461399">Ebaugh, Chafetz, &amp; Pipes, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0899764012461399">Grettenberger, 2001</xref>) or congregations as service providers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0899764012461399">Cnaan, Wineberg, &amp; Boddie, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0899764012461399">Littlefield, 2010</xref>). The faith base or religiosity of FBOs is usually presented as an independent variable that could influence service quality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0899764012461399">Amirkhanyan, Kim, &amp; Lambright, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0899764012461399">Kennedy &amp; Bielefeld, 2002</xref>) or encourage volunteering (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0899764012461399">Caputo, 2009</xref>). Recent nonprofits research suggests that policy should support FBOs as part of a service delivery network (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0899764012461399">Campbell, 2011</xref>), but this network approach appears focused on service delivery networks rather than FBO support systems.</p>
<p>Many of these studies acknowledge that policy makers and others view faith communities as different from secular support systems like geographic communities or networks of people interested in a particular cause. However, their focus on the tangible resources faith communities potentially provide to nonprofits implies that faith communities are interchangeable with any other type of support system. With a few exceptions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0899764012461399">Bane, Coffin, &amp; Higgins, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0899764012461399">Coleman, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0899764012461399">Demerath, Hall, Schmitt, &amp; Williams, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0899764012461399">Jeavons, 1994a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0899764012461399">2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0899764012461399">Koch &amp; Johnson, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0899764012461399">Milofsky, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0899764012461399">Schneider, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0899764012461399">Wittberg, 2006</xref>), the nonprofits literature has paid little attention to faith community culture in FBO resource development and governance.</p>
<p>This article suggests that ignoring faith community–specific culture and structures leads scholars to miss important aspects of support systems for FBOs. Faith-based organizations are created by faith communities or their members to address community needs in the context of the theology of justice and charity of that particular faith. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0899764012461399">Hall (1990</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0899764012461399">2005</xref>) observes, these initiatives can deliberately spread the philosophy of a particular religion even when organizations are secularized. Other scholars note that FBOs were created to provide services within a religious context and may maintain ties to their founding faith communities today (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0899764012461399">Bernstein, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0899764012461399">Cnaan et al., 1999</xref>; Cochran, 2001; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0899764012461399">Coleman, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0899764012461399">Jeavons, 1994a</xref>). Using findings from a multimethods ethnographic study of 81 faith communities and organizations in the mid-Atlantic (Philadelphia to Northern Virginia), Midwest (Chicago and Ohio), and South (South Carolina) conducted between 2008 and 2010,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0899764012461399">1</xref></sup> this article outlines a typology of support systems for FBOs that reflect the history and current attributes of founding religious communities. Study results found that support structures for religious-based nonprofit activities come from the practical theology of their founding religion, leading to the development of systems of stewardship based on religious values and practices. <italic>Practical theology</italic> refers to the formal and informal mechanisms a faith community uses to enact its theological teachings through its religious culture and structures.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0899764012461399">2</xref></sup> The research discovered that faith communities support organizations that continue to reflect their values and raise concerns about those that don’t. This finding suggests that nonprofits research would do well to pay more attention to the environment that supports nonprofit activity.</p>

<title>Theorizing the Community Context for Stewardship</title>
<p>Following <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0899764012461399">Milofsky (2008</xref>, p. 203), this article advocates broadening theories of the organizational environment to understand the relationship of FBOs to the communities in which they are embedded. Faith communities that support specific FBOs can take several forms. Usually, the supporting faith community includes people from a specific faith in a geographical area, but even locality-based faith communities reflect national and sometimes global theological discussions or denominational structures. Not all faith communities are geographical, however; some consist entirely of networks of individuals drawn to a particular project because it reflects their personal beliefs. Network support systems are often virtual and can include people across the globe.</p>
<p>The religious community environment includes the theology, cultural, and social capital of the supporting community, not simply an accounting of financial or in-kind resources provided to the organization or board appointments from the faith community. This community environment reflects the <italic>religious culture</italic> of a given locality. Following anthropological definitions of culture, religious culture includes both the symbols and beliefs of the community and its socioeconomic structures within a historical and global context. For example, recognizing growing factionalism among individual synagogues and evolving denominations, while simultaneously attempting to foster community among an increasingly secular Jewish community and socialize newly arrived Eastern European immigrants, U.S. Jews created the Federation system in the early 20th century as a locality-based support system for Jewish FBOs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0899764012461399">Bernstein, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0899764012461399">Elazar, 1995</xref>). Unique to the United States, Federations recognize Judaism as both a religion and ethnic group, serving as a neutral central planning and fundraising system for anyone who chooses to affiliate with this umbrella system. Although Federations face concerns about donor input and increased individualism today, they still remain powerful agents in shaping the Jewish communal response to social needs. Understanding the structures and belief systems of that supporting Jewish community is essential to analyzing support systems of any FBO affiliated with the Jewish community.</p>
<p>Like the Jews, the study found that each faith community relied on its religious culture in formulating systems to support their FBOs. Faith communities considered themselves stewards of their organizations in a broader biblical sense than a focus on provision of funds, in-kind support, and volunteers. Following <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0899764012461399">Jeavons (1994b)</xref>, we define <italic>stewardship</italic> as the overall administration and guidance of nonprofits by the founding or supporting faith community, based on its practical theology.</p>
<p>Much of the nonprofits literature on the FBO environment focuses on the impact of other nonprofits or key stakeholders like government (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0899764012461399">Kennedy &amp; Bielefeld, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0899764012461399">Monsma, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0899764012461399">Smith &amp; Lipsky, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0899764012461399">Wineburg, Coleman, Boddie, &amp; Cnaan, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0899764012461399">Wittberg, 2006</xref>), with key theories of neoinstitutionalism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0899764012461399">DiMaggio &amp; Powell, 1991</xref>) and institutional isomorphism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0899764012461399">DiMaggio &amp; Powell, 1988</xref>) highlighting ways that community and funder expectations encourage conformity among nonprofits. These theories posit that organizations become increasingly like each other because they respond to powerful forces like government regulations or funder expectations that shape the ways that organizations operate. Organizational isomorphism also suggests that nonprofits resemble each other because they copy best practices from their peers. Our findings reveal that neoinstitutionalism can explain stewardship strategies to a certain degree but that isomorphizing elements come out of religious culture as much as society-wide structures. We found three distinct systems for providing guidance and support for FBOs. Each of these systems comes out of the practical theology and standard practices of that religion, not generalized rationalizing dynamics. As with theories of institutional isomorphism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0899764012461399">DiMaggio &amp; Powell, 1988</xref>), organizations in each system had much in common regardless of the type of service they provided and their size, age, and location. These systems superseded the isomorphizing elements derived from the larger society.</p>
<p>For example, most had boards of directors and funding structures similar to each other. But the relevant question for understanding stewardship was, “How are these board members developed and appointed?,” not “What is the governance structure?” All FBOs in this study had board structures that met the criteria for 501c3 nonprofits, but the stewardship system determined how that board found its members, how they perceived their role vis-à-vis the supporting faith community, and the strategies board members used to provide guidance and support to the organization. The systems to manage stewardship proved far more important in understanding relationships to the founding community and organizational success than any specific action of a given nonprofit.</p>
<p>We also saw unique attributes within each organization that reflected their history and culture. But in contrast to organizational culture theories (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0899764012461399">Martin, 2002</xref>) that focus on culture developed internally by the nonprofit, organizational culture reflected efforts to integrate religious community culture into the organization on multiple levels. Organizations that enjoyed broad support from their faith communities engaged in a dynamic relationship based on community-wide cultural expectations, not those engendered exclusively within the organization. Organizations with strained relationships to their founding religious bodies usually also strove to carry out theological values but relied more on internal interpretations of religious beliefs that did not match those of their supporting faith community. As such, reference to religion in internal organizational culture alone was insufficient to generate support from the founding community.</p>
<p>As with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0899764012461399">Pederson and Dobbin (2006)</xref>, I see neoinstitutionalism and organizational culture theory as complementary but note that neither looks carefully at the dynamic between organizational culture and founding community practices. Clarifying these dynamics is a critical aspect of understanding stewardship of religious nonprofits. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0899764012461399">Wittberg (2000)</xref> observes, religious-based nonprofits can serve to shape the religion by providing avenues for new members to join and providing outlets for religious service. Likewise, successful organizations draw support from their founding communities that shape their mission and internal structures. Religious community isomorphism and organizational culture remain in an important dialectic as continued engagement with an FBO influences both FBO and founding community.</p>
<p>The various careful case studies of community–nonprofit dynamics posit open, fluid relationships between nonprofit and community (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0899764012461399">Koch &amp; Johnson, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0899764012461399">Milofsky, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0899764012461399">Wittberg, 2006</xref>). Networks play a significant role in determining available resources, with network synergy proving more relevant than community resource calculations in understanding outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0899764012461399">Paarlberg &amp; Varga, 2009</xref>). As such, social capital plays an important role in organizational stewardship. Social capital refers to relationships based on reciprocal, reenforceable trust that provide access to resources for organizations and individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0899764012461399">Bourdieu, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0899764012461399">Portes, 1998</xref>). But the nature of social capital is profoundly influenced by community culture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0899764012461399">Schneider, 2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0899764012461399">2009</xref>). People are chosen for leadership roles because they are known within community networks as fitting religious norms. In turn, these leaders carry community expectations to nonprofits and shape their governance systems based on these same community values. These actions constitute stewardship far more than board or staff management of organization resources. The values-based relationships, in turn, generate ongoing systems of support for organizations.</p>
<p>Taken together, this research suggests that a theory of the role of faith community context in supporting FBOs should take into account:</p>
<list id="list1-0899764012461399" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>General patterns of practice in founding faith communities that provide blueprints for support for FBOs.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Networks of individuals and organizations both within the founding faith community and among its nonprofits that support and guide individual organizations.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>An ever-evolving culture within the founding faith community that shapes stewardship strategies for FBOs.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>To understand how these elements work in practice, I now discuss the three systems for organizing stewardship that we found both in our earlier pilot study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0899764012461399">Schneider, Day, &amp; Anderson, 2006</xref>) and this current study. As explained below, each system reflects a dialectic among these factors that changes based both on factors within each system and issues in the larger society. So, for example, each system responded to the economic downturn in different ways based on its internal logic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0899764012461399">Schneider et al., 2009</xref>, pp. 63-65). But the general climate for nonprofits in a weakening economy proved equally important in influencing how stewards looked toward the future for their organizations. It is this dynamic tension between three levels—society-wide factors, faith community dynamics, and internal organizational systems—that determine stewardship on an ongoing basis for any specific FBO. Looking at one level without paying attention to the others provides limited understanding of how stewardship works.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-0899764012461399">
<title>Describing Three Systems</title>
<p>The six religious groups in this study (Catholics, Mainline Protestants, Evangelicals, Jews, Quakers, African American Christians) fell into three strategies for organizing stewardship<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0899764012461399">3</xref></sup>: institutionalized, congregational, and network. Stewardship systems refer to the ways each group of religions organize support for their FBOs, not the structures of the faith communities themselves. For example, although Jewish synagogues and temples are independent entities, local Jewish communities support FBOs communally. Likewise, Mainline Protestant denominations include a wide range of organizational structures from independent conferences to hierarchically organized systems, but all rely primarily on congregations to support their FBOs.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0899764012461399">4</xref></sup> As discussed in a companion paper (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0899764012461399">Schneider &amp; Wittberg, 2011</xref>), these stewardship strategies reflected not only the practical theology of their founding religions but also larger historical forces that influenced general strategies like government regulations and nonprofit norms across the United States. Historical forces created isomorphizing elements for FBOs, but common practical theology cements stewardship strategies for each system. Teaching these values to potential leaders or discerning who in the community best reflects practical theology becomes an important element in stewardship strategies for each system. Each system develops stewards and maintains relationships with its nonprofits in different ways.</p>
<sec id="section3-0899764012461399">
<title>Institutionalized Systems</title>
<p>As Wittberg (personal communication) commented, the older religions—Jews and Catholics—shared strategies that saw stewardship and providing for those in need as the responsibility of communities as a whole (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0899764012461399">Bernstein, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0899764012461399">Cochran, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0899764012461399">Coleman, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0899764012461399">Elazar, 1995</xref>). Our pilot study suggests that Muslims share similar ethos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0899764012461399">Schneider et al., 2006</xref>). This expectation came from times when church and state were merged, with faith communities having primary responsibility for providing supports for their members. Even today, stewardship in these faith traditions centralizes supports through community-wide structures that reflect this history and a practical theology that asserts member responsibility as part of the community to take care of each other. We have labeled these systems <italic>institutionalized</italic> based on their reliance on centralized institutional structures. Jews and Catholics used this system, though they differed in their structure. Catholic systems were integrated into either the archdiocese or order and Jewish systems centralized all social and health services, with synagogues and temples remaining independent from the service system. The Jewish Federation system avoids service duplication and multiple fundraising requests to community members through creating community-wide fundraising and planning for nonprofits founded by the Jewish community (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0899764012461399">Bernstein, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0899764012461399">Elazar, 1995</xref>).</p>
<p>Institutionalized systems evolved from a theology that allocates responsibility for caring for those in need to the community/church as a whole (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0899764012461399">Carp, 2002</xref>). This obligation may be conceived as applying only to members of that religion or the whole world. In Jewish traditions, key theological constructs include <italic>tikkun olam</italic> (responsibility to care for the world—which sometimes means all Jews and other times means anyone in a particular locality or all those with a given need) and a series of Talmudic concepts related to an obligation to support the community and those in need within it (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0899764012461399">Carp, 2002</xref>). For Catholics, key founding theology includes the expectation that Catholics, as the church universal, are responsible both for all Catholics, and by extension, all potential converts to Catholicism. Encyclicals (formalized moral teachings) regarding preferential treatment of the poor, universal health care, and so on that come from the Pope and the Council of Bishops also contribute to the general framework of religious activity (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0899764012461399">Piccione, 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>Major features of Institutionalized systems are as follows:</p>
<list id="list2-0899764012461399" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p>○ Centralized fundraising, volunteer recruitment, training, and sometimes, facilities management.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>Centralized institutions provide umbrella services for these organizations. Although most nonprofits within institutionalized systems fundraise independently, some operational support comes from the United Jewish Appeal, the Catholic Campaign for Human Development, and other centralized fundraising mechanisms. More important, networks to religious foundations and major donors facilitate fundraising from the centralized core. Each of these systems often also had centralized volunteer banks, employment networks, and training systems for leaders. FBOs within these systems relied on these centralized services when seeking a wide array of supports. Centralized facilities management is more typical of Catholics than Jews, but sharing space in community-owned buildings was a common practice particularly for new Jewish organizations. For example, one Jewish executive director reported:
<disp-quote>
<p>The [Federation] has been a wonderful resource, [serving] as a clearing house for information—everything from job descriptions and pay scales to benefits packages and purchasing. They have established umbrella operations like the Jewish Volunteer Connection to help all organizations.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>For schools, centralization included Catholic archdiocesan offices that provided evaluations for children with disabilities and offices providing curriculum resources in both Catholic and Jewish systems. Baltimore’s Federation provided scholarships for all Jewish schools in the area. Although the Jewish schools were largely independent in most Federations, Catholic schools were under the care of orders or archdiocese. For Catholics, decisions to start or close schools came from these centralized structures.</p>
<list id="list3-0899764012461399" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p>○ A strong tradition of centralized planning for the community or its institutions as a whole.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>Planning was particularly important for the Jewish community, with research preceding every major decision. Although the Federation system with its regular planning processes is unique to the United States, Harris et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0899764012461399">Harris, Hutchison, &amp; Cairns, 2005</xref>) note similar strategies in the United Kingdom. However, the hallmark of all institutionalized systems was planning on a community-wide basis and needs assessments of religious communities. These two religions were more likely to regularly use research to adjust the activities of their nonprofits than religions in other systems. These studies and organizational changes happened at a community-wide level. Decisions for change within individual organizations also took community-wide input into account. For instance, Baltimore’s Jewish Community Center made decisions to merge into its current structure and open one facility during the Sabbath on Saturday only with the blessing of its Federation and after wider community input.</p>
<list id="list4-0899764012461399" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p>○ Centralized bodies that occasionally encourage or force mergers or collaborations among organizations in the community for the greater good of the systems as a whole.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>We saw limited duplication of services within these communities and a strong tendency for economies of scale. For example, both Catholics and Jews had merged various social service entities into larger organizations at some point in the recent past. To avoid each pastor making decisions about support for individual needy, one Archdiocese in our study had created a parish partners program that centralized emergency support requests. Individuals could also be referred to formal social service agencies within the system after a parish partners counselor evaluated the case.</p>
<p>Viewing individual social service agencies as part of a larger system enabled collaborations across institutional systems in ways rarely seen in any other system. In one example, a hospital worked with the Jewish Community Center and a Jewish development organization to support fragile seniors. Children with disabilities were supported simultaneously through programs at JCC and the Jewish social service organization. Collaborations also included expectations that system nonprofits would participate in committees on specific topics developed by the central core.</p>
<list id="list5-0899764012461399" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p>○ The ability to share resources across the system.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>Resource sharing took many forms. In Catholic systems, wealthy hospitals contributed to those in communities with fewer resources. Personnel could also quickly be moved to different institutions when the need arose. We saw this with strategic board appointments and sometimes staffing. For example, one Catholic health system administrator reported:
<disp-quote>
<p>We recognize that some of the ministries of [Health System] are in markets that are responding very much to community needs and they are never going to achieve margins. And there are other institutions like [other Sister of X Hospital in another state] that have great ability to achieve operating margins and so there is shared distribution of resources across the system.</p>

<list-item><p>○ Strong networks of religiously based national umbrella organizations in addition to the local centralized systems that provide additional support and networks for their FBOs.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>Networks were extremely important for these organizations, and national umbrella organizations provided a key way to network. In addition, these national umbrellas often provided policy support and served as the bodies that lobbied state and national governments on issues of importance to organizations. Training and best practices materials were also provided by umbrella institutions in many cases (see Wittberg, 2013). These umbrella organizations developed from the expectations for centralized support in institutionalized system, serving as one more element that supported an understanding of that religion as part of a larger community. This was particularly strong for Jews, with the umbrellas serving as the major network for people working in organizations providing a particular kind of service across the country. Umbrellas also played a key role in identifying personnel, and in some cases, the umbrella referred individuals for particular jobs. For example, Jewish Community Center key personnel are referred by the national JCC umbrella and vetted by both the local organization and its Federation. Most Federation personnel come out of the Jewish Communal Services graduate programs and move through positions in different federations through word-of-mouth referrals within the network.</p>
<list id="list7-0899764012461399" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p>○ A tendency for organizations outside of the centralized umbrella to still develop ties with other FBOs either through interfaith entities or independent groups of FBOs from the same faith.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>Schools are connected with the wider faith community and the centralized umbrella (Federation, order, archdiocese), but most Catholic and Jewish schools in some communities are under the direct sponsorship of congregations or independent of any formal religious institution.</p>
<p>The true strength of institutionalized systems to maintain connections and ensure that organizations continued the practical theology of the founding faith came from the centralized planning, evaluation, and leadership development programs. Both religions had thought carefully over time about ways to ensure that people trusted by the local faith community’s leadership and schooled in its practical theology provided connections between nonprofits and the founding faith community. In both religions, close social networks were as important as formal training in decision making regarding who was placed in leadership positions. Both also had some form of formal training or orientation for people placed in leadership roles.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0899764012461399">5</xref></sup></p>
<p>Stewardship development in institutionalized systems started with childhood religious training in the home, faith community, and sometimes schools, regarding obligations to community and practices of supporting that community, like volunteering and regular donations. In Jewish, and to a lesser extent Catholic, systems leadership development programs were available for young adults and established leaders. These included formal classes and workshops as well as providing educational materials. Training and socialization ensured that people responsible for stewardship understood the culture underlying their activities.</p>
<p>Stewardship was seen as involving both obligations to particular organizations and the community-wide structures. For example, Jewish leaders generally were involved in Federation committees in addition to serving on particular nonprofit boards. Catholic leadership often came from those known at the archdiocesan or order level. People on individual Jewish boards were expected to participate in community-wide fundraising campaigns both through donations and volunteer efforts to garner more pledges. The idea that they represented their community appeared particularly strong for both groups. When a Catholic organization employee states that “We are the social service arm of the Catholic church” he or she reflects this sense of community responsibility. Organizations are part of the community as a whole, and being a steward of one meant representing the whole.</p>
<p>Networks of lay leaders were fostered both through informal connections and the leadership development activities. Social capital within the community was particularly important in creating a cadre of leaders and supporting them as they moved among institutions. The tendency for people to move between multiple boards tended to encourage strong networks among those in leadership positions.</p>
<p>When faced with potential crisis, the impulse to turn to centralized institutions was particularly strong in institutionalized systems. In the economic downturn, most of the Catholic and Jewish institutions sought ways to economize through sharing resources or combining back-office activities at a centralized level. These economies of scale prove a particular strength for these systems and provided organizations in these systems with a level of security not available in the other two systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0899764012461399">Schneider et al., 2009</xref>, pp. 73-36).</p>

<title>Congregational Systems</title>
<p>Religions that came out of the Protestant reformation and the religious movements that created the Peace Churches instead stress the importance of individual action to support those in need (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0899764012461399">Balmer, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0899764012461399">Brinton, 1994</xref>). But individuals are part of congregations, and these congregations are the central element in <italic>congregational</italic> systems. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0899764012461399">Hall (1990)</xref> documents, the congregational system is the foundation for much of the U.S. nonprofit sector and these FBOs’ stewardship strategies often look similar to secular nonprofits. Much of the research on faith-based service in the United States reflects this emphasis on the congregation as the central entity fostering both congregational ministries and FBOs, overwhelmingly focusing on research in Protestant congregations or applying Protestant models to all faith communities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0899764012461399">Ammerman, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0899764012461399">Chaves, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0899764012461399">Cnaan et al., 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>This religious tradition emphasizes the local congregation as the primary vehicle for carrying out the mandates of faith in a community (though congregations may be supported in this task by centralized denominational structures). Congregations are often the key institutions appointing board members, even if board members see themselves as independent actors working as nonprofit stewards. For example, one pastor served on the board of two organizations founded many years ago by a local interfaith coalition that included his church. He saw his board work as his congregation’s contribution to each organization but did not feel any need to inform the congregation of key decisions the boards made that could influence the role of these organizations in the community.</p>
<p>Ministries or programs that become institutionalized as independent nonprofits or become projects of the church with independent advisory committees and, sometimes, separate bank accounts, such as a church food pantry, typically begin as efforts within a congregation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0899764012461399">Hall, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0899764012461399">Schneider &amp; Morrison, 2010</xref>, pp. 11-28, 58-68). Well-established organizations maintain strong ties to congregations or at least retain vestiges of these congregational roots through board appointments and both financial and in-kind support. In this study, Mainline Protestants, some African American churches, and Quakers fell into the congregational system. Although none of the Evangelical nonprofits in this study sample were in this category, it is likely that some Evangelical groups do use this system. Major features of Congregational systems are as follows:</p>
<list id="list8-0899764012461399" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p>○ Ministries often formalize as either independent programs of their founding congregation(s) with independent advisory committees and separate accounting systems, or spin off into independent 501c3 organizations with limited ties to congregations or form as interfaith entities.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>The impetus to formalize organizations independently of their founding congregations is particularly strong in Mainline Protestants and Quakers. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0899764012461399">Hall (2005)</xref> observes, placing organizations in the community mainstream fits into earlier Protestant strategies to have secular structures reflect the sacred strategies of the Mainline Protestant majority. Formalization is generally meant as a way to ensure good governance as well as an opportunity to expand the resource network for organizations.</p>
<list id="list9-0899764012461399" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p>○ FBOs maintain ties to one or more congregations through board appointments, appeals for resources, volunteers, and in-kind supports.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>Congregations are seen as the major source for all forms of support, and creating ties to congregations is a major stewardship strategy for organizations that were started by local congregations. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0899764012461399">Baggett (2001</xref>, pp. 75-77) notes that potential Habitat for Humanity affiliates are extolled to speak to as many churches as possible when developing a new organization. Presumably some of these congregations will become active supporters for the Habitat chapter. The Habitat organization in our study relied on a small number of churches for support.</p>
<list id="list10-0899764012461399" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p>○ FBOs see volunteering as an important component of organizational activity and create volunteer opportunities for people from their denomination and others.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>Emphasis on volunteering stemmed from practical theology that saw faith-based organizations as places where individuals could act out their personal calls for service. As such volunteering fulfilled a religious mandate as much as providing support to the organization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0899764012461399">Garland, Myers, &amp; Wolfer, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0899764012461399">Hugen, Wolfer, &amp; Renkema, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0899764012461399">Unruh &amp; Sider, 2005</xref>). The vast literature on volunteering notes that congregations are a key source for volunteers (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0899764012461399">Caputo, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0899764012461399">Cnaan et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0899764012461399">Hodgkinson &amp; Weitzman, 1996</xref>).</p>
<p>Volunteering was also structured by the nature of service provision. Most congregational organizations tended to be small-to-mid-sized entities, more likely to provide emergency assistance than any other kind of service. In the United States providing temporary food, clothing, and shelter is generally the province of religious organizations, with volunteer-based organizations playing a key role (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0899764012461399">Chaves, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0899764012461399">Grettenberger, 2001</xref>). As such, volunteers and volunteer drives for in-kind resources became an important component of staffing and garnering resources for the organization. These volunteer activities served as a primary form of stewardship from the community for the organization. The semiannual food and clothing drives, in particular, raised visibility and investment in the organization from its wider constituent community. For example, one interfaith organization ran its food and clothing pantry with only one paid staff person, relying on volunteers and in-kind contributions from member congregations to staff these programs and provide goods.</p>
<p>Regular volunteering activities, like a given congregation serving food or making meals to give out once a month, created strong ties to the organizations from participating congregations as well as strengthening networks among participating individuals. Individual networks proved essential for the organization to carry out their work. For example, the Habitat chapter relied on key individuals who would organize work crews to complete houses. Volunteers at the interfaith organizations would ensure that news of organization activities regularly appeared in member congregations’ bulletins and newsletters.</p>
<list id="list11-0899764012461399" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p>○ Established congregational FBOs usually maintain ties to their founding faith by requiring that a percentage of board members be from the founding faith or founding congregations.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>Driskell et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0899764012461399">Driskell, Lyon, &amp; Embry, 2008</xref>) document the tendency for Mainline Protestants to ask active members to serve as organization leaders, noting that only Jews were more likely to serve in voluntary leadership positions. Parachurch organizations also use the same strategy. This strategy contrasted with institutionalized system nonprofits, where the percentage of faith community board members was rarely specified in bylaws. Instead, strong community networks led to boards almost exclusively from the founding religion. Network system organizations also did not specify the composition of boards in this way.</p>
<p>The tendency for congregational system organizations to specify that a percentage of their board comes from a particular denominational or congregational source was a hallmark of these organizations and a key stewardship strategy. For organizations started by interfaiths or other denominational coalitions, boards generally consisted of representatives appointed by the member congregations. In denominational organizations, usually denomination members were stipulated as a majority, often 51% to 75% of board membership. The underlying culture expected that board members appointed by the faith community would ensure that the organization maintained the ethos of the founding religion. However, unlike institutionalized systems, denominations or congregations rarely provided training for their board members or clarified what their expectations were for people representing a particular congregation.</p>
<list id="list12-0899764012461399" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p>○ In some cases, the relationship between congregational organizations and their founding faith communities involves the FBO drawing community members into the congregation.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>We saw little overt proselytizing in these organizations. Instead, volunteering in these institutions served as a primary mechanism to interest people in the religion or congregation. In one of our Methodist organizations, people often reported that they joined the congregation because they liked the work of its homeless shelter. Schools also drew people to the religion, especially for Quakers. For example, one African American FBO reported that “[The pastor] guesstimated that about 70 percent of the current congregation have joined either because they worked at or wanted to be part of the outreach programs, or they were actually served by the outreach program before becoming a member.”</p>
<list id="list13-0899764012461399" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p>○ Congregational system organizations often embed their faith in more general values, specifically stating that they valued theological diversity within a general spiritual or Christian context, and on principle they do not proselytize.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>○ Congregational system denominations create fewer umbrella organizations for their FBOs, and the FBOs tended to belong to fewer umbrella groups.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>Stewardship in congregational systems involved primarily appointing board members and requests for funding, volunteers, and in-kind supports. Although some youth group activities encouraged volunteering, we did not see the comprehensive training or socialization to support organizations among congregational system that was so visible in the institutionalized system. Instead, individual choice seemed paramount in encouraging people to support organizations.</p>
<p>Generally unprepared for board service, congregational system board members were also provided little guidance on their role in the institution vis-à-vis its supporting congregations. We saw few formal mechanisms for reporting back on board activities. Nonprofits generally reported back to congregations by disseminating annual reports to their constituent congregations or through fundraising drives. As a result, stewardship increasingly devolved into a narrow understanding as fundraising or ensuring fiscal responsibility within organizations, a tendency also seen among Mainline Protestant faith communities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0899764012461399">Conway, 1995</xref>).</p>
<p>Although most of the congregational system FBOs in this study were relatively small and tied to a small number of congregations, we saw similar strategies in large denominational–level institutions like Lutheran Immigration and Refugee services, the local Lutheran service organizations, and the various settlement houses chartered at a higher-level adjudicatory like a synod or conference rather than at the congregation level. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0899764012461399">Thiemann (2005)</xref> notes, Lutheran practical theology draws from both Catholic and Mainline Protestant roots, and Lutherans are more likely to form institutions supported by a higher-level adjudicatory. However, even in these larger institutions, outreach for board members, local site hosts, volunteers, and funding was through congregations, not the higher-level adjudicatory. For example, a national Lutheran refugee organization sought sponsors and other supports from individual congregations. In addition, institutions not specifically tied to congregations had a harder time maintaining connections to their historic base. As in an earlier study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0899764012461399">Schneider, 1999</xref>), their relationship to the founding faith community was more likely to become attenuated and the organizations tended to become more secular over time.</p>
<p>The challenges faced by these organizations without a firm congregational base showed in this system’s stewardship strategies. Nonprofits that maintained vital connections to specific congregations thrived whereas those lacking these connections could easily lose direction and community support. For example, one Quaker organization with a troubled relationship to its founding Meeting reported desperate calls for the Meeting to appoint board members because “Our nominating committee over the years found it increasingly difficult to find anyone willing to serve. . . .” Stewardship combined an ability to convey the practical theology to the organization, congregation-based networks, and an ethos that incorporated key cultural elements like volunteering and liberal values of equality in the organization.</p>

<sec id="section5-0899764012461399">
<title>Network Systems</title>
<p><italic>Network systems</italic> are relatively new, although they hark back to the religious movements of the 19th century. In these systems, social networks formed around a specific nonprofit are the key element supporting that FBO. But these networks are value driven, and an organization can quickly lose support if it does not reflect the beliefs and practices of its supporting network. Although face-to-face networks are often important in supporting these organizations, networks are just as likely to be virtual, drawing from people with similar goals, even internationally, to support a specific ministry. Network systems transcend congregations and FBOs may be connected with one or multiple congregations, but their decision-making and support systems reside outside the congregational system. For example, a crisis pregnancy center was started by members of a support group for women who had abortions in one congregation, but it was founded as an independent organization and links to an ever-widening network of individuals throughout the state.</p>
<p>Organizations in network systems differ from congregational systems in two important ways: (a) The FBO is supported by a network of individuals focused on a specific ministry, and (b) the people who staff these organizations either as volunteers or paid staff share the faith approach of the organization’s founders, using this faith as a prime motivator in their work. Recent research notes an increasing number of FBOs as independent from congregational structures, which is typical of network forms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0899764012461399">Monsma, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0899764012461399">Unruh &amp; Sider, 2005</xref>). In contrast, congregational organizations drew staff and involved volunteers interested in the service or ministry of the program but who do not necessarily share similar approaches to faith or come from the religion of the founding congregation(s). The <italic>network-based</italic> organizations in this study ranged from small emergency services programs founded by one congregation member to a multisite pregnancy center working to prevent abortions and from a young evangelical Christian school to a nearly 200-year-old multiservice organization that provided support through well-established ministry centers. Major features of Network systems are as follows:</p>
<list id="list14-0899764012461399" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p>○ FBOs become a faith community for staff, active volunteers, and sometimes, program participants.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>Although organizations do not substitute for other worship communities that their participants belong to, they become an important supplement to other religious activities. Networks become particularly strong in these organizations, and stewardship consists of this active participation. Bonding social capital based on shared theological values draws people to these institutions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0899764012461399">Putnam, 2000</xref>), with both face-to-face and virtual networks functioning as a source of resources. For example, one youth serving organization drew from college students involved in Asian campus ministry programs throughout the country. The organization would provide housing and other supports to participating volunteers over the summer and included worship as part of volunteer and staff activities.</p>
<list id="list15-0899764012461399" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p>○ These organizations rely on a combination of staff and volunteers, but almost all people involved with the organization share the founding faith or have some other personal connection with the ministry and their involvement is motivated by that faith.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>Culture is particularly strong in these organizations, with a level of homogeneity of belief seldom seen in organizations from other system types. Sharing similar beliefs is the key draw to the ministry and its network of supporters.</p>
<list id="list16-0899764012461399" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p>○ Resources come through networks of like-minded believers, and often organizations highlight their faith or trust in God as a source for resources for the organization.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>We repeatedly heard “miracle stories” about the way that these organizations garnered resources. For example, while purchasing a second location, an organization was contacted by a contractor who renovated the building at reduced cost. The same kinds of connections appearing at just the right time were reported in multiple organizations. Organization leaders would preach on their ministry in various venues as a mechanism to garner resources. In addition, these organizations excelled at using the internet, social media, and the web to share their message and gain support. Networks could be local, national, or international. For example, one Asian organization in our pilot study drew support through Korean television reports. These organizations also relied heavily on volunteers, often college students in internships. As with other strategies, word-of-mouth networks were far more important than institutional connections.</p>
<list id="list17-0899764012461399" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p>○ Since these organizations are supported through personal networks, they are more likely to end when the pastor or founder moves on. In older, established organizations, ministries can change as the leader’s calling or gospel vision changes.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>Most of the organizations in this study were thriving at this point, with their initial founders still in charge. However, the one older organization had shifted significantly in form and focus each time its leadership changed. Current leadership described these shifts as not only stemming from the new leader’s vision but also reflecting shifts in needs in the community served.</p>
<list id="list18-0899764012461399" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p>○ One main subset of this group is formed by evangelistic organizations, for which sharing their faith is a key element of the ministry.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>The potential for FBOs to proselytize remains a key concern in policy circles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0899764012461399">Monsma, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0899764012461399">Unruh &amp; Sider, 2005</xref>). However, like other studies of Evangelicals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0899764012461399">Unruh &amp; Sider, 2005</xref>), this study found that sharing faith could take two forms: (a) demonstrating faith through actions, and (b) sharing one’s faith with people served by the organization. For example, the Asian youth organization promoted “Godly” behavior through modest dress, encouraging sharing, and admonishing teens for using profanity. Network organizations were more likely than FBOs in the other systems to encourage their staff and volunteers to share faith in either form. That said, most of the FBOs in this study understood that open proselytizing to people receiving services was not allowed if they wanted to receive government funding and was also an issue of debate in the wider society. Those that chose to share faith with people they served more often looked for indications from clients that they would welcome open religious discussion, rather than sharing faith with anyone who came in the door. For example, the crisis pregnancy center had biblical literature available for counseling sessions but only used it if the client mentioned faith first.</p>
<p>Stewardship for these organizations came from the networks that supported them. Although some had formal boards, their governance and accountability structures were less formalized than for organizations in the other two systems. Board members primarily came from networks associated with the founders. Maintaining the founding faith was essential to continued support for the organizations. As such two elements—strong networks and consistent adherence to the cultural elements that underlay the organization—were essential for their survival. Stewardship was thus personal for network members and represented their contributions to a cause that they believed in strongly. The organizations represented these values and carried them out in their work.</p>
<p>Training, support, and maintenance structures seen in the other systems did not exist for these organizations. Although some nascent umbrella organizations existed, these were also similar network organizations that primarily provided advocacy support for causes. Some resource sharing was reported by other scholars working with similar groups (Unruh, personal communication) but not evident in the organizations in this study. As such, organization stewardship depended on the abilities of the network. In many cases, participants had significant experience or training in nonprofit governance that contributed to their work. Nevertheless, network system organizations remain fragile given their dependence on value-driven networks for support.</p>

<title>Summary</title>
<p>This brief discussion of three different systems for organizing stewardship show how these three elements of a general blueprint for stewardship, social capital, and ability to sustain religious culture combine in varying ways for different religions. The result is three systems for stewardship that conceptualize stewardship differently. For institutionalized system organizations, stewardship is a communal effort managed through centralized structures. For congregational system organizations it depends on enduring relationships to congregations. For network organizations, ability to sustain and expand values-based networks is key with the entire network serving as stewards for the organization.</p>

<title>Implications for Research, Policy, and Practice</title>
<p>This brief overview of three stewardship systems suggests several avenues for future research and directions for policy and practice. First, nonprofit support systems cannot be viewed apart from their cultural context, with analysis of shaping forces including this element in research. This would involve exploring the history of system development as well as the beliefs and practices that maintain a system today. It suggests that some generalization is possible but that general elements come from shared culture rather than universal or rationalizing processes. Macro-social and economic elements work in tandem with culture.</p>
<p>It also suggests that there are several ways that support structures organize themselves and that discerning the type of structure of the support system is the first step in research on this topic. Understanding each system’s conceptualization of its relationship to its nonprofits and how each defines stewardship responsibilities is part of this process. Comprehending this internal logic is the first step in tracing governance and resource development strategies for a given nonprofit or an entire system. Diagnosing problems for a particular nonprofit or system must necessarily include determining its system culture and providing advice in keeping with that system.</p>
<p>The important role of umbrella organizations and intermediaries in the institutionalized and, to a lesser extent, the congregational systems suggests that additional research is needed on this topic. However, instead of generalized research, projects that view umbrellas within the context of their system would prove most important. This research suggests that umbrellas serve a different purpose in each system (see Wittberg, 2013). For institutionalized systems, umbrellas are centralizing bodies designed to share resources across institutions and strengthen the sense of common purpose for the faith community as a whole. It is this effort to reinforce the sense of community-wide responsibility and expand the community to a national and even international level that remains the guiding purpose for umbrellas in this system.</p>
<p>Congregational system umbrellas also create avenues to share resources across systems, for instance, a pooled insurance system or sharing best practices. But in this case, the constituent organizations or congregations are considered independent actors who will benefit from the activities of the umbrella. Creating a larger ethos is not the purpose. As such, these organizations serve primarily as professional organizations for FBOs providing common services, with more circumscribed goals than in institutionalized systems. Since this study did not explore the nascent umbrellas associated with network systems, their purpose is yet to be discerned.</p>
<p>Likewise, networks and social capital serve a different function in each system. The social capital literature identifies three types of social capital. Bonding social capital refers to homogenous groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0899764012461399">Putnam, 2000</xref>), bridging social capital crosses cultural boundaries among equals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0899764012461399">Putnam &amp; Feldstein, 2003</xref>), whereas linking social capital involves trust-based relationships across power hierarchies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0899764012461399">Woolcock, 1998</xref>). Although bonding social capital is most salient in network system organizations, it is also important in the other two systems. Institutionalized systems also rely heavily on linking social capital. Congregational systems use bridging social capital both among Mainline Protestant denominations and across other religions as well as secular groups to draw resources for their organizations, a strategy seldom seen in the other two systems.</p>
<p>For institutionalized systems, networks expand on the sense of community of the whole. They are developed in such a way as to ensure that network members are not attached simply to a specific organization but to its community-wide structures. The opposite is the case for the other two systems. In a congregational system, networks exist between congregation and nonprofit, among congregations as independent entities or within congregations to support the nonprofits under its care. Building relationships involves a focus on individuals who may join a network rather than the community as a whole.</p>
<p>This idea of individuals forming a network is even stronger for network systems, with the faith-based beliefs behind the organization’s mission serving as the primary common element among members. Participating in activities to support the organization is an important way that these networks strengthen themselves. Although face-to-face networks remain important, increasingly network FBOs use virtual networks effectively to draw resources. Thus, the networks become essential for the organization, and maintaining their vitality must be a major goal of the organization. In a network system, the concept of stewardship is almost reversed, with the organization responsible for creating its own support structures through fostering networks. Discerning these mechanisms to create, grow, and strengthen supporting networks would be a major goal for research and practical advice for organizations in network systems.</p>
<p>This research also suggests that practical guidance on stewardship would vary for each system based on its conceptualization of how stewardship is structured. Efforts to share strategies across systems must translate across core values and acknowledge that only some strategies will work in different systems. But regardless of system differences, this research suggests that stewardship must be seen as a general responsibility of the faith community for the FBO, not just FBOs turning to faith communities for resource development. Also, stewardship involves seeing an organization within its system context as well as focusing on its individual governance issues.</p>
<p>Overall, this project shows the importance of getting beyond a narrow focus on fundraising, volunteering, specific management issues, or resource development to understand nonprofits as part of interlocking systems influenced by the confluence of culture, socioeconomic systems, and networks. Without comprehending the context for nonprofit activity, we risk encouraging solutions with limited value to FBOs and their supporting communities as well as continuing a nonprofits research focus on resource development and financial management devoid of its community context.</p>
