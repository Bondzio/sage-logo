<p>Bulgaria is one of the two countries which joined the European Union during the latest round of enlargement. It has now been four years since this Balkan country acquired full member state status, and, as it is still continuing its efforts to join the Schengen zone and the EMU, an appraisal of its relationship with, and perceptions of, Europe seems more than appropriate. This edited volume traces the often ‘problematic’ trajectory of Bulgaria’s convergence path towards Europe, starting off with the establishment of a Bulgarian state in the nineteenth century, and moving on to the Cold War, the transition period and beyond. One of the advantages of the book is the breadth of its approaches, which reflect the contributors’ areas of expertise; it contains chapters by historians, international relations specialists, political scientists, sociologists, anthropologists, as well as experts on migration, political economy, and literature, among others. The editor has done a remarkable job tying together all the different approaches to form a coherent whole; this becomes quite clear in the sturdy introduction (co-written with Peter Siani-Davies), which also introduces both the term ‘Europeanization’, and the varying Bulgarian conceptions of Europe.</p>
<p>The structure of the volume follows a chronological sequence, with the first chapter focusing on the genesis and early development of Bulgarian political institutions, and the degree to which institution-building was influenced by, and related to, Western European countries. In the second chapter, Galin Tihanov discusses Bulgaria’s cultural contacts with Europe, through an examination of two literary examples from the first half of the twentieth century. In the following chapter, Marietta Stankova masterfully combines a study of domestic political developments, with a discussion of international events and the role of Britain, in particular, to explain the factors that contributed to the establishment of communism in Bulgaria (‘a moment of the absence of Europe in Bulgarian history’ [61]). The fourth chapter deals with the Bulgarian state’s policy towards minorities, and Iskra Baeva and Evgenia Kalinova set out to show how this has been influenced by Europeanization through a case study of Bulgarian Turks after the collapse of Zhivkov’s regime. Tatyana Kotzeva focuses on the social policies of Sofia vis-à-vis Bulgarian women since 1989. In the fifth chapter she divides the post-socialist period in two phases and offers an outline of the main social-demographic trends that formed the landscape for women’s employment in Bulgaria. In chapter six, Eugenia Markova presents the findings of her research on Bulgarian immigration into Spain and Greece. Dimitar Bechev’s contribution to the volume charts the course of Bulgaria’s accession into the EU from the troublesome immediate post-1989 period, through the negotiations, to the 2007 end result. Benchev analyses the international and domestic factors that contributed to Bulgaria coming closer to Europe, and eventually becoming a member of the EU. Stefanos Katsikas identifies the harsh realities that made Bulgaria relinquish its erstwhile irredentist policies in the Balkan region, and concentrate on integration into Euro-Atlantic institutions. In the ninth chapter Elitza Ranova explores the impact of ‘Europeanization’ in the fields of arts and culture, to explain two different social phenomena: the rise of an elite-in-the-making, and the resurgence of national pride. The last chapter of the book has regional policy at its heart and Vassilis Monastiriotis explains the reasons behind Bulgaria’s limited regional economic performance, stressing the issues of intraregional disparities and polarization, as well as the catalytic role of the EU towards a more efficient regional policy.</p>
<p>All in all, this edited volume serves as an ideal introduction to those interested in understanding where Bulgaria is coming from, where it stands today, and where it may be heading. It provides an informative glimpse of modern Bulgaria, with all its uniqueness and inherent contradictions, its foreign and domestic policies, and its social, economic and cultural peculiarities. Equally importantly, the book manages to live up to the reader’s expectations by providing a clear and coherent picture of the interrelationship between Bulgaria and Europe (from the creation of the Balkan state to the present day), on a variety of levels. The focus on shifting identities and perceptions is an integral part of the volume, with all the contributors shedding light on the ways that the relationship between the Bulgarian state and society and Europe and the EU have changed. This is a well-written and thoroughly researched addition to the literature on Bulgarian history and politics, and will be of interest both to Balkan and to EU scholars.</p>
