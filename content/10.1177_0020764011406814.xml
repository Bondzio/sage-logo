<body>
<p>Dear Editor</p>
<p><bold>The relationship between elderly suicide rates and the internet: A cross-national study</bold></p>
<p>Dr Shah has presented a cross-national study concerning the relationship between elderly suicide rates and the internet, using data from the World Health Organization and the United Nations website. He found that the prevalence of internet users was independently associated with suicide rates in both genders and in the age bands 65–74 years and 75 years and over (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0020764011406814">Shah, 2010</xref>). The author concluded:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Caution should be exercised in the attribution of a causal relationship and the direction of this relationship because of the cross-sectional and ecological study design whereby the findings are subjected to ecological fallacy. However, the independent association between suicide rates in both genders in both age bands and the prevalence of internet users on multiple regression analysis suggests the possibility of an aetiological relationship.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Although this study represents an important and relevant addition to the literature on the subject, some points need to be considered. First of all, more details about the 85 countries included in the study could be presented, such as identification and stratification of high-income, middle-income and low-income nations as well as their sociocultural characteristics. Another question is whether the suicide rates will continue to be associated independently with the prevalence of internet users post-stratification. Furthermore, the main conclusion could emphasize that suicide is associated with a range of medical and social factors. The presence of these factors increases the risk for an individual to commit suicide. These associations do not establish causation, but they demonstrate the importance of interacting variables. The website, as the other suicide methods, will act as intervening variable, increasing the risk of suicide in vulnerable subjects. Therefore, on the causal pathway of suicide, the website will be an intermediate variable. In spite of being very important to implement legislation to regulate websites and chat rooms, for purposes of secondary prevention interventions for suicide, however, it is more relevant to know primary causes of suicide.</p>
