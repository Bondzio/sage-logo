<title>Introduction</title>
<p>In principle, the electrorheological (ER) effect in suspension results in a rapid organization of polarized particles into chain-like or columnar structures in a streamline direction within an external electric field (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1045389X12443595">Winslow, 1947</xref>). When the flow is applied, superposition of shear and polarization forces sets in. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1045389X12443595">Henley and Filisko (1999)</xref> reported that in a flowing paraffin wax suspension of Amberlite cation, exchange particles between parallel plates under electric field application, secondary structures of series of black and white regularly spaced concentric rings were formed. Later, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1045389X12443595">Filisko and Henley (2001)</xref> pointed out the importance of the particle concentration and intensity of the electric field on the morphology of these structures. Particle rings are more numerous, equally spaced and much thinner at higher particle content. Applying higher voltages results in a more significant spacing of particular rings, which is supposedly associated with increasing ER activity. The influence of various parameters (shearing time, electric field strength, and shear rate value) on the lamellar formations of the ER microstructure was also analyzed here (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1045389X12443595">Vieira et al., 2001</xref>). The evolution of ER structures under different flow conditions has been studied (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1045389X12443595">Tang et al., 1999</xref>), and an analysis of ER patterns of modified materials employed as ER fluids has been performed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1045389X12443595">Filisko et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1045389X12443595">Henley and Filisko, 2002</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1045389X12443595">Cutillas and Bossis (1997)</xref> compared the effects of both electric and magnetic external fields on structural patterns in an oscillatory shear flow, and the crucial role of strain to organization as well as to the stability of patterns was recognized. The kinetics of the interaction of particles during chain formation between electrodes has been studied both theoretically and experimentally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1045389X12443595">Bossis et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1045389X12443595">Metayer et al., 2004</xref>). It appeared that the distance between two neighboring particles in the chains related to interaction energy in the presence of the electric field plays a primary role in the formation of ER structures. Similarly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1045389X12443595">Wu and Conrad (1998)</xref> investigated the influence of the intensity of the applied external field and particle amount in clusters on the chain structure properties. In our previous works (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1045389X12443595">Ponizil et al., 2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1045389X12443595">2009</xref>), we presented a mathematical analysis of ER patterns created in suspended flow. The present study is focused on monitoring the formation of the ring structures of chains of glass beads polarized in an electric field in flow under various shearing conditions and their development in time. In doing so, we analyze different sequences of shear and electric field applications, as well as the role of the viscosity of the continuous phase.</p>

<title>Particle characterization and preparation of suspensions</title>
<p>Glass beads (density of 2.54 g cm<sup>−3</sup>) were used as a model material. The average size of the particles obtained from optical microscopy is 40 µm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1045389X12443595">Figure 1</xref>). About 0.03 wt% of physically bonded water on their surface measured by thermo gravimetric analyzer (TGA) (Setaram SetSys Evolution 1200, France) was found. Suspensions with particle concentration of 40 wt% in two kinds of liquids, namely in silicone oil (Lukosiol, Chemical Works Kolin, Czech Republic, viscosity η = 200 mPa s, density 0.97 g cm<sup>−3</sup>), suspension S1, concentration of 20 vol%—and in liquid silicone elastomer base (SYLGARD, Dow Corning, USA, viscosity η = 5500 mPa s, density 1.05 g cm<sup>−3</sup>), suspension S2, concentration of 22 vol%, were prepared. The suspensions were homogenized by mechanic stirring before each measurement and the air bubbles were removed by vacuuming.</p>

<p>The dielectric properties of suspensions were characterized by a radio-frequency (RF) impedance/material analyzer (Agilent 4294A, USA) equipped with a liquid cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1045389X12443595">Figure 2</xref>). The dielectric relaxation frequency between 10<sup>2</sup> and 10<sup>3</sup> Hz corresponding to the inflection on the permittivity decrease and the local maximum of dielectric loss factor identifies interfacial polarization of suspension particles as the main cause of the ER phenomenon. The small shift of relaxation frequencies of suspension in a lower viscosity medium to higher frequencies indicating only slightly higher particle mobility is negligible, and no significant differences in dielectric behavior can be assumed.</p>

<title>Steady-shear behavior</title>
<p>The rotational rheometer Bohlin Gemini (Malvern Instruments, UK) with parallel plates 40 mm in diameter separated by a 1 mm gap equipped with a cell for ER experiments was used. The plates were connected to a DC high-voltage source TREK 668B (TREK, USA) providing an intensity of electric field strength <italic>E</italic> = 1 kV mm<sup>−1</sup>. The flow behavior of suspensions as the shear rate dependence of viscosity is depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1045389X12443595">Figure 3</xref>. In the absence of the electric field, both suspensions demonstrated practically Newtonian behavior. This suggests that even in a low-viscosity medium, the influence of particle sedimentation during this experiment (about 5 min) is negligible.</p>

<p>After application of the electric field, the flow curves of both suspensions dramatically changed and demonstrated strong pseudoplastic character. The relative increase in viscosity of suspension S1 in a low-viscosity medium was higher as a consequence of low electric field-off value. In contrast, in the case of suspension S2, the ER efficiency was markedly lower.</p>

<title>Monitoring of secondary structures</title>
<p>For online observation of the structures generated in flowing suspensions in the electric field, the instrument was equipped with a special cell enabling direct monitoring by a universal serial bus (USB) microscope camera (Dino-Lite, Taiwan) in real time. For observational purposes, the original lower plate was replaced by 1.1 mm thick transparent conducting glass sheet (Geomatec, Japan) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1045389X12443595">Figure 4</xref>). The measurements were carried out under selected shear rates (<italic>γ̇</italic>) of 5, 10, 20, and 40 s<sup>−1</sup>.</p>

<p>Structure development in time was presented by sectors of circle, where each of them corresponds to the time of 30 s of video record in constant experimental conditions. The sectors were taken from captured video snapshots and were gradually joined together in counter-clockwise direction that allows for the portrayal of 3600 s of the experiment in a single picture.</p>

<title>Sequences of the electric field and shearing application</title>
<p>No secondary structures were observed in the absence of an electric field. When shearing started after the electric field application, a fine structure of numerous rings appeared (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-1045389X12443595">Figure 5(a)</xref>). It may be assumed that a primary chain structure of polarized particles between electrodes at rest is broken down by shear into a great number of thin circular layers. On the other hand, a lower number of wider rings joining together in time appeared when an electric field was applied after the shearing began (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-1045389X12443595">Figure 5(b)</xref>). Due to polarization forces, the rotating particles are gradually organized and the thickness of the circular layers increases.</p>

<p>Differences in the development of organized particle structures are reflected in the different rheological behaviors of suspensions in time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-1045389X12443595">Figure 6</xref>). When the measurement of ER properties of particle chain structures created at rest is performed in a standard way, that is, the electric field was applied before shearing, suspension viscosity after an initial steep rise declined in time to a stable value corresponding to the flow properties of the fine ring structure. The application of the electric field to already sheared suspensions caused a gradual increase to a much higher viscosity than in the former case, which corresponds to the formation of a low number of thick secondary rings during flow. It is clear that the latter way does not characterize the equilibrium character of ER chain structures.</p>

<title>Effect of viscosity of liquid phase</title>
<p>The viscosity of the continuous phase significantly influences the relative increase of suspension viscosity (ratio of viscosity in the presence and in the absence of an electric field) and plays an important role in the development of secondary ER structures as well, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-1045389X12443595">Figures 7</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-1045389X12443595">8</xref>. In the case of a low-viscosity medium (suspension S1), structures developed almost immediately throughout the sample after the shearing application, obviously due to higher particle mobility. When a high-viscosity medium was employed (suspension S2), friction forces affecting the motion of the particles were higher, and the development of the circles markedly slowed. Ring structures in contrast to the low-viscosity suspension were more stable.</p>

<sec id="section9-1045389X12443595">
<title>Effect of shearing rate</title>
<p>In general, a higher rate of shearing intensifies the importance of hydrodynamic forces acting on the particles. The significant role of the shear rate on the development of secondary structures is demonstrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-1045389X12443595">Figures 9</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10-1045389X12443595">10</xref>. Evidently, a higher shear rate causes a merging of the circles, which means an increase in the ring width and a decrease in their number. Also, the disappearance of the circle structures in the outer part of the sample prepared from the low-viscosity medium (suspension S1) occurs in shorter times as the intensity of the shearing increases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-1045389X12443595">Figure 9</xref>). In contrast, the circles in the sample with the high-viscosity medium (suspension S2) are stable in time in all ranges of the shear rates used (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10-1045389X12443595">Figure 10</xref>). Here, it may be assumed that the lower mobility of particles reduces the influence of the hydrodynamic forces.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>The investigation of the development of secondary ring structures in flowing ER suspensions demonstrated a very important effect of the sequence of application of the electric field and the shear on the morphology of the chains of polarized particles and time dependence of ER suspension properties.
