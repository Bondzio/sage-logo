<abstract>
<p>Cardiac arrest following aortic dissection carries high morbidity and mortality, primarily due to poor neurological outcomes. Most efforts are directed towards perfusing vital organs and replenishing oxygen and adenosine triphosphate (ATP) stores during and immediately after arrest. Methods of reperfusion (including external cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), open CPR, extracorporeal life support and ventricular assist devices) and other ATP preservation methods, such as pharmaceutical agents and hypothermia, are maximally beneficial only if started early during cardiac arrest. We describe a case of aortic rupture with arrest on the table which was re-perfused after 20 minutes, using cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB), but still managed to recover without neurological sequelae.</p>

<title>Case</title>
<p>A 30-year-old male without any co-morbidity presented with complaints of acute onset burning chest pain without any radiation and lower limb pain for one day. With no other significant history, the general examination and vitals were normal except for bilateral feeble lower limb pulses and cold right lower limb distal to the knee. Hematological and biochemical parameters were normal. Doppler showed decreased flow in both lower limb vessels. Computed tomography (CT) angio showed type A aortic dissection from the root of the aorta to the right common iliac artery, involving the renal artery on the left side. Transthoracic echo showed a dissecting flap above the aortic valve. The patient was moved to the high dependency unit, stabilized and preparations were made for urgent surgery. Inside the operating room, monitoring consisted of electrocardiography (ECG), pulse oximetry, right radial invasive pressure, central venous pressure (right internal jugular vein), end tidal carbon dioxide, nasopharyngeal temperature (placed after induction) using a monitor attached to the S5 Avance Anesthesia Work Station (Datex Ohmeda, Helenski, Finland) and a bispectral index (BIS, Aspect Medical Systems, Newton, MA, USA) with a BIS module on the same monitor. All data were logged onto a computer. The patient was induced with 5 µg.kg<sup>-1</sup> fentanyl followed by titrated propofol doses to a target BIS of 50 and maintained on a propofol infusion titrated to a BIS of 40-50. Esmolol was used to control the heart rate and blood pressure. A transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) probe was inserted. While dissecting the axillary vessels, there was sudden hypotension, with a drop in the mean arterial pressure from 67 mmHg to 11 mmHg with the TEE showing features of aortic rupture into pericardium. An immediate sternotomy was done. Three mg/kg of heparin was given through the central line and 150 mg sprayed on the surgical field after opening the pericardium. The left ventricle (LV) apex was lifted and cannulated using a 20 Fr femoral artery cannula (Fem-Flex femoral cannula, Edwards Lifesciences, Nyon, Switzerland.) after taking care of the epicardial coronaries. The cannula was advanced through the aortic valve to the base of the arch and CPB instituted by temporarily holding the tear manually. The patient was cooled simultaneously and cerebroprotective measures (magnesium sulphate 60 mg/kg and thiopentone sodium 250 mg) started. The BIS decreased from 40 to less than 10 within a minute of arrest. Time from arrest to institution of CPB was 20 minutes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0267659112469550">Figure 1</xref>). No chest compression or inotrope was given as it would have been fruitless in view of the ruptured aorta with pericardial tamponade. The aorta was repaired under deep hypothermic cardiac arrest (DHCA) at 20°C. Following surgical repair, the patient was weaned off bypass at 32°C, with minimal inotropes, and shifted to the intensive care unit (ICU) for elective ventilation. Postoperative neuro-protective measures included mild hypothermia (rectal temperature 34 - 35°C), euglycemia (100 - 180 mg%), normocapnia (PaCO<sub>2</sub> 35 ± 5 mmHg) and pharmacological measures such as phenytoin (3 mg/kg/dose IV TDS) and propofol sedation. The Glasgow coma score (GCS) assessed at 24 hours post-op showed E<sub>4</sub>V<sub>t</sub>M<sub>5</sub>. The patient had increasing serum creatinine following the second post-op day, with decreasing right lower limb perfusion. Hemodialysis was started for acute renal failure (ARF) and right lower limb amputation was performed on the fifth day. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) on the fifth post-op day was normal. The patient was tracheostomized on post-op day 7 for residual cognitive dysfunction. Neurological status and renal parameters gradually improved and he became fully conscious on post-op day nine. The dialysis frequency was decreased and later stopped on post-op day 15. The patient was decannulated after successful weaning and was discharged a month after admission without any obvious neurological sequelae.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The ideal method of perfusing vital organs such as the brain and heart during periods of circulatory arrest has been a topic of debate for a long time.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0267659112469550">1</xref></sup> Conventional CPR is the standard of care now, considering the ease of availability, simplicity of algorithms and world-wide acceptance. However, conventional CPR often is unable to generate adequate perfusion pressure.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0267659112469550">2</xref></sup> Also, the practice of giving adrenaline during CPR is being questioned, with adverse effects such as increased tissue lactate levels due to β stimulation,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0267659112469550">3</xref></sup> increased myocardial oxygen consumption<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0267659112469550">4</xref></sup> and an increase in ventilation perfusion mismatch being proposed.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0267659112469550">5</xref></sup></p>
<p>The time lapse between the arrest and onset of CPR is critical in outcome, with more than 70% mortality rates for a duration &gt;10 minutes. Trummer et al. compared the outcome in pigs which were resuscitated either with CPR or with CPB after 15 minutes of ventricular fibrillation (VF) and found that the survival rates were higher in animals in the CPB group with good neurological outcomes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0267659112469550">6</xref></sup> Data on humans with delayed onset resuscitation with successful recovery is scant, being restricted to special clinical situations such as drowning, where hypothermia is a major factor for successful recovery.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0267659112469550">7</xref></sup> In this case, circulation was restored after 20 minutes of witnessed normothermic cardiac arrest, using CPB, with no obvious neurological sequelae.</p>
<p>Few other factors could have played a crucial role in the outcome of this patient. The ventilator and hemodynamic parameters of the patient were optimal before the arrest. The patient received 100% oxygen. There was no state of low cardiac output before the arrest. The patient received a propofol infusion and was sedated before the arrest, reducing the cerebral oxygen requirement. General anesthetics have been shown to have neuroprotective actions in models of anoxia and glutamate-receptor-mediated toxicity. Propofol enhances GABA-mediated synaptic transmission in adult brain slices by both presynaptic and postsynaptic mechanisms.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0267659112469550">8</xref></sup> Propofol also attenuates increases in intracellular Na+ and Ca<sub>2</sub>+ induced by anoxia. Propofol is a potent antioxidant and has been shown to directly scavenge free radicals and is an inhibitor of lipid peroxidation.</p>
<p>Although the patient was normothermic during the arrest, he was cooled immediately after going on CPB and was kept hypothermic for 24 hours. Mild therapeutic hypothermia has been demonstrated to improve neurological recovery and has been recommended in every patient who is unable to follow commands after the return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC). In the indexed case, the patient was immediately cooled after going on CPB, which greatly reduced the metabolic demands of the vital organs. The optimal temperature recommended is 32 to 34°C and the duration of induced hypothermia should be for at least 12 hours and may be &gt;24 hours. Techniques described for cooling include the use of cooling blankets, the application of ice bags, the infusion of iced saline and the use of endovascular coils. We cooled the patient during CPB and maintained the temperature level postoperatively for 24 hours, using a cold-water blanket and adequate sedation.</p>
<p>Thus, it is obvious from this case that prolonged arrests without chest compressions or other vasoactive medications are not contraindications for resuscitation and survival is still possible without any neurological morbidity if optimal post-resuscitation care is provided. Hypothermia should be considered in all patients who have ROSC after resuscitation.</p>
