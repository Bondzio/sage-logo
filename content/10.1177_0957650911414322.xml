<abstract>
<p>The prediction of the complex flows within a turbomachinery remains a challenging issue for computational fluid dynamics (CFD). The real features of a turbomachinery must be taken into account in the simulation but they increase its complexity. One of these features is the leakage flow due to the axial gap between the fixed and rotating parts of the hub. This article focuses on this flow within the scope of a high-pressure compressor. The results are compared with experimental data obtained in the main flow path. The leakage flow is characterized by several vortices, especially near the hub and between the seal-teeth. It interacts with the main flow: the hub separation is quite wider while the casing one is reduced in comparison with the smooth case. In this article, the smooth case is related to the simulation without any shrouded stator cavity. The leakage flow influences strongly on compressor performances. Taking into account the leakage flow in the CFD improves the agreement between CFD and experimental values. Due to the vortex prediction, the influence of the turbulence modelling is also assessed. The explicit algebraic Reynolds stress model improves the flow prediction while the presently investigated differential Reynolds stress model predicts too wide hub corner separation which leads to high underestimation of compressor performances.</p>

<sec id="sec1-0957650911414322" sec-type="intro"><title>1 INTRODUCTION</title>
<p>The flow inside a high-pressure compressor is intrinsically complex due to rotating blades, endwalls, secondary flows, and leakage flows. The leakage flows can be generated by bleed slots, tip clearances, variable stator, or the axial clearances which are present upstream and downstream of a shrouded blade. Among these flows, only the tip clearance leakage flows are generally taken into account in computational fluid dynamics (CFD), while all of them have a significant impact on the blockage and performances. This article deals with the leakage flow within the shrouded stator cavity in a high-pressure compressor. Thus, due to the pressure increase across the stator, the leakage flow is aspirated from the main flow path downstream of the stator blade and is injected again into the main flow path upstream of this blade.</p>
<p>Jefferson and Turner [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0957650911414322">1</xref>] showed a significant deterioration in multi-stage compressor performance due to the increase of the leakage massflow with seal-tooth clearance. More recent studies confirmed the decrease of the compressor efficiency as seal-tooth leakage increases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0957650911414322">2</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0957650911414322">4</xref>]. Wellborn and Okiishi [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0957650911414322">5</xref>] assessed the influence of shrouded stator leakage flow on a multi-stage compressor performance. They showed for every 1 per cent increase in seal-tooth clearance-to-span ratio, the pressure rise decreases nearly 3 per cent and the efficiency is reduced by 1 point. The higher the blade loading is, the higher the degradation is. The performance degradation is not only due to the direct alteration of the shrouded blade performance near endwalls but also to the modified exit flow conditions, which decrease the work input of the downstream rotor and increase the total pressure loss of the downstream stator.</p>
<p>Some studies also concern the stator shroud leakage flow and its interaction with the main flow. Demargne and Longley [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0957650911414322">6</xref>] investigated this interaction using a linear cascade. They studied the influence of the leakage massflow and the tangential velocity at the cavity exit. The degradation of the performance due to leakage massflow increase is confirmed by experimental measurements. On the contrary, the increase of tangential velocity improves performances. They also showed that the interaction modifies the spanwise distribution of the blockage, flow turning, and loss at the stator passage exit. Wellborn [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0957650911414322">7</xref>] also studied this flow interaction and demonstrated that the flow structure within the cavity is characterized by spatial and temporal variations. In the spanwise direction, the momentum difference between the cavity and the main flow path is adjusted in a shear layer near the interface. The circumferential variation is mainly driven by the upstream potential influence of the downstream blade. Demargne and Longley [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0957650911414322">6</xref>] and Wellborn [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0957650911414322">7</xref>] highlighted the appearance of vortical structures within the cavity. The position and structure of these vortices depend on the cavity geometry. The influence of shrouded blades in turbine is also studied by Gier <italic>et al.</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0957650911414322">8</xref>] and Adami <italic>et al.</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0957650911414322">9</xref>]. All these presented studies shows that the shroud leakage effect must be taken into account in the numerical simulations.</p>
<p>An accurate description of the turbulence is essential to properly simulate both the main and the leakage flows. The complex geometry and the high Reynolds number do not allow the use of direct numerical simulation (DNS) or large eddy simulation (LES) in spite of computer power increase. Reynolds averaged Navier–Stokes (RANS) approach is currently used. The practice in turbomachinery is to use two-equation models to close the Navier–Stokes equations. Recently Sharma <italic>et al.</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0957650911414322">10</xref>], Marty <italic>et al.</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0957650911414322">11</xref>], and Marty <italic>et al.</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0957650911414322">12</xref>] studied the influence of the turbulence modelling on the flow and performance predictions in a high-pressure compressor. They showed the prediction improvement, thanks to explicit algebraic Reynolds stress model (EARSM) or differential Reynolds stress model (DRSM). The influence of these turbulence models is also assessed in this study.</p>
<p>As this article is based upon a high-pressure compressor, the experimental facility CREATE and its numerical modelling are described. This article tackles the leakage flow within the cavity which is first characterized. The influences of the operating point and of the turbulence modelling on this flow are secondly detailed. This article finally focuses on the interaction of the leakage and main flows and on the effect of this interaction on performances. It should be noticed that the simulation without any cavity is referenced as the smooth case.</p></sec>

<sec id="sec3-0957650911414322"><title>2.1 CREATE experimental compressor</title>
<p>The experimental configuration used for this investigation is the three-stage CREATE experimental compressor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0957650911414322">Fig. 1</xref>) located at Acoustic and Fluid Mechanics Laboratory (LMFA-Lyon). This compressor is representative of median or rear stages of a modern, highly loaded multi-stage one. On the CREATE compressor, the number of blades of each rotor and stator is a multiple of 16. All stators were shrouded with three labyrinth seal-teeth in the cavity. The rotational speed is 11 500 r/min and the design massflow 12.7 kg/s. The three stages allow to reach flow conditions close to the ones in a realistic compressor. Experimental data have been obtained through detailed instrumentation of the compressor, using both pneumatic measurements and laser Doppler anemometry techniques at several measurement planes. The measurements are performed in the circumferential direction at different constant radius locations downstream of each row. As the spatial periodicity of the compressor is 22.5°, the azimuth measurements allow aerodynamic phenomena interacting over a complete spatial period to be represented. In order to have traversing probes between blade and vane rows, the axial gap was slightly increased compared to current compressors. A detailed description of the compressor is provided by Touyeras and Villain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0957650911414322">13</xref>] and by Arnaud <italic>et al</italic>.

<sec id="sec4-0957650911414322"><title>2.2 Compressor modelling</title>
<p>Steady computations were run on the three-stages of the compressor and carried out using the <italic>elsA</italic> software developed by ONERA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0957650911414322">16</xref>]. The <italic>elsA</italic> code is a versatile CFD tool allowing a wide choice of turbulence models and numerical schemes. <italic>elsA</italic> solves the mass-weighted averaged Navier–Stokes equations on structured meshes with a cell-centred finite-volume technique. The numerical parameters have been tested in a former study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0957650911414322">11</xref>] and the followings were retained: second-order Jameson scheme for spatial discretization, LUSSOR method with the backward Euler time integration scheme. Multi-stage effects are accounted for through the classic mixing plane approach. Other compressor modelling details are given in Marty <italic>et al.</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0957650911414322">12</xref>].</p>
<p>The main flow path mesh is based upon a multi-block strategy and was generated using Numeca's Autogrid 5 meshing tool using a O3H topology (6.8 million points). It is composed of 85 radial grid points with 25 points in the tip-clearance gap. Each shrouded stator cavity mesh is composed of 2.5 million points. Grid quality was checked by looking at the values of <italic>y</italic><sup>+</sup> on solid walls which were found to be lower than 1 for all models used, except in the shrouded stator cavity where the maximum values are close to 4.</p>
<p>Three turbulence models are assessed in this study: the two-equation model <italic>k</italic>−<italic>l</italic> of Smith [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0957650911414322">17</xref>] which is based upon the Boussinesq hypothesis, the explicit algebraic Reynolds stress model of Wallin and Johansson [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0957650911414322">18</xref>], and the differential Reynolds stress model of Speziale <italic>et al.</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0957650911414322">19</xref>]. More details are given in Marty <italic>et al.</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0957650911414322">12</xref>].</p>
<p>The goal of this study is the evaluation of the leakage flow influence on main flow and performances. Some computations are performed without the shrouded stator cavity. For the shrouded stator configuration computations, the cavity is joined to the main flow path domain, thanks to the Chimera technique [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0957650911414322">20</xref>]. The different meshes are overlapped near the hub, upstream, or downstream of each stator row.</p></sec></sec>

<sec id="sec6-0957650911414322"><title>3.1 Shrouded stator flow</title>
<p>In order to avoid an enlarged effect due to multi-stage computation, the shrouded stator cavity influence is only analysed for the first stator. Simulations reveal that inside the shrouded stator cavity, a complex flow structure develops. It is driven by the geometry of the cavity, especially the seal-teeth. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0957650911414322">Figure 2</xref>(a) shows a schematic view of this flow structure. Several vortical motions are predicted inside the cavity at the nominal operating point (NP). They result from the cavity geometry and the massflow adaptation process, which is a function of the static pressure increase in the stator passage. It is only a two-dimensional view but the rotor and the stator walls induce a three-dimensional flow. The vortices are convected in the azimuthal direction. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0957650911414322">Figure 2</xref>(b) indicates that vortices are mainly predicted near the hub both upstream and downstream of the stator blade and also close to the seal-teeth. This prediction is obtained with the <italic>k</italic>−<italic>l</italic> model of Smith [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0957650911414322">17</xref>]. The flow from the main flow path enters the cavity and is driven into the cavity, creating a vortex. The vortex size is directly linked to the axial gap and to the cavity geometry. Then, the flow is directed towards the seal-teeth due to the negative axial and radial velocities. Near the first seal-tooth, the streamlines show a strong flow contraction. It results in higher viscous effect. This is the first part of the total pressure loss, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0957650911414322">Fig. 2</xref>(b). At the same time, the potential energy is converted into kinetic energy. After the throat, the flow enters in a cavity, separates due to the high angle of the cavity geometry and creates a vortex where the kinetic energy is dissipated and leads to an increase of the static temperature and to another total pressure decrease. The jet bursting dissipates also the energy. This process is repeated with the following seal-teeth. After the last seal-tooth, the jet bursting induces energy dissipation and a vortex creation like downstream of a backward-facing step. A large part of the flow is directed towards the upstream gap and is injected into the main flow path, resulting in a significant interaction as detailed later. The flow within the cavity is characterized by the following Reynolds numbers: <inline-formula id="ilm1-0957650911414322"><mml:math xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="inline" id="mml-math1-0957650911414322"><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>Re</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>x</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>=</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:mi>ρ</mml:mi><mml:mi>h</mml:mi><mml:msub><mml:mi>V</mml:mi><mml:mi>x</mml:mi></mml:msub></mml:mrow><mml:mi>μ</mml:mi></mml:mfrac></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mo>≈</mml:mo><mml:mn>4000</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula> and <inline-formula id="ilm2-0957650911414322"><mml:math xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="inline" id="mml-math2-0957650911414322"><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>Re</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>θ</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>=</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:mi>ρ</mml:mi><mml:mi>h</mml:mi><mml:msub><mml:mi>V</mml:mi><mml:mi>θ</mml:mi></mml:msub></mml:mrow><mml:mi>μ</mml:mi></mml:mfrac></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mo>≈</mml:mo><mml:mn>8000</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula>. Here, <italic>h</italic>, <italic>V</italic><sub><italic>x</italic></sub>, and <italic>V</italic><sub>θ</sub>, are, respectively, the radial gap height of the teeth, the mean axial velocity above the teeth, and the circumferential velocity at the teeth wall. These Reynolds numbers are clearly small in the vicinity of the teeth. The reverse transition should have a significant influence but this one is not taken into account in this study.
<fig id="fig2-0957650911414322" position="float"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><p>Flow structures within the cavity</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0957650911414322-fig2.tif"/></fig></p>
<p>Due to the fixed and mobile walls, the flow structures must develop in the azimuthal direction. The leakage flow parameters (velocity, static pressure, and temperature, etc.) have an azimuthal variation only in the cavity part near the hub downstream of the stator blade. This azimuthal variation is due to the stator effect, especially its potential effect. At a certain distance from the flow entry, this variation vanishes and these parameters do not depend on the azimuth.</p>
<p>The previous results are relative to the NP point. The load variation induces a modification of the static pressure increase in the stator passage. Thus, the operating point must have an influence on the leakage flow. The axial velocity fields inside the cavity for three different operating points are depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0957650911414322">Figs 3</xref>(a) to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0957650911414322"/>(c), respectively, for the near choke (NC), nominal (NP), and near surge (NS) operating points. There are only small discrepancies due to the blade load variation. As the stator influence vanishes within the cavity, only a global effect remains. This one only changes the velocity levels, while the flow structure is quite independent of the operating point. The velocity level variation is confirmed by <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0957650911414322">Fig. 3</xref>(d), which shows the leakage massflow and the static pressure increase as a function of the operating point. The comparison of these evolutions indicates that the massflow variation does not only depend on the static pressure difference in the stator passage.
<fig id="fig3-0957650911414322" position="float"><label>Fig. 3</label><caption><p>Axial velocity field in a plane at a given azimuth for the three operating points and the KL model</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0957650911414322-fig3.tif"/></fig></p>
<p>The structure of the flow within the cavity involves vortices. Generally, the vortex prediction depends strongly on the turbulence modelling. Some advanced turbulence models have been previously assessed without the shrouded stator cavity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0957650911414322">12</xref>]. These models are the EARSM model of Wallin and Johansson [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0957650911414322">18</xref>] and the DRSM model of Speziale <italic>et al.</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0957650911414322">19</xref>]. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0957650911414322">Figure 4</xref> shows the radial velocity in an azimuthal plane for the three different turbulence models. In this case, the flow structure is quite similar. The main differences are the radial velocity levels. The increasing complexity of the turbulence modelling leads to vortices characterized by higher vorticity.
<fig id="fig4-0957650911414322" position="float"><label>Fig. 4</label><caption><p>Radial velocity field in a plane at a given azimuth for the KL, EARSM–WJ, and DRSM–SSG models at the NP point</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0957650911414322-fig4.tif"/></fig></p></sec>
<sec id="sec7-0957650911414322"><title>3.2 Flow structure at hub level</title>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0957650911414322">Figure 5</xref> shows the axial, radial, and azimuthal velocity at hub level. Upstream of the stator blade the highest axial and radial velocities are, respectively, observed at mid-pitch and close to the leading edge. The higher radial velocity areas are also characterized by lower azimuthal velocity, especially near the stator hub. The pressure field induced by the stator prevents the leakage flow injection in the vicinity of the blade. The injection takes place mainly further pitchwise which explains the azimuthal variation of velocities.
<fig id="fig5-0957650911414322" position="float"><label>Fig. 5</label><caption><p>Axial, radial, and azimuthal velocity field at hub level for the NP point predicted by the KL model</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0957650911414322-fig5.tif"/></fig></p>
<p>Downstream of the stator blade, the flow bleed is more intense close to the trailing edge, especially near the pressure side (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0957650911414322">Fig. 5</xref>). This is due to the potential effect of the stator and the hub corner separation on suction side. The highest axial velocity is observed on pressure side. The velocity level decreases from the pressure side to mid-pitch. For similar reason, the radial velocity is higher near the trailing edge on the pressure side and lower at mid-pitch. The pressure field also induces a high-azimuthal velocity near the pressure side of the trailing edge. Once the leakage flow is far from the blade, the velocity decreases.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0957650911414322">Figure 6</xref> shows the radial velocity field close to the upstream axial gap and the streamlines relative to the leakage flow which exits the cavity and interacts with the main flow. The turbulence modelling has a significant influence on the leakage flow prediction. Due to the radial velocity level difference, the leakage flow enters more or less deeply the main flow path. It results in an influence of the turbulence model on the interaction with the main flow. Therefore, the DRSM–SSG (Speziale-Sarkar-Gatski) model predicts a stronger interaction with the low-momentum flow near the hub, as the hub corner separation. The turbulence modelling has a weaker influence on the prediction of the bled flow at hub level. The throttle effect is quite similar. The higher the blade load, the deeper the leakage flow enters into the main flow. This effect is not shown in this article. Nevertheless, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0957650911414322">Fig. 3</xref>(d) shows that the leakage massflow increases as a function of the blade load. The velocity levels near the upstream axial gap are higher for the NS point than for the NP point. The leakage flow enters deeper into the main flow for the NS point.
<fig id="fig6-0957650911414322" position="float"><label>Fig. 6</label><caption><p>Radial velocity field and streamlines upstream of the first stator for the NP point</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0957650911414322-fig6.tif"/></fig></p></sec>
<sec id="sec8-0957650911414322"><title>3.3 Interaction with the main flow path</title>
<p>After entering into the main flow path, the leakage flow interacts with the main flow. First, the leakage flow is directed towards the pressure side of a stator blade (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0957650911414322">Fig. 6</xref>). Then, the streamlines indicate that the leakage flow is driven by the pressure gradient in the stator passage and is directed towards the suction side of the adjacent blade. Due to the compressor throttle, the pressure gradient increases along the operating line. Thus, it strengthens the reorientation towards the low-momentum flow in the vicinity of the hub and suction side walls. It results in a stronger interaction with the hub corner separation at NS point than predicted at NC point.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0957650911414322">Figure 7</xref> depicts the wall streamlines on casing, blade, and hub walls for the NP point. The comparison of the KL computations allows the cavity effect assessment. Due to the leakage flow interaction, the casing corner separation is smaller with the cavity, but the hub corner separation is wider. Thus, the leakage flow has a significant influence on the spanwise load distribution and on the boundary layer development. The turbulence models influence also the prediction of the wall streamlines and the separations. The EARSM–WJ prediction is quite similar to the KL one, while the DRSM–SSG predicts a more significant separation.
<fig id="fig7-0957650911414322" position="float"><label>Fig. 7</label><caption><p>Wall streamlines on casing, blade, and hub walls (from top to bottom) at NP point</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0957650911414322-fig7.tif"/></fig></p>
<p>All previous results concern the first stator. The global effect of the leakage flow is now analysed. The Mach number distribution in the measurement plane located downstream of the third stator is depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-0957650911414322">Fig. 8</xref>. Close to the hub, the Mach number is weaker due to the presence of the leakage flow. Under 20 per cent spanwise, the wake is quite thicker when the cavity is taken into account. On the contrary, on the upper part of the main flow path, the predicted wake is thinner with the cavity. The casing corner separation which leads to this wake thickening is reduced for the simulation with the leakage flow. The Mach number distribution predicted with the shrouded stator is closer to the experimental data in comparison with the smooth case. The EARSM–WJ (Wallin-Johansson) model predicts thinner wakes. Thus, this turbulence model improves the prediction. On the contrary, the DRSM–SSG overestimates the separations on all blades. The wake thickness and the blockage are higher than the measured ones.

<p>As previously shown, the interaction between the leakage and the main flows involves the modification of the boundary layer development on the whole blade and of the load distribution. The radial profiles of the absolute deviation angle and total pressure in the last measurement plane which is located downstream of the third stator are plotted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-0957650911414322">Fig. 9</xref> for the NP point. The squares represent the experimental data. Taking the leakage flow into account and/or modelling the turbulence with the EARSM–WJ model improves the prediction of the absolute deviation angle. The overestimation of this parameter is reduced and is relative to a smaller span range. The DRSM–SSG model prediction differs from the experimental data due to lower velocity as previously shown by the Mach number distribution. On the absolute total pressure profiles, the best fit is obtained with the EARSM–WJ model and the cavity. Despite an underestimation near the casing, the prediction is close to the experimental profile. The KL model without the cavity overestimates the total pressure level especially near the hub. With the leakage flow, this overestimation is significantly reduced. On the contrary, the DRSM–SSG model considerably underestimates the compression through the whole compressor. It is due to the prediction of larger separation area for each blade.

<sec id="sec9-0957650911414322"><title>3.4 Compressor performances</title>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10-0957650911414322">Figure 10</xref> shows the compressor performances such as massflow, compression ratio, and isentropic efficiency. Without the cavity, the NC line is well predicted. The difference between the prediction and the experimental data is nearly 0.5 per cent which is twice smaller than the measurement uncertainties (1 per cent). With the cavity, the blockage is overestimated due to the interaction between the leakage and main flows and to wider hub corner stall. Thus, the massflow at NC line is underestimated by 1.15 per cent. Only two operating points were simulated with the advanced turbulence models. The EARSM–WJ model has a similar prediction of the massflow at choke line, while the DRSM–SSG fails to correctly predict the choke line due to wider separation on all walls.
<fig id="fig10-0957650911414322" position="float"><label>Fig. 10</label><caption><p>Compressor maps</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0957650911414322-fig10.tif"/></fig></p>
<p>The evolution of the compression ratio with the throttle increase is better captured with the leakage flow. At NS line, the compression ratio is overestimated by 4.1 per cent without any cavity, while the overestimation is only in the order of 2.3 per cent. The prediction of the NS line is improved by taking the leakage flow of stator shroud into account. The EARSM–WJ models improves also the compression ratio, especially at NP point. For this operating point, the KL and the EARSM–WJ models overestimate, respectively, the compression ratio by 1 per cent and 0.3 per cent. Nevertheless, the robustness is currently insufficient to simulate the NS point with the advanced turbulence models because this operating point is too close to the numerical stability limit and taking the cavity into account reduces this robustness. The DRSM–SSG model underestimates the compression ratio for the two simulated operating points due to the separation prediction. The difference with the experimental data is nearly 3.6 per cent at NP point.</p>
<p>Taking the cavity into account in the simulation also improves the prediction of the isentropic efficiency along the compressor operating range. The efficiency levels are closer to the experimental data, and the operating point of maximum isentropic efficiency is better captured. Without cavity, the maximum efficiency is predicted at too high-compression ratio. The EARSM–WJ model leads to efficiency similar to the experimental one, while the DRSM–SSG strongly underestimates the isentropic efficiency due to the overestimation of the separations on blade walls. The difference with the experimental data is about 7.6 and 6.6 points, respectively, at NC and NP points.</p></sec></sec>
<sec id="sec10-0957650911414322" sec-type="conclusions"><title>4 CONCLUSIONS</title>
<p>This study focuses on the leakage flow due to shrouded stator of the three stage CREATE compressor. Its structure within the cavity is revealed: it consists of several vortices, especially near the hub and between the seal-teeth where the energy conversion process allows the static pressure drop through the cavity. The dissipation due to viscous effect induces total pressure loss inside the cavity. The location, number, and size of these vortices strongly depend on the cavity geometry. The influence of the operating point and of the turbulence modelling on prediction is also assessed. The discrepancies between predictions are quite small in the cavity but much higher in the main flow path. The flow injection and bleed are detailed, and the influence of the stator on these flows is brought to the fore. In the main flow path, the leakage flow interacts with the main flow, especially with the hub corner separation which is wider with the cavity, while the casing corner separation is reduced. The comparison with experimental data shows a prediction improvement in particular downstream of the third blade. The compression ratio and isentropic efficiency evolutions are better captured. The study of the turbulence modelling influence reveals the ability of the EARSM model to predict more accurately the global performances for the two simulated operating points. Further work concerns the robustness of the advanced turbulence models in order to simulate more than two operating points, especially near the surge limit and the simulation of the smooth case with these turbulence models. The next step is the simulation merging several aspects to improve the NS line and the surge margin prediction: real features, unsteady computation, advanced turbulence models, and transition prediction, first with RANS/URANS and finally with LES methods.</p></sec>
