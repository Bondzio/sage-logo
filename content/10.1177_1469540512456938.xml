<sec id="sec1-1469540512456938"><title>Michael K. Goodman, David Goodman and Michael Redclift (eds) (2010) <italic>Consuming Space: Placing Consumption in Perspective</italic>. Farnham: Ashgate. 282 pp. £65.00. ISBN 9 780 754 672 296</title>
<p>Nearly two decades ago, Nicky <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1469540512456938">Gregson (1995)</xref> asked whether (social) geography was coming to be ‘all about’ consumption, and here we are, witnessing the arrival of the latest collection of consuming geographies. What’s been achieved in the time since Gregson’s snipe? How does the geography of consumption now look? This book gives us a chance to see where we’re at, as a ‘field’ – who’s saying what? Who’s buying what?</p>
<p>The arrival of <italic>Consuming Space</italic> on my desk also made me pause for thought in my own Gregsonian moment (not exactly Proustian, but …). Another book <italic>consuming space</italic> in my life, in my office, on my shelves – joining the cluttered piles of work on consumption that unbalance my work-life. In an already crowded marketplace, what are this product’s unique selling points (USPs)? How will this book entice the would-be consumption-theory-shopper to part with their cash? In short, <italic>who will buy this book?</italic></p>
<p>It sells itself partly on pedigree: it emerges, like so much of the stuff that surrounds me, from the UK AHRC/ESRC Cultures of Consumption programme. That programme represents a high water mark in critical studies of consumption, funding a great smorgasbord of projects picking away at our shopping and eating habits, our clothes and houses and holidays – and pointing out their meanings, values, ethics, practices. And here are chapters on boutique hotels, Chilean wine, chicken, teak, foodies and tourists and fair traders and … Like a theorists’ supermarket sweep, the book does a trolley dash through the aisles; but if we were to analyse its basket at the till, what would we see? An ‘unmanageable consumer’, an omnivore, someone flexing their cultural capital, or, to borrow a Baudrillard slogan from Dave Clarke’s chapter, do we see in this book-basket ‘the total promiscuity of things’?</p>
<p>To be honest, this book’s arrival made me depressed (and I <italic>like</italic> shopping). Opening its covers feels like that moment of too-much-choice-so-can’t-choose that I sometimes feel in the supermarket or sandwich shop. I’m hungry, but can’t see anything I really want to eat. Taken separately, there’s much to commend the chapters here, but taken together – offered side by side, like so many tins of soup, I have difficulty choosing, and go home soupless. It’s overabundant. Don’t get me wrong: there’s clever stuff in here, and useful stuff. It’s just that there’s <italic>too much choice</italic> – of topic, of approach. <italic>I simply don’t know how to think about shopping any more</italic>.</p>
<p>I’m struggling to self-diagnose the malady this book has brought out in me (Clarke’s discussion of fetishism and seduction helps a bit). Is it <italic>because it’s a book</italic>? Normally I love books, love the bookness of books – but in this case maybe the issue is the format, the packaging. Assembled in this way, it’s hard to get your hands around. It’s like a compilation (<italic>Now That’s What I Call Consumption</italic>?) – all I can do is shuffle through it, with the detached unattention of the channel surfer, or the taster-menu eater (to mix metaphors). Has consumption <italic>consumed</italic> geography? If back in the mid-1990s it was ‘all consumption’, what is it now?</p>
<p>Final contradictory comment (hey, it’s ok, consumption <italic>is</italic> contradictory): Ashgate, in continuing to see merit in publishing edited collections (even if only in hard covers) is to be commended for bucking a market trend. But, in this particular case, the book has left me feeling full but oddly unsatisfied.</p>
