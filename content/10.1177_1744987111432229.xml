<p>Many countries, including those in the United Kingdom, invest in targeted therapeutic interventions for specific groups in our communities. This paper makes a useful new contribution to the evidence reinforcing the legitimacy of this policy position in Australia. These programmes all seek to improve health outcomes for children and families who are, to quote the authors of this study ‘at risk of poorer maternal and child health and development outcomes’. (The criteria they used for assessing this risk are clearly defined, and using midwives to deliver the 12-question antenatal psychosocial questionnaire probably provides an opportunity for preventative intervention.) In addition, the use of the Edinburgh Depression Scale (also known as the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale), which is usually self-completed, helps validate the assessment of risk.</p>
<p>However, the complexity of measuring the impact of interventions concurrently with their delivery is a challenge which the MECSH study has sought to overcome. Issues such as controlling interaction between the intervention group and their non-selected peers and the inability to blind or for the researcher to remain ‘disinterested’, are well explored and provide a fascinating insight into the research.</p>
<p>This study is most useful in its universality of application. In England, a recently published recommendation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1744987111432229">Department of Health, 2011b</xref>) noted amongst its stated aims that the national health service should provide and/or enable access to additional tailored care packages and support according to family need. There is also a requirement to develop community capacity. In addition, England has a Health Visitor Implementation Plan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1744987111432229">Department of Health, 2011</xref>), which is designed around services readily recognised as similar to those of the MECSH. These include Universal Plus, a rapid response service for parents with additional childrearing problems such as postnatal depression, sleepless baby etc., and universal partnership, which also includes the Family Nurse Partnership Programme.</p>
<p>The MECSH study compares with, and builds upon, the USA-based Nurse Family Partnership Programme, which was developed primarily for first-time teenage mothers. However, the MECSH programme focuses on a wider group of vulnerable families.</p>
<p>The challenges faced by the researchers in maintaining an ethically appropriate service, whilst attempting to deliver an enhanced service to one cohort, leads to an interesting analysis on a range of aspects which this type of hybrid research generates. The authors sensitively consider the policies employed, the suitability of using individual randomised research designs versus community of cluster randomisation, whilst noting the impossibility of keeping individual families apart within a close knit community. Some side effects created unexpected benefits. The community-based intervention is aimed at enhancing a mother’s confidence in her parenting skills and strengthening her social support networks. Evidence of this achievement was demonstrated when MECSH intervention mothers passed resources or information to the non MECSH mothers. This could, in any other study, have been seen as contaminating the outcome of the non-MECSH group. However, the researchers noted the value of this interaction, as one of the aims of the study was to improve confidence in maternal parenting skills and social interactions. Thus, they rethought the definition of ‘contamination’. Throughout this paper there are references to the ‘real world’, with a deep understanding of the need to shift from being the expert to providing expert support.</p>
<p>One of the joys of this paper is its acknowledgement of the unexpected benefits. For example, documenting the poor development outcomes for children in the community and the issues families face in accessing services. Another was the input on establishing appropriate boundaries for the delivery of home visiting services in cases of child protection, and a memorandum of understanding with child protection services was drawn up. Indeed, the ready acknowledgement of the value of service engagement and of the researchers understanding of services is refreshing to those in practice. The researchers not only recognised the importance of having the right organisation to support research, but also one which will alter its features to support the new intervention rather than alter the intervention.</p>
<p>Overall, this paper offers an optimistic illustration of how hybrid research can overcome, or benefit from, the multitude of factors influencing outcome. The models and the results are readily applicable outside the Australian Health Service and could prove a valuable resource for others, whether those anticipating embarking on such a programme themselves or on establishing a mechanism for managing hybrid research. The challenge for community health professionals, endeavouring to undertake research whilst working in areas they are unable to control, or randomise, or blind, is that their research cannot or will not be taken as seriously as that of the quantitative randomised controlled trials. This paper goes some way to dispelling that belief through its honesty, its strategies for analysis and its acceptance of the results.</p>

Her experience in writing, implementing and advising on guidelines, clinical audit and evidence-based practice have given her opportunities to work at a national level as well as supporting local NHS practitioners. Mary has also published extensively within these fields. She worked as a health visitor and managed community nursing services before becoming engaged in research, and it is her extensive background in community nursing which gives her a real understanding of both the challenges and the opportunities facing community health practitioners.</p></bio>
