         <abstract>
            <p>There is considerable controversy about the role of child sexual abuse in the etiology of anxiety disorders. Although a growing number of research studies have been published, these have produced inconsistent results and conclusions regarding the nature of the associations between child sexual abuse and the various forms of anxiety problems as well as the potential effects of third variables, such as moderators, mediators, or confounders. This article provides a systematic review of the several reviews that have investigated the literature on the role of child sexual abuse in the etiology of anxiety disorders. Seven databases were searched, supplemented with hand search of reference lists from retrieved papers. Four meta-analyses, including 3,214,482 subjects from 171 studies, were analyzed. There is evidence that child sexual abuse is a significant, although general and nonspecific, risk factor for anxiety disorders, especially posttraumatic stress disorder, regardless of gender of the victim and severity of abuse. Additional biological or psychosocial risk factors (such as alterations in brain structure or function, information processing biases, parental anxiety disorders, family dysfunction, and other forms of child abuse) may interact with child sexual abuse or act independently to cause anxiety disorders in victims in abuse survivors. However, child sexual abuse may sometimes confer additional risk of developing anxiety disorders either as a distal and indirect cause or as a proximal and direct cause. Child sexual abuse should be considered one of the several risk factors for anxiety disorders and included in multifactorial etiological models for anxiety disorders.</p>

         <p>Anxiety disorders are among the most common mental disorders worldwide. International epidemiologic studies show a 1-year prevalence of 10.6% and a lifetime prevalence of 16.6% in the adult population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr86-1524838012470032">Somers, Goldner, Waraich, &amp; Hsu, 2006</xref>). Anxiety disorders can cause a great deal of suffering as well as substantial disability in occupational and social functioning, strongly affecting the quality of life of patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-1524838012470032">Olatunji, Cisler, &amp; Tolin, 2007</xref>). In addition, these disorders impose considerable direct and indirect costs, especially those associated with lost productivity and treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1524838012470032">Konnopka, Leichsenring, Leibing, &amp; König, 2009</xref>). The recognition of the adverse social, economic, and personal consequences associated with anxiety disorders is reflected in the intensification of research in the etiology of these disorders. Research on the topic is aimed to highlight the factors that promote the development and maintenance of anxiety problems in order to implement prevention and treatment strategies.</p>
         <p>Research to date has shown that the etiology of anxiety disorders is complex. Both genetic and environmental factors appear to account for significant variance in the development of these disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1524838012470032">Afifi, Asmundson, Taylor, &amp; Jang, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1524838012470032">Gordon &amp; Hen, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1524838012470032">Gregory &amp; Eley, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1524838012470032">Hettema, Neale, &amp; Kendler, 2001</xref>). However, there is evidence that nonshared environmental factors (i.e., those factors in the environment that make siblings different from each other) are significantly stronger than any genetic influences measured to date (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1524838012470032">Gregory &amp; Eley, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1524838012470032">Hettema et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1524838012470032">Keane, Marshall, &amp; Taft, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-1524838012470032">Rapee, Schniering, &amp; Hudson, 2009</xref>). Early traumatic experiences, especially child abuse, are among the environmental factors potentially involved in the etiology of anxiety disorders that have received much attention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1524838012470032">Heim &amp; Nemeroff, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1524838012470032">Kaysen, Resick, &amp; Wise, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr82-1524838012470032">Rodriguez, Vande Kemp, &amp; Foy, 1998</xref>). </p>

            <title>Significance and Nature of the Relationship</title>
            <p>A growing number of studies investigating the potential link between childhood sexual abuse and later anxiety problems have been published over the past 20 years. Efforts to summarize the findings of these studies have resulted in several qualitative and quantitative reviews.</p>
            <p>The majority of these studies and literature reviews have suggested that child sexual abuse is a risk factor for the development of anxiety problems. Indeed, some reviews have stated that survivors of child sexual abuse show higher levels of anxiety symptoms or disorders (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1524838012470032">Black &amp; DeBlassie, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1524838012470032">Briere &amp; Elliot, 1994</xref>), especially posttraumatic stress disorder (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1524838012470032">Holmes &amp; Slap, 1998</xref>). In addition, several reviews have concluded that survivors of early sexual victimization are at increased risk for anxiety symptoms or disorders evidenced immediately after the event or with onset years later (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1524838012470032">Black &amp; DeBlassie, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1524838012470032">Bohn &amp; Holz, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1524838012470032">Briere &amp; Elliot, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1524838012470032">Briere &amp; Runtz, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1524838012470032">Browne &amp; Finkelhor, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1524838012470032">Fine, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1524838012470032">Holmes &amp; Slap, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1524838012470032">Murray, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr83-1524838012470032">Rowan &amp; Foy, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr94-1524838012470032">Valente, 2005</xref>). Most of these reviews have implied a causal association between child sexual abuse and anxiety problems, with some researchers explicitly stating that such association persists even when controlling for other variables that may be independently related to the development of anxiety disorders (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1524838012470032">Black &amp; DeBlassie, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1524838012470032">Briere &amp; Elliot, 1994</xref>). A number of reviews (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1524838012470032">Bohn &amp; Holz, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1524838012470032">Briere &amp; Elliot, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1524838012470032">Briere &amp; Runtz, 1993</xref>) have suggested that sexual abuse constitutes an acute traumatic event for the child, generating immediate phobic responses and anxiety-related symptoms, including posttraumatic stress symptoms as well as long-term, chronic sequelae, especially posttraumatic stress disorder. Some reviewers (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1524838012470032">Bohn &amp; Holz, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1524838012470032">Browne &amp; Finkelhor, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr94-1524838012470032">Valente, 2005</xref>) have considered anxiety symptoms and disorders, including panic, fear, phobias, and especially posttraumatic stress disorder, some of the most common responses to child sexual abuse, perhaps second only to depression as the most common sequelae of incest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1524838012470032">Fine, 1990</xref>). Among the various forms of anxiety disorders, posttraumatic stress disorder has been suggested to be the most prevalent psychological problem in child sexual abuse survivors (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1524838012470032">Briere &amp; Elliot, 1994</xref>). Posttraumatic stress disorder has been indicated as the diagnosis which best fits the syndrome commonly seen in victims of early sexual victimization (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr83-1524838012470032">Rowan &amp; Foy, 1993</xref>). According to a review (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1524838012470032">Murray, 1993</xref>), evidence that a relationship between child sexual abuse and posttraumatic stress disorder exists appears convincing.</p>
            <p>In contrast, other reviews have suggested that child sexual abuse is associated with anxiety problems, without necessarily implying a causal association between child sexual abuse and later anxiety symptoms or disorders. More specifically, many researchers (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1524838012470032">Beitchman et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1524838012470032">Kendall-Tackett, Williams, &amp; Finkelhor, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1524838012470032">Kuyken, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-1524838012470032">Nurcombe, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-1524838012470032">Polusny &amp; Follette, 1995</xref>) have expressed caution about a causal association between child sexual abuse and anxiety disorders. It has been stated that the specific effects of sexual abuse, independent of family variables, such as parental psychopathology, are still to be clarified (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1524838012470032">Beitchman et al., 1992</xref>). In addition, it has been suggested that firm conclusions related to the relationship between child sexual abuse and posttraumatic stress disorder cannot be made because the researchers have not controlled for the influence of physical abuse or other traumatic experiences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-1524838012470032">Polusny &amp; Follette, 1995</xref>). Furthermore, some reviews have suggested that anxiety symptoms or disorders, especially posttraumatic stress disorder, do not seem to be so highly prevalent, given that they are not found in many cases of child sexual abuse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1524838012470032">Green, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1524838012470032">Kendall-Tackett et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-1524838012470032">Nurcombe, 2000</xref>), particularly in victims of single episodes of abuse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1524838012470032">Green, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1524838012470032">Kaysen et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1524838012470032">Kendall-Tackett et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-1524838012470032">Nurcombe, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr92-1524838012470032">Terr, 1991</xref>).</p>
            <p>Thus, to date, research examining the role of child sexual abuse in the etiology of anxiety disorders has not led to unanimous conclusions. In fact, there are fundamental questions concerning the nature of the association between child sexual abuse and anxiety disorders that remain unanswered.</p>

            <title>Moderating Factors</title>
            <p>It has been hypothesized that certain factors, especially gender of the victim and severity of child sexual abuse, might moderate the relationship between child sexual abuse and anxiety problems (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1524838012470032">Freeman &amp; Morris, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1524838012470032">Hulme, 2004</xref>). </p>
            <p>For example, much empirical research (see, e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1524838012470032">Beitchman et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1524838012470032">Briere &amp; Elliot, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1524838012470032">Browne &amp; Finkelhor, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1524838012470032">Kendall-Tackett et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-1524838012470032">Polusny &amp; Follette, 1995</xref>) has suggested that the relationship between child sexual abuse and anxiety disorders seems to be greater for more severe and traumatic forms of sexual victimization, such as those involving force, violence, penetration, and multiple perpetrators. Nevertheless, these studies are not in agreement on the specific aspects of the abuse experience that should be considered as more traumatic and, thus, as factors that have the potential to increase the likelihood of anxiety symptoms or disorders. In fact, empirical research has highlighted a wide range of moderators concerning severity of child sexual abuse.

Moreover, it is unknown how and why more severe and traumatic forms of child sexual abuse may lead to increased anxiety problems. It has been proposed that severe forms of sexual victimization may lead to the development of anxiety problems, especially posttraumatic stress symptoms or disorders, because severity of child sexual abuse may influence a person’s reaction to such traumatic event (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr96-1524838012470032">Wolfe, Gentile, &amp; Wolfe, 1989</xref>). Alternatively, it has been hypothesized that the development of posttraumatic stress symptomatology may be due to physical injury, pain, or danger resulting from child sexual abuse (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1524838012470032">Browne &amp; Finkelhor, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr82-1524838012470032">Rodriguez et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr87-1524838012470032">Spaccarelli, 1994</xref>).</p>
            <p>The relation between gender of the victim and outcomes is even more equivocal. Indeed, some reviews have found high rates of anxiety symptoms or disorders in women who have been sexually abused as children (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1524838012470032">Bachmann, Moeller, &amp; Benett, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1524838012470032">Beitchman et al., 1992</xref>), suggesting that female survivors of child sexual abuse are more likely to develop anxiety problems than male victims of early sexual victimization (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-1524838012470032">Putnam, 2003</xref>). Nevertheless, other reviews (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1524838012470032">Black &amp; DeBlassie, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1524838012470032">Holmes &amp; Slap, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-1524838012470032">Nielsen, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr94-1524838012470032">Valente, 2005</xref>) have also shown great evidence of anxiety symptoms or disorders in males with a history of child sexual abuse. A recent meta-analysis of studies yielding sex-specific risk of potentially traumatic events and posttraumatic stress disorder (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr93-1524838012470032">Tolin &amp; Foa, 2006</xref>) showed no significant differences in prevalence and severity of posttraumatic stress disorder between male and female victims of child sexual abuse.</p>

            <title>Mediating Factors</title>
            <p>Theoretical models of how child sexual abuse affects children’s development have proposed certain factors that might mediate the relationship between child sexual abuse and anxiety problems (for reviews see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1524838012470032">Freeman &amp; Morris, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1524838012470032">Hulme, 2004</xref>). For example, according to theoretical models based on family dynamics (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1524838012470032">Finkelhor, 1984</xref>), a dysfunctional family environment is the source of many mediating variables, such as family structure, family functioning, parental support, parental nurturance, confused family roles, parental separation or divorce, parental alcoholism, and other forms of child abuse (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1524838012470032">Hulme, 2004</xref>). Nevertheless, empirical research aimed at investigating such hypotheses is scant. </p>
            <p>In sum, although efforts to conceptualize those factors that have the potential to moderate or mediate the relationship between child sexual abuse and anxiety problems are ongoing, empirical research has not led to unanimous conclusions, given that different studies and reviews have highlighted different moderators and mediators. </p>

         <title>Aims of the Study</title>
         <p>In sum, despite a large number of empirical studies and literature reviews, both studies and reviews have produced inconsistent results and conclusions. The inconsistency of the literature, in turn, has the potential to generate interpretative difficulties, uncertainties, mistaken beliefs, or confusion among those researchers and practitioners in the field who turn to this literature for guidance, including all professionals who are responsible for the welfare of children or are involved in the prevention and treatment of anxiety disorders. In response to these difficulties and uncertainties, this article provides a qualitative analysis of the findings of the several reviews that have investigated the literature on the relationship between child sexual abuse and anxiety disorders. By addressing the best available scientific evidence on the topic, this article is aimed at understanding how and why some people who have been sexually abused in childhood develop anxiety disorders in later life. More precisely, the objective of the present umbrella review is to clarify the nature of the associations between child sexual abuse and the various forms of anxiety problems by considering the significance and strength of such associations as well as the potential effects of third variables, such as moderators, mediators, or confounders. It seems evident that, with the current high levels of public and scientific interest in both child maltreatment and anxiety disorders, an analysis of what is currently known about the potential role of child sexual abuse in the development, maintenance, and recurrence of anxiety disorders is required in order to effectively implement research and health policy.</p>

            <p>In the more comprehensive review of the literature on child sexual abuse, to obtain relevant studies, seven Internet-based databases (AMED, Cochrane Reviews, EBSCO, ERIC, MEDLINE, PsycINFO, and ScienceDirect) were searched for articles published between January 1966 and December 2008. Separate searches were conducted for the key words <italic>child (hood) sexual abuse</italic>, <italic>child(hood) sexual maltreatment</italic>. Further articles were identified by a manual search of reference lists from retrieved papers. In addition, in the present umbrella review on the role of child sexual abuse in the etiology of anxiety disorders, to obtain more recent articles on the topic, the seven Internet-based databases were searched again in December 2010 for further articles published between January 2009 and December 2010. </p>
            <p>To be included, studies needed to (1) appear in peer-reviewed journals; (2) be published in full; (3) be critical reviews of the literature; (4) not be dissertation papers, editorials, letters, conference proceedings, books, and book chapters; (5) review studies sampling human subjects; (6) investigate medical, neurobiological, psychological, behavioral, sexual, or other health problems following child sexual abuse; (7) have primary and sufficient data derived from longitudinal, cross-sectional, case-control, or cohort studies. For the purposes of the present umbrella review, only those reviews addressing the significance, strength, and/or nature of the relationship between child sexual abuse and later anxiety symptoms or disorders and/or the potential effects of third variables (such as moderators, mediators, or confounders) on such relationship were included.</p>

            <p>The author, R M, and a professor of criminology, independently evaluated the eligibility of all studies identified, abstracted data, and assessed study quality in order to limit biases, minimize errors, improve reliability of findings, reduce the possibility that relevant reports will be discarded, and ensure that decisions and judgments are reproducible (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1524838012470032">Centre for Reviews and Dissemination, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1524838012470032">Higgins &amp; Green, 2006</xref>).

By reviewing the titles and abstracts of all these articles, 211 potentially relevant papers were identified and retrieved for more detailed evaluation. By the manual search of reference lists of these 211 papers, additional 33 potentially relevant articles were identified and retrieved for detailed evaluation. Of all these 244 potentially relevant papers, 42 fulfilled all inclusion criteria and were assessed for study quality. Of these 42 studies, only 3, published between 1966 and 2008, met six quality criteria well. For these reasons, these studies were judged “fair” and were included in the present umbrella review. In addition, a more recent article, fulfilling all the inclusion criteria and meeting all the seven quality criteria well, was identified. This study was judged “good” and was included in this systematic review. Thus, a total of four reviews were included in the present umbrella review.</p>

               <p>The four reviews focused on different types of samples. While <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-1524838012470032">Paolucci and colleagues (2001</xref>) and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1524838012470032">Chen and colleagues (2010</xref>) reviewed a wide range of samples (i.e., young and adult, male and female, clinical and nonclinical samples), <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-1524838012470032">Neumann and colleagues (1996</xref>) and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr81-1524838012470032">Rind and colleagues (1998</xref>) focused, respectively, on adult female (both clinical and nonclinical) samples and college (both male and female) samples. </p>
               <p>All the reviews specified the data sources used to identify studies and the criteria employed to select studies for inclusion in the review. Only the review by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1524838012470032">Chen and colleagues (2010</xref>) assessed the quality of each eligible study. All the reviews provided a quantitative analysis of the data (i.e., meta-analysis) to infer whether child sexual abuse was significantly associated with anxiety symptoms or disorders and to estimate the strength of this association. In the review by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1524838012470032">Chen and colleagues (2010</xref>), subgroup–effect interactions were explored based on the age at which sexual abuse occurred (childhood vs. adult). To test the hypothesis of a subgroup effect, a test of interaction with a predetermined two-tailed α of .05 was used. All these meta-analyses described the main results in an objective fashion, detailed the methods that were employed to obtain these results, took into account the strength of evidence, investigated whether any observed effects were consistent across studies, explored possible reasons for any inconsistencies, and outlined how heterogeneity of effect sizes (i.e., variability in the effects being evaluated in the different studies) was explored and quantified in order to ensure that the combined effect from a group of similar studies would be a meaningful description of that set of studies. Effect sizes and sources of variation between studies were reported. Based on all these factors, only the review by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1524838012470032">Chen and colleagues (2010</xref>) was judged “good,” because it met all the seven criteria of the Methodological Quality Checklist. In contrast, the other three reviews were judged “fair,” because they did not meet the fifth criterion of the Methodological Quality Checklist (i.e., they lacked a formal quality assessment of the primary studies).</p>
               <p>In the studies included in each review, anxiety symptoms or disorders were usually measured by anxiety inventories, scales, or questionnaires, investigator-authored items or questions, or anxiety-related items or subscales from clinical questionnaires, scales, and inventories.</p>
               <p>The following moderator variables were analyzed: form and date of publication of the study, site of the study, size and source of the samples, gender, socioeconomic status, and age of the subjects at the time of assessment, sampling strategy, method of assessment of abuse (e.g., questionnaire list), type of statistic used, definition of child sexual abuse based on maximum age of victim, level of contact, consent, force, frequency, and duration of abuse, relationship to the perpetrator (e.g., parent), age when abused.</p>
               <p>These four meta-analyses reviewed a total of 171 studies (including 220 different subject samples, with 3,214,482 subjects). Because of differences in methods used to identify studies (i.e., data sources, key words, and years searched), and criteria used to select studies for inclusion (especially types of study design and sample included), only five (2.92%) of these studies were analyzed by more than one review.</p>
               <p>In the present umbrella review, the main findings of the four meta-analyses are qualitatively analyzed in an evidence-based, objective, and balanced fashion, with the highest quality evidence available receiving the greatest emphasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr85-1524838012470032">Slavin, 1995</xref>). </p>
               <p>To represent the degree of the relationship between child sexual abuse and anxiety disorders, the weighted effect size estimators <italic>d</italic>, <italic>r</italic>, and odds ratios (ORs) were used. Positive <italic>d</italic> and <italic>r </italic>values and OR greater than 1.0 indicate higher levels of symptomatology for sexually abused participants compared to control participants. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1524838012470032">Cohen (1988</xref>), <italic>d</italic> of .20, .50, and .80, <italic>r</italic> of .10, .30, and .50, and OR of 1.49, 3.45, and 9 correspond to “small,” “medium,” and “large” effect sizes, respectively. </p>
               <p>To organize the results, three major categories were used: (1) magnitudes of the associations between child sexual abuse and anxiety disorders; (2) moderators of such relationships; and (3) confounders. Such categorization resulted from the extraction from each study of information concerning types of anxiety problem, moderator, mediator, and confounder reported. Once all the anxiety problems, moderators, mediators, and confounders had been listed, they were classified into a smaller number of distinct categories. For anxiety problems, four general categories emerged: generic anxiety symptoms, posttraumatic stress symptoms, obsessive–compulsive symptoms, and phobic symptoms; for moderators, three general categories emerged: study characteristics, sample characteristics, and abuse characteristics; for mediators, no categories emerged because none of the included reviews addressed potential mediating variables; for confounders, only one category emerged: family factors. </p>

               <title>Generic anxiety symptoms</title>
               <p>Three reviews provided data on the relationship between child sexual abuse and generic anxiety symptoms. In the review of both clinical and nonclinical adult females by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-1524838012470032">Neumann and colleagues (1996</xref>), a meta-analysis of 11 studies revealed that child sexual abuse was significantly related to generic anxiety symptoms. The association was small to medium in magnitude.

In their review of both clinical and nonclinical adult females, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-1524838012470032">Neumann and colleagues (1996</xref>) used the categorical model testing to assess moderators.

Sample size was not statistically significant, although there was a tendency for studies with smaller samples (<italic>N</italic> &lt; 50) to yield comparatively high mean effect sizes, compared to studies that examined larger numbers of subjects. There were no significant effect-size differences based on age of the subjects at the time of assessment. In their review, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-1524838012470032">Paolucci and colleagues (2001</xref>) assessed two potential moderators concerning sample characteristics (i.e., gender and socioeconomic status of subjects at the time of assessment), using univariate analyses.

To qualify these results, the authors investigated the Consent × Gender interaction. A series of contrast analyses revealed that adjustment was associated with level of consent for men but not for women. According to the authors, because all levels of consent corresponded to social and legal definitions of child sexual abuse, these results implied that, in the college population, the association between child sexual abuse and adjustment problems was not equivalent for men and women.

The analysis of one study on females abused in adulthood revealed that the association between sexual abuse and posttraumatic stress disorder was strengthened by a history of rape, defined as penetration with a body part or foreign object (intravaginal or anal).

Using weighted correlational analyses, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr81-1524838012470032">Rind and colleagues (1998</xref>) examined the association between the maximum age for a “child” in the study’s definition of child sexual abuse and the sample-level effect sizes.

Furthermore, Rind and colleagues provided a series of meta-analyses of the moderator–outcome relations to examine five moderators concerning aspects of the abuse experience (i.e., force, penetration, duration, frequency, and incest). Results showed that incest (i.e., close familial abuse) was associated with outcomes; the magnitude of this relation was small. Force, penetration, frequency, and duration of abuse were not related to symptoms.

More specifically, the authors analyzed the relationship between family environment and child sexual abuse to determine whether they were confounded. The authors coded each study that assessed family environment factors and classified them into six distinct general categories: nonsexual abuse and neglect, adaptability, conflict and pathology, family structure, support and bonding, and traditionalism. The effect sizes for each family environment category were meta-analyzed. For all 6 categories, the effect size estimates were statistically significant. According to the authors, the positive values of the effect size estimates implied that college students with a history of child sexual abuse came from more problematic home environments than control students, implying that child sexual abuse and family environment were confounded in this population. The confounding of child sexual abuse and family environment raised the possibility that child sexual abuse was not causally related to outcomes or was related in a smaller way than uncontrolled analyses had indicated. To address this issue, the authors combined all of the family environment variables into one variable and examined the relationship between family environment and symptoms. For each study assessing the relationship between these two factors, effect sizes were computed for all family environment–symptom relations. A series of symptom-level meta-analyses were then performed. Three samples, including 788 subjects, were used in the generic anxiety symptoms meta-analysis; two samples, including 634 subjects, were used in the obsessive–compulsive symptomatology meta-analysis; only one sample, including 383 subjects, was used in the phobic symptomatology meta-analysis. Results showed that family environment was significantly related to generic anxiety symptoms, obsessive–compulsive symptomatology, and phobic symptomatology. The magnitudes of such relationships ranged from small to medium size and were generally larger than those of the associations between child sexual abuse and anxiety problems, especially for anxious and obsessive–compulsive symptomatology.</p>

            <title>Strength of the Association Between Child Sexual Abuse and Anxiety Disorders</title>
            <p>The results of the four meta-analyses included in this systematic review show that across methodologies, samples, and measures survivors of child sexual abuse are significantly at risk for anxiety problems, such as generic anxiety, obsessive–compulsive, phobic, and posttraumatic stress symptomatology. However, as shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1524838012470032">Table 2</xref>, child sexual abuse was found to be significantly linked with several other psychological and behavioral problems. Therefore, child sexual abuse should be considered a general, nonspecific risk factor for anxiety symptoms or disorders.</p>
            <p>Because of the variation across outcomes and sample characteristics in the four meta-analytic reviews, the magnitudes of the associations between child sexual abuse and the various forms of anxiety problems ranged from small to medium. Although significant, certain anxiety problems (e.g., phobic symptomatology among college males and females) were less related to child sexual abuse than others (e.g., posttraumatic stress symptomatology among female patients and nonpatients). Therefore, it is possible that child sexual abuse may be a more potent risk factor for some anxiety problems than others.</p>

            <title>Moderators of the Relationship Between Child Sexual Abuse and Anxiety Disorders</title>
            <p>Moderator analyses revealed that some explanation of effect size variance was partially accounted for by only a few of the several hypothesized moderator variables of the relationship between child sexual abuse and anxiety problems, given that the majority of them generated conflicting or nonsignificant results. </p>
            <p>More specifically, of the moderators concerning characteristics of the individual studies included in each review, form of publication generated conflicting results, with some evidence suggesting larger effect sizes in studies with college samples whose results were published. None of the other moderators (i.e., publication date, sampling strategy, method of assessment of abuse, and type of statistic used) was statistically significant. </p>
            <p>Of the moderators concerning characteristics of the samples included in each study, only sample source was significant. More precisely, samples drawn from nonclinical populations, especially samples drawn from college population, yielded smaller effect sizes than did clinical samples. In other words, psychiatric patients with a history of early sexual abuse showed greater evidence of anxiety symptoms or disorders than did survivors of child abuse among community, student, or other populations. It is clear that psychiatric samples tend to exclude well-adjusted survivors of sexual victimization because these samples are likely to constitute the negative extreme of abuse outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-1524838012470032">Okami, 1991</xref>). In contrast, community and student samples tend to include more well-adjusted abuse victims, because a certain level of wellness is required to perform daily activities, such as occupational tasks, school obligations, family responsibilities, or household activities. Furthermore, in regard to student samples, it has been suggested that some adverse long-term sequelae of child abuse may have not yet manifested at college age (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr81-1524838012470032">Rind, Tromovitch, &amp; Bauserman, 1998</xref>). None of the other moderators (i.e., sample size and source, type of institution, and gender, socioeconomic status, and age of the subjects at the time of assessment) was statistically significant, although there was a tendency for studies with smaller samples to yield larger effect sizes. Noteworthy was the finding that gender did not moderate the association between child sexual abuse and anxiety problems. In fact, gender was generally nonsignificant, while it was significant when considering only college samples along with definitions of child sexual abuse including both willing and unwanted sex. The fact that gender did not moderate the association between child sexual abuse and anxiety problems in the present systematic review confirms the results of another meta-analytic review (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr93-1524838012470032">Tolin &amp; Foa, 2006</xref>) that was not included in the present umbrella review because it did not fulfill all inclusion criteria. In fact, the meta-analysis by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr93-1524838012470032">Tolin and Foa (2006</xref>) focused on studies yielding sex-specific risk of potentially traumatic events and posttraumatic stress disorder, without addressing the significance, strength, and/or nature of the relationship between child sexual abuse and later anxiety symptoms or disorders. The meta-analytic review by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr93-1524838012470032">Tolin and Foa (2006</xref>) showed no significant differences in prevalence and severity of posttraumatic stress disorder between male and female victims of child sexual abuse. Thus, the greater risk of anxiety problems among female subjects seems to be not true for victims of child sexual abuse, although, in general, females appear to be more likely than males to exhibit anxiety disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr86-1524838012470032">Somers et al., 2006</xref>), especially posttraumatic stress disorder (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr93-1524838012470032">Tolin &amp; Foa, 2006</xref>) as well as to experience both adult sexual assault and child sexual abuse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr93-1524838012470032">Tolin &amp; Foa, 2006</xref>). </p>
            <p>Of the moderators concerning aspects of the abuse experience and definition (i.e., penetration, force, frequency, and duration of abuse, relationship to the perpetrator, age when abused, and definition of child sexual abuse based on maximum age of victim, level of contact, and consent), definition of abuse including consent, abuse involving contact, and relationship to the perpetrator generated conflicting results, with some evidence suggesting greater risk of anxiety problems in college survivors of intrafamilial abuse, and, only for females, in college victims of abuse including both willing and unwanted sex. All the other moderators concerning abuse characteristics generated nonsignificant results. As described in the introduction section, much literature has suggested more negative outcomes in victims of more severe and traumatic forms of sexual victimization, such as those involving force, violence, and multiple perpetrators. Nevertheless, the results of this systematic review do not confirm suspicions that such factors along with other variables concerning aspects of the victimization experience (such as younger age when abused, longer duration or higher frequency of abuse) increase anxiety symptoms or disorders in people who have been sexually victimized as children.</p>

         <p>Although the reviews included in this umbrella review did not investigate potential mediating variables, it is possible that some antecedent or concurrent third variables might contribute to the onset of anxiety disorders by mediating the relationship between child sexual abuse and anxiety disorders.</p>
         <p>For example, it is possible that early sexual victimization might contribute to anxiety disorders through the development of certain cognitive or personality characteristics, such as cognitive biases, that fit the view of the world as dangerous or threatening. Several studies have suggested that information processing biases, that is, the tendency to preferentially process threatening information, intervening in cognitive processes such as attention, memory, and interpretation, are involved in the development and maintenance of anxiety disorders (for reviews, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1524838012470032">Alfano, Beidel, &amp; Turner, 2002</xref>; Bar-Haim, Lamy, Pergamin, Bakermans-Kranenburg, &amp; van IJzendoorn, 2007; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1524838012470032">Cisler &amp; Koster, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1524838012470032">Daleiden &amp; Vasey, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1524838012470032">Ehrenreich &amp; Gross, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1524838012470032">Hadwin, Garner, &amp; Perez-Olivas, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-1524838012470032">Musa &amp; Lépine, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-1524838012470032">Ouimet, Gawronski, &amp; Dozois, 2009</xref>). More precisely, a large amount of studies shows that anxious subjects pay more attention to potentially threatening stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1524838012470032">Bar-Haim et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1524838012470032">Cisler &amp; Koster, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-1524838012470032">Musa &amp; Lépine, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-1524838012470032">Ouimet et al., 2009</xref>) and more frequently interpret ambiguous events or situations as threatening than do nonanxious controls (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-1524838012470032">Musa &amp; Lépine, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-1524838012470032">Ouimet et al., 2009</xref>). Thus, it is possible that child sexual abuse might promote in children a hypervigilant information processing style for the detection of threat (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1524838012470032">Hadwin et al., 2006</xref>). Although such an increased vigilance for threat reflects effective adaptation to avoid danger, it may, in turn, predispose to the development of anxiety disorders. </p>
         <p>Furthermore, both preclinical and clinical studies suggest that childhood trauma and early stressful events, such as child sexual abuse, may induce a cascade of neurobiological events that have the potential to produce persistent sensitization of central nervous system circuits, including long-lived hyperreactivity of corticotropin-releasing factor systems and alterations in other neurotransmitter systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1524838012470032">Heim &amp; Nemeroff, 2001</xref>) as well as enduring changes in brain structure or function, including reduced size of the mid-portions of the corpus callosum, attenuated development of the left neocortex, hippocampus, and amygdala, abnormal frontotemporal electrical activity, and reduced functional activity of the cerebellar vermis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr90-1524838012470032">Teicher, Andersen, Polcari, Anderson, &amp; Navalta, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr91-1524838012470032">Teicher et al., 2003</xref>). These neurobiological sequelae, in turn, seem to provide the neurobiological substrate through which child sexual abuse might increase the risk of developing anxiety disorders. </p>
         <p>Therefore, it is possible that certain neurobiological and psychosocial factors might mediate the association between prior sexual abuse and subsequent anxiety disorders. In other words, it is possible that child sexual abuse may promote other biological (such as alterations in brain structure or function) or psychological (such as information processing biases) conditions which, in turn, might predispose to the onset of anxiety disorders. In these cases, child sexual abuse would not have a direct pathway to anxiety disorders but instead would have a direct relationship with another condition, which in turn would have a direct pathway to anxiety disorders. Thus, in some cases, child sexual abuse might be a distal and indirect cause, rather than a proximal and direct cause, of anxiety disorders.</p>

         <title>Confounders, Causation, and Methodological Limitations</title>
         <p>The results of this systematic review support evidence for an association between child sexual abuse and anxiety symptoms and disorders. However, causal inferences cannot be made, because of the presence of both confounding variables and methodological limitations in the studies included in each review. </p>
         <p>The majority of the primary studies were characterized by poor methodological quality and it should be noted that only one of the reviews included in this systematic review assessed data quality and validity; furthermore, these meta-analyses aggregated various findings regardless of the level of methodological quality. Most studies had design, sampling, and measurement problems, such as poor sampling methods, absence of appropriate comparison groups, inadequate operationalization and measurement of abuse histories and/or anxiety disorders, insufficient control for effect modifiers and confounders, or designs inappropriate to prove causality (see, also, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1524838012470032">Briere, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1524838012470032">Kilpatrick, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr84-1524838012470032">Sharpe &amp; Faye, 2006</xref>). More specifically, most studies addressing the potential relationship between child sexual abuse and anxiety problems employed retrospective designs that required participants to rely on their memory to identify an event that occurred in the past and might have caused their current disease. Because of the limitations of the individual’s memory and the influence of disease/exposure status on the recalling process in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1524838012470032">Grimes &amp; Schulz, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1524838012470032">Hassan, 2006</xref>), results from studies employing retrospective designs with self-report measures of child abuse should be interpreted with caution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1524838012470032">Maniglio, 2009a</xref>). It has been shown that retrospective designs are capable of producing false positive results (see, e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-1524838012470032">Raphael, Widom, &amp; Lange, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr95-1524838012470032">Widom, Weiler, &amp; Cottler, 1999</xref>), with the possibility of recall bias threatening the internal validity and credibility of studies with self-reported data by inflating the estimated risk attributed to the exposure under investigation (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1524838012470032">Green et al., 2010</xref>) and yielding potential spurious association (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1524838012470032">Grimes &amp; Schulz, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1524838012470032">Hassan, 2006</xref>). Furthermore, the vast majority of these studies have relied on self-report measures of child abuse and/or anxiety disorders of questionable reliability and validity (e.g., investigator-authored questions or only single item indicators of anxious symptomatology or sexual victimization) rather than employing well-established measures or formal classification systems to operationalize anxiety symptoms and disorders and/or child abuse. Moreover, many individual studies sampled only individuals who were seeking or receiving psychiatric services, thus producing a high risk of sampling bias. Such convenience sampling raises questions regarding the generalizability and interpretation of research results, not only because clinical samples cannot be assumed to be representative of the general population, but also because data coming from these samples are vulnerable to several biases that threaten their validity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-1524838012470032">Pope &amp; Hudson, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr81-1524838012470032">Rind et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr80-1524838012470032">Rind &amp; Tromovitch, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr84-1524838012470032">Sharpe &amp; Faye, 2006</xref>). For example, participants drawn from clinical samples may be more likely than nonclinical participants to recall events of early traumatic experiences, including child sexual abuse, thus inflating the relationship between child abuse and adult psychopathology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-1524838012470032">Pope &amp; Hudson, 1995</xref>). Moreover, child abuse and family problems are highly confounded in clinical populations; thus causality cannot be inferred from clinical samples (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1524838012470032">Beitchman, Zucker, Hood, DaCosta, &amp; Akman, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-1524838012470032">Ney, Fung, &amp; Wickett, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-1524838012470032">Pope &amp; Hudson, 1995</xref>). In sum, because of these methodological limitations, associations were confounded and causal inferences not feasible. Thus, findings must be interpreted with caution. </p>
         <p>Importantly, most studies investigating the relationship between child sexual abuse and anxiety disorders have not controlled for the overlap with other traumatic events, especially co-occurring forms of maltreatment such as physical and emotive abuse. It has been shown that childhood adversities, especially those associated with maladaptive family functioning (e.g., family violence and parental mental illness, substance abuse, or criminality), are highly prevalent and intercorrelated in people with anxiety disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1524838012470032">Green et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1524838012470032">McLaughlin et al., 2010</xref>). Thus, it is uncertain whether anxiety symptoms and disorders in subjects with a history of child sexual abuse may be attributable to such traumatic experience rather than any other childhood adversity that may precede, accompany, or follow the experience of child sexual abuse.</p>
         <p>Speaking more broadly, several risk factors other than child sexual abuse, such as parental mental illness and/or substance abuse, family conflict or dysfunction, and other forms of child abuse, might be present in a maltreated child’s life or environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1524838012470032">Maniglio, 2010b</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1524838012470032">2011c</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1524838012470032">2012</xref>). Some of these factors might better account for the anxiety symptoms or disorders found in subjects who have been sexually victimized as children rather than the experience of child sexual abuse itself having a causal role in the etiology of anxiety problems.</p>
         <p>For example, it is possible that anxiety disorders in parents might independently increase the risk of their children themselves developing anxiety symptoms or disorders in adolescence or adulthood. It is well known that parental anxiety disorders confer significant risk for anxiety in offspring. A recent meta-analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1524838012470032">Micco et al., 2009</xref>) has revealed that offspring of parents with anxiety disorders have greater risk for anxiety disorders than offspring of psychiatric and nonpsychiatric controls. According to a series of meta-analyses of data from family and twin studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1524838012470032">Hettema et al., 2001</xref>), panic disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, phobias, and obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) all have significant familial aggregation that is largely explained by genes. In fact, both family and twin studies indicate that genetic factors account for significant variance in the development of anxiety disorders (for reviews, see, e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1524838012470032">Afifi et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1524838012470032">Gordon &amp; Hen, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1524838012470032">Gregory &amp; Eley, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1524838012470032">Hettema et al., 2001</xref>). Thus, in people who have been sexually abused as children, anxiety disorders might be due to genetic components rather than child abuse. </p>
         <p>Research also suggests that the impact of family goes beyond heritability. Several reviews (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1524838012470032">Bögels &amp; Brechman-Toussaint, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1524838012470032">Gerlsma, Emmelkamp, &amp; Arrindell, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1524838012470032">McLeod, Wood, &amp; Weisz, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-1524838012470032">Rapee, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr97-1524838012470032">Wood, McLeod, Sigman, Hwang, &amp; Chu, 2003</xref>) have suggested that parenting styles characterized by overcontrol, rejection, and lack of warmth have an impact on child anxiety. Thus, in sexually victimized children, parenting might be a better predictor of anxiety disorders than is child sexual abuse. In a meta-analysis included in the present review (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr81-1524838012470032">Rind et al., 1998</xref>), certain family variables (e.g., conflict, pathology, neglect, physical or emotional abuse) were confounded with child sexual abuse and independently related to anxious, obsessive–compulsive, and phobic symptomatology. Family variables were more strongly linked with anxiety problems, especially for generic anxiety symptoms and obsessive–compulsive symptomatology, than was child sexual abuse. </p>
         <p>In sum, it is possible that certain variables, other than child sexual abuse, might act independently to cause anxiety disorders in subjects who were sexually abused as children.</p>

         <title>Implications for Research, Prevention, and Treatment</title>
         <p>The results of this systematic review show that child sexual abuse is a significant, although general and nonspecific, risk factor for anxiety disorders. However, being a victim of child sexual abuse is not the only important risk factor and often does not have a primary role in the development of anxiety disorders. Evidence to date suggests that, in some cases, additional biological, psychological, or social risk factors may be directly responsible for anxiety disorders in child abuse survivors; in other cases, certain biological and psychosocial risk factors may interact with child sexual abuse to increase the risk of anxiety disorders in survivors of early sexual victimization. However, it is apparent that being a victim of child sexual abuse may sometimes confer additional risk of developing anxiety disorders either as a distal and indirect cause or as a proximal and direct cause.</p>
         <p>Thus, child sexual abuse should be considered one of the several risk factors for anxiety disorders and included, along with other childhood adversities, in multifactorial etiological models for anxiety disorders in order to elucidate not only the processes that contribute to the development of anxiety problems in child abuse victims but also the compensatory mechanisms whereby some abuse survivors achieve positive adaptation despite experiencing significant adversity. To achieve this goal, several methodological advances in research in this area are required, such as use of prospective, longitudinal designs, control for confounders, employment of study samples representative of the general population and matched comparison groups, and, for literature reviews, assessment of data quality and validity.</p>
         <p>Since child sexual abuse is a statistically significant risk factor for the development of anxiety disorders, the implementation of programs and services designed to prevent the occurrence of early traumatic experiences, such as child sexual abuse, and to treat their sequelae may decrease the incidence and prevalence of anxiety disorders in our society. Although children who have posttraumatic stress symptomatology are more likely to demonstrate benefit from psychotherapy than asymptomatic children (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-1524838012470032">Ramchandani &amp; Jones, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr88-1524838012470032">Stevenson, 1999</xref>), programs and services for child abuse survivors should have a long-term orientation and focus not only on treating actual symptoms and disorders but also on reducing additional risk factors that may increase the likelihood of later onset of anxiety disorders, especially the negative family circumstances in which many abused children are raised.</p>
