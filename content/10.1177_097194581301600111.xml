<p>This volume on episcopal sees in England, Wales and Normandy from c. 1000 to c. 1210 is the result of a conference held at Canterbury in December 2007. The 12 contributions, excellently introduced by the editors, reflect by and large the state-of-the-art at that time. They approach their topic not systematically, but from a great variety of angles. Thus, the volume does not offer a comprehensive analysis of the place of the bishops, canons and monks in the Anglo-Norman world, but provides snapshots on particular situations and problems. It is nonetheless possible to group the articles.</p>
<p>The purpose of historical writing is a major theme in Ann Williams’ study on the transfer of Dunstan’s relics from Canterbury to Glastonbury, Charles Insley’s work on Exeter and Michael Staunton’s study of the <italic>vitae</italic> of Thomas Becket. Williams issues a strong warning against using twelfth-century chronicles to reconstruct Anglo-Saxon England. In her view, contemporary sources should be preferred instead. Her case of reconstruction of the events concerning the fate of Dunstan’s relics is convincing, but, in principle, every chronicle, whether contemporary or not, has its <italic>causa scribendi</italic>, its own individual context. This is amply demonstrated by the <italic>Lives</italic> of Thomas Becket. Staunton comes to the conclusion that although they provide some insight into the relationship between the archbishop and his church, this theme features not as prominently as might be expected. This, he argues, is due to Becket’s great prominence which attracted writers from outside Canterbury who then dominated the early discourse on the saint. How a past could be constructed in order to shape the present is shown by Bishop Leofric’s activities at Exeter in the mid-eleventh century. Having moved his see from Crediton to Exeter in 1050, Leofric was striving to create the identity of his new cathedral and to bolster its status. Fabricating a glorious Anglo-Saxon past was part of that strategy.</p>
<p>The making of episcopal sees in post-conquest England and in Wales in the eleventh and twelfth centuries are treated by Chris Lewis and John Reuben Davies. While Davies stresses the importance of saints for the foundation of the Welsh bishoprics, Lewis suggests that moving the episcopal see from Lichfield to Chester and then to Coventry in the eleventh century was not ‘driven by pride and greed’, but ‘the sustained effort to strengthen existing links between the bishop and the three main monastic and clerical communities’ of the diocese.</p>
<p>The various fields in which cathedrals could engage in conflicts are set out in a number of contributions. Sheila Sweetinburgh looks at the conflict between Archbishop Baldwin and the monastic community at Canterbury, thus at a dispute at the archiepiscopal see itself. A strong rivalry between a cathedral church and a monastery is the subject of Richard Allen’s paper on Rouen. He argues that the architecture of their churches was one field on which the competition between the archiepiscopal see and the Benedictine monastery of St Ouen was played out. Based upon a close reading of the <italic>Acta archiepiscoporum Rotomagensium</italic> Allen suggests that St Ouen developed a new architectural design (an echeloned east end). In doing so St Ouen preceded the abbey of St Etienne of Caen. This challenge to the established chronology (St Ouen follows St Etienne) will certainly be commented upon by architectural historians.</p>
<p>The often uneasy relationship between cathedrals, their chapters and bishops to kings and magnates is a theme running through the contributions by Thomas Roche on Philip of Bayeux, Paul Dalton on the responses of Selby Abbey, Pontefract Priory and York Cathedral to war in King Stephen’s reign, and by Paul Webster on King John and Canterbury. The landed resources and the appointments of churchmen, in particular bishops kept the cathedrals, tied in closely with the interests of the aristocracy and the king. In Yorkshire the ecclesiastical institutions fought hard to save their interests, yet still suffered heavy damage. At Bayeux, Bishop Philip tried to recover the lands lost under his predecessor. He seems to have been rather successful, but we need to keep in mind, as Roche points out, that the main source for Philip’s activities, the Bayeux cartulary, was not intended to keep record of lost cases. Webster, finally, takes a fresh look at the relationship between King John and Canterbury. He argues that John, at least until 1205, shows no signs of a particularly impious king. In particular Canterbury received the attention of his devotion. The good relationship with Canterbury deteriorated over the election of Hubert Walter’s successor. Webster stresses John’s point of view on the affair. Here a look at the contemporary development of canon law on episcopal elections would have provided a further insight into John’s dilemma. The long-standing tradition that the English king played an official role in nominating the bishops was no longer acceptable. John was fighting a lost battle.</p>
<p>The relations between cathedrals and the aristocracy, however, were not just a history of tension and conflict. Looking at secular cathedral churches in England Stephen Marritt points to donations made and prebends founded by aristocrats. But despite their undeniable importance for the aristocracy Marritt also shows that they were not at the centre of the baronial attention. The barons focused their piety much more on monasteries than on cathedrals. These monasteries are the focus of the final contribution to the volume. Nicholas Vincent analyses the fate of their French possessions. In comparison to the possessions enjoyed by Norman ecclesiastical institutions in England, the lands held by the English on the continent were relatively few. This underscores that the Norman conquest enriched the Norman landholders much more than it did the English. But they defended arduously whatever little they had. Vincent shows that Canterbury tried to hold on to its possessions in Burgundy until the early fifteenth century. Three hitherto unedited pieces illuminate this struggle.</p>
<p>The volume is well edited and its page layout shows that Boydell can produce reader-friendly books. It is now up to the reader to make the most of the many insights given in this volume.</p>
