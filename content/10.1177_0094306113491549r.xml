<p>Imagining <italic>Saigon’s Edge: On the Origins of Ho Chi Minh City</italic> to be a standard ethnographic treatment of the “in-between” land of an urban fringe in modern Vietnam, my sociological mind pictured a chapter describing Erik Harms’ research site which is Hoc Mon District of Ho Chi Minh City, a history of how the area emerged, a social survey, a description of the ethnographer’s living situation, and a few choice photographs and/or line drawings to illustrate the marginality of the area. After that the theoretical conclusions would be drawn.</p>
<p>Alas, except for the photographs and scattered references to the past, this is not Harms’ book. His book is rather a theoretical exploration of “social edginess” in the rapidly developing Ho Chi Minh City of the 1990s and early 2000s, and its primary reference is to broader anthropological discussions about how symbolism organizes space and time. Harms emphasizes that the state planners, and the residents of Hoc Mon itself, both reason in dualities, a fact that he highlights in his analysis. He emphasizes that such folk descriptions of space and time are from an anthropological perspective with over-simplified views, resting in nostalgia of the past. However, while acknowledging this, Harms both critiques and affirms the habit that both planners and “everyday people” have of reducing questions about cities to this either/or focus on rural and urban.</p>
<p>Harms says that it is important to understand the consequences of dualistic reasoning because it is indeed how “real people” in Hoc Mon think—despite the fact that from a positivistic respect such dualism may not exist. To develop this point, Harms provocatively claims that anthropological and critical theorists on the one hand, and the dualistically thinking Vietnamese categories of the peasants and government planners on the other, share “parallel forms of intellectual hubris,” because both rely on dualistic oppositions in their reasoning (p. 227). In this fashion, Harms’ book wrestles with critical theory, poststructuralism, postmodernism, and the challenges to his data from Hoc Mon.</p>
<p>Methodologically, <italic>Saigon’s Edge</italic> is of course an ethnography, the result of the author’s residence in Hoc Mon in the early 2000s. There are frequent references to the Vietnamese language literature, and interviews that the author apparently conducted in Vietnamese; he makes nuanced definitions of a number of Vietnamese terms. Less apparent though is what exactly Harms’ personal relationship as an ethnographer was with the Hoc Mon district; he does not describe his living situation, daily routines, or use extensive quotes from informants. Rather Harms’ book focuses on theory, and not ethnographical data in the usual sense. Still, this has value.</p>
<p>For example, to describe the edginess of Ho Chi Minh City, Harms emphasizes the intersection of rural and urban in Hoc Mon. The intersection he describes is between a former rural peasantry and the Communist Party officials who manage the city, returning Vietnamese Americans, Korean factory owners, and others who pass through. From this he concludes: “People on the edge clearly play with the categories of inside, outside, rural and urban in order to realize strategic ends. …They edge their way into possible modes of social action that cannot be divorced from the processes of social change that themselves contextualize the edge and lend it symbolic meaning” (p. 59).</p>
<p>Reverting to a form of critical theory, Harms uses his examples to describe how time and space dualities created a shared “Country of Memory.” The country of memory he describes is created by the residents of Hoc Mon as a rural idyll, and is in opposition to the new market-focused city focused on the pursuit of capitalist profit. In this respect, the nostalgia for the lost land of farms is reminiscent of many writers starting at least with Marx, if not before. However, Harms still makes a good case that what is happening in Ho Chi Minh City is different from what happened in Europe in the nineteenth century.</p>
<p>My favorite chapters in <italic>Saigon’s Edge</italic> were Chapter Four which was about time and was highly theoretical, and Chapter Five about the new Trans-Asia Highway which was more traditionally ethnographic. Chapter Four helped explain time and how people in edge cities live in both the annual agricultural cycle, and the urban rhythms of the modern capitalist marketplace. In developing this chapter, Harms describes how social (rural) time is valued independently from time in the labor market, where the modern clock rules. In developing this point, he makes occasional references to other edge cities/situations (e.g., James Ferguson’s descriptions of the Zambian copper belt in the 1990s), while still maintaining that the situation in southern Vietnam is unique.</p>
<p>The most traditionally ethnographic chapter in <italic>Saigon’s Edge</italic> is Chapter Five about the Trans-Asia Highway called “The Road to Paradise.” The Trans-Asia Highway is being built across Asia and when completed will tie Asia together into a modern transportation network. The spur being built through Hoc Mon will connect Ho Chi Minh City with Phnom Penh in Cambodia, and Bangkok in Thailand. Harms describes well how the people of Hoc Mon are re-orienting their lives away from the rural world from which they came, and toward a broader world of the planned social change of Vietnam’s central government, and the broader community of Asian nations. This means local identities inevitably will adjust as “perfect visions of progress” and meet the “messy realities of development in practice” (p. 157) that such a road project brings to the reorganization of rural and urban space.</p>
<p>Reading <italic>Saigon’s Edge</italic> was a reminder that while sociology and cultural anthropology both use ethnographic techniques to evaluate places like Hoc Mon, their approaches can be quite different. While Harms develops well his binary ideas about time, space, and how peasant migrants negotiate between different social systems, he passes quickly over more broad sociological discussions about Hoc Mon’s social history, Vietnamese national politics, and the place of Hoc Mon in the modern world system, <italic>á la</italic> Wallerstein. Also brief is the sociologically obligatory statistical description of the area, which is instead replaced with an emphasis on symbolic edginess and an implicit critique of modernist statistical measures. Missing were some tables and graphs of things like income growth, gender ratios, age structure, patterns of industrial production, family structure, and a statistical summary—while also appreciating that there are different ways to describe the social liminality on the edges of rapidly growing third world cities like Ho Chi Minh City. Perceptions of time and space are indeed important in understanding Hoc Mon, and Harms develops this point well. But as a crusty old sociologist, I still cannot help but wonder more about such traditional sociological variables.</p>
