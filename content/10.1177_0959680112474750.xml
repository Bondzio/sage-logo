<p>This article focuses on recent changes in internal trade union organizational practices in France and Germany, drawing on interviews and internal union documents. Whereas the union renewal literature has emphasized the introduction of elements from the action repertoire of social movements into trade unions, this article finds that union officials and leaders are also transferring private sector managerial rhetoric and practices into trade unions. The extent and dynamics of this process termed ‘managerialization’ are discussed, as well as its effects on role definitions of union leaders, officials and members, comparing two trade unions: in France the <italic>Fédération Chimie Energie</italic> and in Germany the <italic>Vereinte Dienstleistungsgewerkschaft</italic>. The resulting tensions between trade unionism’s administrative and representative rationalities are highlighted.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Recent debate on the future of trade unions has often focused on the issue of renewal or revitalization. Elements of renewal are discerned, for example, in organizing models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0959680112474750">Bronfenbrenner et al., 1998</xref>), collaboration with social movements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0959680112474750">Clawson, 2003</xref>) and transnational labour cooperation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0959680112474750">Harrod and O’Brien, 2002</xref>). The themes of this literature, focused mainly on Anglo-Saxon countries where the legitimacy of trade unions depends directly on their presence in enterprises, have also been applied recently to France and Germany (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0959680112474750">Aust and Holst, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0959680112474750">Béroud, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0959680112474750">Murray et al., 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>The introduction of elements from the action repertoire of social movements into trade unions is a key focus of the union revitalization literature; but writers have shown less interest in unions as organizations and in internal trade union management practices. As a consequence, organizational changes such as greater formalization and a transfer of managerial rhetoric and practices from private sector companies have received less attention. If the rapprochement over the past two decades between forms of organization of companies and trade unions has been noted in France and Germany (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0959680112474750">Basson, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0959680112474750">Zech, 1998</xref>), as well as in the USA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0959680112474750">Behrens, 2002</xref>), the effects of the adoption of management practices on the redefinition of legitimate resources in trade unions and on the fabric of trade union activism have not received much consideration.</p>
<p>The adoption of managerial rhetoric and practices in trade unions occurs in the context of a more general transfer of corporate practices to other social domains such as public services (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0959680112474750">Walsh, 1995</xref>), the voluntary sector (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0959680112474750">Dart, 2004</xref>) or political parties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0959680112474750">Hopkin and Paolucci, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0959680112474750">Robert, 2007</xref>). With their rapid turnover and movement in and out of fashion, management theories are extremely diverse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0959680112474750">Abrahamson, 1996</xref>). However, their general thrust is the quantification and ‘rationalization’ of organizational activities and processes, with the aim of reducing costs, but also of improving quantitative performance, ‘efficiency’ and ‘accountability’, in particular by linking resources and results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0959680112474750">Ferlie et al., 1996</xref>). Core management practices emphasize, for example, outputs and performance over inputs, as well as accounting rules, incentives and performance contracts over trust-based relationships, while quasi-markets and disaggregated units replace planning and provision structures, with an emphasis on organizations’ core competencies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0959680112474750">Clarke et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0959680112474750">Dunleavy and Hood, 1994</xref>). I describe this process as ‘managerialization’.</p>
<p>Inherent in managerialization is the belief in the superiority of entrepreneurial modes of governance over other types of organization, be they bureaucratic or cooperative-democratic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0959680112474750">Sturdy and Grey, 2003</xref>), and the conviction that the same generic management practices can be applied in all kinds of organizations. Managerial reforms have the effect of introducing new criteria of legitimacy and efficiency into organizations; for example, in the case of trade unions, these may displace a representative conception of the role of officials and leaders with a conception of their role as based on expertise. I focus in this article on the managerial redefinition of the roles of trade union leaders, officials and members. Other aspects of trade union managerialization, such as the formalization of internal relations or the influence of managerial organization designs, will not be developed in detail.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-0959680112474750" sec-type="methods">
<title>Methodology</title>
<p>In order to examine the extent and effects of the managerial reconfiguration of trade union structures I use the case-oriented comparative method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0959680112474750">Ragin, 1987</xref>) and compare two trade unions: in France the <italic>Fédération Chimie Energie</italic> (FCE), which is affiliated to the <italic>Confédération française démocratique du travail</italic> (CFDT) and in Germany the <italic>Vereinte Dienstleistungsgewerkschaft</italic> (<italic>ver.di</italic>). Following the suggestion of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0959680112474750">Heery and Kelly (1994)</xref> that developments in union management models might be related predominantly to broader societal trends, I consider how far the adoption of managerial practices and rhetoric goes beyond contextual and organizational differences, and identify the uses made of such practices and rhetoric. In order to do this, I selected cases following the ‘most different’ criteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0959680112474750">Przeworski and Teune, 1970</xref>). With this methodological approach, it is possible to explore similarities, and to show how far similar outcomes are due to larger trends. Such a comparative design is also well suited to an approach focusing on the uses rather than the functions of managerial rhetoric and practices.</p>
<p>I therefore draw my cases from France and Germany, two countries with distinct and often opposed trade union traditions. Whereas German unions have had elaborate bureaucracies and an orientation towards membership services for over a century (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0959680112474750">Brunner, 1992</xref>), the trend towards the professionalization of union activities is far more recent in French trade unions, which have tended to privilege an activist definition of union members over a conception of members or non-member workers as ‘clients’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0959680112474750">Ubbiali, 1997</xref>). Though both countries possess ‘dual systems’ of representation, representative institutions at the workplace do not have the same influence and practices in each (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0959680112474750">Dufour and Hege, 2002</xref>). The organizations compared here are also very different: whereas <italic>ver.di</italic> is a highly complex union, with 2.1 million members in a diverse range of public and private services, the FCE is a much smaller and more homogeneous union with 62,000 members.</p>
<p>This article draws on fieldwork carried out between 2005 and 2007, involving 44 semi-structured interviews with officials from the two unions and their peak confederations and direct observation of union meetings. Numerous administrative documents, internal memoranda and studies were also considered. In the interpretation of change in trade union structures, previous literature on trade union officials and structures has also been taken into account as a benchmark of change.</p>
<p>The article is organized in three sections. The first situates the mobilization of managerial rhetoric and practices in <italic>ver.di</italic> and the FCE within the context of union reform processes. The second analyses changes in the role definitions of union officials and leaders. Finally, I consider the role definitions of members.</p>

<title>Constructing the legitimacy of managerial reforms in trade unions</title>
<p>The introduction of managerial rhetoric and practices in <italic>ver.di</italic> and the FCE is related to broader organizational reform projects, the legitimacy of which has been constructed over the past two decades by coalitions of actors proposing interpretations of the crisis of trade unionism and advocating possible solutions. In both cases, the elaboration of the reform discourse is remarkably similar to that of other reformist enterprises (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0959680112474750">Bezes and Le Lidec, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0959680112474750">Stone Sweet et al., 2001</xref>): groups of actors, composed in this case of trade union officials, consultants and academics, have established diagnostics of the perceived crisis of trade unionism, constituted coalitions for organizational transformation and advocated solutions centred on the mobilization of managerial rhetoric and practices.</p>
<sec id="section4-0959680112474750">
<title>National arenas of debate on trade union reform</title>
<p>Debates on trade union reform have followed membership losses, during the 1980s in France and the 1990s in Germany. The constitution of specific national arenas of discussion on trade union reform reflects differences in the national configurations of trade unionism. In Germany, a relatively unified arena for discussion of the future of trade unionism was created during the 1990s by the central confederation, the DGB (<italic>Deutscher Gewerkschaftsbund</italic>). France, by contrast, has a history of trade union pluralism, with five organizations (CGT, CFDT, FO, CFTC and CFE-CGC) officially recognized as ‘representative’ alongside other rival unions (including UNSA, FSU and <italic>Solidaires</italic>). The crisis of trade unionism thus became the subject of inter-union and intra-union debates in the context of power struggles between confederations, with no agreed model of reform emerging.</p>
<p>The two unions are, up to a point, representative of broader developments in both countries, even though their size and thus their influence in their national movements differ greatly. <italic>Ver.di</italic> is the second largest DGB affiliate, with over a third of its total membership; the FCE is a medium-sized federation within the CFDT, which is by most accounts the second largest French confederation. While the DGB has no authority over the organizational decisions of its affiliates, French confederations possess greater control over their sectoral federations. Both <italic>ver.di</italic> and the FCE, however, have implemented elements of the union reform repertoire which are more widespread in Germany and France, such as mergers across sectors, formalization of organizational structures and a reconfiguration of the repertoire of action. The CFDT has gone further than other French trade unions in reorganizing its structures. However, other trade union confederations, such as the <italic>Confédération générale du travail</italic> (CGT), have also recently tried to rationalize their organization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0959680112474750">Piotet, 2009b</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0959680112474750">
<title>The FCE</title>
<p>In France, reactions to trade union membership decline reflect the divisions within the movement. Whereas some confederations, such as the CGT or <italic>Force ouvrière</italic> (FO), have long denied the existence of a crisis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0959680112474750">Groux and Mouriaux, 1992</xref>), others have embraced the issue and argued for a political and organizational realignment. In particular, the leadership of the CFDT used this to legitimize organizational reforms and a political realignment during the late 1970s and 1980s, under the banner of <italic>recentrage</italic> (refocusing activities from politics towards collective bargaining and employment issues) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0959680112474750">Defaud, 2009</xref>). The <italic>recentrage</italic> of the CFDT, as well as the reconfiguration of its repertoire of action (with an emphasis on negotiation and expertise rather than strikes and collective action), was accompanied by a restructuring of its internal organization, including the merger of member federations and attempts to make the national level more ‘efficient’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0959680112474750">Tixier, 1987</xref>).</p>
<p>The creation of the FCE in 1997 by the merger between the chemical industry federation FUC and the energy sector federation FGE is a good example of the kind of internal reorganization conducted by the CFDT. Three reasons for this merger stand out. First, an industrial logic related to the restructuring of the energy sector through liberalization of EU energy markets. Second, political considerations linked to power relations inside the CFDT: the merger was seen as an attempt by the two federations concerned to regain influence inside the CFDT in the face of the relative growth of service sector federations. The chemical industry federation in particular wanted to regain its former reputation for organizational innovation and rigour (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0959680112474750">Brucy, 1997</xref>). Finally, the goal was also to extend organizing efforts in the face of membership losses, through a sharing of the considerable resources of the energy sector federation, derived from the generous time resources allocated to staff representatives in the then publicly owned companies <italic>Electricité de France</italic> and <italic>Gaz de France</italic>.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0959680112474750">
<title>Ver.di</title>
<p>In Germany, the <italic>Zukunftsdebatte</italic> (debate on the future) conducted by the DGB in the early 1990s witnessed a gradual narrowing down of the issues. Whereas some academics and external observers tended to emphasize the need for programmatic discussions on the renewal of trade union strategies and their socio-political mandate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0959680112474750">Negt, 1989</xref>), the unions chose in the end to concentrate on the ‘core functions’ of trade unionism, such as collective bargaining and employment, as well as enhanced services to members (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0959680112474750">Leif et al., 1993</xref>). Mergers between affiliates have also been pursued in order to pool financial resources. As a consequence, the number of DGB affiliates fell from 16 to eight between 1996 and 2001.</p>
<p>The mixture of organizational and political logics of action which characterize this merger wave is illustrated by the creation of <italic>ver.di</italic>, which on its foundation claimed more than three million union members. It was formed in 2001 by five unions in the private and public services, covering public administration, transport, postal services, the media, retail, banking and insurance. It is a highly complex organization with a large variety of occupational groups and diverse organizational traditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0959680112474750">Keller, 2004</xref>). One rationale for its creation was the goal of developing unionization and of using resources from strongly unionized sectors to gain members in poorly organized sectors. Another merger goal was to enhance the weight of the service sector inside the DGB in comparison to the manufacturing unions.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-0959680112474750">
<title>Advocates of union reform</title>
<p>In both cases a reformist discourse was developed, centred on a redefinition of repertoires of action and an orientation to generic organizational models related to union management. The discourse was developed by reformist coalitions composed of union officials and leaders, together with private consultants and academics who had played an important role in introducing and legitimizing managerial practices within trade unions.</p>
<p>In the case of <italic>ver.di</italic>, consultants helped define the choices available in the run-up to the merger. Some of the merging unions had previously used outside consultants to chart future development perspectives, including the public sector and transport union ÖTV (<italic>Gewerkschaft Öffentliche Dienste, Transport und Verkehr</italic>) which was by far the largest. The second largest, the <italic>Deutsche Postgewerkschaft</italic> (DPG) had in 1995 commissioned the international consulting firm Booz Allen to examine its prospects in the context of the liberalization of the postal sector. The consultants concluded that the DPG was no longer viable and would be forced to merge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0959680112474750">Waddington et al., 2005</xref>). A former DPG official said: ‘the advantage is that they [external consultants] have training regarding business management and strategy. They can also afford to go against the grain on some subjects. For example, they may ask what the remaining lifetime of the organization is by calculating certain things to their ultimate conclusion’ (interview, December 2005). Collaboration with such outside consultants is facilitated by the increased presence of graduates hired directly from university, in particular among national officials: a trend noticeable also in other German trade unions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0959680112474750">Prott and Keller, 1997</xref>). Seven of the 19 members of the <italic>ver.di Vorstand</italic> (full-time executive board) elected during the union’s founding congress in 2001 had been employed as union officials immediately after university graduation. Such leaders and officials are more likely to see themselves as experts and to compare their activities to management tasks in other organizations.</p>
<p>Outside expertise comes more from an intellectual and academic background in the case of the FCE, in line with the role of intellectuals in the development of the CFDT during the 1970s and 1980s. The mobilization of intellectual resources played an important role in establishing the CFDT inside the reformist socio-political coalition on the non-communist left during this period. In the case of the FCE, the leaderships of the two federations involved in the merger held numerous internal seminars with academic participants, during which their loss of membership and influence was constructed as a problem that could be solved through a rationalization of organizational structures. In particular, an organizational sociologist, Pierre-Eric Tixier, who had published extensively on the CFDT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0959680112474750">Tixier, 1987</xref>), counselled the two unions regarding the organizational design of the new federation’s structures and advocated, among other things, the need to reduce the number of organizational levels in the federation. The orientation towards generic organizational models was favoured by the fact that both founding federations of the FCE were historically dominated by technicians and middle-ranking executives, categories with less to lose in the managerial restructuring of organizations and already playing a central role in the depoliticization of the CFDT’s action strategies and in the core emphasis on collective bargaining (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0959680112474750">Defaud, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>The discourse on trade union rationalization is underpinned by a conception of the trade union as a dual entity: on the one hand, a voluntary organization, ruled by democratic norms; on the other, an administrative structure governed by efficiency criteria. Within the framework of this dual vision of trade unions, a space is constructed in which the prevalence of managerial practices and of administrative rationality is legitimized. The analogy between trade union apparatuses and enterprises can be emphasized, in particular by union officials most involved in the running of the apparatus. The official in charge of the internal organizational mechanisms of <italic>ver.di</italic>, who had been a union official for 15 years after working as a middle manager in a savings bank, presented such a dual vision: ‘in <italic>ver.di</italic>, there is the company structure and there is the political structure’ (interview, February 2006). Another <italic>ver.di</italic> official, in charge of ‘strategic direction’, compared the organization of work processes within unions to those in commercial enterprises: ‘the instruments and work processes used are the same in a trade union as at Daimler-Chrysler or at an insurance company. We must identify members, plan revenues and expenditures’ (interview, December 2005). In the case of the CFDT, the dual conception of the organization was developed, for example, in internal documents written by officials in charge of organizational and personnel issues. A former official responsible for personnel thus wrote in a training dissertation in 1991 that ‘“The company CFDT” is not independent of the organization CFDT. The company serves the organization, whose effectiveness depends on the functioning of the company.’</p>
<p>Below we examine the role definitions of union officials and leaders under the influence of the organizational reform discourse.</p>
</sec></sec>
<sec id="section8-0959680112474750">
<title>Redefining the roles of trade union officials and leaders</title>
<p>In both cases the reconfiguration of unions’ repertoires of action, with the attribution of greater importance in particular to collective bargaining and membership services, has contributed to changes in the role definitions of officials and leaders. These are increasingly defined on the basis of technical and organizational competences and less on criteria such as militancy and participation in union activities. Union leadership positions are thus becoming similar to those in other organizations and institutions. Whereas access to the position of union official was once seen as a culminating step in an activist’s career, the managerial redefinition of the function implies a stronger valuation of formal education and an increasing differentiation between officials and rank-and-file members.</p>
<sec id="section9-0959680112474750">
<title>Role definitions of union leaders and officials</title>
<p>Studies in France and Germany (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0959680112474750">Correia et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0959680112474750">Prott and Keller, 1997</xref>), as well as in Great Britain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0959680112474750">Watson, 1988</xref>) have shown that trade union officials are confronted by a wide variety of expectations and imperatives which are difficult to reconcile. In both France and Germany a model of activist promotion has long been prevalent, founded on the idea of the representative character of trade union functions. In accordance with the definition of trade unions as spaces of equal democratic participation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0959680112474750">Bundesmann-Jansen and Frerichs, 1995</xref>), officials and leaders have in general been expected to differentiate themselves as little as possible from members and activists. This model is linked to patterns of the ‘passive professionalization’ of trade union activists, with an accumulation of trade union and representative mandates leading them to a gradual move away from their initial job to become union officials (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0959680112474750">Prott and Keller, 1997</xref>).</p>
<p>In the two unions considered, as we will see, the functions of officials tend to be redefined as based on a set of specific managerial competences and less on political and representational criteria. Generic attributes such as communication skills, efficiency and organizational know-how of a managerial type (planning, goal-setting, performance monitoring) are emphasized over ideological resources or day-to-day experience of workplace representation. The changing role definitions of union officials are accompanied by changing role definitions of shop-floor representatives. In Germany, it has been argued that interaction between work councils and employers has become more ‘professional, rational and apolitical’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0959680112474750">Bosch, 1997</xref>), with works councillors beginning to consider themselves co-managers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0959680112474750">Frege, 2003</xref>). In the case of workplace representatives in France (<italic>délégués du personnel</italic> and members of <italic>comités d’entreprise</italic>), the trend is towards a resort to negotiations, expert resources and legal skills, within the framework of the institutionalization of the process of representation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0959680112474750">Andolfatto and Labbé, 2006</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-0959680112474750">
<title>Union officials: Experts and moderators or membership representatives?</title>
<p>Against the background of the decay of the forms of sociability that have traditionally been conducive to trade union membership (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0959680112474750">Beaud and Pialoux, 1999</xref>), as well as of an ideological crisis of trade unionism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0959680112474750">Renou, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0959680112474750">Upchurch et al., 2009</xref>), both unions exhibit trends towards an assimilation of union officials and leaders’ tasks to generic managerial functions.</p>
<p>In the case of <italic>ver.di</italic>, there has been a process of devaluation of those career resources historically linked to the institutions of the social-democratic labour movement, in favour of an alignment with prevalent managerial forms of training and qualification. Traditional training paths of union officials involved studies in the ‘labour academies’ (<italic>Akademien für Arbeit</italic>) established under the Weimar Republic and reestablished in postwar Germany to promote the training of trade union and party activists. These put the emphasis on social sciences and sought to educate activists with a low initial level of cultural capital. However, only one of the 19 members of the <italic>ver.di</italic> leadership elected in 2001 had followed this route. Forms of politicization of union officials are counterposed to the necessity for trade unions to become more professional. For example, one <italic>ver.di</italic> official in charge of the administrative organization of one of the sectoral groups, who started to work for the union after studying political science, declared: ‘ideological orientations and the concentration on ideological battles have become less important and simultaneously professionalization and market orientation have increased’ (interview, January 2006).</p>
<p>Changes in the nature of the competences and skills considered necessary to be an adequate union leader are particularly evident in the content of trade union training. In the <italic>ver.di</italic> training programmes of 2006, socio-political issues no longer figured prominently, in line with the progressive devaluation of ideological resources, and training tended towards greater specialization, formalization of the transmission of social and communication skills and, for leadership candidates, the introduction of managerial components (for example, managing staff). <italic>Ver.di</italic> provides separate training programmes for union officials and leaders; union leaders, for example, are given training centred on leadership situations, team development or coaching. This integration of specific elements for trade union leaders makes explicit the division of labour and the distinction between leadership and subordinate tasks.</p>
<p>The orientation towards the transmission of generic organizational skills also extends to works councillors, whose training programmes include generic skills and leadership components: for example, the programme of a training unit on conducting meetings states that ‘being elected does not guarantee that one possesses the necessary skills and competences for conducting meetings’ (<italic>ver.di</italic> training programme 2010). Training elements on negotiation, including the so-called ‘Harvard negotiation model’, oriented towards ‘win-win’ outcomes, are also included in the <italic>ver.di</italic> training programme, as well as sessions which promise to transmit ‘insights into human behaviour’.</p>
<p>In the case of the FCE, a similar delegitimization of former trade union resources can be noted, in line with the depoliticization of action strategies which had been a cornerstone of the CFDT’s orientation since the 1980s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0959680112474750">Giraud, 2006</xref>). The need to train activists and officials and formally to transmit social skills is emphasized in the case of the FCE. In 1994, a member of the confederal CFDT leadership stated during a presentation of the future training programme: ‘the arrival of new activists (<italic>militants</italic>) requires the rebuilding of teams and collectives in order to teach the new generations the bases of union work. Today it is rare that this transmission of knowledge is done in the workplace by experienced activists. Because of the numerous departures, workplaces are often like deserts when new activists want to take things up. The transmission of skills and of collective work today takes place largely through training’ (internal CFDT document). As a consequence, skills transmission has become formalized in the FCE, with numerous training sessions covering organizational development issues, such as conducting assessment interviews, project management or conducting meetings. One session concerns the conduct of a self-diagnostic of local union structures through a SWOT analysis (FCE training plan, 2004–2007).</p>
<p>Related to the generic role definition of union officials, the ability to distance oneself from specific sector- or workplace-related issues is set as a selection criterion for officials in the FCE. In an internal document on future organizational structures, an official states that ‘the ambition of trade unionism is to train leaders with an activist horizon and knowledge that go beyond the narrow confines of their occupation or their sector’. In this way, the legitimate definition of the trade union official and activist within the federation is redefined as being based on the ability to apply general categories of analysis to particular issues. As a consequence, the function assigned to officials is that of mediator and arbitrator between the interests of member groups. A leader of the FCE in charge of internal organization says: ‘coming from the chemical industry and being responsible for the chemical industry is not easy, one is too much involved. We have had negative experiences with a too passionate and involved management, where things have ended badly. Trade union officials have a leadership and, more or less, an arbitration role. When they are too involved or concerned, this becomes difficult. It is better to be more distant from the issues’ (interview, April 2006).</p>

<title>Seeking points of comparison: Salaries and occupational reconversion</title>
<p>The changing role definitions of union officials, as well as related changes in trade union incentive structures, are most visible in the case of <italic>ver.di</italic> in debates on appropriate salary levels for officials; while in the FCE, the most prominent issue is the return to ordinary employment (<italic>reconversion professionnelle</italic>). These differences in focus relate to the different opportunities and constraints facing unions in each country. German trade unions receive a comparatively large income from membership fees (typically 1 percent of gross income) and can maintain elaborate apparatuses offering long-term career paths to officials. Thus <italic>ver.di</italic> had close to 4000 persons on its payroll in 2006. French unions, with far fewer paying members, are far more constrained. A high proportion of staff working for them are, however, funded not by the unions themselves but indirectly by the employers or social security institutions. In the first case, a large number of representatives are allowed time off with pay (<italic>mises à disposition</italic>), particularly in the public sector and the formerly nationalized companies, in proportion to the votes for each union in workplace elections. In the second, various social security agencies employ trade unionists as <italic>conseillers techniques</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0959680112474750">Andolfatto and Labbé, 2000</xref>). Such officials cannot count on the long-term security of their positions; they, and their unions, face the problem of the potential loss of their union post and the need to return to ‘civilian’ life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0959680112474750">Ubbiali, 1999</xref>). Similar differences exist in the case of workplace representatives in the two countries. German law prescribes that, in larger firms, a specified number of works councillors shall be totally released from regular work duties and can act de facto as full-time union representatives; in practice, their positions are relatively secure. French workplace representatives can usually obtain more or less full-time release by holding several elected positions (<italic>cumul des mandats</italic>); in the context of inter-union competition, they are, however, much more vulnerable to the vagaries of social elections.</p>
<p>The managerial restructuring of incentives appears most clearly in debates on adequate salary levels for union leaders. When salary levels were set at the founding of <italic>ver.di</italic> in 2001, a heated debate ensued which addressed, among other things, the issue of legitimate comparisons. Various shop-floor activists argued that salaries should be related to the average salaries of members, and that union leaders who received high salaries risked becoming out of touch with ordinary workers. On the other hand, the leaders compared the level of their salaries with those of private-sector managers or with government ministers, and also insisted on the importance of preventing union leaders from leaving for jobs elsewhere. The insistence on the salary level as a material incentive is far removed from a militant conception of union functions which stresses the intrinsic value of serving as a trade union official (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0959680112474750">Streeck, 1981</xref>). At the same time, these debates show that ideological and representative expectations still act as constraints on the adoption of managerial practices by trade unions.</p>
<p>In the case of the FCE, the reconfiguration of the incentive structure is not focused on officials’ salary levels, but on their <italic>reconversion professionnelle</italic>. The aim of the FCE in this regard, in common with other CFDT federations, is to certify the skills of staff members in order to facilitate their vocational reinsertion. The goal is to have the period of a union mandate recognized as one during which managerial skills are acquired: this would enhance the social and labour market recognition of trade union activity.</p>
<p>The importance attributed to the <italic>reconversion professionnelle</italic> of union officials is linked to the incompleteness of their professionalization in France. A study conducted for the CFDT in the 1990s noted that it is difficult for union officials, when stepping down, to accept their previous position in the enterprise (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0959680112474750">Correia et al., 1994</xref>). In general, officials aim to occupy a managerial or executive function in the public or private sector. Interestingly, the certified skills of union officials are considered to be similar to managerial posts in public or private sector organizations. A study conducted for the CFDT identified the following skills as characteristic of union officials: ‘establishing and consolidating structures’, ‘managing teams’, ‘informing and communicating’ and ‘training individuals and groups’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0959680112474750">CREDIJ, 1995</xref>).</p>
<p>The FCE has launched a programme entitled ‘activist trajectory’ (<italic>parcours militant</italic>) in order to help officials and activists develop their competences and to have these recognized. The FCE considers the certification of vocational experience to be a privileged means of legitimizing ambitions with regard to occupational reorientation after a union mandate has expired. The FCE official in charge of this programme, a former technician in the electricity sector, insists on the need for an across-the-board renewal of trade unionism’s public image, among other things in order to create new incentives for activists to become officials: ‘if we succeed in our project to promote the professional utilization of competences obtained through union activities, we will completely change the public image of union activism and of activists. This is particularly important at a time when many activists are retiring’ (interview, June 2006).</p>
<p>Changing role definitions and the managerial redrawing of the structure of incentives, legitimizing individual rewards besides collective ones, also extend to the understanding of members’ interests, as we discuss below.</p>

<title>Members as clients? Reconfiguring membership recruitment and services</title>
<p>Both the FCE and <italic>ver.di</italic> have suffered membership losses. An important component of their reform endeavours has been the recruitment of new members and this has caused a reconfiguration of their understanding of members’ interests. <italic>Ver.di</italic> seeks to enhance service provision to members, and tends to consider members as clients who value efficiency in this regard. In the case of the FCE, marketing conceptions of membership recruitment have been promoted inside the union and rewards introduced in order to encourage local union structures to engage in organizing activities. Membership services, however, are not particularly developed in the case of the FCE, as is generally the case among French trade unions.</p>
<p><italic>Ver.di</italic> conceives membership services largely as market incentives for the purpose of recruiting new members. This ‘service approach’ supposes that members carry out a cost–benefit analysis of the union dues they pay and the services they are offered. As day-to-day grievances have traditionally been handled in the German ‘dual system’ by works councils, trade unions have tended to consider works councillors as their intermediaries with members. In recent times, however, <italic>ver.di</italic> has also tried to develop direct service relationships, among other things via call centres which offer advice and services, for example on insurance or tax issues. This approach also extends to non-members, for example in sectors with low works council coverage and atypical working conditions. In the media sector, <italic>ver.di</italic> launched its project <italic>connexx.av</italic> in 2001, offering assistance and advice via phone or email on issues related to employment contracts, social insurance or copyright law. In order to develop slogans and political campaigns, the union has commissioned marketing studies, and the task of establishing <italic>ver.di</italic> as a brand has been considered crucial.</p>
<p>On the assumption that improving the quality of membership services will help to stabilize or increase the number of members, <italic>ver.di</italic> has attempted to standardize the organization of membership services, systematizing administrative processes and establishing workflow procedures. A manual on quality management inside <italic>ver.di</italic> thus defines union members as ‘internal customers’ to which the organization should adapt its repertoire of services. Such approaches may be contested in the name of a militant conception of trade unionism: thus attempts to apply procedures for quality management have provoked resistance, in particular when they imply the establishment of quantitative indicators. A regional leader of <italic>ver.di</italic> thus states: ‘Most people we confronted with the issue of quality management asked us what were the criteria for judging? The implementation of the project did not achieve the expected success. This included reluctance among activists and officials, because quality management procedures are often used in enterprises to increase performance requirements, without making available the necessary resources. There was an ideological debate. We were accused of wanting to turn members into customers. Members should be fighters in the class struggle and not recipients of services’ (interview, January 2006).</p>
<p>The definition of members as customers can be accompanied by an assumption that they have no interest in political issues or in the running of the union. A regional leader of <italic>ver.di</italic>, a full-time official for 17 years, thus explains that in her view members want ‘to be listened to’ and ‘to benefit from services’, whereas they are indifferent to local participation opportunities (interview, February 2006). On this basis, shop-floor activists do not necessarily represent the interests of members, but rather their own interests. The lay representatives (<italic>Ehrenamtliche</italic>) coming to union meetings are described by a retired <italic>ver.di</italic> leader, who has spent her entire career as a trade union official, as often being only weakly active at the enterprise level and as ‘wasting our time and energy’ because of their ‘inefficient’ behaviour during these meetings (interview, November 2005).</p>
<p>When the FCE was founded, the goal of doubling the number of members was adopted. An internal CFDT analysis of membership decline had identified its own organizational deficiencies as contributory factors, including the supposed passivity of local union structures. Hence the CFDT introduced specially trained <italic>développeurs</italic> (organizers organ-izers) in the late 1980s to recruit new members. As membership recruitment is not traditionally considered a priority in France (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0959680112474750">Dufour and Hege, 2002</xref>), the FCE, like the CFDT as a whole, endeavours to encourage its workplace representatives and local structures to recruit members. A CFDT official, active as a <italic>développeur</italic>, thus states in a thesis written as part of his training: ‘the organizer is a salesman. He is a man in the field, he knows the organization, he has activist knowledge of legal and social matters, his communication abilities are essential to perform his job as an organizer. . . . Personality: the developer must appear trustworthy, be in good health, feel good about himself, be self-assured, be a good communicator, be able to fit in with employees’ (academic paper written by a CFDT organizer, 1991). A former CFDT official criticizes this development, declaring his opposition ‘to the idea of having organizers who would be salesmen for trade unionism and sell the union as a product. . . . There were organizers who worked by themselves, without taking into account union demands and positions. Their only concern was to get people to take out membership cards’ (interview, June 2006).</p>
<p>In order to get local union structures to make organizing their priority, the FCE has introduced objective-based funding instruments: funds are partly distributed on the basis of internal contracting processes, concentrating on specific projects with objectives and indicators of success, in particular with regard to recruitment. In this way a potential element of competition in fund allocation has been created, and the leadership of the FCE can exert pressure on territorial organizations to adopt nationally defined recruitment priorities. One leading member of the FCE thus explained that a ‘sine qua non for the conclusion of a contract on development and training’ between the national federation and local structures is that the latter are ‘in line with the Congress and that they implement the objectives of the Congress’ (interview, April 2006).</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>In both unions studied, a discourse on trade union reform has been developed which interprets the loss of members and of social influence since the 1980s (in the case of France) and the 1990s (in Germany) as requiring changes in the internal structures of union organizations. Common to both cases is an orientation towards management practices from private-sector enterprises. These are considered to be organizational models worth emulating by reform coalitions involving consultants and academics, who act as mediators for managerial rhetoric. This reformist discourse is leading to a redefinition of the roles of union leaders and officials, with an emphasis on generic attributes over ideological knowledge and day-to-day shop-floor experience of worker representation. In the case of <italic>ver.di</italic>, the reconfiguration of role definitions takes the form of an orientation towards managerial incentives for union leaders (through salary levels) and of an overt distinction between leadership and subordinate tasks. In the case of the FCE, the orientation towards management models is most apparent in relation to the <italic>reconversion professionnelle</italic> of officials at the end of their mandate. As regards membership recruitment, which in both cases is considered a priority, reform plans have emphasized, in the case of <italic>ver.di</italic>, service delivery to members, whereas the FCE mobilizes marketing techniques in order to gain new members and attempts, in part through budgetary incentives, to get its substructures to engage in organizing efforts. The cases also show that the managerialization of trade unions may be contested by union activists or officials. The example of <italic>ver.di</italic> demonstrates that representative conceptions of union officials and leaders’ roles represent, for example, obstacles to the managerial alignment of salaries and to a restructuring of incentives. The case of the FCE shows that the adoption of marketing instruments in membership recruitment may be contested on the grounds of a trade union tradition which is reluctant to define members as customers.</p>
<p>Trade union officials and leaders are thus not only focused on transferring organizational techniques from social movements, as the union revitalization renewal literature highlights, but they are also imitating private sector management practices. More research would be necessary in order to confirm whether the trends identified in the French and German unions studied are also to be found in other contexts. However, the trends described, involving an introduction of private sector management practices into trade unions, is in line with the analysis of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0959680112474750">Heery and Kelly (1994)</xref>, which suggests that developments in trade unions’ organizational structures are related to prevalent cultural conceptions about organizational models. This raises the question of the effects of the managerial reconfiguration of trade unions on union democracy and government.</p>
<p>The redefinition of the roles of union officials and leaders may have far-reaching consequences, as it could accelerate the social re-composition of trade union leaderships. Trade unionism is historically considered, both in France (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0959680112474750">Gaxie, 1978</xref>) and Germany (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0959680112474750">Witjes, 1976</xref>), to be a field in which the exclusion and self-exclusion of working classes is less strong than in political parties or other civil society associations. The process of managerialization may call into question the conception of trade unions as spaces of socio-political participation, as well as of social advance and upward mobility for working-class activists.</p>
<p>The emphasis that managerial rhetoric and practices put on the formalization of organizational structures may also have effects on union government and, specifically, on possibilities for local experimentation and policy development. Seemingly ‘archaic’ forms of union organization, with their overlapping structures and organizational levels, can indeed have a creative function as a kind of ‘organized anarchy’, as has been shown in France (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0959680112474750">Piotet, 2009a</xref>). The managerial emphasis on administrative rationality risks diminishing the representative rationality of trade unionism, which is grounded in multiple spaces of representation and participation, as well as in exchange opportunities between different organizational levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0959680112474750">Child et al., 1973</xref>).</p>
