<abstract>
<p>We describe Mexican American seventh graders’ expectations for future work and family roles and investigate links between patterns of future expectations and adolescents’ cultural experiences and adjustment. Adolescents participated in home interviews and a series of seven nightly phone calls. Five unique patterns of adolescents’ future expectations were identified (<italic>N</italic> = 246): Career-Oriented, Independent, Family-Oriented, Early, and Inconsistent. Career-Oriented adolescents had the highest socioeconomic status and contact with the United States (e.g., generation status) whereas Family-Oriented adolescents had the lowest. Cultural orientations, values, and involvement also varied across groups. For example, Career-Oriented adolescents reported significantly higher familism values compared to Inconsistent adolescents. Clusters also differed on adjustment: Career-Oriented and Family-Oriented adolescents reported higher parental warmth and less risky behavior compared to Independent and Inconsistent adolescents. These findings underscore the multifaceted nature of adolescents’ future expectations and the diversity in cultural experiences among Mexican-origin youth.</p>

<p>A young and rapidly increasing population, large cohorts of Mexican American adolescents who are setting goals now are going to be transitioning to adulthood in the next several decades (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0272431610397660">Pew Hispanic Center, 2006</xref>). Adolescents’ expectations for work and family roles are a critical part of understanding pathways to role attainment in adulthood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0272431610397660">Markus &amp; Nurius, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0272431610397660">Miller &amp; Brickman, 2004</xref>). Though research has documented correlates of career expectations and of family expectations separately (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0272431610397660">East, 1998</xref>), our interest in this study was to understand how <italic>patterns of adult role expectations</italic> are associated with individual and contextual characteristics. We used cross-sectional data from young Mexican American adolescents to describe unique <italic>patterns</italic> of future expectations, and to explore these patterns further by linking them to adolescents’ cultural experiences and adjustment. Studying cultural and adjustment correlates of Mexican American young adolescents’ future expectations provides rich descriptive information about this population and their projected pathways.</p>
<p>The specific goals of this study were threefold. The first goal was to investigate diverse patterns of Mexican American adolescents’ future plans based upon expectations for age to move out of parents’ home, age to get married, educational attainment, and career aspiration. The second and third goals were to examine associations between patterns of adult role expectations and adolescents’ cultural experiences (i.e., orientations, values, and involvement) and adjustment (i.e., depressive symptoms, risky behavior, and parent-adolescent warmth), respectively. The overarching purpose of this study was descriptive, such that our aim was to describe the unique patterns that exist among adolescents’ expectations for adult roles as well as the correlates of those unique patterns. Further, the cross-sectional nature of our sample led us to consider future expectations as both outcomes and predictors, and we vary our language to reflect this.</p>
<sec id="section1-0272431610397660">
<title>Patterns of Future Expectations Among Mexican American Adolescents</title>
<p>Experiences in childhood and adolescence can influence future plans and goals that, in turn, can influence pathways to adult role attainment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0272431610397660">Crosnoe &amp; Elder, 2004</xref>). However, experiences, future plans, and pathways may differ across and within cultural groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0272431610397660">Greenfield, Keller, Fuligni, &amp; Maynard, 2003</xref>). For example, “emerging adulthood” in the United States is characterized by role exploration, risky activities, and extended education (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0272431610397660">Arnett, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0272431610397660">Cohen, Kasen, Chen, Hartmark, &amp; Gordon, 2003</xref>). However, role exploration and extended education are more common in modern industrialized cultures and for individuals in advantaged socioeconomic positions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0272431610397660">Shanahan, 2000</xref>). Mexican American adolescents, particularly those who have less access to resources via their socioeconomic status and contact with the United States, may hold beliefs and expectations about transitioning to adult roles that differ from U.S. adolescents of other racial/ethnic backgrounds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0272431610397660">Arnett &amp; Eisenberg, 2007</xref>). We investigated these ideas with a sample of Mexican American young adolescents. This age period is significant because cognitive skills necessary to think about and plan for future events are maturing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0272431610397660">Keating &amp; Sasse, 1996</xref>) and control over important decisions about school, relationships, and future careers is increasing. Research indicates that future planning can play a long-term protective role and that its importance is heightened during transition periods, such as early adolescence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0272431610397660">McCabe &amp; BArnett, 2000</xref>).</p>
<p>An important contribution of this study is our focus on <italic>patterns</italic> of adult role expectations. Pattern-analytic strategies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0272431610397660">Magnusson, 1998</xref>) are necessary to capture the multiple ways that adolescents organize their plans for education, career, and family. Knowing the correlates of high versus low educational expectations, for example, becomes more meaningful when it is in the context of also knowing about adolescents’ family and career goals. To aid our interpretation of emergent patterns, we considered two dimensions along which adolescents’ future plans might vary: family- versus individualistic-orientation, and congruence versus incongruence. For example, a family-orientation could include plans to move out of parents’ home just before entering marriage while an individualistic-orientation could include plans to move out of parents’ home at an early age <italic>and</italic> to delay marriage for several years. Congruent plans would be logical and realistic, such as aspiring to become a doctor <italic>and</italic> planning to obtain a professional degree, whereas incongruent plans would be less so (e.g., plans to marry before completing high school).</p>

<sec id="section2-0272431610397660">
<title>Links Between Patterns of Future Expectations and Cultural Experiences</title>
<p>Cultural experiences may play an important role in Mexican American adolescents’ transitions to adulthood because they must navigate both the majority culture of the United States and their culture of origin. Many researchers have noted that culture is particularly important for understanding ethnic minority adolescents’ future expectations because the majority culture and culture of origin may differ in their emphasis on autonomy versus relatedness in adult roles (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0272431610397660">Greenfield et al., 2003</xref>). For example, spending several years in young adulthood living independent of parents or a spouse may be praised in a culture that values autonomy, but criticized in a culture which stresses the importance of proximal family relationships. To understand this complex issue, we examined several indicators of cultural experiences and we focused on understanding within-group differences in these indicators. In other words, we examined whether adolescents’ cultural orientations, values, and involvement differed across diverse patterns of future plans.</p>
<sec id="section3-0272431610397660">
<title>Cultural orientation</title>
<p>One way to measure cultural experiences is to assess orientations to U.S. mainstream and Mexican culture. Some work suggests that mainstream-oriented adolescents, when measured by network preferences, have higher educational goals than adolescents who are Mexican-oriented (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0272431610397660">Reyes, Kobus, &amp; Gillock, 1999</xref>). Other research, however, finds that time spent living in the United States is negatively associated with adolescents’ educational goals (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0272431610397660">St-Hilaire, 2002</xref>). Socioeconomic status (SES) confounds may explain these discrepant findings. When measured by language and network preferences, mainstream orientation is associated with higher SES (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0272431610397660">Cuéllar, Arnold, &amp; Maldonado, 1995</xref>). Yet if upward socioeconomic mobility has not occurred as a result of years spent in the United States, adolescents’ educational goals may diminish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0272431610397660">Negy &amp; Woods, 1992</xref>). These issues underscore the need to measure orientation to both mainstream United States and Mexican culture and to account for SES when examining cultural orientation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0272431610397660">Negy &amp; Woods, 1992</xref>). Controlling for SES, we expected Mexican orientation to be associated with family-oriented patterns of expectations (e.g., delay moving out of parents’ home until marriage) and mainstream orientation to be associated with individualistic patterns of expectations (e.g., delay marriage and pursue a professional career).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0272431610397660">
<title>Cultural values</title>
<p>In addition to assessing overall cultural orientation, it is important to measure specific cultural values that can guide behavior and future goals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0272431610397660">Greenfield et al., 2003</xref>). Within-group variability in cultural values may be linked to different patterns of future expectations. In particular, familism and traditional gender role attitudes are important values that are associated with Mexican culture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0272431610397660">Marín &amp; Gamba, 2003</xref>). Studies suggest that gender role attitudes of immigrants and Mexican Americans are significantly more traditional than non-Hispanic White Americans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0272431610397660">Rodriguez, Ramirez, &amp; Korman, 1999</xref>), though they become less traditional as more time is spent in the United States (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0272431610397660">Valentine &amp; Mosley, 2000</xref>). Traditional attitudes have been linked to Mexican American high school girls’ lower educational and career expectations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0272431610397660">McWhirter, Hackett, &amp; Bandalos, 1998</xref>), and to adolescents’ decreased expectations for establishing an independent household before marriage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0272431610397660">Goldscheider &amp; Goldscheider, 1992</xref>). These studies led us to expect that traditional attitudes would be associated with family-oriented patterns of future plans (e.g., expect early marriage and lower career attainment, particularly for girls) and less traditional attitudes would be associated with individualistic patterns (e.g., more time as a single head-of-household).</p>
<p>Familism appears to be an enduring Latino cultural value and includes beliefs about maintaining close family relationships into adulthood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0272431610397660">Sabogal, Marín, Otero-Sabogal, Marín, &amp; Perez-Stable, 1987</xref>). Adolescents’ familism values may be associated with their plans for young adulthood. For example, a sense of family obligations is associated with a greater likelihood of living at home and pursuing higher education after high school (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0272431610397660">Fuligni &amp; Pedersen, 2002</xref>). Further, Mexican American adolescents who value family support tend to have fewer externalizing problems and better academic engagement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0272431610397660">Gonzales et al., 2008</xref>). Therefore, we expected that high familism values would be linked to congruent and family-oriented patterns of future expectations (e.g., marry early and enter employment early). In contrast, adolescents with lower familism values would have less congruent and more individualistic patterns of future plans.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0272431610397660">
<title>Cultural involvement</title>
<p>Ecological perspectives propose that how and with whom adolescents spend their time provides opportunities for learning skills, forming a sense of identity, and developing interpersonal bonds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0272431610397660">Bronfenbrenner, 1979</xref>). Time spent with <italic>companions</italic> may reflect adolescents’ future plans because companions transmit cultural norms and beliefs regarding work and family roles. The family context is usually a primary source for information about successfully negotiating important developmental tasks in adulthood (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0272431610397660">Bryant, Zvonkovic, &amp; Reynolds, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0272431610397660">Starrels &amp; Holm, 2000</xref>). However, immigrant and ethnic minority parents’ knowledge of U.S. norms and institutions may be limited. Particularly in these cases, the peer context may play an important role in socializing future plans and goals.</p>
<p>To explore associations between adolescents’ cultural involvement and future plans, we studied time spent with Mexican family members and with Mexican peers. As our measure does not indicate the quality or content of time spent in particular contexts, we drew upon past research focusing on the notion of <italic>unsupervised</italic> peer time to formulate our hypotheses. For example, Latino parents report socializing their children to be successful in marriage and family and to hold high education and career aspirations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0272431610397660">Azmitia &amp; Brown, 2002</xref>). Yet time spent in unsupervised peer contexts has been associated with unproductive and deviant activities, which may not be consistent with success in future adult roles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0272431610397660">Larson &amp; Seepersad, 2003</xref>). Therefore, we expected that more time spent with family would be associated with patterns of higher and more time spent with peers would be associated with patterns of lower educational goals and family role orientations.</p>

<sec id="section6-0272431610397660">
<title>Links Between Patterns of Future Expectations and Adjustment</title>
<p>Developmental task theory suggests that adjustment patterns earlier in life are linked to adjustment patterns in adulthood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0272431610397660">Masten et al., 2004</xref>). Further, the timing of adult role attainment can impact well-being over the life course. Theory indicates that transition sequences that foster gains in human, social, and personal capital are linked to better adjustment in adulthood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0272431610397660">Caspi, Wright, Moffitt, &amp; Silva, 1998</xref>). In particular, delaying marriage and parenthood and pursuing higher education are important determinants of job attainment and future earnings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0272431610397660">Mouw, 2005</xref>). Adult role transitions are also linked to factors present during childhood and adolescence. For example, non-Hispanic White girls who exhibit risky behavior and problems at school move out earlier than do girls with fewer problems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0272431610397660">Stattin &amp; Magnusson, 1996</xref>). Therefore, understanding the extent to which adolescents’ well-being is associated with patterns of future plans increases our understanding of how pathways to adulthood are linked to adjustment over the life course.</p>
<p>Two indicators of individual adjustment, depressive symptoms and risky behavior, are particularly relevant given that these problems often surface for the first time during adolescence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0272431610397660">Avenevoli &amp; Steinberg, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0272431610397660">Moffitt, 1993</xref>). Problematic adjustment may hinder adolescents’ expectations for future success in familial, educational, and work roles. Research with Israeli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0272431610397660">Seginer &amp; Lilach, 2004</xref>) and Hawaiian (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0272431610397660">Skorikov, 2007</xref>) adolescents suggests that depression is linked to expectations for never marrying and unrealistic educational and career plans. In addition, adolescent risky behavior is linked to lower expectations for marriage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0272431610397660">Manning, Longmore, &amp; Giordano, 2007</xref>), and lower educational and occupational attainment (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0272431610397660">Tanner, Davies, O’Grady, 1999</xref>). We expected risky behavior and depression to be associated with patterns of future plans that were less congruent, where family roles were avoided (i.e., move out of parents’ home early, delay marriage), and where educational and career goals were lower.</p>
<p>Relationship quality with parents is another indicator of adolescent well-being. Parents are important sources of information about future adult roles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0272431610397660">Tucker, Barber, &amp; Eccles, 2001</xref>). Warm and close parent-adolescent relationships are linked to increased exploration toward and self-efficacy for future work and family roles in Israeli adolescents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0272431610397660">Seginer, Vermulst, &amp; Shoyer, 2004</xref>) and to delayed family role expectations in rural non-Hispanic White adolescents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0272431610397660">Crouter, Carson, Vicary, &amp; Butler, 1988</xref>). Furthermore, longitudinal data with non-Hispanic Whites have documented that transitions into adult roles generally lead to more emotional closeness with parents (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0272431610397660">Aquilino, 1997</xref>). Taken together, these studies suggest that strained parent-child relationships may be a symptom or a predictor of adolescent goal setting that does not indicate progression toward mature roles or an understanding of the steps required to reach future goals. We expected that parent-adolescent warmth would be positively associated with patterns of realistic expectations (i.e., congruent plans). Alternatively, first generation immigrant parents and their adolescents may disagree on what constitutes realistic goals due to dissonant acculturation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0272431610397660">Portes &amp; Rumbaut, 2001</xref>). In this case, adolescents may report realistic future plans even in the context of less warmth with their parents.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-0272431610397660">
<title>Moderating Factors</title>
<p>Socioeconomic status is an important contextual factor for understanding adolescents’ future expectations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0272431610397660">García Coll et al., 1996</xref>). For example, potential negative associations between risky behavior and patterns of low educational and career goals may be stronger for lower than for higher SES adolescents because higher SES adolescents have greater access to resources that can minimize negative associations. Feminist perspectives also draw attention to gender differences in access to work and family roles (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0272431610397660">Coltrane &amp; Parke, 1998</xref>). While most adolescents report that successful familial relationships are a high priority, girls are more likely than boys to mention occupational and familial goals at equal frequencies when asked about their futures (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0272431610397660">Yowell, 2000</xref>). Therefore, SES and gender were examined as moderators of the links between future expectations and adolescents’ cultural experiences and adjustment.</p>

<title>Method</title>
<sec id="section9-0272431610397660">
<title>Participants</title>
<p>Interviews were conducted with 246 Mexican American families as part of a study of family socialization and adolescent development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0272431610397660">Updegraff, McHale, Whiteman, Thayer, &amp; Delgado, 2005</xref>). Families were eligible for participation if (a) seventh graders, an older sibling, biological mothers and biological or long-term adoptive (at least 10 years) were living in the home, (b) mothers were of Mexican origin, and (c) fathers worked at least 20 hours per week. Though not a requirement, 93% of fathers were also of Mexican origin. These criteria were set given the goals of the larger study, to understand both mothers’ and fathers’ roles and how they were shaped by parent-work dynamics. We focus on seventh graders (target adolescents in the larger study) to understand young adolescents’ future plans.</p>
<p>Families represented a diverse range of backgrounds. The median family income level was US$40,000 (<italic>SD</italic> = US$45,382, <italic>range</italic> = US$3,000 to over $100,000) and parents reported approximately 10 years of education (<inline-formula id="inline-formula1-0272431610397660">

Parents born outside of the country had lived in the United States an average of 12.38 years for mothers (<italic>SD</italic> = 8.86) and 15.18 years for fathers (<italic>SD</italic> = 8.78). Target adolescents (seventh graders) were 51% female (<italic>n</italic> = 125) and about 12.51 years old (<italic>SD</italic> = 0.58; <italic>range</italic> = 11-14).

<sec id="section10-0272431610397660">
<title>Procedures</title>
<p>Names of seventh-grade adolescents with Latino backgrounds who were not learning disabled were obtained from five school districts and five parochial schools in and around a large southwestern city. Letters were mailed to families of these adolescents (<italic>N</italic> = 1,856) describing the goals of the study in both English and Spanish. Follow-up phone calls were then made to assess interest in and eligibility for participation. For 438 families (24%), the contact information was incorrect and repeated attempts to find updated information through school personnel or public listings were unsuccessful. An additional 42 (2.4%) families moved between the initial screening and final recruitment contact, and 148 (8%) refused to be screened for eligibility. Eligible families included 421 families (32% of those we were able to contact and screen for eligibility). Of those who were eligible (<italic>n</italic> = 421), 284 (or 67%) agreed to participate, 95 (23%) refused, and we were unable to recontact the remaining 42 families (10%) who were eligible to determine if they would participate. Interviews were completed by 246 families. The remaining 38 families were unable to be located or refused to participate at the time of the interview.</p>
<p>Data were collected from mothers, fathers, and adolescents using two procedures. First, family members completed in-home interviews in their preferred language (English or Spanish) led by trained bilingual interviewers. Next, within 3 to 4 weeks of the home interview, adolescents participated in a series of seven nightly phone calls (five weekday calls and two weekend calls) about their daily time use and each parent participated in four phone calls (three weekday calls and one weekend call). Using a cued-recall procedure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0272431610397660">McHale, Crouter, &amp; Bartko, 1992</xref>), adolescents reported on their involvement during nonschool hours in 86 different activities, including how long each event lasted and who else was present (i.e., gender, ethnicity, and relationship to adolescent). Parents provided the same types of information about activities they participated in with target adolescents and about their involvement in housework. Families received a US$100 honorarium for participating in the home interviews and US$100 for participating in the phone interviews.</p>

<title>Measures</title>
<p>All measures were forward and back translated into Spanish by two translators familiar with the local Spanish dialect using the method outlined by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0272431610397660">Foster and Martinez (1995)</xref>.</p>
<sec id="section12-0272431610397660">
<title>Future expectations</title>
<p>Adolescents’ expectations for future role transitions and educational and occupational attainment were assessed with four items: (a) “How old do you expect to be when you move out of your parents’ home?” (b) “What age do you expect to be when you get married?” (c) “How far do you really think you will go in school?” and (d) “What kind of job would you like to have when you are an adult?” Response choices for education were on a continuous scale representing the total number of years of education (e.g., 16 = <italic>bachelor’s degree</italic>; 21 = <italic>JD, MD, PhD</italic>). Adolescents’ job preferences were coded for prestige (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0272431610397660">Nakao &amp; Treas, 1994</xref>), and ranged from occupations such as waiter/waitress (28.08) to physician (86.05).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section13-0272431610397660">
<title>Family background</title>
<p>Parents reported their income, educational attainment, years living in the United States, and adolescents’ country of birth. Adolescents’ language preference (English or Spanish) for the interview was also recorded. A socioeconomic status variable was computed by log transforming family income to correct for high positive skewness, and then standardizing the transformed income score, along with mothers’ and fathers’ education attainment level into z-scores. These three scores were then averaged (α = .78; <italic>SD</italic> = .84; <italic>range</italic> = −2.36 to 2.08).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section14-0272431610397660">
<title>Cultural experiences</title>
<p>Adolescents’ cultural experiences were assessed with two indicators each of cultural orientation, cultural values, and involvement. Adolescents’ <italic>cultural orientations to Mexican and mainstream U.S. culture</italic> were assessed with the Acculturation Rating Scale for Mexican Americans-II (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0272431610397660">Cuéllar et al., 1995</xref>). Adolescents responded to 30 items (e.g., “My friends are of Mexican origin” and “I enjoy English language TV”) on a 5-point scale (1 = <italic>not at all</italic>, 5 = <italic>extremely often or almost always</italic>). Scores from this measure included Mexican orientation (17 items; α = .90) and mainstream orientation (13 items; α = .82).</p>
<p>Two cultural values were also examined. G<italic>ender role attitudes</italic> were assessed with 10 items (e.g., A husband’s job is more important than a wife’s) on a 4-point scale (1 = <italic>strongly agree</italic>, 4 = <italic>strongly disagree</italic>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0272431610397660">Hoffman &amp; Kloska, 1995</xref>). Items were averaged, with higher scores indicating more traditional attitudes (α = .82). <italic>Familism support</italic> (α = .74) was measured with a subscale from the Mexican American Cultural Values Scale (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0272431610397660">Knight et al., 2010</xref>). Adolescents rated six items (e.g., Parents should teach their children that the family always comes first) on a 5-point scale (1 = <italic>strongly disagree</italic>, 5 = <italic>strongly agree</italic>).</p>
<p>The third aspect of cultural experiences was the amount of time that adolescents spent in particular cultural contexts. Using data from the phone interviews, variables were computed for time spent with <italic>family members</italic> (only nuclear or extended kin present) and <italic>Mexican peers</italic> (only nonsibling kin and nonkin under age 18 present). For time spent with family members, families in which the father was not of Mexican origin (<italic>n</italic> = 18, as well as one family who was missing this information) were excluded to increase the likelihood that the variable represented time spent with <italic>Mexican</italic> family members. Time use variables were converted to proportion scores, computed as time in the selected context divided by total time reported across the seven phone calls, and square root transformed to correct for skewness. In analyses involving time use variables, untransformed overall means (in hours) are reported for ease of interpretation, though effect sizes were computed using the transformed proportion scores. Adolescents’ reports of their time use were highly reliable; correlations between younger siblings’ reports and reports of the other target family members ranged from .80 to .90 for shared time.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section15-0272431610397660">
<title>Adjustment</title>
<p>Adolescents’ well-being was assessed by depressive symptoms, risky behaviors, and parent-adolescent warmth. Adolescents reported how often they experienced <italic>depressive symptoms</italic> (e.g., I thought my life had been a failure) on a 4-point scale (1 = <italic>rarely or none of the time</italic>, 4 = <italic>most of the time</italic>) using the 20-item Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale (α = .85; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0272431610397660">Radloff, 1977</xref>). The CES-D has established measurement equivalence for Mexican American adolescents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0272431610397660">Crockett, Randall, Shen, Russell, &amp; Driscoll, 2005</xref>). Adolescents reported how often they engaged in each of 24 <italic>risky behaviors</italic> (e.g., smoked cigarettes, started a fight with someone) on a 4-point scale (1 = <italic>never</italic>, 4 = <italic>more than 10 times</italic>) using a measure adapted from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0272431610397660">Eccles and Barber (1990</xref>; α = .91) for use with ethnically diverse youth. Finally, <italic>parent-adolescent warmth</italic> was assessed with the acceptance subscale of the Child Report of Parental Behavior Inventory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0272431610397660">Schaefer, 1965</xref>). Adolescents responded to eight items (e.g., My mother/father is able to make me feel better when I am upset) on a 5-point scale (1 = <italic>almost never</italic>, 5 = <italic>almost always</italic>) for their mothers (α = .84) and fathers (α = .89) separately. Cross ethnic and language equivalence of CRPBI acceptance scale has been established by Knight and colleagues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0272431610397660">Knight, Tein, &amp; Shell, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0272431610397660">Knight, Virdin, &amp; Roosa, 1994</xref>).</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>Results are organized around the three goals of the study: (a) to describe patterns of Mexican American adolescents’ expectations for future work and family roles, and to examine links between patterns of future expectations and (b) adolescents’ cultural experiences and (c) adolescents’ adjustment. Our plan of analysis included a clustering strategy and then a series of ANCOVAs. First, a cluster analysis was conducted using Sleipner version 2.1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0272431610397660">Bergman &amp; El-Khouri, 2002</xref>) to identify unique patterns of adolescents’ future expectations. Next, we tested a series of 5 (Cluster) × 2 (Gender) ANCOVA models, with familial SES included as a covariate, to determine whether future expectation clusters differed significantly by cultural experiences and adjustment. We also tested a series of 5 (Cluster) × 2 (Gender) × 2 (Socioeconomic Status) ANOVA models, in which SES was divided into two groups according to a median split, to determine whether SES moderated associations between future expectations and the culture variables. Follow-up comparisons were conducted with Tukey’s tests using unadjusted means.</p>
<sec id="section17-0272431610397660">
<title>Goal 1: Identify Patterns of Mexican American Adolescents’ Future Expectations</title>
<p>Descriptive statistics and correlations (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0272431610397660">Table 1</xref>) suggest that adolescents’ future plans are linked in expected ways. On average, adolescents who plan to move out of their parents’ house later also expect to marry later. In turn, expecting to marry later is linked to higher educational expectations, and higher educational expectations are linked to higher career goals.</p>

<p>Adolescents with complete data on the four future expectation variables (<italic>n</italic> = 237; 96% of the sample) were entered into a cluster analysis to identify unique patterns of expectations. Adolescents with missing data were not significantly different from the rest of the sample on family background characteristics or the dependent variables. Cluster analysis is sensitive to outliers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0272431610397660">Bergman, 1988</xref>), and nine cases were removed by the standard procedure in Sleipner (i.e., a case is retained if the squared Euclidean distance from its closest neighbor is .50 or less).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0272431610397660">1</xref></sup></p>
<p>The cases that were retained (<italic>n</italic> = 228; 93% of the sample) were then clustered according to the weighted average linkage algorithm using squared Euclidean distance. The best solution was chosen based on the merging coefficients, explained error sums of squares (ESS), and whether solutions distinguished among theoretically meaningful groups. Similar to interpreting scree plots in exploratory factor analysis, it is recommended to select the cluster solution just before a large increase in the merging coefficient and before a large decrease in the explained ESS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0272431610397660">Aldenderfer &amp; Blashfield, 1984</xref>). For the seven-, six-, five-, four-, and three-cluster solutions, respectively, the merging coefficients were 1.99, 2.00, 2.41, 2.75, and 3.46 and the explained ESS were 53.56, 49.13, 47.98, 40.75, and 33.07. The merging coefficients supported the six-cluster solution and the explained ESS supported the five-cluster solution. Closer inspection revealed that the six-cluster solution included two small clusters (<italic>n</italic> = 16 and <italic>n</italic> = 5) that were theoretically similar. We determined that the five-cluster solution optimized theoretical relevance and the cluster statistics.</p>
<p>Next, to increase within-cluster homogeneity, cases were relocated using an iterative procedure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0272431610397660">Aldenderfer &amp; Blashfield, 1984</xref>). A total of 65 cases were relocated, resulting in an increase in the explained ESS from 47.98% to 54.70%. The means of each variable within each of the five clusters are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0272431610397660">Table 2</xref>. The first cluster (Career-Oriented) had the highest educational and career goals. Adolescents in the second cluster (Independent) expected the largest gap in time between age to move out of parents’ house and age to get married (7.2 years). In contrast to the Independent cluster, adolescents in the third cluster (Family-Oriented) had the smallest gap in time between expected ages to move out and to marry (0.8 years). Adolescents in Cluster 4 (Early) were characterized by the earliest expected family role transitions and the lowest school and career goals. Finally, adolescents in Cluster 5 (Inconsistent) expected to move out and to get married at an earlier than average age, but had higher than average career goals and lower than average educational goals. Their career aspirations seemed inconsistent with their expectations for (relatively) low educational attainment and early transitions into family roles.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0272431610397660">2</xref></sup></p>

<title>Goal 2: Links between Patterns of Future Expectations and Cultural Experiences</title>
<p>Three sets of indicators were tested to assess whether patterns of future expectations were associated with different aspects of cultural experiences: (a) orientation to Mexican culture and mainstream culture, (b) endorsement of traditional gender role attitudes and familism, and (c) time spent in Mexican familial and peer contexts. Because analyses revealed that SES did not significantly moderate associations between future expectations and cultural experiences,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0272431610397660">3</xref></sup> SES was added as a covariate. Mean values of the three indicators of cultural experience by the clusters are presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0272431610397660">Table 4</xref>. As shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-0272431610397660">Table 5</xref>, the ANCOVA models revealed that gender or the interaction between gender and cluster did not predict meaningful differences in cultural experiences. However, there were systematic differences in the three sets of indicators of cultural experiences across the clusters.</p>

<p>Mexican and mainstream cultural orientations were included in the same analysis with cultural orientation treated as a within-group factor to test cluster membership differences in both Mexican and mainstream cultural orientations simultaneously. The follow-up analyses of the significant cluster by cultural orientation interaction (comparing the difference scores of Mexican orientation minus mainstream orientation across groups) revealed that Family-Oriented youth reported stronger Mexican than mainstream orientations and differed significantly from Career-Oriented, Inconsistent, and Independent youth, who reported stronger mainstream than Mexican orientations (<italic>d</italic>s = .84, .91 and .95, respectively). In addition, Inconsistent and Independent youth also differed from Early youth (<italic>d</italic>s = .51 and .50, respectively): Inconsistent and Independent youth reported stronger orientations toward mainstream culture as compared to Mexican culture, but Early youth had similar orientations to Mexican and mainstream cultures.</p>
<p>For cultural values, there were significant overall cluster effects for both traditional gender role attitudes and familism values.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The process of transitioning from adolescence to adulthood depends on access to resources and cultural norms and beliefs about when and how transitions should occur. This study provides a “snapshot” of this process by describing how Mexican American seventh graders think about their work and family futures. We also gain understanding of how context relates to this process by describing links between patterns of future plans and cultural and adjustment factors. In discussing our results, we reflect upon the cultural-ecological context to understand how experiences, future plans, and pathways are linked over the life course.</p>
<p>Our pattern-analytic approach identified groups of adolescents characterized by distinct patterns of future plans. For example, the cluster strategy showed that both Independent and Family-Oriented adolescents plan to delay marriage, but that only Family-Oriented youth plan to live with their parents in the years before marriage. This difference in marriage expectations would be obscured had we only examined bivariate correlations between future plans, and underscores the importance of understanding patterns across key decisions about adult roles. Examination of the collective set of expectations also revealed patterns of developmental significance. Over a quarter of the sample fell into the Inconsistent cluster, which was characterized by low levels of expected educational attainment coupled with high career expectations. In early adolescence, youth may have unrealistic expectations and a less clear understanding of what is necessary to obtain particular adult careers and lifestyles. It is likely that the patterns of adolescents’ expectations for their adult lives will shift over the course of adolescence as they develop more sophisticated cognitive abilities and acquire experiences in their journeys toward adulthood.</p>
<p>Important cluster differences emerged with regard to access to resources (SES) and in cultural background characteristics that reflect contact with the United States. (i.e., adolescents’ language preference, nativity, generation status, and mothers’ years living in the United States.). Although it is normative for non-Hispanic Whites to move out of parents’ home several years prior to getting married (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0272431610397660">Cohen et al., 2003</xref>), this study indicates that Mexican American youth who are born in Mexico and have spent less time living in the United States. (i.e., Family-Oriented cluster) are less likely to expect this path. Socioeconomic status was lowest in the Early and Family-Oriented clusters. For the Early cluster, being U.S. born and speaking English was linked to lower educational and career goals and for the Family-Oriented cluster, less contact with the United States (in terms of generation status, mothers’ years living in the United States, and youth’s nativity) was linked to higher educational and career goals. In contrast, the cluster with the highest SES and the longest number of years living in the United States reported the highest educational and career goals (i.e., Career-Oriented cluster). These adolescents may have accrued more resources in terms of both financial resources and cultural experiences that provide a context for expectations to pursue extended education and professional careers.</p>
<p>Results from the second goal of the study revealed that adolescents’ future expectations are linked to their cultural experiences in complex ways. An important contribution of this study was to move beyond the focus on singular and proxy measures of culture (e.g., generation status or nativity) to understand how <italic>multiple</italic> dimensions of culture (i.e., cultural orientations, values, and involvement) are linked to youths’ future plans. Such an approach allows for a more nuanced perspective on the role of culture in Mexican American adolescents’ future plans. For instance, endorsing less traditional gender role attitudes is consistent with Career-Oriented adolescents’ (82% female) high education and career goals and Independent adolescents’ plans to delay marriage. Family-Oriented adolescents who expected to spend more time living with parents and aspired to a more professional career also reported higher Mexican than mainstream orientations. Most important may be what we learned by looking across the <italic>constellation</italic> of cultural experiences. In the Inconsistent cluster, for example, adolescents may receive contradictory messages about adult roles. In particular, their traditional gender role attitudes seem to conflict with their low familism values and higher mainstream as compared to Mexican orientations. Further, Inconsistent adolescents spent the most time in unsupervised Mexican peer contexts. Perhaps protective cultural values, such as familism, are not advanced in the peer context to the same extent as in the familial context. Taken together, our findings suggest that young adolescents’ cultural experiences are a factor in their expectations for adulthood and that the complexities involved in studying the role of culture is evident when culture is conceptualized in a multidimensional way.</p>
<p>Clusters did not differ by depressive symptoms, but higher parental warmth was linked to cluster membership emphasizing either future work roles (i.e., Career-Oriented adolescents) or family roles (i.e., Family-Oriented adolescents). In addition, Career-Oriented youth reported significantly less involvement in risky behaviors than Independent and Inconsistent adolescents. One potential explanation is that high education and career goals, like those of Career-Oriented adolescents, are protective in terms of involvement in risky behavior. In addition, Career-Oriented adolescents spend less time with Mexican peers and describe higher levels of parental warmth than Inconsistent adolescents, both of which may be additional protective factors for involvement in risky behaviors (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0272431610397660">Osgood, Anderson, &amp; Shaffer, 2005</xref>). The pattern for the Independent cluster suggests that adolescents who engage in risky activities plan to delay marriage, perhaps because they expect to continue engaging in risky activities in young adulthood.</p>
<p>We tested whether gender moderated associations between cluster membership and cultural experiences and well-being, but no interactions were significant. For Mexican Americans in early adolescence, it seems that boys’ and girls’ plans and goals for their future are associated with culture and well-being in similar ways. Gender may begin to differentiate links between future expectations and cultural experiences and adjustment as adolescents mature physically and socially.</p>
<p>SES did not emerge as a moderator of associations either. Past research has shown that SES is linked to adolescents’ future education goals and family plans (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0272431610397660">East, 1998</xref>). Therefore, it is not surprising that SES was intimately tied to the clusters that emerged, and may explain why cluster × SES interactions were not significant. In addition, the confounds among indices of culture and SES (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0272431610397660">McLoyd, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0272431610397660">Negy &amp; Woods, 1992</xref>) suggest that future work with larger samples is needed to begin to understand how culture and SES separately and in combination are linked to girls’ versus boys’ future plans.</p>

<title>Limitations and Future Research Directions</title>
<p>The limitations of the current study offer a springboard for future research. First, the exploratory nature of cluster analysis makes replication particularly important. Though our sample is diverse in terms of family and cultural background, its representativeness is limited to young Mexican American adolescents living with both parents and at least one other sibling in a large southwestern city. In addition to increasing generalizability, future research should include measures of other future plans (e.g., cohabitation) in tracing pathways to adulthood.</p>
<p>A second limitation is our focus on future plans and goals. In reality, young people are not always able to realize their goals or follow through on their plans, particularly in the face of contextual constraints. Discrimination, poverty, and language barriers can hinder educational and career progress, and the availability of a partner has obvious consequences for the timing of marriage and parenthood. An important step for future research will be to understand how much personal agency and decision making play a role in the transition to adulthood versus contextual resources and constraints (and fortuitous life events).</p>
<p>Finally, the cross-sectional nature of the data does not allow us to draw conclusions regarding direction of effects. It is reasonable that cultural orientation and values lead to expectations about adult roles; however, adolescents also may adapt their cultural involvement to match that of their future expectations. For example, adolescents who are particularly motivated to achieve educational and career success might adopt cultural values of competitiveness and independence that will facilitate their progress. Longitudinal studies are needed to uncover the ways that culture, adjustment, and pathways to adulthood are related.</p>
<p>In conclusion, the present study offers evidence for diversity in early Mexican American adolescents’ future expectations. It appears that there are distinct groups of adolescents who vary widely in their expected pathways to adulthood. Further, while all elements of culture are not linked in the same ways to youths’ patterns of future expectations, there is evidence that these expectations are associated with adolescents’ culture and well-being in meaningful, albeit complex, ways. As the growing population of Mexican American adolescents living in the United States strive to reach their work and family goals, research on their goals for adulthood will become increasingly important.</p>
