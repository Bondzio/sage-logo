<title>Background</title>
<p>Pandemics “are some of the problems without passports” and prove that “ours is a world in which no individual, and no country, exists in isolation” as the former UN general Kofi Anan noted a decade ago.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0009922812474890">1</xref></sup> Pandemics take a toll not only on human lives but also on the functioning of hospitals. After the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2004, pandemic planning has been an important preparation in most hospitals, including in ours.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0009922812474890">2</xref></sup> The 2009 influenza A H1N1(pH1N1) pandemic was the first time this planning was tested in practice.</p>
<p>The first wave of the pH1N1 pandemic started in April 2009 and a more serious second wave in June 2009.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0009922812474890">3</xref></sup> Many hospitals had pandemic preparation in place for pH1N1 and subsequently examined their responses to identify areas of improvement.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0009922812474890">4</xref></sup> This article describes our experiences during the second wave of pH1N1 at a tertiary-care children’s hospital during the Fall 2009 outbreak. Our objective is to describe our experiences with practical problems and solutions used in the management of the second wave of influenza A H1N1 (pH1N1) pandemic in a tertiary-care children’s hospital.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-0009922812474890" sec-type="methods">
<title>Methods</title>
<p>An autoethnographic study to reconstruct the events leading up to and the subsequent response to the second wave of pH1N1 at our hospital was conducted. Autoethnography is a genre of writing and research that connects personal narratives to cultural and social contexts.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0009922812474890">5</xref></sup> The authors use their own experiences to extend understanding of pandemic management in a university hospital.</p>
<p>Narrative accounts of 10 key team members of the institution’s preparedness and response committees were solicited by the primary and coprimary investigators (SR and MAM). In all, 9 committee members (90%), including 3 administrators and 6 individuals with clinical and administrative roles, provided autoethnographic narratives. Because all participants were coauthors, the research ethics submission was waived by the institutional research ethics board.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0009922812474890">6</xref></sup></p>
<p>Data on patient visits, acuity levels, admissions, number of pH1N1-positive cases, and mortality rate of pH1N1 patients for the period from October 26, 2009, to December 1, 2009, in which the second wave of pH1N1 occurred across the Province of Ontario, were collected and compared with data from the previous year to examine the impact of pH1N1 on hospital functioning and patient outcomes.</p>
<p>The written narratives and transcribed verbal narratives were synthesized by 2 investigators (SR and MAM) into a master narrative reconstructing events leading into the second wave of pH1N1 and the institutional response to this health crisis. The drafts were read and approved by all investigators as a representative account of how the epidemic was experienced.</p>

<title>Results and Discussion</title>
<sec id="section4-0009922812474890">
<title>Setting</title>
<p>The Hospital for Sick Children, with a total capacity of 343 inpatient beds, including 36 neonatal and 38 pediatric intensive care beds, serves the greater Toronto area with a population of 5.6 million and is the regional trauma and tertiary-care referral center. The emergency department is staffed by pediatric emergency physicians and pediatric emergency nurses and has more than 50 000 emergency patient visits annually. The emergency department has a 2-tier triage system and using the validated 5-level Paediatric Canadian Triage Acuity Score (P-CTAS) indicators, registered nurses triage patients as CTAS levels 1 to 5 (1, resuscitation; 2, emergent; 3, urgent; 4, less urgent; 5, nonurgent).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0009922812474890">7</xref></sup> The first rapid triage uses the pediatric assessment triangle (color, appearance, and work of breathing) to identify acutely ill patients who need to be taken to treatment areas immediately. The CTAS level 4 and 5 patients are usually sent to the urgent care area within the emergency department, and the others are treated in the main ED.</p>
<p>The first wave of the pH1N1 reached us in late April, 2009, leading to 61 admissions and no deaths, showing no significant difference to the patients with seasonal influenza in the previous 5 years.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0009922812474890">8</xref></sup> When the second wave of pH1N1 was declared by WHO on June 11, 2009, 13 members of the original Pandemic Planning Committee were assembled as the influenza management team (IMT) and started communication with Public Health Ontario (PHO) to discuss institutional response to the anticipated second and third waves of pH1N1. Three physicians in the IMT were recruited to provide expertise on identifying and managing infectious diseases. The laboratory prepared for additional testing, and infection control measures such as N95 mask fitting, obtaining additional supplies of personal protective equipment, and plans for communication were initiated.</p>
<p>PHO determined that 4 to 6 flu clinics would be set up across the city of Toronto to handle patients with influenza-like illness (ILI). PHO and members of the Toronto Academic Health Science Network decided to open a family influenza (flu) assessment clinic close to the children’s hospital in a nearby hospital that had an urgent care unit. This site was to be opened at the call of the PHO because they were to provide the supplies to the clinic to be operational 7 days a week (07.00-22.00 hours).</p>
<p>It was planned that volunteer nurses and nurse practitioners would run the clinic with physician coverage from both family physicians from the ambulatory care hospital and pediatricians from our hospital. It was also generally expected both by PHO and IMT that there would be no added cost or revenue for the hospital because both nurses and physicians were salaried by the hospital and would cover the flu clinics as part of their regular duties. Providing privileges to work in the other hospital and liability coverage to our staff proved to be a highly bureaucratic process. None of the physicians from our institution had obtained privileges or liability coverage to work in the ambulatory hospital by the time the second wave broke nor was planning for this flu clinic sufficiently advanced to allow it to be fully operational in a short period of time.</p>

<title>The Second Wave of pH1N1</title>
<p>The second wave of pH1N1 reached Toronto in October 2009; by the end of the second week, there were several cases of ILI presenting in Toronto and elsewhere in Canada and daily volumes of patients in the ED increased (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0009922812474890">Figure 1</xref> for isolation data). Initially, patient flow was managed by extending scheduled shift hours and calling in the backup physician on call.</p>

<p>The sudden death of a previously healthy teenager after being unwell with influenza-like symptoms and the almost immediate public media reports quickly focused attention on the potential severity of pH1N1 disease. The following day, October 27, 2009, the news of his death was widely reported on the Internet and in the local and national media, and unprecedented numbers of patients started presenting to the ED. This public reaction reinforces the power of stories and the impact of mass media on public reaction.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0009922812474890">9</xref></sup> The data show an immediate doubling of numbers of children attending the ED (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0009922812474890">Figure 2</xref>). The administrator on call was informed, and physicians from the ED fan-out list (full-time staff physicians) were called in to manage this surge; 4 additional physicians came in to work that night.</p>

<p>The Director of IMT liaised with the Chief of Paediatrics to coordinate physician deployment. This led to the establishment of a response team, which included the Clinical Director of the Division of Paediatric Emergency Medicine and the Heads of the Divisions of Pediatric Medicine, Infectious Diseases and Respiratory Medicine, chaired by the Associate Chief of Clinical Affairs of the Department of Paediatrics. The response team implemented planning decisions using the existing chain of command and became an incident management tactical team.</p>
<p>The infectious disease specialist on the IMT and his team synthesized and updated local protocols to match the changing national and international guidelines that were being disseminated almost on a daily basis. The critical frontline group leaders identified by the Chief of Paediatrics (eg, emergency medicine, pediatric medicine, infectious diseases, respiratory medicine, trainees, child health services management, infection control, central supplies, protection services, and housekeeping services) were asked to attend daily briefings/discussions to bring their perspectives to the table. It was a forum to bring physician and management leaders together on a daily basis to (<italic>a</italic>) discuss/plan next steps, (<italic>b</italic>) try to deal with new developments as they emerged, (<italic>c</italic>) and most important, to improve communication between the major frontline workers, particularly emergency physicians who were reluctant to follow IMT guidelines on pH1N1 patient management and kept e-mailing the infectious disease specialist on the IMT for endorsement of the IMT guidelines.</p>
<p>Key operational roles such as the clinical program director-on-call, patient care liaison role, and physician and surgeon administrator roles were added to the IMT group. The day-to-day decision-making processes focused to preserve patient care activities across the institution, avoiding the cancellation of surgery and ambulatory visits.</p>

<sec id="section6-0009922812474890">
<title>The Impact of the Second Wave on the Emergency Department</title>
<p>Since May 2008, renovations in the ED were in progress, and it was challenging to meet the daily demands for emergency care because the patient volumes kept increasing; delays in transfer of admitted patient to wards was a major access block in ED. When pH1N1 peaked, the transfer of admitted children to wards was expedited because it was a crisis situation, and everybody was willing to do something out of the ordinary. So the doctors discharged patients early, families were receptive to taking care of their children at home, ward nurses took care of more patients, and people worked together to clear patients from the ED.</p>
<p>As early as October 10, 2009, there were intermittent days with higher-than-usual patient volumes—an early warning signal, in retrospect. From October 20, 2009, an extra physician staff to each day and additional shifts for our fellows were added. The pediatrician-in-chief asked the ED to increase staffing without concern for the costs incurred, and the following organizational changes took place:</p>
<list id="list1-0009922812474890" list-type="order"><list-item><p>the ED Urgent Care Centre was opened for at least 12 hours daily from the previous 8 hours on week days and 12 hours on weekends initially and then increased to 18 to 20 hours as ED volumes increased;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>hours of staff physician coverage increased from the usual 60 to 66 hours/24 hours to more than 100 to 110 hours on most days to increase the number of staff physicians working in the ED at a given time;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>pediatric emergency medicine residents and fellows doing rotations outside the ED were repatriated;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>non-ED divisions were granted temporary privileges to work in the ED and asked to provide up to 8 hours of standby/on call backup from 8 <sc>pm</sc> to 4 <sc>am</sc> in rotation; individuals were called in on about 8 to 10 nights; and</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>multiple daily visits were paid to the ED by the pediatric executive (chief, associate chief of paediatrics) to ensure good staffing and morale.</p></list-item></list>
<p>The special hours were in effect until the influx of patients began to wind down in the third week of November 2009. Serious consideration was given to the idea of using chemoprophylaxis for frontline ED staff, because the vaccine was not available in the initial days of the second wave, and considering the 2 weeks following vaccination before “vaccine take.” In the end, this was not routinely done.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-0009922812474890">
<title>Communication</title>
<p>Comprehensive information on influenza was posted for both our staff and parents on our hospital Intranet and the publicly available Internet site, respectively, and updated on a daily basis. We also had a recorded message on our staff information and parent information telephone lines and posted signs throughout the hospital.</p>
<p>The staff feedback was that communication had to be regular and consistent. Updates were posted on the hospital’s internal news site by 12 noon each day, and an e-mail update was sent to all physicians at the hospital each day. But emergency physicians were not checking the hospital Web site for management protocols while working and were at times reluctant to follow changes to protocol from the hospital Web site if someone they identified as an authority figure in their chain of command did not directly communicate these changes to them. If there were specific physician-related issues, the associate-chief of paediatrics sent out the communication to ensure that there would be no confusion as to whether or not the changes requested were mandatory.</p>
<p>In the end, the communication strategy was streamlined, with individuals identified as responsible for internal communication, developing information for parents and families, and for communicating with the media. There was also an intradivisional point person for the emergency department, so that the infectious disease specialist did not receive multiple e-mails asking the same question.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-0009922812474890">
<title>Infection Control</title>
<p>As recommended by the Ontario Ministry of Health and Health Canada, the institution advocated for and provided N95 masks for all staff. At the peak of the second wave of pH1N1, there were more than 250 patients with ILI per day as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0009922812474890">Figure 1</xref>. Physicians and nurses were expected to change into full personal protective equipment, with gowns, gloves, and N95 masks for each patient. This was time-consuming and difficult when patients were seen in the waiting room or in corridor beds. In practice, working for long periods with N95 masks was difficult (facial heat, irritation, and difficulties with communication), and compliance with N95 mask requirements was suboptimal. There were 2 articles widely circulated among emergency staff and used as evidence for using surgical masks.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0009922812474890">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0009922812474890">11</xref></sup> Staff compliance with vaccination was high: 5433 (more than 75%) staff and volunteers were vaccinated within a month.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-0009922812474890">
<title>Microbiology Laboratory</title>
<p>PCR (polymerase chain reaction) testing was instituted by the end of April 2009, within a week of the identification of the new strain of the virus with the help of the National Microbiology Laboratory in Winnipeg. Turnaround time for in-house testing was 1 day in most cases. When the second wave started, the regional Central Public Health Laboratory was so inundated with specimens that their turnaround time was around 2 weeks for most specimens, and they gave priority to ICU patients in their testing algorithms. During the second wave, from October 1 to December 1, we had performed 1462 PCR tests for swine flu, of which 357 (24%) were positive.</p>
<p>Because there was no disruption of usual hospital services during the pandemic, significant overtime was incurred, and the usual 6 days a week testing schedule was extended to 7 days per week, resulting in difficulties for staff to take their days off. Our 2 research and development technologists both participated by working long hours to rapidly develop the new tests and by performing testing themselves where necessary.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-0009922812474890">
<title>Physician Deployment</title>
<p>Many physicians across the hospital were brought together to support the pH1N1 effort. The scheduling needs were reassessed daily, so that extra staff would not be brought in needlessly. A package consisting of an ILI management tool and oseltamivir phosphate (Tamiflu) dose guide was distributed to physicians. Preprinted information sheets and discharge instructions were made available. Over the course of the crisis, a number of ED physicians—a few staff and some trainees—became ill with ILI and had to remain home demanding a fluidity of scheduling; factors that have to be considered during pandemics is physicians’ duties and rights.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0009922812474890">12</xref></sup></p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-0009922812474890">
<title>Nursing</title>
<p>There was discussion at the IMT to reduce nonclinical nursing activities (education days, project work, and so on) for redeployment of nursing staff to the proposed family flu centre at the other hospital. Because there was no reserve pool of emergency-trained nurses or float nurses to be deployed to work in the ED, nurses were seconded from inpatient wards to assist in the ED. Most of the deployed ward nurses were not trained in emergency care and did not know the system, the processes, or the environment; as such, their utility was limited.</p>
<p>Surge capacity is critical in disaster management, and closure of nonemergency health services to control disease spread was a common practice during the SARS outbreak.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0009922812474890">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0009922812474890">14</xref></sup> Ramping down clinical activity by 25% to get additional nursing staff for deployment was not entertained because this would have increased the number of patients presenting to the ED. Thus, as clinics closed, chronically ill children with complex medical needs would also begin visiting the ED, adding extra work for ED staff and exposing these vulnerable patients to other children with H1N1 infection. So it was decided not to disrupt subspecialty clinic operations.</p>

<p>The key points of our results listed on <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0009922812474890">Table 2</xref> show that there is often a schism between preparation and action.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0009922812474890">15</xref></sup> Any institution undergoing pandemic planning should conduct an environmental scan to identify resources in their institution. As highlighted in an article about Hurricanes Katrina and Rita, “The local response to any disaster is more a function of management of people, ideas, supplies, and strategies, and less a matter of practiced drills for chemical, biologic, radiologic, and blast conditions.”<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0009922812474890">16</xref></sup></p>

<tr>
<td>1. <italic>Off-site clinics</italic>. Administrative details regarding privileges and liability coverage should be taken into consideration during pandemic planning and well in advance of any anticipated event. The planned clinic never came to be. Had this clinic actually got up and running, it might have served a large number of patients and provided a very useful service, possibly even relieving some of the pressure on nearby EDs. Physicians’ legal duty of care and the legal rights to refuse to work during a pandemic also have to be considered.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0009922812474890">11</xref></sup></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>2. <italic>Continuing nonurgent outpatient care</italic>. Advanced planning is necessary because patient care may be compromised if specialty nonurgent care clinics are closed during infectious disease outbreaks, as shown during the SARS outbreak.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0009922812474890">10</xref></sup> Specialty clinics may have to be adjusted in order to manage their own patients who develop ILIs but have no emergency complication</td>

<tr>
<td>3. <italic>Surge capacity</italic>. “The ability to obtain adequate staff, supplies and equipment, structures and systems to provide sufficient care to meet immediate needs of an influx of patients following a large-scale incident or disaster.”<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0009922812474890">14</xref></sup></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td> (<italic>a</italic>). Physician deployment: In retrospect, we needed physician leaders in the direct line of command for timely physician deployment (associate chiefs, clinical directors, or his/her designates) as members of the IMT to ensure physician staffing plans are in place. Identifying skill sets for all physicians and creating fan-out lists not only for individual divisions but also for the institution is important.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td> (<italic>b</italic>). Nursing deployment: Many people believed that sending nurses from the clinics and inpatient wards to the ED would address the need for additional ED nurses. Our experience showed that clinic nurses are more useful in clinics and that keeping the clinics open kept vulnerable patients out of the ED for nonemergency medical issues. In retrospect, creating a pool of float nurses who have experience working in the ED during normal times, so that we can draw from this pool in an emergency would have been a better strategy. This is currently happening in our hospital.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td> (<italic>c</italic>). Microbiology laboratory services have to be self-reliant within the hospital and to be able to identify new infectious agents. Surge capacity for staff, supplies, and equipment has to be improved, so that the added demands for increased testing are met while ongoing research to identify new testing methods and regular laboratory services are continued.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td> (<italic>d</italic>). Mobilization of security and other health care workers such as occupational health nurses, unit clerks and registration clerks, and patient service aids was achieved with minimal disruption of services because of earlier preparedness and the nature of a large institution. However, these should be taken into account when planning for pandemic management.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td> (<italic>e</italic>). Supplies from central stores, personal protective equipment, and medications were adequate to cover the crisis period.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>4. <italic>Communication</italic>. Multiple modes of communication should be instituted to effectively communicate information to frontline workers. A point access person who has the credibility and authority is necessary to ensure that instructions are perceived as valid and are followed by physicians. It is important that recipients of communication materials know where to find information and when such information will be available</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>5. <italic>Expenses</italic>. Revenue-neutral strategies are unlikely to be sustainable during disasters, and leaders with authority to mobilize funding must be accessible and involved in the management of any incident</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>6. <italic>Closure</italic>. The additional resources were withdrawn and institutional functioning returned to that of the pre-pH1N1 period based on clinical demands from ED patient visits</td>

<p>Successful strategies to increase surge capacity, such as increasing physician and nursing coverage in the ED, adopting a 5-level triage system, providing extra space for emergency patients, creation of a short-stay unit, and using physicians not certified in pediatric emergency care and ward nurses to work in the ED have been described in managing the influenza pandemic.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0009922812474890">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0009922812474890">18</xref></sup> Our article not only describes the measures that were successful but also those that had to be abandoned or modified to manage the surge during the pandemic.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>The incident management team that manages pandemics and other disasters has to be dynamic, and inviting leaders from frontline workers to be part of it uses existing chains of commands and facilitates bidirectional communication with the frontline worker. The power of public media during pandemics should not be underestimated. Feedback from staff and modifications to address different groups of people will improve communication strategies.</p>
