<abstract>
<p>The “More doctors smoke camels” advertising campaign ran from 1946 until 1954. The campaign featured a series of advertisements centered around and celebrating the physician in American life. Neatly bookending the demise of the physician was the appearance, in 1955, of the Marlboro Man. The dominant figure in the Marlboro Man campaign was the cowboy. This shift away from the physician to the cowboy will be situated in the context of 1950s fears about smoking and health. The similarities and differences in the masculine virtues of the physician and the cowboy will be analyzed in terms of the relationship between men and health in mid-century America.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>In the post–World War II period, from 1946 until 1964, the meaning of the cigarette in American life underwent a significant transformation. In 1946, at the beginning of this period, the epidemiological analysis of the statistical relationship between smoking and lung cancer was still a number of years away. The social acceptability of cigarette smoking was reaching an historical high point and the rates of consumption were increasing exponentially. The year 1964, at the end of this period, was marked by the release of the surgeon general’s Advisory Committee report on <italic>Smoking and Health</italic>, which unequivocally held cigarette smoking responsible for a seventy percent greater mortality rate among smokers than nonsmokers(US Department of Health 1964). The report was subsequentlyfollowed by health warnings on cigarette packaging.</p>
<p>Prior to this change in meaning, the cigarette was one of America’s most important commodities during the mid-twentieth century. Its re-signification had widespread ramifications. The transformation of the relationship between the cigarette and health had obvious implications for the tobacco industry. It also had implications for the agricultural industry and all those relying on cigarette advertising revenue.</p>
<p>Yet, as a commodity, the cigarette was not only or merely a commercial entity. As Anne Cronin, following Kopytoff (1986), Appadurai (1986), and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1097184X12461917">Marx (1990)</xref>, argues, commodities are magical, in the sense that they are invested with meanings, values, and feelings that extend beyond their materiality. They promise the metamorphosis or transformation of mood, lifestyle, and/or self-identity (Cronin 2002).</p>
<p>This article examines the implications of the transformation in the meaning of the cigarette in the postwar period in terms of the gendered significance of the cigarette in American life. More specifically, this article argues that the shift in the relationship between the cigarette and health was accompanied by a shift in the relationship between masculinity and health. The article examines this shift in the relationship between masculinity and health through a comparative analysis of two cigarette advertising campaigns that took place at either end of the period under consideration. The first of these campaigns, RJ Reynolds’ “More doctors smoke camels,” was introduced in 1946, just after the end of World War II, and ran until 1954. The second advertising campaign, Philip Morris’s Marlboro Man, was introduced in 1955 and emerged in its canonical cowboy garb in 1962, just prior to the release of the surgeon general’s 1964 report.</p>
<p>The article argues that the “More doctors smoke camels” campaign employed a particular representation of the relationship between men (or masculinity) and health. More specifically, the campaign represented men as the arbiters of health by virtue of a relationship between masculinity and a technoscientific–medical rationality. Cigarette smoking, these advertisements seemed to suggest, would endow men with this rationality (or at least enable them to look like they were so endowed).</p>
<p>The Marlboro Man campaign, in contrast, represented a very different relationship between men, masculinity, and health. Appearing just as the wave of controversy about the relationship between smoking and health started to crest, the Marlboro Man celebrated virtues of individualism, autonomy, and self-sufficiency. These virtues functioned very effectively as a critique of the institutional authority of health and medicine and its calls for the regulation of tobacco consumption. These virtues provided cigarette consumers with a justification for continued smoking and also provided the cigarette industry with a powerful response to the calls for regulation by pubic health.</p>
<p>It should be noted at the outset that these two representations of masculinity, the physician and the cowboy, as depicted in cigarette advertising, are only partial. They are, obviously, emanating from only one source, and one very biased source at that, the tobacco industry. Nevertheless, it is the argument of this article that the shift in the relationship between health and masculinity discussed herein is valuable in terms of what it can tell us about the gendered history of cigarette consumption. This article also suggests that the shift in the relationship between health and masculinity, as represented in these two tobacco advertising campaigns, can be read as a cultural text, illuminating cultural changes that are greater than the sum of the parts.</p>

<title>More Doctors Smoke</title>
<p>The “More doctors smoke camels” advertising campaign ran from 1946 until 1954 (Gardner and Brandt 2006). The campaign comprised a series of advertisements all of which suggested that “more doctors smoke camel’s than any other cigarettes.” The campaign appeared across a broad range of both local and national media. In mid-1946 “I’m going to grow to a hundred years old,” for example appeared on the back cover in major publications such as <italic>Time</italic>, <italic>Look</italic>, <italic>Newsweek</italic>, <italic>Colliers</italic>, and <italic>United States News</italic>. The advertisement also appeared on the back cover of a range of more targeted publications. These included <italic>Ladies Home Journal</italic>, <italic>Field and Stream</italic>, <italic>Capper’s Farmer</italic>, <italic>Country Gentleman</italic>, <italic>Fawcett’s Women’s Group</italic>, <italic>Good Housekeeping</italic>, and<italic> Our Navy</italic>.The “more doctors smoke camels” campaign was significant by virtue of its emphasis on the character and qualities of the doctor and the important role he played in mid-twentieth century American masculine culture.</p>
<p>The principle version of the “more doctors smoke camels” campaign (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1097184X12461917">Figure 1</xref>), featured the reassuring face of a white doctor in the foreground. Larger than life and in full color, his poised cigarette concurrent with his brill-creamed hair, stethoscope, and white coat, the doctor appeared against a black and white collage of work scenes from across America, diverse, but also familiar. The scenes all represent men and women working together, but in each one the man is shown in a position of authority. The doctor’s presence is reassuring, a bedrock of certainty, keeping a careful watch over a hive of activity (Reynolds 1946a).</p>

</fig>
<p>The reassuring quality of the doctor’s presence was reiterated in other versions of the campaign via an emphasis on fatherly-like, paternalistic virtues. Images employed in the campaign showed the doctor caring for children (Reynolds 1946b), caring for the elderly (Reynolds 1946c), giving birth, (Reynolds 1946d), getting out of bed in the middle of the night (Reynolds 1946e), providing “wise counsel” and “loyal and understanding friendship,” and generally being “part of the family” (Reynolds 1946f).</p>
<p>Yet, as paternalistic as the relationship between the doctor and his patients might be, it was motivated less by a sense of intimacy than it was by a sense of what Oreskes describes as “anideology of scientific heroism” (1996). Here the role of the doctor was to conquer the “cause of human health and happiness” (Reynolds 1946g). The emphasis on heroism was captured by the language employed in the advertisements, which evoked both passion and physicality. Examples of heroic virtues included a sense of selflessness (he isn’t interested in making speeches and taking bows; Reynolds 1946b), determination (asking no quarter; Reynolds 1946b), and devotion (toiling ceaselessly) with “selfless . . . devotion” (Reynolds 1946b, 1946e).</p>
<p>Heroic virtues such as selflessness, determination, and devotion represented in the “more doctors smoke” advertisements were represented as a function of another commitment, a higher calling than the patient himself or herself, namely, to science. The technical and scientific qualities of the physician were highlighted in an advertisement called “The Doctors behind the Doctor.” Featuring an image dominated by a man in a laboratory conducting an experiment, the doctor was positioned as a researcher, akin to the “biochemists and bacteriologists . . . pathologists and physiologists . . .” The technical expertise of the doctor was signified by the use of scientific language to describe what was known in colloquial terms as “the valuable aids in the little black bag”; “magical penicillin . . . the amazing ‘sulfas’ . . . and now the new streptomycin” (Reynolds 1946g). The notion of doctor as scientist was reinforced by an emphasis on his commitment to the “years of training and experience” required to become a doctor in the first instance (Reynolds 1946f) as well as the constant vigilance necessary to keep this training up to date. As “Night school for the Doctor” puts it, “His years of study are never finished . . . for the practice of medicine is one of constant change . . . and every change is for the better . . . for you!” (Reynolds 1946h).</p>
<p>The emphasis on the heroic nature of the doctor was also emphasized by his willingness to sacrifice the emotional attachments of normal life and risk bodily discomfort (if not harm) for the sake of his quest. “I’ll be right over,” for example, featured the image of a doctor taking a late-night call, in his bed, from a patient. His “little black bag” sits prominently on his bedside table, ready for the emergency, along with his watch, glasses pad and pencil, and telephone. He is, the caption tells us, “‘on duty’ . . . guarding health . . . protecting and prolonging life . . . 24 hours a day.” “When there’s a job to do . . . he does it.” All he needs are “a few winks of sleep, a few puffs of a cigarette . . . and he’s back . . . again.” (Reynolds 1946i). A similar story was reiterated in “Now Daddy’s got to go to another ‘birthday party,’ Son . . . .” Featuring an image of a four-year-old boy looking up at his father who has been called away from his birthday party to attend a birth, the emphasis is on the capacity of the doctor to sacrifice his role in the intimate life of the family. “Whether bringing life or guarding it, the doctor’s personal life fades into the background when duty calls” (Reynolds 1946j).</p>
<p>It was this culture of heroism, alongside a commitment to science and objectivity, which formed the basis of the social and cultural significance of the physician in mid-twentieth century America. As John Burnham writes “During the first half of the twentieth century American physicians enjoyed social esteem and prestige along with an admiration for their work that was unprecedented in any age” (Burnham 1982). Nancy Tomes, following Paul Starr, describes this sense of prestige in terms of a doctor’s “exceptionalism” (Tomes 2001; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-1097184X12461917">Starr 1982</xref>). This referred to the doctor’s “unique position within the world of modern goods and services” (Tomes 2001).</p>
<p>Yet the doctor was not only an exemplary hero, he was a hero to “mankind” in the literal sense of the word. He was an exemplar of masculinity. The doctor, in other words, was a fundamentally masculine persona, an iconic or hegemonic representation of masculine virtue in mid-century America. The emphasis on the doctor as both male <italic>and masculine </italic>was iterated throughout the “more doctor’s smoke” series. “Class of ‘46, class of ’06,” featuring three male physicians watching a “demonstration of a new method of using penicillin,” was an intimate image of transgenerational homosocial bonding (Reynolds 1946k). “Young man in white” emphasized the masculinity of the doctor in terms of a distinction with the femininity of the nurse. Here, a young, raw-looking intern is invested with an aura of masculinity, despite his inexperience, in terms of his juxtaposition with three nurses in close proximity, all of whom are women (Reynolds 1946l). “It’s all up to <italic>you</italic> son!” represented the mantle of the doctor being passed down from father to son (Reynolds 1946m).</p>
<p>The“more doctors smoke camels” series did feature one image of a woman as a doctor. “Lady with a lamp” was published in magazines such as <italic>Ladies Home Journal</italic>. While this advertisement did suggest that women <italic>could</italic> become doctors, it was also the fact that these women were “intrepid” exceptions to the rule (Reynolds 1946n). The role of the doctor was best served by a man, if not handed down from father to son (Reynolds 1946m).</p>
<p>With its emphasis on masculine heroism, the advertising model employed by the camel campaign was as much aspirational as it was informational. In addition to providing information and reassurance regarding the healthfulness of Camel cigarettes, these advertisements offered a model to which smokers might aspire via their consumption of Camel cigarettes. Even if you did not have the time for the seven years of study followed by a two-year internship required to become a doctor (Reynolds 1946l), the advertisements seemed to suggest that you might still acquire the virtues of the doctor by smoking Camel cigarettes. Cigarettes and health are shown to coexist, even if they are not coterminous. At the same time, the advertisements emphasize a particular relationship between masculinity and health. Here, health is understood as the technorational domain of men. Men are the arbiters of health.</p>
<p>The gendered significance of the doctor in mid-century America coincided with the social and cultural and influence of the scientific/medical expert/professional more generally and the associated medicalization aspects of life such as sexuality, reproduction, and “happiness,” which would increasingly come under the purview of medicine and associated behavioral sciences during the mid-twentieth century. As Susan Speaker argues, because the medical industry was invested with the power to define illness and control the diagnostic and treatment process, patients became increasingly dependent on “the ‘experts,’ their medicines, and their views of ‘reality.’” This emphasis on the expert worked, in turn, to reinforce existing gendered hierarchies (Speaker 1997; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1097184X12461917">Herman 1995</xref>)</p>
<p>Nikolas Rose and Peter Miller highlight the importance of the way the growing authority of the expert was authorized by a centralized, government-sanctioned licensing system. Rose and Miller situate this phenomenon in terms of postwar response to challenges to the welfare state through which new forms of governing emerged.</p>
<p>Government [came to be] intrinsically linked to the activities of expertise, whose role is not one of weaving an all-pervasive web of “social control,” but of enacting assorted attempts at the calculated administration of diverse aspects of conduct through countless, often competing, local tactics of education, persuasion, inducement, management, incitement, motivation and encouragement (Rose and Miller 1992)</p>
<p>The emphasis on the (male) health expert was also facilitated by the increasingly technocratic nature of medicine. This was, in part, a function of the application of new medicines (“magical penicillin . . . the amazing ‘sulfas’ . . . and now the new streptomycin”; Reynolds 1946g). It was also the result, as historians have argued, of the increasing control of medicine over knowledge about drugs in the wake of 1938 Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulations which created a class of drugs that could not be legally sold without a prescription. The fortification of prescription had a marked effect on the authority accorded medicine. Doctors accrued the symbolic capital that was afforded by the curative power of increasingly effective medicines. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1097184X12461917">Kane Race (2009</xref>) writes “It was doctors as much as drugs that were authorized in the wake of powerful new treatments.” Their expertise was also vouchsafed, furthermore, by the government licensing of medical practitioners (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-1097184X12461917">Temin 1980</xref>).</p>
<p>Another fascinating aspect of the “More Doctors Smoke” campaign was the extent to which it targeted doctors as well as the general public. In May 1946, for example, the “The Light That Never Fails” appeared in sixty-nine different medical journals in America. In a strangely Baudrillard-esque moment, it seemed as if these cigarette advertisements really were working to make sure that reality followed the advertisement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1097184X12461917">Baudrillard 2006</xref>).</p>

<title>The 1950s “Health Scare” and Cigarette Advertising</title>
<p>In the early 1950s, when the “More doctors smoke” campaign was in full swing, “a broad experimental and clinical approach” to the relationship between smoking and health began to emerge (U.S. Department of Health, Education, and Welfare 1964, p. v). In 1950, for example, Wynder and Graham published their famous study of the carcinogenic affect of cigarette tars applied to mouse skin (Wynder and Graham 1950). This clinical approach to the smoking and health question was supplemented by epidemiological studies. Alton Ochsner, for example, analyzed trends in bronchogenic cancer (Ochsner 1952), and the U.S. Public Health Service published the findings of two of its own studies in 1953 and 1954. A national survey of tobacco-smoking habits in the United States conducted by the Bureau of the Census was published in 1956 (U.S. Congress 85th House Committee 1957). On July 12, 1957, Surgeon General Leroy E. Burney issued a statement declaring, “The Public Health service feels the weight of the evidence is increasingly pointing in one direction: that excessive smoking is one of the causative factors in lung cancer” (U.S. Department of Health, Education, and Welfare 1964).</p>
<p>In terms of the generation of social, cultural, and political change, the reporting of the scientific research in the popular media was perhaps as important as the research itself. The most longstanding media campaign focusing on the tobacco and health question came from the <italic>Readers Digest</italic>. Roger William Riis’s “How Harmful are Cigarettes,” in January 1950, provided an annotated bibliography of recent developments in scientific research (Riis 1950). Roy Norr’s “Cancer by the Cartload,” in December 1952, provide a similar survey, with a particular focus on the work of Alton Oschner and Wynder and Graham (Norr 1952). Clarence William Leib’s “Can the Poisons in Cigarettes be avoided?” concluded, in a word, “no” (Leib 1953). In November 1953, <italic>Time</italic> suggested that the relationship between smoking and cancer was “beyond any doubt” (Beyond Any Doubt 1953). News of the <italic>Time</italic> article carried across into radio. Pearson, on New York and New Jersey radio station WNVJ described the article as a “great public service.” Walter Winchell, on WABC (New York) described it as “a frightening article for cigarette smokers” (Hill and Knowlton 1953). <italic>Life </italic>made similar claims the following month (Smoke Gets in the News 1953).  It was also at this time (1953) that reports started to speak of the “cancer scare” (Tobacco Trade Maps War On Cancer Scare 1953), the “cigarette scare” (Cigarette Scare 1953), and the “tobacco scare” (Tobacco Scare 1954).</p>
<p>The smoking and health controversy presented the tobacco industry with an unprecedented challenge. In 1953, the industry experienced the first decline in cigarette consumption in twenty years. In 1954, consumption declined by a further ten percent (Cigarettes: Notes on the Industry 1956). A journalist summed up the challenges succinctly, “Plainly the tobacco people are facing a crisis more dramatic in its implications than any that has confronted any business in modern times” (No White-Wash Here 1954).</p>
<p>The challenge to the tobacco industry presented by the smoking and health controversy was exaggerated not because the relationship between smoking and health was new. Far from it. The challenge posed by the controversy was exaggerated by the fact that the industry had for decades carefully, self-consciously, and self-interestedly cultivated an <italic>intimate</italic> relationship between smoking and health as a way of <italic>promoting</italic> cigarettes. This relationship between smoking and health was nowhere clearer than in the “more doctors smoke” campaign.  Since the early decades of the twentieth century, cigarettes traded on the centrality of health in American life.</p>
<p>To address this new situation the cigarette sought to reconstruct itself vis à vis its relationship to health. Rather than promoting the centrality of health in American life and culture, the cigarette now sought to craft an oppositional relationship with health and its institutions. The ideological device it would employ to articulate this opposition was an emphasis on the sovereign quality of the individual consuming subject in the face of the institutional authority of health and medicine.</p>
<p>A coherent ideological and political response by the tobacco industry to the cultural and political authority of health and medicine emerged over a number of years and was associated with a range of tactics. One of the earliest aspects of the tobacco industry’s response to the smoking and health controversy was to form a centralized industry body, in December 1953, called the Tobacco Research Industry Research Committee (TIRC), which agreed to limit any health claims in advertising. “No one is going to [gain] a competitive advantage” a statement by the public relations firm Hill &amp; Knowlton employed to guide the TIRC stated, “by inferring that <italic>its</italic> product is less risky than others” (Dakin and Hill &amp; Knowlton 1953), RJ Reynold’s “More doctors smoke camels” campaign was discontinued shortly thereafter (in 1954).</p>
<p>A second aspect of the tobacco industry’s response to the smoking and health controversy was to produce a barrage of material, emanating from both internal research and university-based research sponsored by tobacco industry money (channeled via the TIRC), which challenged the authority of the research testifying to the relationship between smoking and cancer and, by inference, the authority of health and medical research more generally. Allan Brandt defies this emphasis on contesting the evidence regarding the relationship between smoking and cancer as  “constructing controversy” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1097184X12461917">Brandt 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>The attempt to challenge the authority of health and medical research and to “construct controversy” was complimented by an insistence that it was the tobacco industry itself, and <italic>not</italic> the institutions of health or medicine, which was best positioned to evaluate the relationship between smoking and health. This emphasis on the role and responsibility of the tobacco industry was emphasized in “A Frank Statement to Cigarette Smokers” issued by the Committee in January 1954 in the form of a full-page advertisement in 448 American newspapers nationwide (Brown and Rubin 2005). <italic>“The “Frank Statement” sought to reassure consumers by stating that “we”, meaning the tobacco industry, “believe the people are entitled to know where we stand on this matter [of smoking and health] and</italic> what we intend to do about it”. The Statement advertised a “pledging of [additional] aid and assistance to the research effort into all phases of tobacco use and health” (Tobacco Industry Research Committee 1954).</p>

<title>Marlboro Introduces the Cowboy</title>
<p>In 1955, the year after Phillip Morris discontinued the “More Doctor’s Smoke” campaign, RJ Reynolds launched a campaign to rebrand their Marlboro cigarettes. This campaign would give rise to an iconic representation of the cultural ideal of individualism and an insistence on the sacrosanct quality of the individual capacity to choose, instead of being dictated to (Brandt 1990).The Marlboro Man’s qualities of independence and individualism formed the basis of an alternative relationship between cigarettes and health and, simultaneously, an alternative relationship between masculinity and health. Whereas the doctor represented man’s capacity to control health, the Marlboro man’s individualism found expression in an anti-institutionalism which objected on principle to the authority of health and medicine.</p>
<p>In 1955, Philip Morris had been producing Marlboro for over thirty years. The brand first appeared in 1924. It had come with an ivory tip or a red “beauty tip” and was generally considered to be “a fancy smoke for dudes and women” (Burnett 1955). The term dude,, as Bill Osgerby illustrates, referred to a dandified figure remarkable primarily on account of his absurd and effeminate flamboyance and implied homosexuality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1097184X12461917">Osgerby 2001</xref>). Throughout its early history Marlboro ads were directed toward women. A May 1936 advertisement published in <italic>Vogue </italic>magazine created an aura of glamor by featuring the lips of an immaculately mysterious woman. Delineated by a wisp of smoke from the Marlboro in her hand, the advertisement suggested the “ivory tips protect the lips” (Philip Morris 1936). By 1950, feminine ideals appeared to have changed, but Marlboro advertisements were still directed at women smokers. Employing a far less refined aesthetic, a Marlboro advertisement in <italic>The American Magazine</italic> from November of that year (1950), featured an oversized baby “saying,” in a cartoon-like script, “Gee Mommy, you sure enjoy your Marlboro.” The selling point of Marlboro, for the mother-as-consumer at the bottom of the picture, gazing up at her enormous child, was that “you never feel oversmoked . . . that’s the miracle of Marlboro” (Phillip Morris 1950).</p>
<p>In February 1955, however, Philip Morris relaunched the Marlboro cigarette with a new filter, a new, flip-top, crush-proof box, a new length (80 mm as opposed to the usual 70 mm regular size or the 85 mm king size) and a new, clean and simple, red and white, color scheme. The initial response to Marlboro was strong and demand overran initial production capacities. In its first year, Marlboro sold 6.6 billion units. It was one of the most dramatic gains of any brand for 1955 (Wootten1955). In 1956, Marlboro sold 14.3 billion cigarettes (Wootten 1956).  By 1957, Marlboro was Philip Morris’s best-selling cigarette, the fourth most popular filtered cigarette (behind L&amp;M, Kent and Winston) and the eighth most popular cigarette overall (Wootten 1957).</p>
<p>In a market awash with virtually identical products (filter-tipped cigarettes), Marlboro’s success was primarily the result of its innovative marketing campaign. Philip Morris had employed Leo Burnett Company Inc. of Chicago to market the new brand. Burnett was a seasoned advertising executive. Among other successes, Burnett was famous for transforming Campbell’s soup can into the iconic representation of American consumerism celebrated by Andy Warhol in 1962. Burnett also managed accounts for Pillsbury Mills, Kellogg, Proctor and Gamble, Mars Candy, Toni Company and Green Giant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1097184X12461917">Fox 1984</xref>).</p>
<p>In the first series of Marlboro advertisements Burnett developed a range of male figures, or types. They included a man in a tuxedo, a chess player, a man in a towel coming out of a shower, a man typing (a writer), a cinematographer, a skin diver, a cowboym and a sailor. All the ads carried the byline: “A lot of man . . . a lot of cigarette” and all the men carried a tattoo on their left hand (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1097184X12461917">Leo Burnett Agency 1955</xref>). The tattoo, according to Burnett, was supposed to invoke the figure of a self-made man with an aura of mystery, a “romantic past” (Burnett 1955). Burnett also proposed a strong program of sports sponsorship, and Marlboro was soon associated with television broadcasts of the National Football League and sponsored Paul Hornung, Green Bay Packers halfback, and 1961 National Football League Player of the Year.</p>
<p>These initial Marlboro advertisements resonated in the context of Cold War era anxieties about the virility of American masculinity(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1097184X12461917">Ehrenreich 1983</xref>).The sense of crisis was associated with changes in American culturesuch asthe rise of suburbia, the cultural significance of the nuclear family, and an associated emphasis on conformity (Courdileone 2000). There was a widespread concern that these changes had domesticated theAmerican male and led to a loss of individualism. Individualism was, moreover, a key component in the ideological war with communism (Gilbert 2005; Courdileone 2000).</p>
<p>The Marlboro Man, who expressed his individuality through consumption, offered American men an avenue for articulating an empowered masculine identity. In this respect, Marlboro can be situated alongside other cultural phenomena such as <italic>Playboy </italic>magazine, which started out on a shoestring budget in 1953 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1097184X12461917">Osgerby 2001</xref>). <italic>Playboy</italic> helped to cultivate as well as profit from a sense of masculine anxiety. Articles such as Philip Wylie’s “The Abdicating Male and How the Gray Flannel Mind Exploits Him through His Women,” published in the third edition of <italic>Playboy </italic>(1956) resonated amidst a broader anxiety about and fear of the institutionalization of American masculinity outlined in Sloan Wilson’s 1955 novel (<italic>The Man in the Gray Flannel Suit</italic>).  Intriguingly, as Ethan Thompson (2008) argues, the discourse of the gray flannel suit defined the problem of masculinity as “only” a problem of style and fashion. Thus, in <italic>Playboy </italic>as in Marlboro advertisements, consumption, style, leisure, and personal gratification were increasingly relieved of their feminine connotations and authorized as authentic sites for the expression of masculine independence and individualism.</p>
<p>By 1962, the figure of the cowboy had emerged as the ubiquitous symbol of Marlboro (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1097184X12461917">Figure 2</xref>) (Starr, 1984). The cowboy held an almost unique capacity to evoke a specific culture of masculinity which, in turn, was associated with a particular set of virtues. As Burnett described it, the cowboy offered “an almost universal symbol of admired masculinity . . . [which] appealed to both sexes”(Burnett 1955). The virtues of a cowboy, as described by Burnett, were his “masculine confidence,” his simplicity, his “virility without vulgarity,” and his “quality without snobbery.” Burnett also liked the idea of the virtues represented by a man who had worked his way up, a man who “used to work with his hands,” a self-made man (Burnett 1958). Historian Bruce Lohof described the virtues of the Marlboro Man as cowboy in similar terms:</p>

<title>Situating the Cowboy</title>
<p>Despite the long history of the myth of the cowboy, it spoke to mid-twentieth century American men in very specific and powerful ways. The editor of a trade journal, writing in 1960, for example, wondered about the “intrusion” of cowboys “into . . . advertising—as authorities on cigarettes, bourbon and automobiles” (Saddlesoap Please, 1960). In the 1950s, rodeos experienced an unprecedented boom (Kimmel 1996; Altherr 1996). The cowboy also dominated publishing houses. Over ten percent of all fictional works published in the 1950s were westerns (Kimmel 1996). In the new medium of television, eight of the top ten shows—a total of thirty prime time television shows in all—were “horse operas” (Kimmel 1996). Among these, <italic>Gunsmoke</italic>, which first appeared on CBS in 1955, was particularly prominent. In 1956, its second season on the air, the series entered the list of top ten programs on U.S. television and moved quickly to number one. It remained in that position until 1961 and in the top twenty until 1964 (The Museum of Broadcast Communications). It was in the movie industry, however, that the cultural and gendered significance of the cowboy in the 1950s was most evident. Richard Slotkin suggests that the beginning of the Cold War in 1948 inaugurated the “Golden Age of the western” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-1097184X12461917">Slotkin 1992</xref>). Stanley Corkin writes, “In U.S. film history, [the Cold War] marks an era when A-picture Westerns—large budget features—burgeoned as at no other time” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1097184X12461917">Corkin 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>In the context of the overwhelming presence of the cowboy in 1950s American culture, Burnett’s invocation, in the form of the Marlboro Man, is easy to understand. The image of the stoic, square-jawed cowboy that he used to create his cigarette commercials had a greater capacity to invoke an aura of masculinity in postwar America than at any other time since, perhaps, the 1890s. Thus, despite the apparent timelessness of his imagery, Burnett was a man of his times.</p>
<p>It is therefore important to understand why the cowboy carried such a capacity to represent masculinity in the 1950s and to understand why Burnett’s Marlboro Man was so successful. This requires an historical consideration of the cultural and political significance of his virtues, his “virility without vulgarity” as Burnett (1958) puts it, his “simple genuineness,” as Lohof (1969) puts it, and his “independence and individualism”as Nussbaum (1961) puts it.</p>
<p>Some writers sought to explain the lure of the cowboy in 1950s America in terms of an overwhelming sense of claustrophobia brought on by the inane boredom of consumer culture dominated by white goods and the suburban home (Cohen 2000). Martin Nussbaum, writing at the height of the cowboy craze, argued that the “adult western” evolved at “this precise time in our culture” as a kind of “catharsis” from the “depressing and wearisome . . . pressures, monotony . . . stifled routine . . . [and] conformity” of “modern lives.” For Nussbaum, this sense of depression was, unsurprisingly, gendered. “At a time when men are concerned with the loss of their masculinity,” he wrote, they can sublimate by identifying themselves with the western hero (Nussbaum 1961). Yet this emphasis on the fear of “stifled routine” was a description rather than an explanation of the emphasis on the cowboy.</p>
<p>To understand why the cowboy was such an important figure in America during the 1950s, and why, if we are to believe Cohen (2000), Nussbaum (1961), and many others writing about a “crises” of masculinity in American in the Cold War period, that was such a sense of claustrophobia and fear of “stifled routine,” requires the kind of analysis of Courdileone who frames 1950s gender politics in terms of “American political culture” (Cuordileone 2000; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1097184X12461917">Cuordileone 2005</xref>). The widespread (gendered) fear that a smothering, overpowering, suspiciously collectivist mass society had “smashed the once-autonomous male self . . . and doomed men to a slavish conformity” Courdileone argues, emerged in the context of comparisons between this “slavish conformity” and the “experience [of] men living under communist rule” (Cuordileone 2000).The fear of routine and the associated emphasis on individuality and autonomy, as represented by the cowboy, emerged, in other words, in the context of the political contingencies of the cold war and the widespread fear of the stifling quality of a centralized (communist) state apparatus. “The rise of the Western” Richard Slotkin(1992) writes, in an analysis similar to that of Courdileone, “mirrored the development of the Cold War and its sustaining ideological consensus.”</p>
<p>The notion of the ideological consensus Slotkin refers to is perhaps epitomized by Arthur Schlesinger’s classic, 1949, manifesto of cold war liberalism, <italic>The Vital Centre</italic>. Here Schlesinger argues that as a consequence of a process of “re-examination and self-criticism,” coupled with the “unconditional rejection of totalitarianism,” contemporary liberalism had experienced a shift to the right, toward the center of the political spectrum and toward a “reassertion of the ultimate integrity of the individual” and a belief in “free society” (Schlesinger 1988). Schlesinger’s emphasis on entrepreneurial individualism was reiterated in works such as Sloan Wilson’s <italic>The Man in the Gray Flannel Suit</italic> (1955), with its critique of suburbanization, and  William H. Whyte’s <italic>The Organization Man</italic>(1956), which attacked “organization men” softened by the “group ethos.” Written while Whyte was the editor of <italic>Fortune </italic>magazine, Gilbert (2005) describes <italic>The Organization Man </italic>as “one of the sharpest, most exhaustive critiques of the age.”</p>
<p>In terms of the history of the cowboy, the content of this “consensus” was best illustrated, as Slotkin describes it, by the film <italic>High Noon</italic> (1952). <italic>High Noon</italic> illustrates, he writes,</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>beneath the “left” perspective . . . <italic>and</italic> the “right” perspective . . . is a common ideological structure that devalues “democracy” as an instrument of progress and declares that the only effective instrument for constructive historical action is a gun in the hands of the right man. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-1097184X12461917">Slotkin 1992</xref>)</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thus, contrary to Burnett’s claim that the cowboy was a “universal” symbol of masculinity, it is also the case that the cowboy was peculiarly suited to the cultural and political landscape of the early Cold War. As sociologists such as Connell and Messerschmidt have argued, particular representations of gender emerge as desirable, dominant or hegemonic, at specific times and for specific reasons. They write, “Changes in the situations in which masculinities are formed . . . result in redefinitions of socially admired masculinity” (Connell and Messerschmidt 2005).</p>

<title>The Marlboro Man and Health</title>
<p>The Marlboro Man was also significant in the sense that it (he) reflected a broader shift in the politics of health in America in the mid-twentieth century. As Nancy Tomes argues, the rise of a movement advocating the rights of the health consumer to make informed choices about their care and to reclaim rights lost to them as a consequence of “medicine’s professionalization process” combined with a Cold War ideology which juxtaposed a pragmatic belief in the virility of the individual with the reputed sentimentality and impotence of the welfare state to “slowly [erode] the idea that any kind of expertise, including medical knowledge, was sacrosanct” (Tomes 2006).</p>
<p>In terms of its impact on the relationship between the individual and their health, this shift to the right in the ideology of medical care and responsibility had the capacity to instill two, divergent responses. On one hand, as Foucauldian scholars have argued, the shift away from centralized control toward individualized “choice” worked to promote an emphasis on prevention and prudence on the part of the responsible individual who, ideally, invested in self-health and therapeutic management strategies. O’Malley discussed this under the heading of “prudentialism” (O’Malley 1996; Diprose et al. 2008). This trend towards individualized responsibility had the capacity to promote a <italic>decrease </italic>in cigarette consumption, clearly, not the result the tobacco industry was seeking. Nikolas Rose’s argues that as the state is “freed” of responsibilities for securing individuals against the consequences of illness, it gives rise to a “will to health.” He writes</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>We have seen an intensification and generalization of health-promotion strategies, coupled with the rise of a private health insurance industry, enhancing the obligations that individuals and families have for monitoring and managing their own health. Every citizen must become an active partner in the drive for health, accepting their responsibility for securing their own well-being. (Rose 2001)</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>A second possible response to the challenge presented to medicine’s professional authority had the capacity, as advocates of the process argued, to create an emphasis on individual choice (as opposed to individual responsibility). This appealed to what Allen Brandt describes as “[the] traditional American libertarian ethic: ‘It’s my body and I'll do with it as I please’” (Brandt 1990). Given the destructive implications of cigarette consumption, the “decisions” made available to celebrated self-steering individuals by the tobacco industry’s critique of medicinal authority were terrifyingly limited. The argument was insouciant at best. Nevertheless, it appealed, as Allen Brandt writes, to a “powerful cultural ideal” (Brandt 1990).  The goal of this process would be to redefine smoking as the site or expression of a belief in an individual’s capacity to make their own decisions about consumption rather than have those decisions curtailed by regulatory processes. The fact that the decision <italic>to </italic>smoke might kill you was rendered nearly irrelevant in the context of a debate about the right to choose to do so. This argument was prefaced on a reorientation of the meaning and authority of health and of the relationship between cigarettes and health and, ultimately the relationship between men (or masculinity) and health.</p>
<sec id="section7-1097184X12461917">
<title>The Marlboro Man and Industry Regulation following the Surgeon General’s 1964 Report <italic>Smoking and Heath</italic>
</title>
<p>The Marlboro Man presented a significance answer to the problem posed by the smoking and health issue. By virtue of his emphasis on individual autonomy, the Marlboro Man referenced political ideals regarding individual responsibility and freedom. These ideals, in turn, provided a powerful response to calls to regulate the advertising, sale and consumption of cigarettes, which emerged in the wake of the health scare of the 1950s. The Marlboro Man’s ability to engage so critically with questions about health and consumption was indicative of a broader extent to which a discourse of health shaped the language of politics and popular culture in America during the 1950s. As historians such as Smith (1992) and Epstein (1994) illustrate, the anxieties about gender and identity evident in the works of Schlesinger, Wilson, and Whyte (discussed above) were often framed in terms of metaphors of health, disease, and/or degeneration.</p>
<p>In the context of cigarette consumption, the capacity of an ideology emphasizing individual autonomy over government regulation to stymie attempts at regulation emerged was realized in the wake of the U.S. Surgeon General’s 1964 report on <italic>Smoking and Health </italic>(U.S. Department of Health 1964). The report stimulated a widespread discussion about regulating the tobacco industry. Recommendations included educational antismoking campaigns directed to minors, controls on sales to minors, encouraging and assisting those who wanted to quit smoking, raising taxes on the sale of cigarettes, restrictions on cigarette vending machines, strong Federal Trade Commission (FTC) controls on cigarette advertising and labeling, the cutting of subsidies to tobacco growers and bringing tobacco under the control of the FDA (Hill and Knowlton 1964).</p>
<p>The single most significant proposal to regulate the tobacco industry to emerge from a government body in the aftermath of the report, indeed the only such proposal, came from the FTC, which had been assigned the role of regulating and monitoring tobacco advertising since 1940. Now, with the surgeon-general’s report in hand, the FTC proposed a bold new strategy. The FTC issued a proposed set of regulations which targeted advertising directed at young adults and called for health warnings on cigarette packages as well as health warnings on all cigarette advertising (FTC 1964).</p>
<p>The FTC’s proposal and the 1964 report more generally, appeared to open the door for a system of public regulation. Alan Brandt, more than 40 years later highlighted the significance of the report in this regard. He writes “Inherent in the report were powerful notions of the possibility of the liberal state . . . [It] remains a signal contribution not only to the history of the cigarette but to the history of public health” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1097184X12461917">Brandt 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>Despite the promise of a new era in American public health, events did not unfold in the promised way. The tobacco industry challenged the proposal that all advertising carry a health warning, taking the case to Congress, and winning. The Congress Committee voted 12-2 in favor of a tobacco industry proposition to postpone the requirement for a period of four years. Elizabeth Drew, writing in the <italic>Atlantic Quarterly</italic> in 1965, described the Bill as “an unabashed act to protect private industry from government regulation.” One of the most significant factors in the defeat of the bill was that it was seen to interfere with the machinations of the market. The tobacco industry “pulled it off,” Drew wrote, because</p>
<p>it successfully grafted onto its built-in congressional strength from tobacco-producing states a sufficient number of congressmen to whom the issue was not one of health, or even of the tobacco industry, but one of <italic>curbing the powers of regulatory agencies</italic> such as the Federal Trade Commission (Drew 1965)</p>

<sec id="section8-1097184X12461917">
<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>The argument of this article is that the imagery employed in cigarette advertising underwent an important transformation in the mid-twentieth century. This transformation can be understood in terms of a comparison of the physician, depicted in Camel’s more doctors smoke . . .” campaign of the late 1940s and  early 1950s, with the cowboy depicted in Marlboro’s Marlboro Man campaign which developed through the late 1950s and 1960s. The basis of this shift in advertising was the controversy that emerged regarding the relationship between smoking and health during the 1950s and early 1960s.</p>
<p>This shift from the physician to the Marlboro Man cowboy can be understood as transformation in the relationship between men and health. Whereas the emphasis on the physician represented men as the arbiters and prescribers of health, the cowboy had a very different kind of compulsion. The cowboy’s masculinity was, in part, dependant upon his conception of himself as an individual, a free agent. As such the cowboy was deeply suspicious of any suggestion of institutionalization, bureaucratization, regulation, authority or hierarchy. (In this respect he was an insular and insecure figure).</p>
<p>Whereas previously a man might have identified with the physician, now this relationship would be characterized by suspicion and anxiety and viewed as a site and sign of weakness and disempowerment: of emasculation rather than aspiration. This shift in masculinity would, as it was designed to do, enable men to define their smoking as a site of resistance to dominant health discourses and, consequently, as a performance of autonomous masculinity (Courtenay 2000). The ideology represented by the cowboy, with its compulsive anxiety regarding government intervention, was also deeply complicit in the failure of FTC to regulate cigarette advertising in the wake of the 1964 report on smoking and health.</p>
