<abstract>
<p>This article provides an overview of the Asian American Psychological Association (AAPA). A brief history is provided, followed by current status and resources, connections to counseling psychology, and implications for the Society of Counseling Psychology and for the future of the AAPA. AAPA was created in 1972 in response to psychology’s neglect of practice and research concerns within Asian American communities and the emergence of “Asian Americans” as a political and personal identity rooted in the shared experiences of different Asian ethnic groups. Since then, the association has been at the forefront of advancing Asian American psychology and the interests of Asian American psychologists. AAPA ties with counseling psychology can be evidenced by significant overlap of professional values and goals and leading counseling psychologists actively involved in both AAPA and Division 17. The article discusses some of the existing resources within AAPA and points out existing collaborations and ideas for future collaborations with Division 17.</p>

<title>Brief History</title>
<p>Advocacy has been integral to the history and mission of the Asian American Psychological Association (AAPA). Founded in 1972 by Derald Wing Sue and Stanley Sue, AAPA was inspired by the social advocacy of the civil rights movement and the spirit of self-determination and solidarity of Black activist psychologists who formed the Association of Black Psychologists (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0011000012450416">Pickren, 2004</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0011000012450416">Pickren (2004)</xref> observed that during the 1960s-1970s, the American Psychological Association (APA) was ambivalent about addressing social issues such as race, as evidenced by the <italic>Tyler Report</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0011000012450416">Tyler, 1969</xref>)—a report by an Ad Hoc Committee on Public Affairs that was chaired by Leona Tyler, a former President of both APA and the Society of Counseling Psychology. In regard to the role of APA in addressing public policy, the committee concluded that social issues were of lower relevance than “scientific” or “professional” issues. Subsequently, parallel to their colleagues in the Black community, the Sue brothers formed AAPA after recognizing that psychology also failed to provide training on practice or research with Asian American communities. Indeed, a PsycInfo search of the term <italic>Asian American</italic> between 1965 and 1975 yielded only 12 publications—6 of them written by one of the Sue brothers. Interestingly, a PsycInfo search of terms related to the major Asian ethnic groups (e.g., Chinese American, Japanese American, Filipino American) yielded 97 publications during the same time period. In effect, the emergence of the association also paralleled the emergence of an Asian American consciousness or racial identity that was developing across the United States across the various Asian ethnic groups—particularly second-generation Chinese American, Japanese American, and Filipino American activists and scholars (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0011000012450416">Espiritu, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0011000012450416">Wei, 1993</xref>). Whereas various Asian ethnic groups had historically “disidentified” with one another prior to the 1960s and primarily identified with their own ethnic group, the notion of an Asian American identity developed in recognition of shared experiences of immigration and discrimination across Asian ethnic groups as well as a recognition of political strength through coalition building (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0011000012450416">Espiritu, 1992</xref>). Thus, AAPA was created within the context of transformations within psychology as well as the country as a whole.</p>
<p>Moreover, AAPA was formed due to the absence of a network for Asian American psychologists and their relatively minimal influence and representation in professional psychology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0011000012450416">Wong, 1981</xref>)—particularly clinical and counseling psychology. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0011000012450416">Pickren (2004)</xref> observed that in the mid-1970s Asian Americans were entering other disciplines within psychology rather than clinical or counseling psychology. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0011000012450416">Boxley and Wagner (1971)</xref> found only 5 Asian American faculty and 48 graduate students in clinical psychology. Similarly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0011000012450416">Russo, Olmedo, Stapp, and Fulcher (1981)</xref> reported that only 30 Asian Americans or .007% of the discipline identified as counseling psychologists. In this context, AAPA was formed to advocate for the inclusion of and attention to Asian American issues in training, research, and practice as well as to increase the recruitment of Asian Americans into psychology. Indeed, when K. Patrick Okura, the Executive Assistant Director of the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH), and the Asian American Social Workers Organization helped to organize the first national Conference on Asian American Mental Health in 1971, they had expected about 80 participants to attend. Instead, over 600 participants attended the tension-filled conference to voice their long-held frustrations about the lack of attention devoted to Asian American mental health issues and the lack of representation of Asian Americans practitioners and researchers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0011000012450416">Pickren, 2004</xref>). Similarly, to focus on recruitment and training issues specific to psychology, Stanley Sue, with support and funding once again from NIMH and K. Patrick Okura, convened the first National Asian American Psychology Training Conference in 1976. AAPA members have also been instrumental in developing the National Asian American Psychology Training Center in 1979 and the National Research Center on Asian American Mental Health in 1988 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0011000012450416">Leong &amp; Gupta, 2008</xref>). From this foundation of advocacy, AAPA has continued to advocate for all segments of Asian/Pacific Islander American communities by addressing a variety of significant issues influencing these communities, such as marriage equality, immigrant rights, language access, U.S. census representation, culturally competent crisis and trauma counseling, research funding, and leadership in professional psychology.</p>

<title>Current Status and Resources</title>
<p>From its original 10 members to its current membership of approximately 600, AAPA has continued its expansion. Of these members, approximately 35% identify as counseling psychologists and approximately 50% are students (M. Wei, personal communication, November 13, 2010). Structurally, AAPA consists of four Divisions—Division on Women, Division of Students, Division on Filipino Americans, and Division on South Asian Americans—and regional associations across the country. Since 1985, AAPA hosts an annual convention that is a focal point for networking and presentations on Asian American scholarship and best practices. To foster networking and mentoring, AAPA has also developed a website, electronic mailing list, online mentoring programs, and discussion groups. The AAPA website serves as an archive of previous AAPA conventions, in addition to providing numerous resources (e.g., research, grants, awards) for students and early career professionals (see <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://aapaonline.org/resources">https://aapaonline.org/resources</ext-link>). AAPA publishes a quarterly newsletter—the <italic>Asian American Psychologist</italic>—and has launched the <italic>Asian American Journal of Psychology</italic> in 2010. AAPA members have also been instrumental in shaping the field through key publications such as the <italic>Mental Health of Asian Americans</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0011000012450416">Sue &amp; Morishima, 1982</xref>), <italic>Handbook of Asian American Psychology</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0011000012450416">Lee &amp; Zane, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0011000012450416">Leong et al., 2006</xref>), <italic>Asian American Psychology</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0011000012450416">Hall &amp; Okazaki, 2002</xref>), and <italic>Asian American Psychology: Current Perspectives</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0011000012450416">Tewari &amp; Alvarez, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>With the considerable number of graduate students and early career professionals in AAPA, a large proportion of the Association’s resources have focused on supporting these emerging colleagues. Given that financial concerns are a critical concern for this segment of the community, AAPA sponsors Student Travel Awards—to enable students to attend AAPA conventions—and the Student Grant for Dissertation Research to support students at this critical stage of their career. Relatedly, students and early career professionals have highly reduced dues in order to ease their financial pressures. To facilitate student attendance at AAPA’s conventions, students are given volunteer opportunities at both the Convention and annual banquet in exchange for reduced registration fees. Moreover, a Mentor-Mentee event has also been a consistent Convention activity that links students with leaders within the field. To continue the momentum of these mentoring relationships throughout the year, AAPA has sponsored online mentoring discussion groups that have been facilitated by AAPA leaders to enable mentees to explore professional development issues in more depth. Moreover, given the importance of creating organizational structures that give voice and power to students and emerging professionals, AAPA has designated one of the Board of Director’s positions as a student representative, and in 2006, the Division of Students was formally created to enable students to coalesce and network more effectively. Additionally, AAPA has created a Leadership Fellows program to cultivate the leadership skills of early career professionals and to facilitate their entry into formal leadership roles within AAPA. Since its inception, the Leadership Fellows program has produced convention chairs, a member of the Board of Directors, and a chair of an association-wide task force. Indeed, it has been the belief of the AAPA leadership that the retention and active participation of AAPA’s students and early career professionals is directly related to an organizational culture that is open and accessible to its membership.</p>

<title>Counseling Psychology’s Connections to AAPA</title>
<p>As previously noted, there are numerous connections between counseling psychology and AAPA. First, there has been a connection between AAPA and counseling psychology in terms of values and training. As a discipline, counseling psychology is grounded in “developmental, growth-oriented, strength-based, and multicultural models” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0011000012450416">Fouad, Gerstein, &amp; Toporek, 2006</xref>, p. 2). AAPA’s mission statement echoes similar values, seeking to “advance the psychological well-being of Asian American communities through affecting professional practice, research, and teaching” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0011000012450416">AAPA, 2010</xref>). Over the years, AAPA has increasingly been very specific in affirming its values on client and community assets and recognizing contextual influences as demonstrated by its conference themes (e.g., “strengthening our diverse families and communities in times of change” and “interdisciplinary approaches to resisting ethnocentrism, racism, and intersection oppressions”). Both counseling psychology and AAPA view clients in relation to their environments and endeavor to take a holistic approach to psychological practice focusing on client resilience as opposed to viewing them from a deficit model.</p>
<p>Second, counseling psychology and AAPA have a shared emphasis on international student training, and both counseling psychology and AAPA have taken action on best practices with training international students. AAPA has not merely relied on the fact that international students attend its conference in large numbers. AAPA has held specific symposia, workshops, student travel awards, and mentoring opportunities designed to meet the needs of internationals students during its annual conference (see AAPA’s website at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://aapaonline.org/conventionmain/prevconv">https://aapaonline.org/conventionmain/prevconv</ext-link> for a listing of previous conventions’ content). This is in alignment with counseling psychology’s increased emphasis on international student training, evidenced by the formation of the International Section of Division 17 in 2007, whose mission includes this training as a specific focus (see <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.div17.0rg/sections_i.html">http://www.div17.0rg/sections_i.html</ext-link> for a full discussion). Counseling psychology literature on international students has also moved from asserting the importance of training (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0011000012450416">Pedersen, 1991</xref>) to the voices of international students themselves about their training needs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0011000012450416">Ng &amp; Smith, 2009</xref>). The most recent 2008 counseling psychology conference in Chicago had a large emphasis on international students through specific workshops, symposia, and mentoring opportunities directly related to international student training needs (see <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.icpc2008.0rg/">http://www.icpc2008.0rg/</ext-link>).</p>
<p>A third connection between counseling psychology and AAPA has been the integral value of multiculturalism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0011000012450416">Asian American Psychological Association, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0011000012450416">Society of Counseling Psychology, 2010</xref>). AAPA has endeavored to recognize the diversity not only within subgroups of Asian American Pacific Islander (AAPI) psychology but has also held a conference in 2004 to specifically explore the differences and similarities between Asian psychology and Asian American psychology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0011000012450416">Leong &amp; Okazaki, 2009</xref>). Likewise, counseling psychologists have been at the forefront of the multicultural movement in psychology in developing multicultural guidelines and competencies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0011000012450416">Arredondo et al., 1996</xref>). Many of the leaders of this multicultural movement have been counseling psychologists who are also members of AAPA (e.g., Y. Barry Chung, Derald Wing Sue, Richard Suinn, Christine Yeh). In recent years, both AAPA and counseling psychology have used this strong emphasis on multiculturalism to explore areas for advocacy and activism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0011000012450416">Fouad et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0011000012450416">Singh, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Finally, a fourth connection between counseling psychology and AAPA is evident in the leadership of both organizations. We will discuss the prominent counseling psychologist leaders of AAPA in more detail in a later section. However, it is important to note that as the large number of these distinguished leaders have naturally brought counseling psychology’s values and practices into AAPA as an organization, AAPA has also influenced the work of these leaders in their own discipline in a mutually reciprocating process.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0011000012450416">
<title>Prominent Counseling Psychologists within AAPA</title>
<p>There are many counseling psychologists within AAPA whose work has influence not only on the national level but also on the international level. The co-founder of AAPA as well as former President of the Society of Counseling Psychology, Derald Wing Sue, is a counseling psychologist who is well known for his outstanding leadership in promoting multicultural competency in counseling psychology as well as psychology as a whole. The only Asian American and one of only three men of color to be a President of the American Psychological Association—Richard Suinn—has also been a leader within AAPA and as a Member-at-Large in Division 17’s Executive Board. Indeed, as an indicator of his many influences in the field of psychology, the APA’s Suinn Minority Achievement Award was named in his honor to recognize graduate programs that excel in recruiting, mentoring, and graduating minority students along with implementing multiculturalism in the program’s curriculum.</p>
<p>Gisela Lin, Frederick Leong, and Alvin Alvarez are three distinguished counseling psychologists who have served as the President of the AAPA in the past 10 years. Their contributions are well recognized not only in Asian American psychology and multicultural counseling but also internationalism in counseling psychology. Moreover, two former Vice Presidents of AAPA, Nita Tewari and Arpana Inman, are both counseling psychologists who have been Co-Chairs of the Division on Women for AAPA and co-founders of the South Asian Psychological Networking Association (SAPNA). Another prominent Asian American counseling psychologist is Lisa Suzuki, who is a co-editor of the <italic>Handbook of Multicultural Counseling</italic>. Vivian Ota Wang is a counseling psychologist at the National Institute of Health who has been recognized with the Award for Distinguished Service from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and the Distinguished Contributions Award from AAPA. Christine Yeh received AAPA’s Early Career Award as recognition for her outstanding research and community mental health service for underserved populations. Additionally, counseling psychologists who are AAPA Early Career Award recipients include Bryan S. K. Kim, Alvin Alvarez, Richard Lee, Y. Barry Chung, and Arpana Inman, who have been recognized for their research and service to Asian American communities.</p>
<p>As previously noted, one of the significant overlaps between AAPA and the Society of Counseling Psychology has been in the area of organizational leadership. For instance, leaders within AAPA have also been Vice Presidents within the Society of Counseling Psychology—Mary Fukuyama, Ruperto Perez, Lisa Suzuki, and Y. Barry Chung. With many publications related to multicultural counseling competencies and multicultural assessment development, Gargi Roysircar is a former Chair of the Section on Ethic and Racial Diversity for Division 17. Currently, Bryan S. K. Kim and Lisa Suzuki serve as Associate Editors of <italic>The Counseling Psychologist</italic>, while Kwong-Liem Karl Kwan serves as the Editor of <italic>The Counseling Psychologist</italic>’s International Forum. Thus, there has been considerable overlap between the leadership of both AAPA and Division 17.</p>
<p>Lastly, the potential for continuing collaborations between AAPA and the Society of Counseling Psychology also looks promising in light of the numerous counseling psychologists who are active members of AAPA and, at the same time, a fellow of Division 17 in the APA. These people include Derald Wing Sue, Frederick Leong, Meifen Wei, Seung-Ming Leung, Richard Lee, Richard M. Suinn, Ruperto M. Perez, and Y. Barry Chung. The potential for continued cooperation between the AAPA and the Society of Counseling Psychology is also promising given AAPA’s efforts at promoting and honoring excellence in leadership, research, and service skills of future counseling psychologists by providing various awards to the students. For example, in addition to the aforementioned Association-wide Student Grant for Dissertation Research and Student Travel Awards, the Division of Students gives a Leadership Award, a Research Award, and a Service Award to student members in the Association. Therefore, with a large number of Asian American counseling psychologists in visible leadership positions and with the large percentage of students who are in counseling psychology, there is a clear bridge between AAPA and the Society of Counseling Psychology that can serve as a foundation for cooperation and collaboration.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0011000012450416">
<title>Implications for Counseling Psychology</title>
<p>With overlapping leadership and a shared commitment to advocacy and multiculturalism, the potential for formal and long-term collaborations between AAPA and counseling psychology have been well established. As an initial step toward this goal, formal relationships that create better communication between the two organizations will be integral in acting upon shared agendas. For instance, in terms of communication among the leadership, it may be possible to arrange regular meetings with the respective Presidents of AAPA and Division 17, convene joint meetings with executive boards, and create formal liaisons to each group. With regard to activities, exposure for both organizations may be feasible through linkages in each organization’s newsletters, websites, and journals. Most importantly, with AAPA’s conventions occurring prior to APA, collaborating on convention programming is a rich opportunity for the two groups. From co-sponsoring workshops, poster sessions, and symposia to community service activities and social hours, conventions are an ideal time for the two communities to interact and learn from one another.</p>
<p>Leveraging the fact that both organizations meet prior to the APA convention is especially important, as currently the Division 17 Executive Board meets during the evening prior to the APA convention and the AAPA holds its Annual Awards Banquet. This timing could be easily shifted so that Division 17 leaders could attend the banquet and members of AAPA may become more involved in Division 17 leadership opportunities. There is also the potential to collaborate on expanding support to students and early career professionals among the two organizations. Given the increased visibility that would result from such collaborations, it seems likely that each community will be strengthened by the mutual exchange of ideas, skills, and potentially members. Indeed, with Asian American/Pacific Islanders as one of the fastest growing racial groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0011000012450416">Reeves &amp; Bennett, 2004</xref>) and students as the largest community within AAPA, a collaboration between AAPA and counseling psychology has the potential to reshape the next generation of both communities.</p>
