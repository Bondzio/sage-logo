<sec id="sec1-0022185613482231" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title>
<p>Reform is never easy, particularly that which is driven by economic factors on a grand scale. As mentioned in earlier articles, the new Queensland state government retrenched a large number of public servants during 2012 as part of its reform agenda (see McCrystal and Orchiston, this issue; Sheldon and Thornthwaite, this issue).</p>
<p>This article will examine briefly the decision of the Queensland government to retrench over 10,000 public sector employees and make each of their respective positions redundant, voluntarily or otherwise. It will discuss the unprecedented legal challenge led by the public sector union Together Queensland and the Australian Workers Union (AWU) against the Crown, and attempt to present to the reader a glimpse of the post-redundancy impact on not only those employees who were terminated, but also those employees remaining in the workplace.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec2-0022185613482231"><title>Background</title>
<p>In July 2012, the Queensland government redundancies were touted to employees and the public sector community at large as a necessary part of its reform process and as a way for the Premier, Campbell Newman, to cut costs on surplus positions and functions, thereby assisting in the reduction of Queensland’s debt. The Treasurer and Minister for Trade, Tim Nicholls, stated in parliament on 11 September 2012:<disp-quote>
<p>Fellow Queenslanders, the 2012 Budget will deliver a brighter future for all Queensland. It’s the most important budget in a generation. There’s much to be proud of here in Queensland – our people and our economy are extremely resilient. But we also need to make sure the State’s finances are sound and well managed. For too long the State Government has been living beyond its means, spending more than it earns. Under the previous Labor government, debt has reached $65 billion. And if we had done nothing about it, it would have reached $100 billion. Although our State’s dire financial circumstances are not of our own making, we have a responsibility to fix them. And it’s a responsibility we understand and accept.</p>
<p>By making sure government is the right size, the Newman Government will ensure that the State can continue to deliver the services Queenslanders want at a price they’re prepared to pay.</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>It soon became clear that there would be insufficient <italic>voluntary</italic> redundancies, so the government issued directives to strip job security and no-contracting-out clauses from public servants’ work agreements, enabling forced retrenchments.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0022185613482231">1</xref></sup> Together Queensland and the AWU quickly mounted a Supreme Court challenge, arguing that the Public Service Commissioner did not have the authority to issue such directives, which, it was claimed, were made contrary to the Industrial Relations Act.</p>
<p>In August 2012, the state government passed legislation allowing the Public Service Commissioner to enforce industrial instruments, such as directives, to make public service reform easier. Following on from that, the state government faced rallies and protests by public sector employees and their unions and was placed in the invidious position of having to defend itself vehemently against criticism, from commentators and unions, that the proposed redundancies were forced rather than voluntary; and that the government directives and newly enshrined legislation<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0022185613482231">2</xref></sup> to strip employment security breached the separation of powers in the Queensland Constitution, in that it interfered with concluded judicial proceedings by overriding agreements certified by the Queensland Industrial Relations Commission.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec3-0022185613482231"><title>Legal challenge</title>
<p>On 31 August 2012, Together Queensland and the AWU launched a legal challenge against the controversial legislative amendments, specifically, s. 138 of the Public Service Act 2008 and ss. 3(p)(i), 149(5)(c)(ii)(A) and 388AA of the Industrial Relations Act 1999 (Qld). The unions claimed that the government’s amendments to the Public Service Act<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0022185613482231">3</xref></sup> and the Industrial Relations Act<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0022185613482231">4</xref></sup> breached the Queensland and Australian Constitutions. They also claimed that the changes undermined the integrity and the appearance of independence and impartiality of the Queensland Industrial Relations Commission. Conversely, the state government argued that the changes to the legislation were needed to allow the government to ensure that the public service was the ‘right size’ and affordable.</p>
<p>Justices Catherine Holmes, John Muir and Margaret White of the Supreme Court delivered their judgement on 14 December 2012, dismissing with costs the bid by the unions to have the relevant sections of the legislation declared invalid.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0022185613482231">5</xref></sup> On 10 January 2013, lawyers for the AWU filed an application for Special Leave to appeal the Supreme Court’s decisions to the High Court of Australia.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0022185613482231">6</xref></sup></p>

<sec id="sec4-0022185613482231"><title>Workforce morale post-redundancy</title>
<p>When making employees redundant, there is of course more for an organisation to consider than ensuring that the redundancy process complies with the law. How must this affect the balance of the employees the government want to retain? Even up until recently, the state government has continued to cut significant numbers of jobs, and Queensland’s public sector employees continue to look over their shoulders, holding their breath and wishing they could ‘feel safe’ once again. How might this impact on the attractiveness of the Queensland public sector as a place to work?</p>
<p>Not all workers have the benefit of a tertiary education or the ability to transfer their skills into the private sector. Some employees spend their entire working life as a public servant – a position perceived by many as a safe haven and a privilege. What happens when that safety and security is threatened? It is a devastating reality for a person who values their position, qualifications, skills, experience, contribution, sense of belonging and self-worth to be faced not only with losing their job, but also with the prospect of losing faith in all of those self-fulfilling attributes.</p>
<p>The effect of retrenchment is very likely to impact enormously on not only the employee and his or her family, but also colleagues who remain in the workplace and who may or may not have been in the line of fire. As a workplace lawyer advising clients on the redundancy process and having regard to the impact that a termination can have on the existing workforce, it is incumbent upon the lawyer to warn not only of the legal consequences of a non-compliant process, but also about the rights and obligations of departing employees, and the potential negative impact of a badly managed restructuring upon those employees the employer wishes to retain.</p>
<p>A restructuring process may have a serious destabilising effect on the existing workforce if they feel that their fellow workers have been treated unfairly. This may result in employee morale plummeting and the building of mistrust among the ranks. It is not unusual for employers to experience a sharp increase in labour turnover up to a period of 12 months after a major restructure has been affected. This may ultimately negate the purpose of the restructuring – which is usually to promote efficiency and to reduce costs.<sup>7</sup></p>
<p>It is well documented that employees are more likely to adopt the goals of the restructuring if they are properly consulted as to its purpose and perceive that the employer has considered all possible alternatives before termination. It is also critical to the process for employers at the end of a major restructuring to explain the benefits of the restructuring to the remaining employees, and to ensure that they gain some advantage from it in terms of job security, increased responsibilities or benefits.<sup>8</sup></p>
<p>While the Queensland state government has been criticised in the media and in the community at large for undertaking such a drastic restructure, which has resulted in affecting thousands of individual livelihoods, the government does claim to have undertaken a thorough consultative process.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0022185613482231">9</xref></sup></p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec5-0022185613482231"><title>The future</title>
<p>The government is in a rebuilding phase, as are those employees who have been retrenched from redundant positions. The government’s stated priority is the rebuilding of the state’s financial security, which it claims has necessitated the mass restructuring of the Queensland public sector.</p>
<p>The decline in public sector employees’ job security jeopardises one of the perceived main advantages of employment in the public sector vis-a-vis the private sector. Taking away this factor can be expected to impact on the public sector’s attraction as an employer and on retention issues. In a state such as Queensland where there is competition for skilled labour, particularly from the resources sector, the public sector has limited ability to compete with bonuses, above-award payments and so on and needs to consider carefully what conditions of employment it can offer to attract new employees of a high calibre.</p>
<p>A review in 12 months’ time of the outcomes for the government, the public and the employees made redundant would enable a clearer assessment of the consequences, more so than is possible now.</p>
