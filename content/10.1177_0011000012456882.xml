<abstract>
<p>An overview of the evolution of Asian American acculturation and enculturation theory and measurement is offered, focusing on major theoretical advancements and methodological issues that are salient for measuring these constructs. Informed by these considerations, an empirical approach is taken to clarifying the dimensions of Asian American acculturation and enculturation in existing measures. Existing measures of Asian American acculturation and enculturation as well as items from some population-nonspecific measures were selected for consolidation, with attention to item content, uniqueness, and format variability. Exploratory factor analyses of data from 275 Asian and Asian American participants in the United States suggested that the measures reflected three factors of acculturation and enculturation: (a) Language-related Behavior, (b) Cultural and Sociopolitical Knowledge, and (c) Pride and Cultural Group Association. Results suggested that values measures assessed distinct (but correlated) constructs relative to these three acculturation and enculturation constructs.</p>

<body>
<p>With greater appreciation of how cultural contexts shape people’s lives, the study of acculturation, or the adoption of dominant host cultural norms, and enculturation, or the adoption of heritage cultural norms, has received substantial attention in the psychological literature (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0011000012456882">Schwartz, Unger, Zamboanga, &amp; Szapocznik, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-0011000012456882">Yoon, Langrehr, &amp; Ong, 2011</xref>). These advancements are particularly salient in the literature on Asian American acculturation and enculturation (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0011000012456882">Kim, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0011000012456882">Suinn, 2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0011000012456882">2010</xref>). This literature includes a proliferation of approaches to operationalizing Asian American acculturation and enculturation (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0011000012456882">Gim Chung, Kim, &amp; Abreu, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0011000012456882">Kim, Atkinson, &amp; Yang, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0011000012456882">Suinn, Rickard-Figueroa, Lew, &amp; Vigil, 1987</xref>), which in turn has led to conceptual efforts to integrate the landscape of acculturation and enculturation constructs assessed across measures (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0011000012456882">Kim, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0011000012456882">Kim &amp; Abreu, 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>At this juncture, empirical efforts are needed to elucidate the constructs assessed across Asian American acculturation and enculturation measures and to evaluate the promise for instrument consolidation. Such research can promote greater clarity in future theory refinements, research efforts, and clinical applications of Asian American acculturation and enculturation constructs. To this end, the aims of the present article are two-fold. First, we offer an overview of the evolution of Asian American acculturation and enculturation theory and measurement. Given numerous prior reviews of general and Asian American–specific acculturation and enculturation literatures (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0011000012456882">Kim, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0011000012456882">Kim &amp; Abreu, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0011000012456882">Suinn, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-0011000012456882">Yoon et al., 2011</xref>), the present overview focuses on major theoretical advancements (e.g., multidimensionality) and methodological issues (e.g., item format variability) that are salient for the measurement of Asian American acculturation and enculturation. Second, we describe a study in which, informed by these theoretical and methodological considerations, we take an empirical approach to clarifying the constructs assessed by Asian American acculturation and enculturation measures.</p>

<title>Definitions and Correlates of Acculturation and Enculturation</title>
<p>Since <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0011000012456882">Redfield, Linton, and Herskovits (1936)</xref> first defined acculturation as “those phenomena which result when groups of individuals having different cultures come into continuous first-hand contact, with subsequent changes in the original cultural patterns of either or both groups” (p. 149), scholars have been interested in studying acculturation in the context of a wide array of social and health-related issues. Such research on acculturation has facilitated better understanding of various populations’ adaptation to the dominant U.S. culture, including that of Asian and Asian American populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0011000012456882">Kim &amp; Abreu, 2001</xref>). This understanding, coupled with the ability to assess acculturation, is important to psychologists who serve Asian and Asian American populations because acculturation in these populations has been found to be related to a variety of behavioral, attitudinal, and psychological variables (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0011000012456882">Miller, 2007</xref>). For example, acculturation has been linked with Asian American individuals’ vocational functioning (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0011000012456882">Leong, Kao, &amp; Lee, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0011000012456882">Miller &amp; Kerlow-Myers, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0011000012456882">Tang, Fouad, &amp; Smith, 1999</xref>), attitudes toward help-seeking (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0011000012456882">Kim, 2007b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0011000012456882">Liao, Rounds, &amp; Klein, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0011000012456882">Miller, Yang, Hui, Choi, &amp; Lim, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0011000012456882">Ruzek, Nguyen, &amp; Herzog, 2011</xref>), counseling process (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0011000012456882">Kim, Atkinson, &amp; Umemoto, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-0011000012456882">Wang &amp; Kim, 2010</xref>), prejudicial social attitudes (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0011000012456882">Liu, Pope-Davis, Nevitt, &amp; Toporek, 1999</xref>), perceptions of mental illness (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0011000012456882">Kumar &amp; Nevid, 2010</xref>), disordered eating and body image (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0011000012456882">Reddy &amp; Crowther, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0011000012456882">Stark-Wroblewski, Yanico, &amp; Lupe, 2005</xref>), communication styles (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0011000012456882">Park &amp; Kim, 2008</xref>), emotional self-disclosure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0011000012456882">Chen &amp; Danish, 2010</xref>), acculturative stress (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0011000012456882">Hwang &amp; Ting, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0011000012456882">Kim &amp; Omizo, 2005</xref>), family relationships (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0011000012456882">Kim, Ahn, &amp; Lam, 2009</xref>), and mental health (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0011000012456882">Sue &amp; Chu, 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>Related to the concept of acculturation, the concept of enculturation was first defined as the process of socialization to and maintenance of the norms of one’s indigenous culture, including the values, ideas, and concepts that are salient for the culture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0011000012456882">Herskovits, 1948</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0011000012456882">Kim (2007a)</xref> indicated that the advantages of conceptualizing enculturation as a psychological construct separate from acculturation were two-fold. First, enculturation may better describe the experiences of some Asian American individuals who were born in the United States and exposed to U.S. cultural norms but may not have been fully enculturated into their Asian ethnic groups’ cultural norms. Second, using the term <italic>enculturation</italic> places an equal focus on the process of learning and retaining one’s Asian cultural norms, so as to be on par with the term <italic>acculturation</italic>, which focuses on the process of adaptation to U.S. dominant cultural norms.</p>
<p>In their content analyses of acculturation and enculturation theories and measures, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0011000012456882">Kim and Abreu (2001)</xref> proposed that enculturation be used to describe the process of (re)socializing and maintaining the norms of the indigenous culture, and that acculturation be used to describe the process of adapting to U.S. cultural norms. Similarly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0011000012456882">Kim (2009)</xref> described that, for Asian American individuals, acculturation is “the extent to which these individuals have adopted the dominant cultural norms of the United States,” and enculturation refers to “the degree to which they have retained the norms of their heritage cultures” (p. 99). Within the existing research, enculturation has been linked with behavioral, attitudinal, and psychological variables such as Asian American individuals’ family conflict (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0011000012456882">Park, Kim, Chiang, &amp; Ju, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0011000012456882">Tajima &amp; Harachi, 2010</xref>), eating attitudes and body image (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0011000012456882">Lau, Lum, Chronister, &amp; Forrest, 2006</xref>), attitudes toward help-seeking (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0011000012456882">Kim, 2007b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0011000012456882">Miller et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0011000012456882">Ruzek et al., 2011</xref>), client-counselor working alliance (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0011000012456882">Kim, Ng, &amp; Ahn, 2005</xref>), depressive symptoms (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-0011000012456882">Wong, Tran, &amp; Lai, 2009</xref>), distress disclosure (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0011000012456882">Chen &amp; Danish, 2010</xref>), psychological functioning (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0011000012456882">Kim &amp; Omizo, 2006</xref>), acculturative stress (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0011000012456882">Kim &amp; Omizo, 2005</xref>), gender role conflict (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0011000012456882">Liu &amp; Iwamoto, 2006</xref>), and substance use (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0011000012456882">Liu &amp; Iwamoto, 2007</xref>).</p>

<title>Assessment of Acculturation and Enculturation</title>
<p>To promote conceptual clarity, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0011000012456882">Miller (2007)</xref> proposed a standardization of terminology based on recommendations by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0011000012456882">Kim and Abreu (2001)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0011000012456882">Magaña et al. (1996)</xref>. Specifically, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0011000012456882">Miller (2007)</xref> suggested that the terms <italic>linearity</italic> be used to describe the number of cultures that the model or measure of acculturation and enculturation references, and that <italic>dimensionality</italic> be used to describe the multiple domains of acculturation and enculturation. The terms <italic>linearity</italic> and <italic>dimensionality</italic> are used accordingly in the present discussion.</p>
<p>Conceptualization and measurement of the linearity and dimensionality of acculturation and enculturation have evolved over time. Early unilinear perspectives assumed that individuals are placed on a single continuum of cultural retention-adaptation that ranges from exclusively adhering to one’s indigenous culture to exclusively adhering to the mainstream culture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0011000012456882">Ryder, Alden, &amp; Paulhus, 2000</xref>); as such, greater adherence to one’s indigenous culture is at the expense of reduced adherence to another culture and vice versa. In contrast, the bilinear perspective posits that acculturation and enculturation are orthogonal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0011000012456882">Tewari &amp; Alvarez, 2009</xref>) in that some individuals may experience low or high levels of cultural retention and adaptation to both indigenous and other cultures. As these descriptions suggest, the major criticisms of the unilinear model are that it does not allow for independent determination of acculturation to the mainstream culture and enculturation to the indigenous culture and consequently fails to capture the reality of biculturalism for many ethnic minority people in the United States (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0011000012456882">Cuéllar, Arnold, &amp; Maldonado, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0011000012456882">Kim &amp; Abreu, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0011000012456882">Ryder et al., 2000</xref>). As a result, in the recent development of acculturation and enculturation measures for different ethnic groups, the bilinear approach has superseded the unilinear approach for conceptualizing acculturation and enculturation (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0011000012456882">Cuéllar et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0011000012456882">Lee, Yoon, &amp; Liu-Tom, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0011000012456882">Ryder et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-0011000012456882">Zea, Asner-Self, Birman, &amp; Buki, 2003</xref>).</p>

<sec id="section3-0011000012456882">
<title>The Bilinear Model of Acculturation and Enculturation</title>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0011000012456882">Berry (1980)</xref> first proposed a bilinear model of acculturation whereby it is plausible for an individual to adhere to both her or his culture of origin and a second culture. Specifically, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0011000012456882">Berry (1980)</xref> asserted that there are four acculturation outcomes possible—namely, integration, assimilation, separation, and marginalization. Integration occurs when an individual maintains adherence and proficiency in both the indigenous and host (or dominant) cultures. Assimilation occurs when an individual internalizes the dominant culture and rejects or no longer adheres to the indigenous culture. Separation occurs when an individual maintains proficiency in the indigenous culture, but does not adapt to the dominant culture. Marginalization occurs when an individual rejects both the indigenous and dominant cultures.</p>
<p>More recent conceptualizations do not focus on these four formulations and rather emphasize a bilinear relation between adoption of culture of origin and the host culture, whereby it is possible for individuals to maintain a positive relationship with both cultures and to shift their behaviors as needed across contexts to fit into these cultures (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0011000012456882">Cuéllar et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0011000012456882">LaFromboise, Coleman, &amp; Gerton, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0011000012456882">Miller, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0011000012456882">Ryder et al., 2000</xref>). However, data are mixed regarding whether the relation between acculturation (adherence to the mainstream U.S. culture) and enculturation (adherence to the indigenous Asian culture) is psychometrically oblique (factors correlated with one another; e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0011000012456882">Lee et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0011000012456882">Miller, 2007</xref>) or orthogonal (factors not correlated or not correlated strongly with one another; e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0011000012456882">Cuéllar et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0011000012456882">Gim Chung et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0011000012456882">Ryder et al., 2000</xref>). These mixed findings may be related to two additional issues in operationalizing acculturation and enculturation: multidimensionality and item format.</p>

<sec id="section4-0011000012456882">
<title>The Multidimensional Perspective of Acculturation and Enculturation</title>
<p>Beyond the issue of linearity, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0011000012456882">Miller (2007)</xref> observed that there is some diversity and lack of consensus in the dimensions of acculturation and enculturation assessed across studies. In a content review of acculturation and enculturation measures, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0011000012456882">Kim and Abreu (2001)</xref> examined the item content of 33 measures of acculturation for U.S. ethnic minority groups and identified four basic dimensions from these items: behaviors (e.g., friendship choice, language use and preferences), values (e.g., attitudes and beliefs about social ties, cultural customs and traditions), knowledge (e.g., understanding culture-specific information such as history or cultural significance of an event), and cultural identity (e.g., self-identification, attitude, and feelings toward one’s indigenous cultural group and toward the mainstream cultural group). Based on this review, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0011000012456882">Kim and Abreu (2001)</xref> proposed a formal four-dimensional model comprised of the four interrelated dimensions of behaviors, values, knowledge, and cultural identity.</p>
<p>Empirical research related to these dimensions among Asian American individuals has tended to focus on the distinctiveness of behaviors from values. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0011000012456882">Kim et al. (1999)</xref> found that level of Asian values did not differ significantly across first-generation, second-generation, and third-generation (and beyond) Asian American immigrant groups. But these authors found the expected pattern of lower behavioral acculturation in tandem with more recent generational status. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0011000012456882">Kim et al. (1999)</xref> argued that this pattern suggests distinct change processes for values and behaviors, with the latter occurring faster than the former. As well, the pattern of correlations observed among values and behaviors dimensions also suggests their distinctiveness. For example, Miller et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0011000012456882">Miller, 2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0011000012456882">2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0011000012456882">Miller et al., 2011</xref>) found that within cultures (i.e., Asian and Western), values and behaviors were correlated positively, and within dimensions (i.e., values and behaviors), enculturation and acculturation were correlated negatively. But the magnitudes of these correlations were generally small to medium (i.e., in the .20s to .30s), suggesting some level of orthogonality consistent with a bilinear and multidimensional model. Furthermore, in a cross-validation study with Asian American individuals, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0011000012456882">Miller (2010)</xref> found that a bilinear multidimensional model comprised of behaviors and values acculturation and enculturation provided superior fit to the data when compared to unilinear and bilinear unidimensional models.</p>
<p>In light of the potential viability of a bilinear multidimensional model of Asian American acculturation and enculturation, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0011000012456882">Kim and Abreu (2001)</xref> called for research on existing acculturation and enculturation instruments to separate items that measure their different dimensions. Indeed, measures of Asian American acculturation and enculturation vary in the extent to which they assess behaviors (including language), values, knowledge, and cultural identity—the four dimensions that <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0011000012456882">Kim and Abreu (2001)</xref> identified. Some measures focus on only one dimension; when multiple dimensions are included, the number of items assessing each dimension is not balanced; and items are typically not scored along multiple dimensions and yield only overall scores for acculturation and enculturation. For example, the Asian American Multidimensional Acculturation Scale (AAMAS; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0011000012456882">Gim Chung et al., 2004</xref>) is a trilinear measure that assesses adherence to one’s Asian culture of origin (enculturation), the White mainstream culture (acculturation), as well as a panethnic Asian American culture. AAMAS items were adapted largely from the unilinear Suinn-Lew Asian Self-Identity Acculturation Scale (SL-ASIA; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0011000012456882">Suinn et al., 1987</xref>). Among the AAMAS items for each culture, six items are purported to measure behaviors (four measuring language, two measuring food consumption), three items measure cultural knowledge, and six items measure cultural identity. While the authors provided evidence for a four-factor structure (i.e., language, food consumption, cultural knowledge, and cultural identity), the items are not scored along these four dimensions and yield only a total score for each cultural domain.</p>
<p>Another example is the Acculturation Rating Scale for Mexican Americans–II, modified for use with Asian Americans (ARSMA-II-AA; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0011000012456882">Lee et al., 2006</xref>). The ARSMA-II-AA is a bilinear measure that was modified from the Acculturation Rating Scale for Mexican Americans–II (ARSMA-II; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0011000012456882">Cuéllar et al., 1995</xref>). The original ARSMA-II consists of 13 items that assess acculturation (Western orientation) and 17 items that assess enculturation (Mexican orientation). Using the modified ARSMA-II items with a sample of Asian American college students, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0011000012456882">Lee et al. (2006)</xref> found a two-factor solution for each orientation: For orientation to Asian culture, nine items were found to measure the dimension of language, six items were found to measure social interaction and identification with Asians, and two items were excluded due to their low factor loadings; for the orientation to Western culture, eight items were found to measure language, three items were found to measure social interaction and identification with Caucasians, and two items were excluded due to their low factor loadings. A confirmatory factor analysis of data from a second sample did not support the replicability of the language and social interaction dimensions; nevertheless, medium correlations between the overall Western and Asian orientation scores in both samples were consistent with a bilinear model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0011000012456882">Lee et al., 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>Finally, existing acculturation and enculturation measures typically do not assess values directly, but separate measures have been developed to assess values with Asian American populations. For instance, the Asian Values Scale–Revised (AVS-R; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0011000012456882">Kim &amp; Hong, 2004</xref>) and the European American Values Scale for Asian Americans–Revised (EAVS-AA-R; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0011000012456882">Hong, Kim, &amp; Wolfe, 2005</xref>) assess Asian American individuals’ endorsement of Asian cultural values and European American cultural values, respectively. Thus, although values are typically not included in acculturation and enculturation measures, the EAVS-AA-R and AVS-R are available for assessing the hypothesized values dimension of acculturation and enculturation.</p>
<p>As these examples illustrate, different measures of acculturation and enculturation assess different dimensions to different extents. Important to tests of the orthogonality of acculturation and enculturation is that these different dimensions of acculturation and enculturation may differ in their level of independence. For instance, because there is a finite amount of time for enacting behaviors, greater engagement in one set of cultural behaviors may be associated with lower engagement in the other cultural set of behaviors. By contrast, greater values, knowledge, and cultural identification in one cultural domain do not necessarily mean higher or lower values, knowledge, and cultural identification in the other cultural domain. Thus, in tests of the orthogonality of acculturation and enculturation, higher (negative) correlations might be expected between behavior-focused measures than between measures that emphasize other dimensions. As such, variation in the dimensions assessed across measures may be a source of the mixed findings regarding the orthogonality of acculturation and enculturation.</p>

<title>Item Format Variability and Impact on Linearity</title>
<p>Related to the issue of dimensionality is the issue of item format variability. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0011000012456882">Kang (2006)</xref> examined 14 measures of acculturation and enculturation and found that while these measures contained similar items to assess acculturation and enculturation in one or more dimensions, three different item formats tended to be used: frequency, proficiency, and endorsement. Frequency-format items often measure behavioral acculturation or enculturation; these items require participants to rate the frequency of their behaviors (e.g., language use, food preference) or to report the proportion of involvement (e.g., media selection, friendship composition) in each cultural domain. An example frequency-format item is, “How often do you listen to music or look at movies and magazines from your own Asian culture of origin?” (AAMAS; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0011000012456882">Gim Chung et al., 2004</xref>). Proficiency-format items exclusively assess language proficiency, which could be subsumed under behavioral acculturation/enculturation; these items ask participants to rate their competence in language skills and abilities. An example language proficiency-format item is, “How well do you speak the language of your own Asian culture of origin?” (AAMAS; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0011000012456882">Gim Chung et al., 2004</xref>). Endorsement-format items often measure acculturation/enculturation across the dimensions of values, behaviors, and cultural identity; these items ask participants to rate their level of agreement with each statement, level of enjoyment of some behaviors, or the degree of similarity between their cultural experiences and that of people from similar ethnic backgrounds. An example endorsement-format item is, “I enjoy reading in an Asian language (e.g., books)” (ARSMA-II-AA; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0011000012456882">Lee et al., 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>Importantly, in a sample of Asian American college students, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0011000012456882">Kang (2006)</xref> found that item format influenced the linearity of the acculturation/enculturation measurement model. When acculturation and enculturation across various dimensions were measured exclusively by endorsement-format items, the correlation between acculturation and enculturation was small (<italic>r</italic> = −.13), suggesting some level of orthogonality consistent with a bilinear model. However, when acculturation/enculturation were measured exclusively by frequency- and language proficiency-format items, the correlation between acculturation and enculturation was large (<italic>r</italic> = −.60), raising questions about the orthogonality assumption of a bilinear model. These findings were also supported by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0011000012456882">Kang’s (2006)</xref> review of correlations between acculturation and enculturation across eight instruments. In sum, these findings suggest that item format may influence the observed linearity of data produced by acculturation and enculturation measures. Thus, attention to item format is important in evaluating the linearity and dimensionality of existing measures.</p>

<title>Present Study</title>
<p>This study aimed to evaluate the dimensions of Asian American acculturation and enculturation assessed across existing measures of these constructs. To this end, we reviewed existing measures of acculturation and enculturation to identify a set of measures that aimed to capture extant conceptualizations of these constructs with Asian American populations. In light of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0011000012456882">Kang’s (2006)</xref> findings, we also attended to balance in terms of item format variability. We employed exploratory factor analyses (EFA) to examine the extent to which the dimensions that emerged from existing measures aligned with the hypothesized four dimensions of behaviors, values, knowledge, and cultural identity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0011000012456882">Kim &amp; Abreu, 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>In addition, we explored validity evidence for the emergent factors by examining their correlations with several indicators. We used participants’ age as a discriminant validity indicator, as age was found in prior studies to be uncorrelated with acculturation and enculturation (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0011000012456882">Gutierrez, Franco, Gilmore Powell, Peterson, &amp; Reid, 2009</xref>). Conceptually, the distinctiveness of age from acculturation and enculturation is reasonable because, by definition, acculturation and enculturation are related to level of exposure to U.S. and Asian cultures and level of exposure may be independent of purely developmental processes (e.g., an older Asian American adult who has lived in the United States since a young age may be similarly acculturated as a younger Asian American adult who was born in the United States).</p>
<p>In addition, we examined associations with total number of years lived in the United States, total number of years formally educated in the United States, generational status (first generation to immigrate or second generation and beyond), whether participants were born in the United States (yes or no), and whether English was their first language (yes or no). Such variables have been found to correlate positively with acculturation and negatively with enculturation and are sometimes used as proxies for acculturation and enculturation (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0011000012456882">Tsai, Ying, &amp; Lee, 2000</xref>). Thus, we expected that total number of years lived and educated in the United States would be correlated positively with acculturation and negatively with enculturation. We also expected that participants who self-identified as the first generation to immigrate would have lower acculturation and higher enculturation scores than those who self-identified as second generation and beyond, that participants who were born in the United States would have higher acculturation and lower enculturation scores than those who were not born in the United States, and that participants whose first language was English would have higher acculturation and lower enculturation scores than those whose first language was not English.</p>

<title>Participants</title>
<p>Data from 275 Asian/Asian American participants residing in the United States were analyzed in the present study. Participants ranged in age from 18 to 75 years old (<italic>M</italic> = 27.49, <italic>SD</italic> = 8.33, <italic>Mdn</italic> = 25.00). About 63.6% of the sample identified as woman, 22.9% as men, and 13.5% did not indicate their gender. In terms of sexual orientation, 67.6% of the sample identified as exclusively heterosexual, 10.2% as mostly heterosexual, 6.2% as bisexual, 1.5% as mostly lesbian or gay, 1.1% as exclusively lesbian or gay, and 13.5% did not indicate their sexual orientation. Participants’ reports of their highest educational degree indicated that 34.2% of the sample had a professional or graduate degree, 23.3% had a college degree, 11.3% had some professional or graduate education, 10.2% had some college or technical school education, 8.0% had a high school degree, and 13.1% did not indicate the highest education they have completed. In terms of socioeconomic status, we used categories following a prior study with Asian American individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0011000012456882">Shen, 2009</xref>) to assess participants’ qualitative experiences of their socioeconomic statuses: 34.5% of the sample indicated that “we could always make ends meet and had enough money,” 31.6% indicated “most of the time, we could make ends meet and had enough money,” 13.5% indicated “sometimes we were able to make ends meet and had enough money,” 6.2% indicated “quite often, we could not make ends meet and were short of money,” 0.4% indicated “we could never make ends meet and were always short of money,” and 13.8% did not indicate their socioeconomic status. Participants reported residing in 26 out of the 50 United States, with most residing in California (26.2%) or Florida (21.8%).</p>
<p>In terms of ethnicity, participants identified themselves as Chinese (28%), Taiwanese (17.1%), Korean (8.0%), Japanese (6.2%), Vietnamese (6.2%), Asian with more than one ethnic/racial background (5.5%), Filipino (3.6%), Asian Indian (3.3%), Thai (2.9%), other (2.2%), Hmong (1.1%), Malaysian (1.1%), Cambodian (0.7%), Nepali (0.7%), Singaporean (0.7%), and 12.7% did not indicate their ethnicity. Moreover, a plurality of participants identified their first language as English (29.1%) or Chinese or Mandarin (22.9%), and the remaining participants identified Korean (5.8%), Cantonese (5.1%), Vietnamese (4.7%), Japanese (3.3%), Thai (2.5%), Taiwanese (1.8%), Hmong (1.1%), Khmer (0.7%), Nepali (0.7%), Tagalog (0.7%), Tamil (0.7%), other (7.6%), or unknown (13.5%) languages. In terms of the first generation of their family to move to the United States, 25.8% of the sample reported that they alone were the first generation to move to the United States, 16.4% reported themselves and their parents, 32.7% reported their parents, 6.9% reported their grandparents, 3.6% reported their great-grandparents and beyond, and 14.5% did not report the first generation of their family to move to the United States. Approximately 38.9% of the sample was born in the United States. For the participants who were not born in the United States, their mean number of years lived in the United States was 11.17 (<italic>SD</italic> = 10.06). The mean number of years that the participants were educated in the United States was 11.13 (<italic>SD</italic> = 8.63).</p>

<title>Procedures</title>
<p>Participants were recruited via online resources such as electronic mail and listserves, discussion boards, student organizations at universities and colleges, and virtual communities for Asian and Asian American individuals. Recruitment notices invited individuals to participate in a study of the experiences of Asian and Asian American individuals in the United States. Participants were directed to an online survey that was made available through an Internet site hosted by SurveyMonkey. The survey began with an informed consent page that reiterated the purpose of the study, outlined the inclusion criteria for the study, stated the confidentiality and anonymity of responses, indicated institutional review board (IRB) approval, and provided contact information for the researchers and IRB, should the participants have any questions about the study. No compensation was offered. To participate in the study, respondents had to first affirm that they (1) were 18 years of age or older, (2) resided in the United States, and (3) were of Asian descent or background. If respondents affirmed that they met these inclusion criteria and agreed to participate after reading the informed consent, they were connected to the survey.</p>
<p>A total of 503 entries were submitted. To prepare the data for analyses, data were screened and incomplete entries (i.e., missing more than 50% of the total number of items excluding demographic items) or entries missing more than 20% of items on the acculturation and enculturation measures (the primary measures of interest) were removed from analyses (the 20% criterion falls within the tolerance range studied or recommended by prior researchers; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0011000012456882">Dodeen, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0011000012456882">Parent, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0011000012456882">Schlomer, Bauman, &amp; Card, 2010</xref>). Additionally, two validity questions asking participants to mark a particular response (e.g., please choose the response “disagree”) were included in the survey to check that participants were responding attentively and not randomly. If participants responded incorrectly to either validity check item, their data were screened to determine if the rest of their responses suggested random responding. Based on these procedures, 224 entries were removed for missing more than 50% of responses on the entire survey; some of these incomplete entries may have been from individuals who responded to a few items to “check out” the survey and then returned to complete the survey at a later time, but this possibility cannot be tested due to the anonymity of the survey responses. An additional three participants were removed for missing more than 20% of items on the acculturation and enculturation measures, and one additional participant was removed because he answered both validity questions incorrectly and the rest of his answers suggested random responding. These procedures resulted in 275 participants for analyses.</p>

<title>Dimension of values acculturation and enculturation</title>
<p>As described previously, existing acculturation and enculturation measures did not assess the values dimension substantively. Thus, we selected two measures, namely the Asian Values Scale–Revised (AVS-R; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0011000012456882">Kim &amp; Hong, 2004</xref>) and the European American Values Scale for Asian Americans–Revised (EAVS-AA-R; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0011000012456882">Hong et al., 2005</xref>) designed specifically to assess the hypothesized values dimension of Asian American enculturation and acculturation, respectively.</p>
<p>The AVS-R is a 25-item self-report measure based on the original 36-item Asian Values Scale (AVS; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0011000012456882">Kim et al., 1999</xref>). The AVS-R is designed to assess Asian American individuals’ endorsement of Asian cultural values of “collectivism, conformity to norms, deference to authority figures, emotional restraint, filial piety, hierarchical family structure, and humility” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0011000012456882">Kim &amp; Hong, 2004</xref>, p. 19). The measure asks participants to rate on a 4-point scale (1 = <italic>strongly disagree</italic> to 4 = <italic>strongly agree</italic>) items such as “one should consider the needs of others before considering one’s own needs” and “educational and career achievements need not be one’s top priority.” Appropriate items are reverse coded and item ratings are averaged to yield an overall score, with higher scores indicating greater adherence to Asian cultural values. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0011000012456882">Kim and Hong (2004)</xref> used Rasch model analyses to improve the psychometric properties of the AVS. Notably, they found statistical support for a 4-point instead of the original 7-point scale for the AVS-R, determined that AVS-R items adequately distinguished individuals at the low and high ends of the Asian values continuum, and removed items that were redundant or lacked construct homogeneity. The revised measure yielded a unidimensional structure with a person separation reliability of .80 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0011000012456882">Kim &amp; Hong, 2004</xref>). AVS-R scores were highly correlated with scores on the original AVS (<italic>r</italic> = .93, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001), supporting the convergent validity of the revised scale (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0011000012456882">Kim &amp; Hong, 2004</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0011000012456882">Iwamoto and Liu (2010)</xref> reported a Cronbach’s alpha of .73 with a sample of Asian American and Asian international individuals, while <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0011000012456882">Miller et al. (2011)</xref> reported a Cronbach’s alpha of .77 with a sample of Asian American undergraduate and graduate students. For this study, AVS-R items yielded a Cronbach’s alpha of .80.</p>
<p>The EAVS-AA-R is a 25-item self-report measure that is an extension of the original European American Values Scale for Asian Americans (EAVS-AA; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-0011000012456882">Wolfe, Yang, Wong, &amp; Atkinson, 2001</xref>). The EAVS-AA-R is designed to assess Asian American individuals’ endorsement of European American cultural values in areas such as childrearing practices, marital behavior, autonomy, and sexual freedom. Items such as “you can do anything you put your mind to” and “a student does not always need to follow the teacher’s instructions” are rated on a 4-point continuum (1 = <italic>strongly disagree</italic> to 4 = <italic>strongly agree</italic>). Appropriate items are reverse coded and item ratings are averaged to yield an overall score, with higher scores indicating greater adherence to European American cultural values. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0011000012456882">Hong et al. (2005)</xref> used Rasch model analyses to improve the psychometric properties of the EAVS-AA because the original instrument had low reliability, unclear factor structure, and items not reflecting the full range of the European American values construct. The revised measure yielded a unidimensional structure with a person separation reliability of .78 and Cronbach’s alpha of .77 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0011000012456882">Hong et al., 2005</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0011000012456882">Iwamoto and Liu (2010)</xref> found Cronbach’s alphas of .64 and .65 for samples of Asian American and European American individuals, respectively, while <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0011000012456882">Miller et al.

<title>Item selection for dimensions of behaviors, cultural identity, and knowledge acculturation and enculturation</title>
<p>We took several steps to select a pool of items to reflect the posited behaviors, cultural identity, and knowledge dimensions of Asian American acculturation and enculturation. As a first step, we reviewed the item content of existing measures that were designed to assess acculturation and enculturation specifically with Asian and Asian American populations. We reviewed these items for clarity and tracked the number of items that reflected behaviors, values, knowledge, and cultural identity dimensions. Based on this review, we selected for inclusion all 15 “culture of origin” and 15 “European American” items from the Asian American Multidimensional Acculturation Scale (AAMAS; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0011000012456882">Gim Chung et al., 2004</xref>). We also included all 17 “Asian orientation” and 13 “Western orientation” items from the Acculturation Rating Scale for Mexican Americans–II modified for use with Asian Americans (ARSMA-II-AA; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0011000012456882">Lee et al., 2006</xref>). In addition, we selected 11 of 39 items from the abridged version of General Ethnicity Questionnaire–Chinese (GEQC; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0011000012456882">Tsai et al., 2000</xref>) and 11 of 38 items from the abridged version of General Ethnicity Questionnaire–American (GEQA; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0011000012456882">Tsai et al., 2000</xref>) that reflected unique item content beyond AAMAS and ARSMA-II-AA items.</p>
<p>In the second step, we reviewed the content of acculturation and enculturation measures designed for use across multiple populations and selected additional items that reflected unique content beyond the items from the aforementioned Asian and Asian American–specific measures. In our review of these measures, when there was content redundancy across items, we selected the most clearly stated item. Based on this process, we selected six “U.S. American” and six “culture-of-origin” items from Abbreviated Multidimensional Acculturation Scale (AMAS-ZABB; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-0011000012456882">Zea et al., 2003</xref>) and three “ethnic society immersion” and three “dominant society immersion” items from Stephenson Multigroup Acculturation Scale (SMAS; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0011000012456882">Stephenson, 2000</xref>).</p>
<p>As a third step, we again reviewed the item pool for item clarity, parallel content across acculturation and enculturation dimensions, and item format (i.e., endorsement, frequency, language proficiency). Based on this review, we made some refinements to the item pool, working to focus our modifications on these issues rather than on changing the substance of the items given our aim to examine the structure of constructs assessed in existing measures. Specifically, to maintain clarity and consistency in item wording and rating scale, items that were originally stated as questions were restated as statements (e.g., “How much do you feel you have in common with people from your own Asian culture of origin?” was modified to “I feel I have a lot in common with people from the same heritage culture as myself”), and all items were rated on a 4-point scale of level of agreement (1 = <italic>strongly disagree</italic> to 4 = <italic>strongly agree</italic>); this scale was selected on the basis of evidence of the precision of such a scale relative to a 7-point scale in assessing cultural values in Asian American samples (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0011000012456882">Hong et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0011000012456882">Kim &amp; Hong, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>We also made item modifications to clarify endorsement, frequency, and language proficiency formats and to ensure coverage across these response formats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0011000012456882">Kang, 2006</xref>). For instance, “I speak English” from ARSMA-II-AA was clarified to become a frequency-format item “I often speak English” because a parallel language proficiency-format item “I speak English well” was included from AAMAS, and an endorsement-format item “I enjoy speaking English” was created as a parallel acculturation item to the existing ARSMA-II-AA enculturation item “I enjoy speaking the language of my heritage culture.” These modifications also resolved cases where the original measures’ rating scale was confusing and conflated multiple item formats (e.g., an AAMAS item “How much do you practice the traditions and keep the holidays of [mainstream culture/Asian culture]?” rated on the scale of 1 = <italic>not very well</italic> to 6 = <italic>very well</italic>). In addition, three items were created to increase the proportion of items assessing the knowledge dimension in the areas of norms and customs, holidays, and literature (i.e., “I know social norms and customs of my heritage cultural group well,” “I know holidays celebrated by mainstream Americans well,” and “I know literature from my heritage cultural group well”). As well, for two items, we created parallels so that items existed for both the acculturation and enculturation subscales (e.g., “my family often cooks foods from mainstream America” was added as a parallel item to an existing item, “my family often cooks foods from my heritage culture”).</p>
<p>In addition, we noted variability in the descriptions of the dominant culture of reference across measures of acculturation, with terminology such as “White mainstream culture” (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0011000012456882">Gim Chung et al., 2004</xref>), “Caucasian” (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0011000012456882">Lee et al., 2006</xref>), “Anglo American” (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0011000012456882">Stephenson, 2000</xref>), “American” (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0011000012456882">Tsai et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-0011000012456882">Zea et al., 2003</xref>), and “mainstream American” (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0011000012456882">Ryder et al., 2000</xref>) used to specify the culture of reference. In our effort to select a consistent term, we considered that these terms were not completely interchangeable (e.g., not all American things and people are White or Anglo, not all Caucasian individuals are perceived or identify as White) and the lack of consistency in the meaning of these descriptors seemed particularly confusing in some contexts. For example, we thought that an item such as “I know how to prepare Caucasian food” would be confusing in that the cuisine of the Caucus regions is not mainstream American food; we considered that items on knowledge about White history, music, celebrities, and so forth might unnecessarily exclude salient aspects of dominant U.S. culture (e.g., civil rights movement, hip hop, Jennifer Lopez); we thought that cultural identity items asking the extent to which Asian and Asian American respondents identify as White, Caucasian, or Anglo American would be confusing and obfuscate the point of assessing identification as American. By contrast, we thought that the terms <italic>mainstream America</italic> or <italic>Americans</italic> could capture the intended meaning of assessing U.S. acculturation without unnecessarily narrowing the scope of this culture to a single racial or ethnic group. Thus, we chose to use the terms <italic>mainstream America</italic> or <italic>Americans</italic> to describe the dominant culture or cultural groups in the United States, and we clarified this intended meaning in the survey instructions.</p>
<p>As the final step in the review process, we submitted the items to several consultants. Specifically, we asked three consultants who self-identified as Asian American or as an Asian person living in the United States, two of whom had conducted research with Asian persons in the United States, to provide feedback regarding item clarity, measure length, and relevance of items to their personal experiences. Based on consultant feedback, we deleted two confusing items, “Compared to how much I negatively criticize other cultures, I criticize American culture less” from the GEQA and its parallel item “Compared to how much I negatively criticize other cultures, I criticize my heritage culture less” from the GEQC. We also modified the wording of an item from ARSMA-II-AA (i.e., “My contact with the USA has been [‘not a lot’ to ‘extremely often’]” was replaced with “I feel connected with mainstream American culture”), and its parallel enculturation item (i.e., “My contact with an Asian country has been [‘not a lot’ to ‘extremely often’]” was replaced with “I feel connected with my heritage culture”) to capture the consultants’ interpretation of these items and increase their applicability to Asian and Asian American persons.</p>
<p>In sum, the pool of items that captured the dimensions of behaviors, cultural identity, and knowledge was comprised of 52 acculturation and 56 enculturation items (the four additional enculturation items were from the ARSMA-II-AA and did not seem to assess enculturation directly and rather assessed parents’ and participants’ self-identification; these items were retained for the sake of completeness and further empirical evaluation). Sample items include “I often speak the language of my heritage culture,” “I know popular mainstream American television shows well,” and “I like to interact and associate with people from the same heritage culture as myself.” Including the 25 AVS-R and 25 EAVS-AA-R items, the final item pool consisted of 77 acculturation and 81 enculturation items that reflected the four dimensions of behaviors, values, knowledge, and cultural identity.</p>

<title>Demographic and background variables</title>
<p>In addition to the instruments above, participants were asked to report their demographic characteristics (e.g., gender, age, sexual orientation). They also provided data on a number of background variables used as convergent validity indicators. Specifically, they responded to the following questions: “How long have you lived in the U.S.?” with an open-ended response to report years and months; “How long were you formally educated in the U.S.?” with an open-ended response to report years and months; “Were you born in the U.S.?” with the response options of yes or no; “Is English your first language?” with the response options of yes or no; and “Who was the first generation in your family to move to the U.S.?” with the response options: you alone, you and your parents/family, your parents, your grandparents, your great-grandparents [your parents’ grandparents and beyond]); the first two categories of generation status were coded as first generation and the remaining categories were coded as second generation and beyond.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>Several guidelines in the literature indicated that the sample size of 275 was sufficient for obtaining stable factor solutions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0011000012456882">Tabachnick &amp; Fidell, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-0011000012456882">Worthington &amp; Whittaker, 2006</xref>) as (a) communalities were generally higher than .50, (b) items per factor ratios were greater than 10:1 (16:1 for acculturation and 14:1 for enculturation subscales), and (c) participant-to-item ratios were greater than 3:1 (about 6:1 for both acculturation and enculturation subscales). In terms of missing data, as stated previously, all retained cases were missing 20% or less of acculturation items (including items from EAVS-AA-R) and 20% or less of enculturation items (including items from AVS-R). NORM software (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0011000012456882">Schafer &amp; Graham, 2002</xref>) was used to impute these item-level missing data from Expectation Maximization parameters.</p>
<sec id="section15-0011000012456882">
<title>Item Screening</title>
<p>To ensure meaningful factor solutions, an important preliminary step prior to factor analysis is to identify and exclude items that correlate with very few other items (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0011000012456882">Field, 2009</xref>). Following procedures outlined in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0011000012456882">Field (2009)</xref>, we examined the inter-item correlations for (a) all acculturation items (including AVS-R items) and (b) all enculturation items (including EAVS-AA-R items) in order to identify items that were minimally related to other items. In each item set, we eliminated items that had 10 or fewer inter-item correlations of more than .30; this was a fairly conservative decision rule for screening the intercorrelations of 77 acculturation items and 81 enculturation items. Based on this criterion, one AAMAS and three GEQ acculturation items as well as three AAMAS, five ARSMA-II-AA, and five GEQ enculturation items were eliminated (these included the three previously mentioned ARSMA-II-AA enculturation items that seemed to assess parents’ and participants’ self-identification rather than enculturation directly). We also found that AVS-R items were correlated minimally (i.e., <italic>r</italic> ≤ .30; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0011000012456882">Tabachnick &amp; Fidell, 2007</xref>) with the larger set of enculturation items as well as with other AVS-R items and that EAVS-AA-R items were correlated minimally with the larger set of acculturation items as well as with other EAVS-AA-R items, making these items problematic for inclusion in subsequent factor analyses (<italic>r</italic>s ≤ .30 for nearly 100% of correlations between AVS-R items and non-AVS-R enculturation items, 99% of correlations between EAVS-AA-R items and non-EAVS-AA-R acculturation items, 93% of correlations within the AVS-R item set, and 94% of correlations within the EAVS-AA-R item set). These item screening steps resulted in a total of 48 acculturation and 43 enculturation items (which now excluded all values items) to be factor analyzed.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0011000012456882">1</xref></sup></p>
<p>Next, we conducted exploratory factor analyses using SPSS 17.0 to determine the dimensionality of acculturation items and enculturation items. As a first step, principle axis factor analysis (PAF) with no rotation was conducted to determine potential factor solutions for further examination and rotation. Data factorability was supported for acculturation items and enculturation items as indicated by the Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin measure of sampling adequacy values above .90 (acculturation items = .94 and enculturation items = .95) and significant Barlett’s tests of sphericity (acculturation items, <italic>χ</italic><sup><italic>2</italic></sup>[1,128, <italic>N</italic> = 275] = 1,1431.89, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001; enculturation items, <italic>χ</italic><sup><italic>2</italic></sup>[903, <italic>N</italic> = 275] = 9,788.43, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0011000012456882">Tabachnick &amp; Fidell, 2007</xref>). Factor retention was decided by examining eigenvalues; scree plots; parallel analyses following procedures described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0011000012456882">Hayton, Allen, and Scarpello (2004)</xref>; and interpretability of factors. Interpretability of factors was determined by factors’ conceptual meaningfulness, having three or more distinctive indictors, and accounting for 5% or more of total variance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0011000012456882">Tabachnick &amp; Fidell, 2007</xref>). Following <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-0011000012456882">Worthington and Whittaker’s (2006)</xref> recommendations, a factor loading of .40 and a factor loading to cross-loading discrepancy of .15 were used as criteria for items’ factor assignment.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section16-0011000012456882">
<title>Exploratory Factor Analyses</title>
<p>For the acculturation items, the PAF with no rotation produced nine factors with eigenvalues greater than one, but the scree plot suggested retention of four to five factors, and the parallel analysis suggested that six factors may be retained. Thus, the nine-, six-, five-, and four-factor solutions were explored using promax rotation to accommodate potential factor intercorrelations. The nine-factor solution was rejected as no item loaded clearly on the ninth factor. The six-, five-, and four-factor solutions each yielded one factor with only two items and many items had indistinctive loadings across factors (i.e., factor loadings and cross-loading discrepancies of less than .15; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-0011000012456882">Worthington &amp; Whittaker, 2006</xref>) and one or more factors that accounted for notably less than 5% (i.e., between 2.0% to 3.1%) of variance. The three-factor solution accounted for 54.56% of the total variance, with the third factor accounting for 5.11% of variance; this three-factor solution was also interpretable within the dimensions of behavior, knowledge, and cultural identity for Asian American acculturation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0011000012456882">Kim &amp; Abreu, 2001</xref>). The three-factor solution reflected (1) Language-related Behavior accounting for 40.85% of variance, (2) Pride and Cultural Group Association accounting for an additional 8.60% of variance, and (3) Cultural and Sociopolitical Knowledge accounting for an additional 5.11% of variance in the data. Loadings and cross-loadings from the pattern matrix for the items on these three emergent factors along with factor intercorrelations are reported in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0011000012456882">Table 1</xref>.</p>

<p>For the enculturation items, the PAF with no rotation produced seven factors with eigenvalues greater than one, but the scree plot suggested retention of three to five factors, and the parallel analysis suggested that five factors may be retained. Thus, the seven-, six-, five-, four-, and three-factor solutions were explored further; promax rotation was used to accommodate potential factor intercorrelations. The seven- and six-factor solutions each yielded a factor with only one or two items, and many items had indistinctive loadings across factors (i.e., factor loadings and cross-loading discrepancies of less than .15; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-0011000012456882">Worthington &amp; Whittaker, 2006</xref>). Of the remaining solutions, the five- and four-factor solutions each yielded one or more factors that accounted for less than 3% of variance. Examination of the three-factor solution revealed a third factor that accounted for 4.59% of variance, which approximated our 5% interpretability criterion. The three-factor solution (accounting for 54.04% of the variance) was also found to be the most interpretable based on <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0011000012456882">Kim and Abreu’s (2001)</xref> proposed dimensions of behaviors, knowledge, and cultural identity for Asian American enculturation. The three-factor solution reflected (1) Language-related Behavior accounting for 41.70% of variance; (2) Cultural and Sociopolitical Knowledge accounting for an additional 7.75% of variance, and (3) Pride and Cultural Group Association accounting for an additional 4.59% of variance in the data. Loadings and cross-loadings from the pattern matrix for the items on these three emergent factors along with factor intercorrelations are reported in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0011000012456882">Table 2</xref>.</p>

<title>Validity Evidence</title>
<p>To evaluate validity evidence for the acculturation and enculturation factors, we computed mean scores for acculturation and enculturation subscales (i.e., Language-related Behavior, Cultural and Sociopolitical Knowledge, and Pride and Cultural Group Association) by averaging ratings of items that met the factor loading criterion of .40 and the factor loading to cross-loading discrepancy criterion of .15; for acculturation and enculturation full scale scores, we averaged ratings of all the items that met these factor loading and cross-loading criteria. We computed zero-order correlations of acculturation and enculturation subscale and full scale scores with continuous variables (e.g., age). For dichotomous variables (e.g., born in the U.S.), we computed point-biserial correlations and univariate and multivariate analyses of variance (MANOVA). For exploratory purposes, we also examined correlations of the acculturation and enculturation dimensions with AVS-R and EAVS-AA-R scores. Effect sizes were interpreted as small (<italic>r</italic> = |.10| or <italic>η</italic><sup><italic>2</italic></sup> = .01), medium (<italic>r</italic> = |.30| or <italic>η</italic><sup><italic>2</italic></sup> = .06), and large (<italic>r</italic> = |.50| or <italic>η</italic><sup><italic>2</italic></sup> = .14) following benchmarks summarized by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0011000012456882">Cohen (1992)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0011000012456882">Sink and Stroh (2006)</xref>.</p>
<p>Correlations are reported in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0011000012456882">Table 3</xref>. For acculturation items, validity was supported in that all acculturation full scale and subscale scores were correlated positively with participants’ total number of years lived in the United States and with total number of years formally educated in the United States. For each of the dichotomous background variables, MANOVAs with the set of acculturation subscales as dependent variables also yielded significant overall effects for generation status, <italic>F</italic>(3, 231) = 19.42, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001, <italic>η</italic><sup><italic>2</italic></sup> = .20, whether participants were born in the United States, <italic>F</italic>(3, 233) = 19.50, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001, <italic>η</italic><sup><italic>2</italic></sup> = .20, and whether English was their first language, <italic>F</italic>(3, 234) = 19.72, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001, <italic>η</italic><sup><italic>2</italic></sup> = .20. Follow-up univariate analyses are reported in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0011000012456882">Table 4</xref> and yielded the expected pattern of group differences: Participants who self-identified as the first generation to immigrate had lower acculturation scores than those who self-identified as second generation and beyond; participants who were born in the United States had higher acculturation scores than those who were not born in the United States; and participants whose first language was English had higher acculturation scores than those whose first language was not English. The overall pattern of correlations and partial eta squares suggested mostly medium to large effect sizes (<italic>r</italic> = |.29| to |.60|, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01; <italic>η</italic><sup><italic>2</italic></sup> = .08 to .19). Discriminant validity was supported in that acculturation full scale and subscale scores were uncorrelated with age (<italic>r</italic> = |.00| to |.08|, <italic>p</italic> &gt; .05). Although acculturation full scale and subscale scores were correlated positively with EAVS-AA-R full scale scores, the effect sizes were small to medium (<italic>r</italic> = |.20| to |.42|, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01), suggesting some orthogonality between behaviors, knowledge, and cultural identity acculturation and the values dimension.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>This study contributes to theory, research, and clinical application related to acculturation and enculturation for Asian and Asian American persons by evaluating the posited bilinear and multidimensional aspects of acculturation and enculturation as reflected in extant measures of these constructs. The results offer preliminary evidence that existing measures assess multiple dimensions of acculturation and enculturation that reflect Language-related Behavior, Cultural and Sociopolitical Knowledge, and Pride and Cultural Group Association. These findings also suggest the promise for consolidating existing measures into a bilinear multidimensional measure of Asian American acculturation and enculturation.</p>
<sec id="section19-0011000012456882">
<title>Dimensions of Acculturation and Enculturation</title>
<p>The present findings suggest that the content of existing measures of acculturation and enculturation corresponds with three out of the four dimensions described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0011000012456882">Kim and Abreu (2001)</xref>. Specifically, exploratory factor analyses of the acculturation and enculturation data yielded three factors each that approximated the dimensions of behaviors, knowledge, and cultural identity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0011000012456882">Kim &amp; Abreu, 2001</xref>). However, it appeared that values may be a correlated but separate construct from these acculturation and enculturation dimensions. First, the magnitude of interitem correlations showed that values items were correlated minimally (<italic>r</italic> ≤ .30) within their own item sets and with other acculturation and enculturation items. Second, the magnitude of correlations between AVS-R scores and enculturation full scale and subscale scores (<italic>r</italic> = .09 to .26) and those between EAVS-AA-R scores and acculturation full scale and subscale scores (<italic>r</italic> = .20 to .42) were small to medium. These correlations of values with acculturation and enculturation dimensions were also generally smaller than the magnitude of correlations among the acculturation dimensions (<italic>r</italic> = .49 to .66) and among the enculturation dimensions (<italic>r</italic> = .48 to .72). This pattern suggests that the behaviors, knowledge, and cultural identity dimensions of acculturation and enculturation, as assessed in existing measures, are more closely aligned with one another than with values.</p>
<p>This interpretation is consistent with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0011000012456882">Miller’s (2010)</xref> finding of a substantial amount of unexplained variance (at least 86%) in the relations of behavioral acculturation and enculturation with Asian and European American values and with Kim et al.’s (1999) findings of a small and positive correlation (<italic>r</italic> = .15) between Asian values and Asian behavior enculturation. One reason for these findings may be a posited difference in the process of values and behaviors adoption (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0011000012456882">Kim et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0011000012456882">LaFromboise et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0011000012456882">Szapocznik &amp; Kurtines, 1980</xref>). For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0011000012456882">Sodowsky, Kwan, and Pannu (1995)</xref> suggested that Asian American individuals may keep their Asian values indefinitely while adopting the behaviors of U.S. culture fairly quickly. As such, the adoption or retention of values may be somewhat independent of the acculturation and enculturation processes for Asian and Asian American individuals. While our data are consistent with such a distinction, it is important to note that they do not suggest that values are not important or that values measures should not be used alongside measures of behavioral, knowledge, and cultural identity acculturation and enculturation. In fact, the empirical distinctiveness of values from these other dimensions suggests that values might offer unique information above and beyond behaviors, knowledge, and cultural identity. A question for future theoretical and measurement refinement is whether values, at least as currently operationalized, are so distinctive from acculturation and enculturation dimensions as to be considered correlated with but outside of the acculturation and enculturation framework.</p>
<p>In addition to these conceptual interpretations, it is important to consider the development and psychometric properties of the two measures of values used frequently with Asian American individuals. The AVS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0011000012456882">Kim et al., 1999</xref>) was originally conceptualized to be a multidimensional measure that assesses dimensions of Asian values such as conformity to norms, emotional self-control, collectivism, humility, and filial piety. However, the low coefficient alphas obtained for these six factors in the AVS led its authors to suggest using the AVS total score to assess adherence to Asian values, and subsequently Rasch model analyses were used to develop the AVS-R as a unidimensional measure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0011000012456882">Kim &amp; Hong, 2004</xref>). Similarly, recent studies have found reliability problems with the EAVS-AA-R. Specifically, in studies since the instrument development study, Cronbach’s alphas for EAVS-AA-R items have ranged from .60 to .67 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0011000012456882">Iwamoto &amp; Liu, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0011000012456882">Kim &amp; Omizo, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0011000012456882">Miller et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0011000012456882">Omizo, Kim, &amp; Abel, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0011000012456882">Park &amp; Kim, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-0011000012456882">Wang &amp; Kim, 2010</xref>). Consistent with these low alphas, the alpha for the EAVS-AA-R was also found to be fairly low in the present study (.71). In addition, the item content of the EAVS-AA-R seems to focus on women’s roles (5 out of 25 items) and marital and sexual relationships (6 out of 25 items); therefore, it is unclear if these items adequately capture U.S. values for Asian American individuals. Any interpretation of the association of values with acculturation and enculturation dimensions must be made with these limitations in mind, and further construct clarification and instrument refinement might be needed in the values domain.</p>
<p>Beyond the pattern of associations with the values dimensions, the relations among acculturation and enculturation dimensions were consistent with a bilinear and multidimensional conceptualization. For example, the correlation between total acculturation and enculturation scores was –.49, suggesting that the shared variance between these variables is not so high as to indicate that they are opposite ends of a single construct continuum (i.e., unilinear). Furthermore, the magnitude of intercorrelations for acculturation subscales (<italic>r</italic> = .48 to .72) and those for enculturation subscales (<italic>r</italic> = .49 to .66) was generally stronger than the correlations across corresponding acculturation and enculturation factors (<italic>r</italic> = −.58 for Language-related Behavior, <italic>r</italic> = −.18 for Cultural and Sociopolitical Knowledge, and <italic>r</italic> = −.22 for Pride and Cultural Group Association), again challenging a unilinear conceptualization of these dimensions. While prior research on the multidimensionality and bilinearity of Asian American acculturation and enculturation has focused on the behaviors and values dimensions (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0011000012456882">Miller, 2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0011000012456882">2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0011000012456882">Miller et al., 2011</xref>), the present factor analyses and subscale intercorrelations offer support for the bilinearity of multiple factors approximating the behaviors, knowledge, and cultural identity dimensions.</p>
<p>The pattern of relations of acculturation and enculturation dimensions with the background variables also provides evidence of validity for the factors that emerged in the present study. Specifically, similar to the findings of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0011000012456882">Tsai et al. (2000)</xref>, convergent validity was supported in that background variables such as generational status and length of residence in the United States were associated positively with acculturation dimensions and negatively with enculturation dimensions. Likewise, similar to the findings by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0011000012456882">Gutierrez et al. (2009)</xref>, discriminant validity was supported in that age was uncorrelated with acculturation and enculturation full scale and subscale scores. These patterns provide preliminary support for the construct validity of the acculturation and enculturation dimensions captured in existing measures. Future research is needed, however, to examine whether the behaviors, knowledge, and cultural identity dimensions of acculturation and enculturation yield unique concurrent or predictive relations with other criterion variables (e.g., mental health indicators, psychosocial functioning indicators such as family conflict, counseling process and outcome variables such as attitudes toward help-seeking). Evidence of distinct relations can support the utility of a multidimensional model over a unidimensional one.</p>
<p>In addition to the issue of dimensionality, the present study attended to item format variability—that is, the extent to which acculturation and enculturation items reflected frequency, language proficiency, and endorsement formats. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0011000012456882">Kang (2006)</xref> found that orthogonality between acculturation and enculturation was shown when items reflected an exclusively endorsement format, whereas orthogonality was not supported when items reflected only frequency or language proficiency formats, or a mixture of all three formats. The present study found a pattern consistent with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0011000012456882">Kang’s (2006)</xref> findings. Specifically, most frequency- and language proficiency-format items were found in the behaviors dimension factor named “Language-related Behavior” as compared to the other factors that parallel knowledge and cultural identity dimensions. This may result in the larger correlation between behavioral acculturation and behavioral enculturation (<italic>r</italic> = −.58), as compared to that between knowledge acculturation and enculturation (<italic>r</italic> = −.18) and that between cultural identity acculturation and enculturation (<italic>r</italic> = −.22). As the behavioral factors accounted for the largest amount of variance in the factor analyses of acculturation and enculturation data, this may explain the medium correlation (<italic>r</italic> = −.49) between the full scale scores of acculturation and enculturation. Thus, item format may influence the interpretation of relations between acculturation and enculturation within dimensions.</p>
<p>It is important to consider, however, that the influence of item format on orthogonality and the concentration of frequency items in the behaviors dimensions of acculturation and enculturation may be conceptually meaningful. That is, greater frequency of engaging in some behaviors (e.g., speaking English) necessarily means lower frequency of engaging in other behaviors (e.g., speaking Mandarin Chinese); by contrast, knowledge of or identification with one culture does not necessarily require less knowledge of or identification with another culture. Thus, the present analysis of extant measures underscores the importance of attending to item format, from both a methodological and a conceptual stance, when interpreting the level of orthogonality between acculturation and enculturation.</p>

<sec id="section20-0011000012456882">
<title>Limitations and Implications for Research and Practice</title>
<p>The present findings should be interpreted in light of a number of limitations and directions for future research. First, despite the strengths of Internet recruitment in accessing large numbers of potential participants, an age diverse sample, and diversity in residence location (including locations with large or small Asian American communities), Internet samples limit participation to individuals who have computer and Internet access. As well, most of the present study’s participants reported that they were college educated, financially comfortable or affluent, and heterosexual or mostly heterosexual. Therefore, caution must be taken when generalizing the present findings to broader populations of Asian American individuals.</p>
<p>Additional considerations regarding the generalizability of the findings are also important to note. Specifically, this survey was conducted in English and therefore Asian and Asian American individuals who were not comfortable with the use of English may not be well-represented in the sample. This is particularly salient in research on acculturation given that a major dimension of acculturation assessed in extant measures is Language-related Behavior. Also, a majority of our participants were of East Asian ethnicities (i.e., Chinese, Taiwanese, Korean, Japanese), but there is a growing Southeast Asian population in the United States (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0011000012456882">Kim, 2007a</xref>). Also important to consider is potential acculturation and enculturation variability across various Asian ethnic communities, particularly those with different histories of immigration to the United States (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0011000012456882">Chang, Tracey, &amp; Moore, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0011000012456882">del Prado &amp; Church, 2010</xref>). Overall, the demographic composition of the present sample shapes the boundaries of generalizability for the results and research is needed to evaluate the replicability of these findings with Asian and Asian American individuals of diverse socioeconomic, ethnic, sexual orientation, and other backgrounds.</p>
<p>Within the context of these limitations, the present findings can inform theory, research, and practice in a number of ways. With regard to theory and research advancements, the present findings offer groundwork for developing a single bilinear multidimensional measure of acculturation and enculturation for Asian American individuals. For example, it may be useful to build on the final item sets identified in the present study by honing the existing items and developing new items to better represent the behaviors, knowledge, and cultural identity dimensions of acculturation and enculturation. Further refinement of values measures could also help to clarify whether the observed distinctiveness of the values dimension in the present study and in prior research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0011000012456882">Miller, 2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0011000012456882">2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0011000012456882">Miller et al., 2011</xref>) is a methodological artifact or a conceptually meaningful distinction to be translated into refinement of theory about the dimensions of acculturation and enculturation.</p>
<p>A parallel question that may warrant further conceptual clarification is the connection between acculturation and racial or ethnic identity attitudes. The frameworks and measures that informed the present study conceptualized cultural identity as a component of acculturation, but there is also a distinct tradition of racial and ethnic identity development models with their own multidimensional measures (for review, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0011000012456882">Fischer &amp; Moradi, 2001</xref>). Some research with Asian and Asian American populations has operationalized cultural orientation on the basis of integrating models and measures of acculturation with those for racial or ethnic identity (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0011000012456882">Chang et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0011000012456882">Chia &amp; Costigan, 2006</xref>). These studies suggest that the implications and salience of cultural orientation dimensions may differ across different subpopulations (e.g., Asian-, American-, and Asian American–identified; integrated, marginalized, or assimilated identities). This subpopulation variability adds another layer of complexity to consider in understanding acculturation and enculturation among Asian and Asian American populations. It is also noteworthy that much of the existing research and measurement of acculturation and enculturation focuses on changes in the “new” population as a result of contact with the host culture or population. However, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0011000012456882">Redfield et al.’s (1936)</xref> early articulation of acculturation delineated potential change in both cultural groups. Thus, greater attention to processes of acculturation and enculturation in the host culture and population is warranted.</p>
<p>The empirically derived multiple dimensions of acculturation and enculturation in the present study also suggest that it may be fruitful for practitioners to take an individual differences perspective, considering variability both within and between Asian American clients along each dimension and to consider how such individual differences may shape counseling content, process, and outcome. The bilinear and multidimensional nature of acculturation and enculturation is an important reminder that not all Asian and Asian American clients can be approached with the same set of expectations about their levels of acculturation and enculturation. Specifically, the present findings underscore diversity among Asian American clients in terms of language-related behavior, cultural and sociopolitical knowledge, and pride and cultural group association. This diversity suggests that counselors should be prepared to assess the multiple dimensions of acculturation and enculturation on an individual basis in order to tailor the counseling process and interventions to best accommodate their individual clients.</p>
<p>The bilinear and multidimensional nature of acculturation and enculturation also suggests that levels of language-related behavior, cultural and sociopolitical knowledge, and pride and cultural group association acculturation and enculturation may vary within an individual. For instance, a first-generation Asian American man may have high proficiency in English and Mandarin Chinese (i.e., high language-related behavior acculturation and enculturation), have a high level of knowledge of American culture but not of his heritage culture (i.e., high cultural and sociopolitical knowledge acculturation and low cultural and sociopolitical knowledge enculturation), and affiliate primarily with Asian American peers or social groups (i.e., low pride and cultural group association acculturation and high pride and cultural group association enculturation). In this example, it would be misleading to assume, based on the client’s bilingual proficiency, that he also experiences high levels of acculturation and enculturation in the other dimensions. Furthermore, such assumptions could impede the development of rapport and working alliance. The present support for a bilinear and multidimensional model of Asian American acculturation and enculturation suggests the importance of attending to intraindividual variability rather than generalizing an individual’s level of acculturation or enculturation in one dimension to the other dimensions. Understanding such nuances across different dimensions of acculturation and enculturation may help practitioners to identify the distinctive salience of acculturation or enculturation dimensions in their Asian and Asian American clients’ experiences. Ultimately, a deeper understanding of acculturation and enculturation dimensions, along with better tools for assessing these nuances, can help clinicians (and researchers) to be mindful of both cultural and individual differences within this heterogeneous population.</p>

<p>In addition to the primary analyses described in this article, for exploratory purposes, we conducted two separate EFAs, one with the set of all acculturation items (including EAVS-AA-R items) and a second with the set of all enculturation items (including AVS-R items). For the EFA of all acculturation and EAVS-AA-R items, the initial PAF produced 17 factors with eigenvalues greater than one; the scree plot suggested retention of five to seven factors. The seven-, six-, and five-factor solutions were explored with promax rotation, but were not interpretable (e.g., yielded one or more conceptually ambiguous one- to three-item factors). We also forced the four-factor solution, even though it was not suggested empirically, and found that the factor closest to “values” was made up of only five items about single motherhood and sexual freedom, which deviates from the description of Asian values as described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0011000012456882">Kim and Abreu (2001)</xref>. For the EFA of all enculturation and AVS-R items, the initial PAF produced 19 factors with eigenvalues greater than one; the scree plot suggested retention of four or five factors. The five- and four-factor solutions were explored with promax rotation, but neither solution was interpretable along the four theoretically expected factors (i.e., values, behavior, knowledge, and cultural identity); both solutions collapsed meaningful separate factors (e.g., behavior and knowledge) and yielded a non-interpretable fourth or fifth factor. In sum, analyzing the items sets with the values items did not yield the four factors described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0011000012456882">Kim and Abreu (2001)</xref>.</p>
