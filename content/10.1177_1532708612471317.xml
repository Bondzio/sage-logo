<abstract>
<p>Queer bonds conceptualize inventive and resistant modes of belonging, sociability, and relation that push at, through, and outside normative relational systems and their normative commitments. The essay juxtaposes contemporary gay suicide discourse, specifically the “It Gets Better” campaign and 2009’s <italic>Prayers for Bobby</italic> with the 1985 Molly Ringwald made-for-TV film <italic>Surviving: A Family in Crisis</italic>, examining how normative familial bonds in discourses of heterosexual suicide produce a resistant and relational discourse of brutal selfishness. Contrary to a rhetoric of selfishness, mediated representation of gay youth suicide reproduces a discursive link between gay identity and suicide that constructs gay suicide as problematically logical, sensible, and intelligible. Conceptualizing a queered rhetoric of selfishness, resisting gay suicidal logics, the essay looks to queer bonds forged in John Hughes’s ‘Brat Pack” films of otherness as maps of relational resistance and inventive articulations of non-normative modes of queer selfishness and belonging.</p>

<p>The relational turn toward queer sociality in contemporary queer theorizing has worked to examine and unpack the potentials of queer bonds. Queer bonds conceptualize relations that explore inventive and resistant modes of belonging that push at, through, and outside normative relational systems and their normative commitments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1532708612471317">Butler, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1532708612471317">Weiner &amp; Young, 2011</xref>). As an emerging discussion in queer theory, queer bonds continue the ongoing work of third wave feminists who interrogate the limitations of normative kinship systems and mine the potentials for rethinking modes of belonging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1532708612471317">Lorde, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1532708612471317">Moraga &amp; Anzaldúa, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1532708612471317">Sandoval, 2002</xref>). Central to this work are the questions: To whom are we tied (and not tied), who is scripted as “our people” (and not “our people”), where are individualizing boundaries between self and other drawn (and how are they limiting), what relations are privileged (and not privileged), and which lives are grievable (and not grievable)?</p>
<p>The essay begins with an analysis of the 1985 Molly Ringwald made-for-TV film <italic>Surviving: A Family in Crisis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1532708612471317">Hussein, 1985</xref>), examining how normative familial bonds produce a resistant and relational rhetoric of non-LGBTQ (Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, Queer) marked teen suicide as brutally selfish and senseless. This is contrasted with Lifetime’s 2009 movie <italic>Prayers for Bobby</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1532708612471317">Mulcahy, 2009/2010</xref>), wherein queer systems of belonging are obscured and normative familial belongings are strengthened <italic>through</italic> gay suicide, which is reified as both discursively sensible and <italic>not</italic> selfish. Finally, the essay turns to the 1986 John Hughes (writer) and Molly Ringwald classic, <italic>Pretty in Pink</italic> and Hughes’s 1987 follow-up, <italic>Some Kind of Wonderful</italic> (hereafter <italic>SKOW</italic>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1532708612471317">Deutch, 1987</xref>) to locate queer relational spaces produced within these films, suggesting the queer bonds of John Hughes offer resistant and inventive potentials for rethinking hierarchies of belonging.</p>
<p>Although playing in the low theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1532708612471317">Halberstam, 2011</xref>) of Molly Ringwald, John Hughes’s films, and made-for-TV movies, the argument in this article is anything but frivolous. This essay looks to popular culture to demonstrate how the rhetoric of gay teen suicide is produced in mainstream texts in qualitatively different ways from “straight” teen suicide, contrasting the selfish and senselessness of straight suicide with the naturalized discursive logic of queer suicide. Thus, while straight suicide is disciplined and critiqued, queer suicide is reified as fundamentally tied to gay identity and centrally embedded within gay narratives. This essay excavates how the privileging of normative systems of belonging produces these differing rhetorics of teen suicide, thereby foreclosing queer relational systems that potentially resist the discursive logics of queer suicide. As a corrective, John Hughes’s 80s films decenter normative systems of relation and challenge traditional hierarchies of kinship. Theorizing the queer bonds of John Hughes, specifically the relations of Andie/Duckie and Keith/Watts, <italic>Pretty in Pink</italic> and <italic>SKOW</italic> open up relational maps where discourses of belonging can be potentially queered and queer suicide discourses can be remapped as selfish and senseless.</p>
<p>The analysis performed in this article adopts the method and politics of the “pragmatic, strategic, and self-reflexive” bricoleur (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1532708612471317">Denzin &amp; Lincoln, 2005</xref>, pp. 4-6; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1532708612471317">Grossberg, Nelson, &amp; Treichler, 1992</xref>;) in which a confluence of queer media criticism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1532708612471317">Erni, 1998</xref>) and queer personal narrative/autoethnographic investigation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1532708612471317">Adams, 2011</xref>) are used alongside creative analytic practice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1532708612471317">Richardson &amp; Pierre, 2005</xref>) and fragmented construction of a “‘critical rhetoric’ narrative” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1532708612471317">Sloop, 2000</xref>) to unearth tacit logics that work to promote limited and limiting discourses of queer lives, queer belonging, and suicidal logics. As a bricolage, the theoretical argument is built through the “gathering of fragments” (p. 168), including several films, personal narratives, blogs, printed texts, Youtube videos, and pop cultural iconography.</p>
<sec id="section1-1532708612471317">
<title><italic>Surviving</italic>: Suicide and the Rhetoric of Brutal Selfishness</title>
<p><italic>Surviving: A Family in Crisis</italic> is a made-for-TV movie starring Molly Ringwald, Zach Galligan, River Phoenix, Heather O’Rourke, Marsha Mason, and Ellyn Burstyn, wherein two straight angst-ridden teens fall in love and commit suicide together. The movie’s opening hour is quintessential 1980s made-for-TV hilariousness, offering a camp buffet of melodramatic acting, silly dialogue, and overly sentimental music. However, for second half of the film, following the anticipated suicide, my audiencing position shifted away from camp. The second hour presented two families who were simply unable to cope, completely devastated, incapable of living through the tragedy. It differed from the tragic conclusions of queer sacrifice that have been common for decades (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1532708612471317">Goltz, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1532708612471317">Russo, 1987</xref>), lingering on the effects of suicide on these families—their pain, anguish, confusion, hurt, and brokenness. These families, the survivors, were constructed as victims.</p>
<p><italic>Surviving</italic> centralizes the reproductive family’s inability to cope with suicide, underscoring a narrative of belonging that differs from suicide in queer media. The movie endorsed intense anger from the family, deep betrayal, and an impassioned disciplinary argument that suicide is selfish. As one mother discovers her daughter’s lifeless body on the front lawn, the film lingers on her wailing and crying in ecstatic grief in a futile effort to revive Lonnie (Ringwald). Hollowing wails continue, as she screams, “My daughter is dead!”</p>
<p><italic>Surviving</italic> produces (straight-coded) teen suicide as selfish and cruel, specifically to family members left behind to grieve and continue living. This rhetorical indictment of suicide is minimized, if not absent, from contemporary discourses of queer suicide, most notably in the largely discussed and debated It Gets Better campaign. For suicide to be constructed as an act of selfishness, this argument is contingent on the person who commits suicide to be recognized within a system of belonging—to be in relation and beholden to another. Often attributed to the rejection of biological family and society at large, queer suicide is often framed as a desperate act of <italic>not</italic> belonging—of being beholden to none. Alongside suicidal ideation, a recurrent theme in the It Gets Better project is queer alienation—feelings of isolation, loneliness, and the belief that one is alone in the world. To be alienated is, by definition, the lack of perceived belonging.</p>
<p>In watching <italic>Surviving</italic>, the question emerged, “How might a rhetoric of selfishness provide a powerful narrative to challenge scripts of queer suicide and potentially reconstruct new forms of queer belonging. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1532708612471317">Butler (2004)</xref> examines the ways ecstasy and grief offer spaces to locate the inherent interdependence of bodies, marking the ways we are both tied to and undone by each other, as a tool for a radical politics of human belonging. This inherent interdependence not only challenges logics that permit the dehumanization and torture of others, it also argues “our” life is never fully our own to take, to hurt, or to end. In short, one’s life is never fully one’s own life, we are bound and tied to others, and suicide is the selfish undoing of others beyond the self—a view consistent with <italic>Surviving.</italic></p>
<p>Alongside <italic>Surviving</italic>’s rhetoric of selfishness is the construction of suicide as utterly senseless. Rick’s younger sister (<italic>Poltergeist’</italic>s Heather O’Rourke) wakes up screaming and crying, “why did he do it, Daddy?” This lingering question of “why” (never to be answered) is also the theme of 1988’s <italic>Permanent Record</italic>, starring Keanu Reeves. A popular male teen’s suicide (assumed straight) haunts and forever transforms his friends and family as they struggle to make sense out of the senseless. These representations of senselessness challenge tacit logics at work in gay suicide representation, begging the question, “Do we ask <italic>why</italic> when a queer teen commits suicide?” Rather, once a suicide is marked as “gay,” this demarcation tacitly answers “why?” Gayness, in discourse, has been constructed as the answer to “why?” In the dark comedy <italic>Heathers</italic>, where teen murders are restaged to look like suicides, Kurt and Ram’s murder is easily rescripted as a “repressed homosexual suicide pact” through the placement of a wine cooler and a nude male glossy. In the film <italic>Lucky Number Slevin</italic>, this device is recycled, where the murder of “Yitzak the fairy” is covered up by the standard “You do me, I do you, we’re both gay, the world doesn’t understand” scenario (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1532708612471317">Goltz, 2010</xref>, p. 51). Gay suicide, discursively, is rarely interrogated with “why” because the tragic suicidal gay script is so deeply embedded in popular culture that it no longer requires explanation or back-story for audiences to “fill in” –as the title of Rofes’ <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1532708612471317">1983</xref> book, <italic>I Thought People Like That Killed Themselves: Lesbians, Gay Men, and Suicide</italic>, works to challenge. While straight teen suicides are senseless, queer suicide is constructed in discourse as, for a lack of a better term, logical. Gay suicide, discursively, makes sense.</p>
<p><italic>Surviving</italic> depicts a biological family’s coping, and while seemingly an unlikely space to theorize queer bonds, this representation offers rhetorical insight into the workings of a rhetoric of belonging. Faced with the suicide of her son, Rick’s mother moves from silent shock and denial to deep rage, screaming, “I want to die!” She argues, “It wasn’t just Rick and Lonnie in that car—we were there too.” Severed from her child, she marks how she <italic>was</italic> a parent, but there is no word for what she is <italic>now</italic>, forever changed, thrown besides herself in grief (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1532708612471317">Butler, 2004</xref>). Speaking to a concerned group of parents in the film, following the suicide, a community doctor argues that suicide is not the answer, for “all it does is lay that pain on the broken shoulders of the survivors.” Furious at Rick, his little brother Philip (River Phoenix) yells, “He ruined everything—the whole family.” He further argues, “He didn’t care about us” and “He must have really hated us.”</p>
<p>Philip grows increasingly angry and confused, feeling invisible to his parents (who are wrapped up in their own grief), and he swallows a bottle of pills. Reaffirming the rhetoric of selfishness, his mother is enraged when she discovers Philip, groggy beside an empty pill bottle. She asks him how he wants to die, “The head or the heart?” as she drags him to the hospital. She yells, “Are you going to do it here, so I’m the one to find you?” Philip begs for her to stop, but she refuses. “What, am I being brutal? Well suicide is brutal! Its ugly and painful so think of that next time!” Philip argues that Rick gets all the attention, but the mother quickly replies, “What he got was death!” Rick and Lonnie are discussed with confusion, but also deep resentment, anger, and disgust. Their actions are framed as brutal, cruel, and selfish. They are not only mourned but also indicted.</p>
<p>This indictment radically differs from the respect, reverence, and (perhaps) martyrdom present in the mediated representation of queer suicides, such as Tyler Clemente and Billy Lucas, or as depicted in the Lifetime film <italic>Prayers for Bobby</italic>. Although many of these representations of queer suicide work to memorialize the loss of someone valuable, while indicting homophobia, additional logics within these representations require greater scrutiny. Discourses naturalize interconnections between gayness and suicide, while dangerously constructing queer suicide as a space of vindication, acceptance, and respect. In <italic>Prayers for Bobby</italic>, when first accepting his queer feelings, Bobby stares in the mirror for several moments and then attempts to swallow a bottle of pills. His brother Ed finds him, and Bobby tearfully confesses two pieces of information. First, he wanted to kill himself but he couldn’t because suicide is a sin. Second, he sexually desires men, not women. Ed relays this to his mother and for the next hour of the film, Bobby’s mother works to cure him through prayer and faith. At no point does anyone (family or friends) question <italic>why</italic> he would try to kill himself or attempt to parse same-sex desire from him taking his life. Suicide is accepted as a given, a “fill in” that is logical and goes hand-in-hand with gayness.</p>
<p>Mirroring <italic>Surviving, Prayers for Bobby</italic> differs from many past gay representations, for his suicide is not the final act. The second half of the film focuses on the aftermath of the tragedy. Never is the question posed, “why did he do it?” In fact, the “logic” of Bobby’s actions are not questioned at all, but rather justified through two competing narratives. First, as Bobby walks on the freeway overpass and drops into traffic, a quick montage reflects his internal dialogue and rationale, which ends with his mother saying, “I won’t have a gay son.” The second half of the film depicts the mother coming to terms with the violence of her religious beliefs, her religious intolerance, and how her rigid belief systems diminished Bobby’s self-worth. In short, Bobby’s suicide is presented as her fault and we watch her seek redemption as she accepts this knowledge. This explanation denies any agency or accountability for Bobby, and thus obscures the selfishness in the act. Similar to <italic>Surviving</italic>, we watch Bobby’s parents and siblings learn the news of his suicide, followed by screams, crying, and pain. However, the pain of these reactions is rooted in the family’s guilt and responsibility. Rather than anger and disbelief, asking “why did this happen,” the effect is more in line with “Look what we did!” Unlike <italic>Surviving</italic>, where the family is angry at the selfishly brutal actions of Rick and Lonnie, Bobby emerges a victim, punished by his Christian mother’s homophobic cruelty, which is the first justification for his suicide. The suicide, in turn, punishes the family, turning Bobby into a martyr in the service of his mother’s revelation and transformation.</p>
<p>The second explanation represented for Bobby’s suicide is the “logical” interconnection of gayness and suicide. This tacit conflation, which is reified across much gay representation in popular culture, follows the linkage that goes unquestioned at the top of the film—Bobby thinks he’s gay so suicide makes sense (to Bobby, to those around him, and apparently, the audience). The priest at Bobby’s funeral explicitly articulates this interconnection, reiterating a Christian master narrative (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1532708612471317">Corey, 1998</xref>) of Bobby straying from the path of righteousness, growing lost, and inevitably taking his own life. This story of straying (from heterosexuality) and becoming lost (severed from self, family, God) marks a sedimented cause-and-effect linkage for gay suicide that reifies homophobic religious morality as a cautionary tale of heterosexuality’s correctness. However vile and oppressive, this tacit logic remains insidiously embedded in many “positive” scripts, films, and representations. Often working to build audience identification with gay characters, we routinely see gay characters battling self-hatred, shame, a desire to change, and mortification—self-punishment being a central component to the introduction of gay characters to the mainstream.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1532708612471317">1</xref></sup> Although Bobby’s boyfriend and best friend sit in the church and reject the priest’s sermon as homophobic, <italic>Prayers for Bobby</italic>, as with many other texts and campaigns working to help gay teens, continue to retell the narrative of mortification as a strategy of social acceptance. In the effort to solicit mainstream identifications (they don’t want to be gay, they would rather be straight, they feel rightfully bad about themselves, and it’s not their fault), self-punishment has become naturalized in representations of “proper” and grievable GLBT persons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1532708612471317">Goltz, 2010</xref>)</p>
<p>Navigating these two explanations for Bobby’s suicide, neither one affords a space for <italic>his</italic> actions to be critiqued. Even as Bobby falls backward, arms out, off the freeway overpass, he is both Christ-like in visual allusion and seemingly passive, as if Bobby is surrendering to a momentum outside himself. In Bobby’s final journal article, he discusses sinking in quicksand, questioning his ability to free himself. The discourses of suicide seem to court him, pull at him, drive him, and so the suicide is less an act than a refusal to keep fighting and give in—and so he falls. Beyond merely being sensible, this framing tells a story where NOT killing oneself is the active choice, and suicide is the result of one not being strong enough to resist the pull. Suicide is not an act, but a surrendering—an inability to resist. Thus, the logic is reified that suicide is always AN option (if not THE option) for gays. Juxtaposed with <italic>Surviving</italic>’s construction of (straight) teen suicide as senseless and selfish, the dangerous manner in which suicide has been produced as unquestioned, logical, and divorced from agency within gay narratives is highlighted.</p>
<p>Near the end of <italic>Surviving</italic>, Philip lays in the hospital following his suicidal attempt. His father says, “Philip, you must promise to never do that again, because I couldn’t bear to lose you.” Again, relational ties and the brutal selfishness of suicide are forefronted as antisuicide appeals. Rather than an “it gets better” message where the pains of today will be lesser tomorrow if one holds on (and doesn’t give into the logic of suicide), <italic>Surviving</italic> constructs a rhetoric of belonging, wherein taking one’s life is cruel cowardice. It ruins <italic>lives</italic>, rather than takes <italic>a</italic> life. It speaks to the interconnectedness of identity and how we are undone through our relations, through grief, and accountable to one another (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1532708612471317">Butler, 2004</xref>). Queers, however, are routinely written outside these systems is discourse, wandering and lost, only reclaimed into systems of belonging through the punishing corrective of suicide. Suicide, as in <italic>Prayers for Bobby</italic>, is presented as a remedy for queer estrangement from familial belongings, for through suicide, Bobby is finally loved, valued, and accepted. This strategy mirrors 1980s’ gay representation construction of HIV/AIDS as a vehicle mending familial belongings for gay males, and garnering familial and social acceptance, just before dying (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1532708612471317">Brookey, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1532708612471317">Goltz, 2010</xref>). The next section will examine these systems of belonging, the positioning of queers, and the potentials of queer bonds of belonging.</p>

</disp-quote></p>
<p>Watching <italic>Surviving</italic>, I am taken back to a vivid memory from 1990:
<disp-quote>
<p>I wake in a hospital bed again. Different room, different month, same ordeal. My body’s exhausted from the charcoal tube forced down my throat, the gagging, the resistance. My body’s exhausted from the anger and hurt and emotional tornado that peaked to the point of wanting to be done with all of it—all of them. My body’s still, my eyes are closed, hiding in half sleep as nurses talk, doctors talk, my parents talk—and cry—and yell. Dad screams and curses at me until nurses interrupt. Mom makes him leave the room. I play it out in my tightly closed eyes. The nurses will see his outburst and put two and two together; depressed suicidal kid, jerk father, case closed, seen it before. It’s the work of the closet, always planning ahead, anticipating risks, and covering tracks. Dad’s voice leaves the room. I fight a tear that’s escaping, a give away that I hear them—that I am awake—that I am hiding. The room gets quiet. I breathe. I let my eye open just a bit, thinking I am now alone. I am not. Mom whispers to me, in a voice that is interrupted by squelched full-body crying. “You don’t get to open up this box anymore. This is it, the last time. You can’t do this again.” The sound of her crying, the pain in her voice, the pain I was bringing to her, the pain I would cause her if I died, the look on her face, the destruction to her life, the terror, and tearing of her is all tied into her resolute statement—“You don’t get to open up this box anymore.” I knew, I felt, with utter certitude that killing myself, or even entertaining killing myself could no longer be a choice. She said it, but I felt it, as I imagined the moment she is told of my death. It was more than I could ever do. I never allowed my mind to go there again, and though things didn’t get easier or less shitty for a while, it was a box in my mind I refused to touch from that moment on—because it was selfish, because it was cruel.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>This is my story of the last time I tried or considered suicide. It speaks volumes of my commitments to my family, and the power that system of belonging can have on someone. Often suicidal ideation or attempts are discounted as “just looking for attention” but can we reframe this slightly to “looking for belonging?” Looking for attention is about being audienced and appreciated. To look for belonging is to locate the consubstantiality of one’s life with another, examine and explore how one’s life is relational, to seek to understand and locate where or how one is tied to someone else in the world. Can we think of suicide as more than an act of hopeless depression, but rather individualized alienation—a cry of not belonging—for one to believe he or she could ever only take <italic>a</italic> life?</p>
<p>As queer theory emerges from and is rooted within impulses of negation, rejection, resistance, and/or standing apart, moving toward a relational model for queerness—a reconsideration of queer bonds that construct a queered form of belonging—navigates a paradoxical antisocial relationality. Queer absence of belonging is fueled by the ways gay suicide is produced in discourse as logical, rather than the senselessness of (assumed to be nonqueer) teen suicide. As seen by It Gets Better and the recent proliferation of discourse around gay suicide, it is not that gay teen suicides are not grieved or grievable—though White, middle-class male suicides tend to be the cases that garner public outcry and sympathy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1532708612471317">Lim, 2010</xref>). Within the growing proliferation of gay suicidal discourse, we are asked as a culture to grieve (for some), but we are not asked to question “why?” We are not asked to indict the act. “Proper” neoliberal grieving is scripted as the public declaration of concern and anger at a homophobic society coupled with a somber reflection on the value, worth, and loss of this individual. The discourse does not operate under a rhetoric of selfishness, but one of reverence and redemption—one where we are asked to pity the deceased, feel sad for the homophobic weight they endured, and be angry at a culture that created a world where this person felt there was no hope or choice. We are not called to question or condemn the <italic>act</italic> of suicide, reject the <italic>logic</italic> of suicide, or hold the deceased in any way accountable. While there is a fine line between a rhetoric of selfishness and “blame the victim,” by not holding the deceased to some level of accountability, it renders their life as untied, alienated to any system of belonging, and thus not accountable. In one moment in <italic>Prayers for Bobby</italic>, Ed, Bobby’s brother, expresses anger. He yells to his Dad, “Did he even think what it would do to us?” Livid that there was not even a goodbye, Ed yells, “YOU HAPPY NOW! I’M SORRY BOBBY!” This moment is not about apology, but a moment of indictment. He is furious in his delivery, and the momentary implication is that Bobby was cruel and selfish. However, Ed’s father quickly places his hand on Ed’s shoulder and says “It’s not your fault.” Ed drops his head, shamed and saddened, and they exit. The father’s response completely ignores Ed’s critique of Bobby’s actions, and he immediately rescripts Ed’s anger to fit back in-line with the rest of the family, as guilty and ashamed.</p>
<p>The logical and redemptive construction of gay suicide requires death before queers are recognized within systems of belonging—mourned and honored as a grave loss likened to a fallen soldier. To return to reframing suicide as “searching for belonging,” <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1532708612471317">Freeman (2007)</xref> suggests queer belonging “names more than a longing to <italic>be</italic>, and be <italic>connected</italic>, as in being ‘at hand.’ It also names the longing to ‘be <italic>long</italic>,’ to endure over time” (p. 299). She explores the temporality of wanting to be long, as a desire to extend oneself across time, beyond one’s own life, through connections with others—a form of offering “oneself beyond one’s time” (p. 299). In representations, such as <italic>Prayers for Bobby</italic>, it is only through death that queers are recognized within a “we.” In death, there is belonging and visibility, and recognition, as well as an importance of being long-of reaching out “a hand across time” (p. 299). Suicide is a part of our story, our narrative, our plotline, emerging from a Christian morality tale of straying from the correct path and losing one’s way, yet it is also a means to a problematic end of belonging and being long. Thus, suicide is crafted in discourse as a way of achieving acceptance, respect, belonging, and significance for queer youth, and discourse writes suicide as the ever-present option to be weighed and considered by queer youth. In film and television, gay suicide requires no justification. It is our story, discursively always on the table. As one form of queer victimage that spans popular media for decades, queer self-punishment and self-hatred are not remarkable, but logical. Their alienation and isolation often constructs their suicide as sad, but not selfish.</p>
<p>To reframe queer suicide under a rhetoric of selfishness marks, claims, and demands that the queer life be rewritten into systems of belonging. It works to claim the power of queer bonds, which insist on accountability either alongside or in the absence of normative familial bonds of belonging. These queer bonds demand accountability, wherein taking one’s life is not a solitary act, but a cruel and brutal act of violence to others. In <italic>Prayers for Bobby</italic>, the space for a queer form of belonging and a rhetoric of selfishness lingered at the off spaces of the film. As mentioned, when Bobby kills himself, the initial reactions of his two parents and two siblings are shown. However, the first to find out about Bobby’s death and the person who calls Bobby’s immediate family is his queer-friendly cousin, best friend, and roommate Jeanette. Jeanette supported Bobby, encouraged him to come to Portland, introduced him to gay clubs, and was his confidant in the film. She delivers the news, but is positioned on the other end of the phone. We are denied her reaction, her pain, as someone bound to and supportive of (and betrayed by) Bobby. Also, neither Bobby’s boyfriend David nor any of Bobby’s queer friends from his hometown are depicted in this sequence, thus privileging the biological family and containing the pain and suffering to the family’s responsibility and guilt. Where is the accountability of Bobby’s action to Jeanette? What would allowing an audience to see that pain, that betrayal, and the cruelty of Bobby’s actions to his queer family open up and potentialize? These questions call for a different relational system to be placed at the center, one that does not only position suicide as a teachable moment for a homophobic culture—a lesson about the wonderful person they failed to love (who is awarded belonging by taking his life). Rather, this other story forefronts relations that would render queer suicide as not only cruel, selfish, and brutal, but senseless.</p>

In many ways, the videos stage an imagined exchange with the speaker’s childhood self, a temporal crossing where the person posting the video offers the advice they imagine/remember needing as a queer teen. This essay offers a similar gesture, crafting a theoretical letter of hope to myself as a 12-year-old queer —ashamed of his body and desires, while navigating a near-obsessive connection to Molly Ringwald.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Dear Dust, You can’t imagine this now, but in 1998 you will be at a table at The Brew ’N View in Chicago, pounding cheap beers in a crowded old movie theater, watching <italic>Pretty in Pink</italic>. We were too young to catch the film in the theater in 1986, so the opportunity to see the movie on a big screen fourteen years after its release will be too exciting to pass up. In those final moments of the film, as Andie (Molly Ringwald) is reunited with Duckie (Jon Cryer) at the prom, the theater becomes (what you will one day call) affectively charged. Andie and Duckie see each other far across the stuffy hotel entry hall. Music fades in as they smile in recognition and acceptance of their deep bond, following the pain and isolation of being apart. They are together again. We cheer and clap. Duckie is decked out in fab alternative 80s wear, his “duckman” shoes, and a bolo tie. He enters the prom with Andie in her (wonderfully hideous homemade) dress that is “less a garment than a statement: a cool, pink, fuck you, sexy suit of armor deflecting the steers and sneers” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1532708612471317">Bernstein, 1997</xref>, p. 77). Together, they are an unstoppable force—a pair of unified alienated artsy lower class teens—refusing to let the rich pricks of John Hughes’s high school world break them. You tear up (as always), but no one seems to care. As you know, the film doesn’t end there (as it should) for the story returns to the lame-ass relationship between Andie and the vanilla rich kid Blaine (Andrew McCarthy). Blaine confesses his love for Andie (blah!), offers a trite line about always believing in her but not believing in himself (blah blah!) and flees, seemingly devastated (blah blah blah!). In the Brew ’n View, in 1998, as Blaine exits, you will groan, as always. This time, however, it’s not just you, but the voices of many, yelling “who cares” and “wa wa wa” at the screen as Blaine departs. When Andie contemplates whether to run after him or stay with Duckie, someone yells, “Don’t do it” and the crowd breaks into laughter and applause. When Duckie advises Andie to “go to him,” for fear of killing this “very romantic moment,” there are more groans and hisses. Remember how annoyed we were when the film asked us to abandon our commitment to Andie and Duckie, so she could run after BLAINE? In 1998, in this theater, when Andie leaves to chase her “love,” the crowd erupts in a loud and seemingly unified “Booooooo!” In that theater, in this moment, there will be a shared recognition. While not a visibly queer audience, and surely not what I marked as a queer space before this moment, this audience will grow in laughter and pleasure at the collective resistance voiced to the unfolding narrative on the screen—pushing it elsewhere, resisting its commitments, and calling to the film and each other to reject Andie’s decision. That final scene of Blaine and Andie kissing is ignored, as yelling and chatter fully dismiss the final moments of heteronormative recuperation on the screen. Together, WE reclaim the queer bond of Andie and Duckie, and you need to be there.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>At The Brew ’n View, I came to understand the power and potential of rethinking modes of belonging and kinship as a survival strategy. I saw the power in queer bonds to challenge us to rethink our relations and selves otherwise. After over 10 years of numerous collages, posters, paintings, and drawings, I began to understand my deep and seemingly peculiar queer obsession with Molly Ringwald—what she meant to me that I couldn’t articulate or let go of. Yet to love <italic>Pretty in Pink</italic> is to give oneself over to Duckie, Duckie’s devotion to the artsy Andie, the depths of their connection, highlighted through the shallow love story of Andie and Blaine. Like most of John Hughes’s alternative outsiders from the wrong side of the tracks, Duckie embodies an unspoken yet ever-present queerness that both marginalizes him from the high school world he is forced to endure, and brings him in queer relation to others outside of social inclusion. Hughes’s brat pack films flirted with queer subtexts in both subtle and not so subtle ways, yet framed his outcast queer characters in generalized narratives of being “different” and “not fitting in” (often coded as unpopular due to economic status). Hughes’s teens were “the neglected, the abused, the neurotic, the anal, the demented, the despised, the vulnerable, the lonely, and the lost” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1532708612471317">Bernstein, 1997</xref>, p. 79) or in other terms, queer. Popularity is continually tied to a vacuous heteronormativity that sacrifices self and relation for social acceptance; his outcasts are coded with glamorized and soulful queerness. From the brief glimpse of the gay pride flag across the street from Iona’s record store, to the alternative clubs and alternative underground worlds that provide homespaces away from the oppressive and hollow mainstream, Hughes calls for us to love and identify with his queers.</p>
<p>Previous writings on queer bonds have used examples, such as daddying and sexual apprenticeship (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1532708612471317">Freeman, 2007</xref>) or an allied teacher who shares queer literature with a curious student (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1532708612471317">Weiner &amp; Young, 2011</xref>, p. 227). Turning to popular culture, the queer bond of Andie and Duckie opens up the space for an alternative site of relational development that resists and hollows the heteronormative narrative (attempting to) drive the film. The queer relations forged refuse to relinquish the film, having built a queered allegiance and commitment with the audience that invalidated the normative Hollywood closure. Audiences rejected the ending, which was later revealed to be a last-minute reshoot. The original script ends with Duckie and Andie descending on prom, outdancing and outdressing the school’s “social elite,” and reclaiming their pride, bond, and resistance.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-1532708612471317">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>Hughes’s next film, <italic>SKOW</italic>, works to correct the wrongs of <italic>Pretty in Pink</italic> by recentralizing the queer outsider bond in the film. Mirroring <italic>Pretty in Pink</italic>, the film swaps out the artsy red-haired Andie for the red-haired artist Keith (Eric Stoltz). In the opening sequence, Keith walks on train tracks, alone, as a train approaches. The train blows its whistle frantically, but Keith, stone-faced, continues walking forward. At the last minute, Keith casually steps aside, and the train whips by. He smirks, deriving pleasure in a flirtation with death, while something else drives him to step out of its path. From this introduction, Keith is coded with queer difference, an outsider who is “the weirdest guy in a huge school.” “I like art, my best friend’s a tomboy. These things don’t fly too well in the American high school.” His best pal is the wonderfully dyke-ish drum playing tomboy Watts (Mary Stuart Masterson). Hughes’s queer subtexts<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-1532708612471317">4</xref></sup> move further to the surface with this film, as the short-haired, boxer short–wearing Watts signifies butch lesbian to even the most normative viewer. When Watts is called “lesbian” for her nonnormative gender performance, she does not refute it.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-1532708612471317">5</xref></sup> Watts, Duckie 2.0, embraces her outsider status as queer, yet is devoted to Keith—a dreamer who obsesses on the popular and beautiful Amanda Jones (Lea Thompson). Named after the Rolling Stones song “Miss Amanda Jones,” Keith’s desire for Amanda is exposed in the film as disingenuous—more about using her as a prop for social acceptance than any romantic feelings. As the poor girl who sacrifices and hides to fit in, Amanda becomes a symbol for the concessions one makes by closeting one’s true self for normative inclusion. She is placed in opposition to Watts, who queerly embraces the ambiguity of her sexual and gender identity. Contrasted with the sham “romance” of Amanda and Keith, Watts’ relationship with Keith is built on commitment, otherness, and pride in the face of oppression. In the films close, a perfect flip to correct the wrongs of <italic>Pretty in Pink</italic>, Amanda sends Keith after Watts. Keith says to Watts “you look good wearing my future,” and this happy ending is less romantic than about a deep dependence and shared commitment—a reclaiming and recentering of Andie and Duckie’s prom entrance that designs the film’s closure through a queer opening. Lessened in its intensity by words, such as “friends,” Watts and Keith, as do Andie and Duckie, create and potentialize something greater. “Friends” is often conceived in relation to (biological) family and romantic partner, subject to a normative hierarchy that privileges one in relation to the other. Queer bonds rupture this system; displace the centrality of normative love and biological family, marking their lack and hollowness in favor of relations built through struggle, oppression, alliance, and commitment. Allies bonded through the dual trajectories of queer bonds, they are cast out against the social, yet this queer outside/against position permits their own relations—a queered sociality that they stand for <italic>as</italic> they stand together (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1532708612471317">Weiner &amp; Young, 2011</xref>). Queer bonds, while intimate, might be more appropriately defined as extimate (p. 231), enlisting the Lacanian term that marks “the radical abyss of foreigness and a form of closeness that remains strange, unassimilable, and not reducible to identity” (p. 231). These tensions of close and foreign, together in resistant sociality, trace the contours of Hughes’s queer teen relations. As queer bonds are privileged in these films, a space for audiences to reject the oft-privileged normative heteroromance relationship is opened, celebrated, and endowed with resistant we-ness.</p>
<p>Hughes’s queer bonds offer alternative representations of relations that open up this “other story,” wherein family or romance are decentered in a commitment to queer relations and suicide emerges as ideologically selfish. In <italic>Pretty in Pink</italic>, Duckie’s intense feelings of isolation and alienated queerness are demonstrated throughout the film, yet are constructed relationally. He circles Andie’s house on his bicycle, continually makes her mix tapes, leaves repeated answering machine messages in an effort to build a stronger connection to someone else who sees him, feels him, and knows him. When Andie is out with Blaine, Duckie sits alone in a dark alley, distraught. When he and Andie stop speaking, Duckie is shown in a beaten down apartment, on a mattress on the floor, tossing playing cards into a hat. There is no family or connection for him to draw on, and parental alienation or absence is a common theme across all Hughes’s films. Loosely guised under a crush, his connection to Andie is not about sex and far more potent than the word “friendship” can contain. This isolation and disconnection is mirrored in <italic>SKOW</italic>’s Watts, who is always waiting for and wanting for Keith throughout the entire film. “The only thing I care about in this goddamn life is me, and my drums, and you.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-1532708612471317">6</xref></sup> The prom scene in <italic>Pretty in Pink</italic> and the final scene of <italic>SKOW</italic> mark climaxes in the films, where Andie and Keith are awakened to the irreplaceable value of their queer bonds with Duckie and Watts. The queerness of Hughes’s characters exceed the heteronormative script they occupy, offering films that celebrate something other than romance and far beyond friendship, but a connection and dependency forged through those who do not belong, yet belong to each other. These stories, these relations hint at the relations written outside of <italic>Prayers for Bobby</italic>, such as Jeanette or Bobby’s queer family, for as much as Duckie is taunted in school, socially marginalized, awkward, and perpetually outside, he is tied and accountable to Andie to a degree that renders suicide illogical and cruel.</p>
<p>In the Hughes films, where no one was marked explicitly as queer, everyone lingers in a potentially queer space, yet through the increase of gay visibility in the 1990s’ popular culture, sexual categorization became rigid and absolute.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-1532708612471317">7</xref></sup> Relationships with rich queer subtextual space are less common in contemporary film and television, where gay identity is marked, specified, and clearly organized. A postmillennial version of the Duckie and Andie relationship might be the John Hughes obsessed Olive (marked straight) and Brandon (marked gay) in 2010’s <italic>Easy A</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1532708612471317">Gluck, 2010</xref>). As queer allies to one another, Olive willingly pretends to have sex with Brandon to dispel rumors of his gayness, which have resulted in ongoing bullying, harassment, and cruelty. In the film, we are led to believe that Olive may have helped prevent Brandon from taking his life, yet rather than read her as a form of straight hero, we can more productively look at the queer bond forged between the two of them as an alternative form of alliance, commitment, and belonging. Their relationship is used as a queer survival strategy. We can surely critique the positioning of this relationship at the periphery of the film in the service of the central heterosexual love plot, and we can also critique the patriarchal dimensions of this relationship, but these points ought not dismiss the ways Brandon and Olive’s relationship forged a queer survival strategy. However, as mandated by the post-1990s rigid classification of representation, the bond was short-lived and secondary to Olive and Brandon landing their boyfriends by the films close. The pleasurable and potential space to enter and play in the subtextual spaces of Andie and Duckie and Watts and Keith seem to be more carefully policed amidst the proliferation of gay representations. Stark classifications of friend, boyfriend, family, gay, and straight work to contain the ways queer bonds might bend and blur these categories, as well as challenge the cultural hierarchy that seeks to privilege biological or romantic relations above other potential bonds of intimacy. For queers, these bonds offer strategies to unmask and highlight suicide as a choice (and a selfish and brutal one at that) rather than a logical narrative moment; these bonds offer strategies for this work.</p>

<p>In <italic>Surviving</italic> and <italic>Prayers for Bobby</italic>, a weight hovers over the families as they struggle to move forward from their tragedies. The weight is a ghost, a legacy of suicide they are forced to confront, negotiate, and push through each day. In many ways, all queers live with the weight of this ghost on our souls, as we all inherit a discursive legacy of suicide that is ever-present, following and weighing on us. This ghost may not be of a person, yet it materializes through films, television programs, and religious narratives of “straying from the path” that repeatedly write suicide into our lives, identities, and stories. So interwoven are the scripts of suicide and gayness, that suicide, in itself, draws speculation of one’s sexuality. In <italic>Dead Poet’s Society</italic>, was it Neil’s love of Shakespeare that coded him as queer in my reading, or was it that he took his own life? In <italic>Pump up the Volume</italic> when the queer male caller hangs up on Harry Hard-on, why do I assume suicide is on his mind? How did we get to a point where one’s sexual desires have come to explain taking one’s life? This ghost is now our legacy. Its hauntings are fueled by discourses that write the queer outside of belonging, and as I have worked to show, dangerously construct suicide as a space of redemption, belonging, and acceptance.</p>
<p>As a strategy of resistance and survival, a rhetoric of selfishness works to underscore and emphasize the ways we are tied to one another, vulnerable to one another, and accountable to one another. The narrative is all too common, where “I attempted suicide in my teens. I took a lethal dose of prescription medication and meant to remove myself from where I didn’t feel I belonged” (Rivers in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1532708612471317">Savage &amp; Miller, 2011</xref> p. 243). Queer studies needs to not only write queers within systems of belonging, marking suicidal logic as selfish and brutal, but also needs to interrogate how suicide discursively writes queers into relations where they/we DO belong.</p>
<p>Although Pat Benatar’s 1984 anthem “We Belong” is didactically playing in <italic>Surviving</italic> as Lonnie and Rick ride a motorbike around town, contemplating the choice to end their life, the belonging they cling to is each other. Familial systems of belonging, such as those represented in <italic>Surviving</italic>, work to construct a rhetoric of selfishness that requires greater presence in gay suicide discourses. As Taylor Bailey states in his It Gets Better essay, his sister kept him alive. “She’s who I’d think about when I thought of killing myself. I realized I couldn’t do that to her” (Rivers in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1532708612471317">Savage &amp; Miller, 2011</xref> p. 304). It was the image of my mother that I believe kept me alive. While we occasionally hear about the families of gay suicide, discourses of selfishness are rarely, if ever, present. While not literally endorsing an approach of “blame the victim” of gay suicide, we ought question and extend the logic of “victim”—which denies accountability, systems of belonging and obscures agency. It guides us to feel sad and helpless, redeeming the importance of the dead person rather than indict and reject the act. A queer rhetoric of brutal selfishness argues queer suicide is tied to us all, and it must stop being treated as logical or redemptive, but brutally selfish.</p>
<p>Looking to biological familial relations, opposed to “logical” ones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1532708612471317">Maupin, 2007</xref>), as the space for crafting queer belonging is flawed and tenuous, as many queers are denied familial belonging because of their queerness. Thus, the need to look elsewhere is essential, and the queer relational focus on queer bonds offers a productive strategic avenue to challenge and rethink these discourses.</p>
<p>A contentious flurry of arguments that both indict and support the It Gets Better campaign emerged in the first months of the project. In a divisive dialogue that pitted arguments of Dan Savage’s privilege and the normative underpinnings of the message against the spirit of the campaign and the potentials it affords, I was thrown by a critical blog entry:
<disp-quote>
<p>Dear Queer and Transgender Youth of the World, PLEASE DO WHATEVER YOU CAN TO SURVIVE AT ALL COSTS . . . Understand when a queer or transgender person commits suicide it hurts the whole community (and yes you are part of a larger community whether or not you realize it just yet). It shakes the faith in all our survival, in all our strength. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1532708612471317">Windsome, 2010</xref>)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The accountability that is forefronted in this message pushes at discourses of belonging in important ways. It writes the queer into a system of belonging, asserting, “We are out here. We are out here. People who love. Love. Love. Love. Love. Love. Love. Love. Love in full. Love Wholly” (Milligan-Green, Kahill, &amp; Peck in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1532708612471317">Savage &amp; Miller, 2011</xref>, p.199). It also acknowledges WE are struggling for OUR survival. The blog entry marks the accountability of OUR lives to one another. It extends beyond saying, killing yourself will “deny us the chance to meet and get to know you” (Winfiele in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1532708612471317">Savage &amp; Miller, 2011</xref>, p. 272) and indicts the act as an infliction of pain and loss and selfishness on other queers. It writes a different story.</p>
<p>This blog post speaks back to that night at the Brew ’n View, as we reclaimed Duckie and Andie. Writing against the normative trajectory of the film, we rejected the coaxing of Hollywood romance narrative and defiantly celebrated queer bonds. Collectively, we insisted that Duckie and Andie’s relationship, this other story, matters—it matters more. In <italic>Pretty in Pink</italic>, Duckie was not alone, for even when Andie could not realize their worth and connection, we did. We were out there. We claimed them as our own, and celebrated the recognition of that bond—waiting for Andie to recognize it as well. Returning to the opening sequence of <italic>SKOW</italic>, it is Watts (rather than his parents or family, or career) that motivates Keith to step off the train tracks—Watts who “looks good wearing his future.” For Duckie, Watts, Andie, or Keith—our alienated queers who are cast outside of normative social worlds and systems—suicide would not have been logical, would not have redeemed them, would not have made them more valuable, or made us love them more. They belonged to one another, and to us, in ways that disrupts the logic of queer suicide. That action would be nothing short of cruel, and that selfish cruelty and senselessness offers a space, and relation, and accountability to build from. Queer bonds need to mark and own the cruelty of suicide and allow that awareness of selfish cruelty to rewrite me, bleed into you, and usher forth a complicated US to combat the suicidal stories that continue to haunt queers. We need to make WE mean more. We need to make US mean enough.</p>

<p>Several characters throughout Hughes’s teen collection offer ample fuel for queer readings. In <italic>Breakfast Club</italic>, Andrew (Estevez) tapes a thin and hairy peers ass cheeks together in the locker room as a desperate act to discipline weakness and appear “tough” and strong for his father. Alison (Sheedy), in the same film, embodies a reclusive, tomboyish “basketcase” who rejects traditional gender performances, until the end, where her queerness is concealed behind makeup and a hair-band. In <italic>Weird Science</italic>, Wyatt wakes up wearing women’s underwear, with no explanation. His hyper-masculine brother removes his towel, handing it to Wyatt to cover himself, while Chet stands facing Wyatt, fully naked. Watts in <italic>SKOW</italic> and Sam in <italic>Sixteen Candles</italic> both have moments of gazing on female breasts in the high school locker room, opening a space of queer longing. Operating under an eighties logic of straight until proven otherwise, Hughes’s films enjoy multiple levels of same-sex eroticism and play.</p>

<p>Although the accusation of being a lesbian is constructed as an insult in the film, Watts’ refusal to respond challenges both the system of categorization and the negative meanings assumed in the accusation. Homophobic insults range across Hughes films, but are not refuted. For additional examples, see Andrew in <italic>Breakfast Club</italic> and Ted in <italic>Sixteen Candles</italic>. When Ted asks Sam (Ringwald), “Can I as you a question,” Sam quickly replies, “Yes, you are a total fag.” Ted chuckles for a moment, before responding, “That’s not the question.”</p>
