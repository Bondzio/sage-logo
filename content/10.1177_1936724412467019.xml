<abstract>
<p>How can mentors maximize their positive relationships with “at-risk” youth? Youth mentoring program evaluations at the Boys &amp; Girls Club of McAllen Metro (BGCMM) yield a framework that illuminates the content of relating inside mentoring relationships. The mentoring model identified is established primarily by qualitative methods with a phenomenological approach and supported by young adult alumni findings from a Harris Poll Interactive Survey. The case review of mentoring program evaluations is significant in that it fills a gap in the mentoring literature regarding the content of mentor-mentee relating. The summary of evaluation findings is also important because the inquiry occurs with 98 percent Latino youth population between the ages of 8 and 17. (The regional success of youth mentoring programs is meaningful to the nation in large part because South Texas is the one location where Latinos comprise a demographic majority). Given the academic achievement gap of Latino students, nationally with Latino high school drop-out rates approaching 50 percent and the overrepresentation of minority populations incarcerated, this simple replicable strategy for the successful mentoring program design and evaluation is timely. The interactionist sociological analysis examines what happens inside the mentor-mentee relationship as it is perceived to be impactful by the youth themselves with their definitions. The mentoring model informed by the case review is a practical tool in planning, implementing, and facilitating effective dyads between mentor and mentee that can inform mentor training and program evaluations.</p>

<p>How can mentors maximize their positive relationships with “at-risk” youth? The case review of Boys &amp; Girls Club of McAllen Metro’s (BGCMM) program evaluations demonstrates the perceptions of youth ages 8 to 17 on the impact their mentors make in their lives. The case illuminates how mentoring efforts can be maximized for the greatest positive effect in youth development by listening to youth voices as they describe what impacts them. This case review of program evaluations introduces a mentoring framework, which can inform the development of mentoring programs and their evaluation. The phenomenological approach utilizes content analysis of essay responses and focus group themes, triangulated with a survey of recent alumni. The result supports that mentor training emphasizes relationship skills building rather than focusing solely on prevention programming for juvenile delinquency prevention outcomes. This analysis ultimately calls for more phenomenological and interpretive qualitative research that advocates for mentoring relationships that honor the creative force of youth voices as cocreators of mentoring relationships.</p>
<p>The case review is conducted with low-income Latino youth in the Lower Rio Grande Valley of South Texas, which further makes the case significant in that, this population is among the least studied. More than 90 percent of the youth served at the BGC McAllen are Latinos of Mexican American descent. McAllen, Texas, is 10 miles from the Texas-Mexico border located in the heart of the Rio Grande Valley. The mentees are 99 percent Latino, 60 percent male and 40 percent female, 60 percent LEP (Learning English Proficient), and 100 percent free- or reduced-lunch recipients meaning 100 percent are low-income classified. The McAllen Texas metropolitan statistical area (MSA) has 30 to 40 percent of its population living at or below the poverty line according to the U.S. Census. Between 60 and 90 percent of BGC McAllen youth come from single-parent homes as collected by the Membership Tracking Database. Despite recent gains in high school matriculation of students by area school districts, the Lower Rio Grande Development Council’s Community Assessment continues to report the regional, cumulative dropout rate between 40% - 50% as measured by students beginning kindergarten and those not graduating high school. The document states high school drop-out and low college graduate numbers as problematic for area economic growth.</p>
<p>The BGC McAllen has developed four successful mentoring programs with positive youth outcomes. The four highly effective mentoring programs are Texas AIM (Academic Innovation and Mentoring), TXSYN, Youth First Mentoring, and Be Great McAllen—Graduate. Outcome data are shared to satisfy traditional expectations of reporting to funders; however, summarizing our successes led to a more process-driven inquiry. A mentoring framework developed as a way to describe relating can inform future development and evaluation of mentoring programs. Programs reviewed are as follows: (1) <italic>Texas AIM</italic>—This mentoring model closes the academic achievement gap of Latino students being mentored in Texas AIM. Ninety percent of participants achieve at least one grade-level advance in an academic core area of study such as math or reading, and 88 percent pass their state skills standardized test (TAKS). (2) <italic>TXSYN—BGC Experience—</italic>A group mentoring model utilizing prevention curricula yielding the amazing result of 99.5 percent of youth avoiding the juvenile justice system, despite escalation of border violence in the region. (3) <italic>The Youth First Mentoring (Department of Education)</italic> is the one-on-one traditional mentor program for student success. Ninety-three percent or 255 out of 273 youth achieve on time grade promotion and are on schedule for high school graduation. (4) The <italic>Be Great McAllen—Graduate</italic> program is a graduation success/drop-out prevention model developed by Boys &amp; Girls Club of America based on <italic>Check and Connect</italic>. The thrust of this one-on-one mentoring program is case management for school attendance, behavioral compliance, and academic support. Out of 50 academically <italic>failing</italic> students mentored in the first year, 42 promoted to the next grade level. Youth being mentored improve behavior by 10 percent compared with other youth in a control population.</p>
<p>Traditional mentoring program evaluations are primarily summative and not formative. They focus on positive youth development outcomes derived from mentoring. Most mentoring research focuses heavily on the outcomes produced by so-called evidenced-based curricula utilized in mentoring. The mentoring model developed as a result of this case review of program evaluations emphasizes youth-defined impact.</p>

<title>Mentoring Literature Review</title>
<p>The U.S. Department of Justice recognizes that caring, trained adults mentoring youth in a one-to-one relationship is a prescriptive and effective strategy in combating the societal ills of juvenile delinquency and juvenile crime, specifically, violence, bullying, underage drinking, illicit drug use, and even suicide. The U.S. Department of Education recognizes that mentoring can make a positive impact on high school drop-out rates. Generally, literature demonstrates documented best practices as the following: the mentor-mentee relationship should (a) last more than one year; (b) be based on shared interests; (c) consist of regular, consistent face-to-face meetings; (c) and be child centered in that youth should view the mentor as a trusted friend and not as an authority figure. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1936724412467019">Tolan, Henry, Schoeny, &amp; Bass (2008)</xref> conducted meta-analyses of 31 youth mentoring programs. Focusing on a more limited array of outcomes, the researchers found there seems to be little additional certainty of the nature of mentoring and information to guide further development, sound training and management of the programming, and adequate tracking of effects to activities, staffing and other features (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1936724412467019">Tolan et al. 2008</xref>). The case review of mentoring evaluations and subsequent findings are one clinical sociologist and practitioner’s attempt to deal with the deficit in the field. The practical value of the approach and the mentoring diagram as a tool is that mentors can structure activities and conversations with youth in such a way as to achieve meaningful and impactful bonding that produces positive youth outcomes.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1936724412467019">Spencer (2006)</xref> state,<disp-quote>
<p>The input-output model of program effects is not sufficient for assessing mentoring as an intervention. A full understanding of what contributes to quality mentoring necessitates examining the characteristics and experiences of individual mentors and protégés, the nature and quality of the dyadic relationships they form and the programs in which they are embedded.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Our project review of program evaluations and the findings described in the diagram to be presented does exactly that—examines how participants experience the activities of the relationship as significant to them. We found one qualitative, phenomenological study of Latino-matched mentor and mentees that characterized the meaning of the mentoring relationship through mentors’ descriptions of their experiences and thematically categorized their responses in three clusters, personal relationships between mentor and mentee, mentee family relationships, and personal growth and development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1936724412467019">Knoche and Zamboanga 2006</xref>). Still, our program evaluation review is one of the few that we know of that highlights qualitative inquiry with solely Latino youth.</p>

<sec id="section2-1936724412467019">
<title>Theory and Methods Applied to the Study</title>
<p>Research outlines possible stages of development of the mentoring relationship, which may be reflective of an application of psychological bonding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1936724412467019">Karcher, Nakkula, and Harris 2005</xref>). Our perspective is more sociological. The new sociology of childhood deals with issues of human agency with the larger social forces that define them such as life course, stratification, race, and ethnicity. Children have been viewed by traditional sociologists and the general public as passive recipients of adult attempts to socialize with them through traditional societal institutions such as family, church, and schools. Questions of social construction from more interpretive sociological camps give the impetus to reexamine the role of children as active, meaning-producing beings and stress the creative production (agency) of social life rather than the determination of social behavior by systems of social organization (structure) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1936724412467019">Prout and James 2010</xref>). It is important to recover children as social actors and their activity as a source of social change. Adult mentors are no doubt agents of socialization to communicate the social order, but our case reflects that the mentoring relationship is a reflexive one with distinct two-way communication as defined by both children and adults. As such, children are capable of interpreting the social order and cocreating their own meanings. Great care is taken to “listen” to the voices of children in the methodological design of our evaluation. Therefore this work is about human agency within prescribed social structures, such as family, school, sports, and in our case, club.</p>
<p>We recognize that a summary of program evaluations is not replicable to other programs or other populations; however, a sociological look into effective mentoring is helpful to practitioners regarding their own program design, mentor training, and programmatic evaluation. We seek to understand <italic>the world of meanings</italic> and significance to the individuals in the mentoring relationships. Therefore, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1936724412467019">Creswell’s (2007)</xref> phenomenological discussion in his work informed our choices, which were essays, focus groups, and interviews triangulated with a young adult alumni survey of 100 club alumni. Since the data were consistent throughout the summary of program evaluations, we establish a mentoring framework reflected in the diagram of the findings. The framework may be useful in tracking mentor-mentee progress, training mentors, and evaluating mentoring programs.</p>
<p>Collecting data from children using questionnaires or traditional interviews is suspect because children, like others without power, are wise enough not to reveal information that might be used against them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1936724412467019">Waksler 1996</xref>). We understand the social location of children and the social forces exerted on them; therefore, we chose the investigative methodology of brief focus groups with similar aged children. Focus groups are not often used with children; however, they generate large quantities of material from relatively large numbers of people in a relatively short amount of time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1936724412467019">Kamberelis and Dimitriadis 2000</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1936724412467019">Deutsch and Spencer’s (2009)</xref> rationale for method selection supports our choices. The choice to utilize focus groups as a methodology for children is key to hearing their voices as free from the constraints of the socializing effect of our setting and their relationships as possible. Throughout our evaluation and focus group facilitation, we assumed the <italic>least adult role.</italic> Because the youth development professionals conducting the focus groups were perceived as “trusted friends” rather than authority figures, focus group content was rich and diverse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1936724412467019">Wyness 2010</xref>).</p>

<sec id="section3-1936724412467019">
<title>Qualitative Methods</title>
<p>Data collection consists of 100 essays of 8- and 10-year-olds, 10 focus groups conducted over one year’s time with 10- to 17-year-olds and 30 interviews with teens, ages 10 to 17 for the qualitative content analysis of the evaluation. These methodological choices lend themselves to Creswell’s modified version of Moustaka’s step-by-step analysis process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1936724412467019">Creswell 2007</xref>). Data collection and data analysis followed Creswell’s outline (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1936724412467019">2007</xref>:156-59) for phenomenological inquiry in that transcripts of focus groups and interviews are read, notes made, thematic groupings emerge, significant statements are pulled out, descriptions are made of the essence of meanings as youth describe them. The development of the mentoring framework occurs organically as a result of the textual and structural descriptions. Appropriate research protocols were followed to protect data and individual confidentiality.</p>
<p>A simple focus group and interview guide of seven questions is then utilized. (The questions were developed in conjunction with fellow sociologist Kelly Himmel, PhD.) The focus group questions are as follows: (1) Who do you admire? (2) What do you admire about the person you have in mind? (3) Think about your mentor at the Boys &amp; Girls Club, what do you admire about them? (4) Why do you admire your mentor? (5) Describe a time when your mentor helps you? (6) Does your mentor help you solve problems? Please give an example. (7) Does your mentor help you in a time of crisis? If so, please share an example. Focus group responses, essays, and interview responses are analyzed by thematic clusters, and aggregated and shared accordingly in a framework format.</p>

<p>Boys &amp; Girls Club of America (BGCA) commissioned a research project designed to assess alumni experiences in clubs and the impact club participation had on their lives. Key themes explored as part of the current research included club impact on individual lives both as children and as adults, education, and civic engagement. The study sample consisted of 1,014 alumni interviews with 814 conducted online, and 200 via telephone. The interviews were conducted from November 15, 2006, through March 16, 2007, and were 19 minutes in length, on average. This sample is a representative sample of BGC alumni nationally.</p>

<title>Findings Summarized</title>
<p>Our review of program evaluations at the BGC McAllen shows that youth members feel most connected to the caring adults in their lives through fun activities, skills taught, problems solved, and adult availability in a crisis. When interviewed, our alumni shared that the youth development strategies used by our staff and mentors created a sense of belonging, competence, and usefulness that made a real difference in their lives. They remember walking into the club and everyone knowing their names. Fellow members felt like family; they called the club a second home. They remember learning valuable and fun skills from cooking to basketball, and they remember feeling good about themselves as a result. They also remember serving others less fortunate than themselves through community service projects. We asked youth to comment and categorize how and why they admired mentors in their lives. The mentoring model developed as a result of the content analysis of themes in the essays, focus groups, and in-depth interviews. The responses reflected the perceptions of the youth themselves. Youth identified five significant areas of influence and gave examples or told stories to demonstrate their significance. The following themes emerged and were organized into the diagram below.</p>

</fig>
<p>The case review treats two previously understudied and underdiscussed areas of mentoring program effectiveness: (a) “How do the youth (mentees) construct meaning as contributing social agents within the mentor-mentee relationship?” and (b) “Based on their reported perceptions, what actions were perceived as most meaningful to youth?” <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1936724412467019">Figure 1</xref> may be used as a map to guide mentor training and program evaluation framework. This means, mentors engage youth in the activities that the youth identify as important. Over time and consistent relating, youth perceived the following as impactful to them—fun activities, being taught problem-solving skills, and receiving support in times of crisis. While much of group mentoring is focused on prevention curriculum delivery, the “lessons” of the curriculum are not what the youth cite as impactful. While the summative outcome measures of improved grades, better attendance in school, and improved behavior in school are obvious in our evaluations, these changes are not what youth note as meaningful in relating to their mentors. Youth identified fun activities, help solving problems, being taught skills, and support in crisis as the primary reasons they felt impacted by their mentors. The diagram demonstrates the way this occurs. It is not a hierarchy in which one must pass through a number of fun experiences together before the mentor is trusted enough to be afforded the right to be supportive in crisis, but rather fun activities are the milieu of relating in our mentoring model. Problem solving together and teaching skills are a natural outgrowth of relating and occur organically as a result of spending time together. Being present for a youth in crisis is the bull’s eye of the mentoring diagram because of the alignment of our finding to other mentoring and prevention literature, which asserts that adults being helpful and supportive to youth in crisis can serve as an inoculation against entry into youth gangs or other delinquent behaviors.</p>
<p>The process is affirmed by other research that postulates that one of the most protective factors against acting out with negative behaviors such as alcohol and drug abuse, poor school performance, teen pregnancy, or juvenile crime, is the presence of an adult in a crisis as perceived by the youth or teen. <italic>The National Youth Gang Center</italic> has identified individual risk factors for gang involvement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1936724412467019">United States Department of Justice’s Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention Bulletin [OJJDP] Bulletin 2009</xref>]) and adult availability to a youth in crisis as a major protective factor. For this reason, the United States Department of Justice’s OJJDP has named mentoring as an effective evidence-based prevention strategy for juvenile crime. Risk factors identified are antisocial behavior, alcohol and drug use, victimization, and negative life events. The BGC case review and subsequent diagram distinguishes presence in crisis as a key to effective mentoring because of the reports of youth that echo the need for an involved adult throughout life events. An adult presence in the life of a youth may be a key protective factor against attraction to risky behaviors and eventual gang involvement. In addition, this finding mirrors the meta-analysis finding by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1936724412467019">Tolan et al. (2008)</xref>, which states, “effects were larger when the program included emphasis on emotional support for the recipient and if the mentor was motivated to undertake this role as part of professional advancement.” (p. 5) See section “Qualitative Data Summaries: Focus Groups and Essays”.</p>

<p>The first column data are youth responses categorized, and the second column are the youth essay results of primarily younger mentees. The responses about crises are distinguished separately because of the significance defined by the research as key protective factor against delinquency and gang involvement. Interpretation and organization for presentation of these findings are not intended to be hierarchical in the model’s diagram above. In addition, the number of times the theme is mentioned within the focus group does not make the finding carry more weight. The fact that these themes are reflected consistently throughout the investigation is more meaningful than the number of times it is found.</p>

<title>Additional Factors</title>
<p>The results of the qualitative portion of the study include youth and teens who benefit from either group mentoring or one-to-one mentor matches with a trained, caring adult or both types of mentoring. Twenty percent were involved in one-to-one mentoring only, 45 percent were involved in group mentoring only, and 35 percent were involved in both one-on-one mentoring and group mentoring.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section13-1936724412467019">
<title>Specific Qualitative Findings Summarized</title>
<p>Every focus group story that participants recount consistently falls into one of the categories of the relationship described in the diagram. Every focus group consists of 8 to 12 participants. Youth give examples of mentor assistance with a problem or being present and helpful in a youth-perceived crisis. In every focus group, youth and teens describe their boys and girls club, as being their “home away from home.” They state that their mentors made a difference in their lives in the specific ways outlined in the diagram.</p>
<p>There is much literature about what works and does not work in mentoring such as the length of the relationship and the type of mentoring (one on one, group, formal, or informal). There is a great deal of literature on the successful outcomes of mentoring proving that it is indeed worthy to engage youth in such a way. Program evaluations abound about specific curricula for group mentoring and arguments about the attributes of evidence-based versus informal results. However, there is very little literature on what kind of impact specific activity or behaviors inside the mentoring relationship can have as being most effective to mentees and mentors. This programmatic need and inquiry guided our program development, mentor training, and program evaluation. We find that youth perceive fun activities, teaching skill, problem solving, and support in crisis as fundamental to mentor impact.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section14-1936724412467019">
<title>Specific Quantitative Data Findings</title>
<p>We tested our interpretations by commissioning a specific question with Harris Poll Interactive. Young adult alumni were asked about their mentors at the BGC McAllen. The respondents were adults, the majority of whom were ages 18 to 24. The local survey is similar to the national BGCA survey, which was commissioned and conducted a year before the local survey. A portion of the survey results are shown below. Two questions about mentoring affirmed the findings in the development of the mentoring model. In this way, the case study was triangulated for qualitative validity as defined by triangulation standards in qualitative sociological research, meaning three different methodologies are utilized. Fifteen percent of alumni felt their mentor helped them with problems and/or was present for them in a time of crisis. This supports the focus group’s findings.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section15-1936724412467019">
<title>Field/Practice Implications</title>
<p>By investigating what significantly impacts youth about mentors, we learned that it is not merely commitment, duration, and consistency that make a difference for youth but rather the content of the relating. This vital information can enlighten adults about how to best spend their time building relationships of significance with the youth they mentor. The BGC McAllen Mentoring Model may be used to inform and develop effective mentoring programs that train mentors not only in prevention messaging as conduits of socialization but also in relationship building skills such as active listening skills and open-ended question to solicit mentee response for youth-centered conversing. In addition, like BGCMM, mentoring programs may choose to facilitate problem-solving assistance and not merely teach prevention curriculum development. Our findings also beg the question, “Do youth programs target youth in the ways that youth state are significant to them, such as fun activities, skills building, problem solving, and assistance in crisis?” In this age of ever-tightening budgets, it is essential that youth programming produces youth outcomes most effectively and efficiently. Spending resources on mentors that assist in problem solving and crisis intervention may be the key to producing positive youth outcomes cost efficiently. While certainly no qualitative data can be generalized to fit other cases, it may be noteworthy to recall that quantitative methods mirrored the thematic clustering of the model also.</p>
<p>Evaluators of mentoring programs can utilize the mentoring diagram identified to shape their evaluation of mentoring programs by asking youth how their mentors impacted them and testing to see whether the categories of impact arise similarly. It is anticipated that their responses will fall into the four categories identified within the model’s diagram. As such, the diagram may be used as an evaluative tool. Youth will likely name the multiple fun activities they share with their mentors most often since youth development professionals tell us it is the glue of mentoring relationships. It is further anticipated that youth will share the number and type of skills taught to them by their mentors and define the problem-solving help they receive from mentors. Evaluators should also listen for stories of how mentors were present and helpful in times of youth crisis, as an indication of a successful mentor-mentee bond. Evaluators may even use the qualitative methods outlined, such as the simple essay format and focus group guide to discover the content of mentor-mentee relationships. The interactive content between mentors and mentees is postulated to be necessary components to produce the summative results desired in youth socialization, such as improved school attendance, improved grades, passing test scores, school promotion rates, and improved behavior resulting in the avoidance of the juvenile justice system. Evaluators will likely see that the relational content of mentoring simultaneously present with positive summative outcomes. If this content of relating is not present, it is highly unlikely that the prescriptive and summative outcome mentoring measures will be evident either.</p>
<p>Finally, this case review took place in a relatively homogeneous cultural setting of Latino youth and mentors in the Rio Grande Valley of South Texas. Research is needed to engage the question of replication of results in various settings, Latino and otherwise. While it is generally accepted that program evaluation is not formally generalizable beyond the sample considered, the impact of what youth find impactful in mentoring may be useful for mentoring program staff as they design interventions, train mentors, and evaluate their own programs. Ultimately, the findings may be interpreted from a social constructivist worldview where groups of individuals construct meaning of their shared experience. As such, the findings summarize common themes regarding the mentoring experience for both current youth members and alumni. If these same themes are demonstrated through the Boys &amp; Girls Club of American national Harris Poll Interactive survey results, then there may be a strong argument for generalizability to non-Latino audiences.</p>
