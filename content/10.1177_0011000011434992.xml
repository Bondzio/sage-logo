<p>The seven featured articles in this volume provide a much-needed contribution to psychology literature regarding the history of the five ethnic minority psychological associations (EMPAs), their relationships with the Society of Counseling Psychology (SCP), and implications for future efforts in building stronger connections. We believe this set of readings will prove to be informative and thought provoking for members and leaders of the aforementioned organizations. As we review these articles and reflect on our own experience and perspectives, we wrestle with some philosophical ideations related to such relational dynamics among the organizations. Whereas <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0011000011434992">Delgado-Romero, Lau, and Forrest (2012)</xref> have done an excellent job synthesizing the issues and providing future directions, we participate in this dialogue by adding several thematic considerations. Our overarching theme is one of a “both-and” perspective versus the “either-or” dichotomy. We discuss below several thematic issues using this both-and perspective, followed by a story to highlight our wishful thinking.</p>
<p>Before going forward, we would like to mention our relevant backgrounds and disclaimers for our writing. Y. Barry Chung is a first-generation Chinese American professor of counseling psychology. As of this writing, he is the current SCP President. However, our writing does not necessarily indicate his official position as President, nor does it represent the SCP leaders or membership at large. Nonetheless, some of our perspectives emerge from his experience as a member and leader of SCP and two EMPAs (Asian American Psychological Association, AAPA; Society for the Psychological Study of Ethnic Minority Issues, Division 45). Kathy P. Wu is a 1.5-generation Chinese American doctoral student in counseling psychology. She is interested in the psychology of success concerning multicultural immigrant groups. As an individual who immigrated to the United States at a young age, she proudly embodies the both-and framework in negotiating both of her cultural heritages. Whereas we attempt to present a holistic perspective, our thinking may have the aroma of a particular “Chinese philosophical flavor,” especially toward the end of the article.</p>
<sec id="section1-0011000011434992">
<title>Written and Oral History</title>
<p>The five articles about the EMPAs uniformly begin with a historical account of the respective organizations. This approach is very fitting as persons of color value history as a great source of reflection and guidance. It is a treat to have all these historical accounts in one volume. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0011000011434992">Delgado-Romero, Forrest, and Lau (2012)</xref> discuss, SCP has not always been at the forefront of the multicultural movement. There was a long period of time when overt racial tension was present, particularly surrounding the development of the multicultural counseling competencies. Collectively, these historical accounts serve as reminders of the journeys of the six organizations, which may also be summed up by a more contemporary saying: “It gets better.”</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0011000011434992">Delgado-Romero, Forrest, and Lau (2012)</xref> discuss the scattered written history available about EMPAs (and we would add SCP to this group) and the reliance on individuals and stories communicated orally. As we reviewed the historical accounts of the five EMPAs, we noted indeed that the authors had to collect information from various written sources (e.g., literature, meeting minutes) as well as personal communications. It would seem that having a comprehensive written account of an organization’s history that is kept up to date would be tremendously helpful. We certainly learned a great deal about the humble beginning, struggle, and triumph of the EMPAs from the five articles in this volume. On the other hand, oral history is a valued tradition among persons of color. It would have been nice to hear from these authors regarding what it was like for them to seek oral history from elders and living pioneers of the EMPAs. The factual historical information conveyed in these articles could be further enriched by storytelling (e.g., who the story teller is, the tone of the voice, the meaning making of stories). No two persons will tell a story in identical styles; each has unique ways to select story materials, arrange for sequencing, make conclusions, and package delivery. For that matter, much of the richness of oral history is lost in written history. Fortunately, with advances in digital video technology that preserves image and sound and makes them accessible to the whole world across time (e.g., YouTube), digital videos can be a valuable supplement to written history when direct oral communication is not feasible. In that regard we advocate for both written and oral history, perhaps with the assistance of video technology to preserve the historical perspectives of those who made history. When both written and oral histories are available, we imagine that there may be a different perspective about the relationship between SCP and EMPAs. The lived experience and stories of counseling psychologists of color who maneuver between SCP and EMPAs likely will shed light on the nature of the organizational relationships, which cannot be accounted for by the existence of formalized organizational relationships (or lack thereof).</p>

<title>Interconnectedness and Independence</title>
<p>From reading the articles in this major contribution and from our own experience, SCP and the five EMPAs seem to have the following in common: (a) valuation of culture, cultural competence, and social justice; (b) overlapping members and leaders; (c) organizational cultures that emphasize community and collaborative decision-making processes; and (d) emphasis on mentoring students and early career professionals. However, these articles also communicate somewhat different messages about how these organizational relationships should be. On one hand, there are advocates for more strategic and formal arrangements to strengthen the relationships between SCP and EMPAs (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0011000011434992">Alvarez, Singh, &amp; Wu, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0011000011434992">Chavez-Korell, Delgado-Romero, &amp; Illes, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0011000011434992">Delgado-Romero, Lau, &amp; Forrest, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0011000011434992">Gray, Carter, LaFromboise, &amp; BigFoot, 2012</xref>). On the other hand, there are emphases on autonomy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0011000011434992">Obasi, Speight, Rowe, Clark, &amp; Turner-Essel, 2012</xref>) and concerns about losing one’s own identity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0011000011434992">Morales, Lau, &amp; Ballesteros, 2012</xref>). These differences are also evident in the ways the four EMPAs (excluding Division 45) approach the issue of gaining voting seats on the American Psychological Association (APA) Governing Council.</p>
<p>We conceptualize the aforementioned issue as a dilemma of interconnectedness versus independence. Not surprisingly, we advocate for a both-and approach to this dilemma. As discussed previously, there are important commonalities that make it natural and beneficial for interconnectedness between SCP and EMPAs. Conversely, SCP and EMPAs are distinctively different organizations; each has its own mission and constituents. SCP is a specialty of professional psychology whereas EMPAs focus on ethnic minority issues in psychology, inclusive of all psychology subdisciplines. Independence is particularly the core value of the Association of Black Psychologists (ABPsi). A simple fact we learn from multicultural psychology is that one size does not fit all. On the basis of our both-and philosophy, we envision that SCP may establish both interconnected and independent relationships with the five EMPAs, tailoring for each EMPA’s values, leadership styles, and membership culture. Another possibility is that SCP and any one particular EMPA may be interconnected informally—but formally independent.</p>
<p>We would like to point out that there are additional reasons that may call for this both-and relational model. Although SCP currently does not have formal relationships with four of the EMPAs, it does collaborate closely with Division 45 and other culture- or population-based APA divisions such as Divisions 35 (Society for the Psychology of Women); 44 (Society for the Psychological Study of Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgender Issues); and, to a lesser degree, 51 (Society for the Psychological Study of Men and Masculinity). Whereas we cherish these interdivisional collaborations, we also wonder why other divisions are not joining this collaborative multicultural movement. Is it because a tight-knit cycle with formalized relationships makes others feel excluded? Is SCP being stereotyped as the APA division that forms relationships with culture-based associations, to the point that others do not feel that effort on their part is needed? Could it be that these formalized relationships demand more personnel and other resources, making it difficult to explore and establish new collaborative relationships? Or is it because other divisions are simply not interested? We use this example of APA interdivisional relationships to stimulate our thinking about SCP’s relationship with the EMPAs. In light of these questions, a both-and relational model of interconnectedness and independence may be worth trying between SCP and EMPAs.</p>

<title>Micro and Macro Issues</title>
<p>It is important to assess how the organizational and social issues salient within the stories of the EMPAs, SCP, and counseling psychology in general are being informed and confirmed by events transpiring beyond their safe professional walls. The moment we move away from this ecological framework will be the moment we begin to fester in bitterness and disdain about where we were and where we are going—while forgetting about who we are. Given our privileged both-and roles as participants-observers and researchers-practitioners, we can benefit from focusing on issues that affect the world at large. Just as this major contribution is born out of a need to better understand the inner workings of the EMPAs and perhaps help bridge apparent fissures between each of the EMPAs and SCP, we call for an even more worthwhile and ambitious project. We would like there to be collective long-term projects involving all EMPAs and SCP to better understand society-level issues such as the psychology of poverty, healthcare disparity, gender inequality, and other pervasive issues the United Nations and non-government organizations are tackling. Counseling psychology students and professionals are not immune to global economic woes, wars, and all the <italic>-isms</italic> in the world. The same is true for EMPAs and SCP. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0011000011434992">Franklin (2009)</xref> aptly stated,
<disp-quote>
<p>Our knowledge about ethnic and cultural experiences, the multiculturalism of the human experience should promote reduction of global conflicts, the achievement of universal human rights and world peace. Many of us have been in conversations both domestically and abroad with these beliefs clearly stated. Otherwise, what is the purpose of our ethnic psychological perspectives and promotion of multiculturalism? (p. 422)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>To some degree, we believe that SCP and EMPAs may be experiencing some effects of the original racism and social injustices present at the outset of these organizations. After all, the fact that the Civil Rights Movement served as the backdrop during the emergence of ABPsi and AAPA was no minor coincidence. With this reminder, we see how some of our current intergroup dynamics might be manifestations of persistent national and international issues of social justice, as psychologists are not above the societal fray. We are not advocating for a “let bygones be bygones” remediation approach because buried problems will only resurface at a later time. Instead, we wonder if we can step back and examine possible macro-level influences on our organizational dynamics. Perhaps by focusing our collective attention toward macro-level issues, we will achieve our micro-level goals of creating sustainable connectedness and loyalty within and between the EMPAs and SCP.</p>
<p>We cannot see any reason not to use our integrative approaches to understanding multicultural issues, using socially sensitive and creative problem solving, and committing to collaborative meaning making. Again borrowing <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0011000011434992">Franklin’s (2009</xref>, p. 422) words,
<disp-quote>
<p>As we seek to find solutions to these delicate issues how we work together as diverse ethnic, cultural, and allied groups within our multicultural movement will [and can] serve as a model to others on intergroup relations and collective efforts.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>This both-and approach will ultimately help to demonstrate how SCP and EMPAs can navigate and negotiate a place of collaboration and harmony, while transforming ways we can proactively address social justice issues in society.</p>

<sec id="section4-0011000011434992">
<title>A Story of Five Brothers</title>
<p>We conclude our commentary by telling a story. What we found interwoven within the articles of the major contribution is a well-cherished, albeit controversial, classic American children’s story, <italic>The Five Chinese Brothers</italic>, adapted from an ancient Chinese folklore by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0011000011434992">Bishop and Wiese (1938)</xref>. This children’s story is intended as an overly simplified attempt to impart the morals of resilience through collaboration and interconnectedness. It is not to be read for its persecutory theme, and we have no intent to connect it to historical events concerning the five EMPAs.</p>
<p>The story is about five identical brothers who each possess a unique superhuman power. First Brother can swallow the sea in whole; Second Brother has a neck of steel; Third Brother can stretch his limbs infinitely; Fourth Brother cannot be burned by fire; and Fifth Brother can hold his breath infinitely. One day, First Brother, a successful fisherman, reluctantly agrees to allow a young boy to accompany him on a routine fishing trip. First Brother swallows the seawater in whole to expose a scene the boy has never seen. The boy becomes fascinated by the treasures he finds in the seabed, and he ignores First Brother’s desperate signals to him to return to safe grounds. First Brother can only hold the water in his mouth for a limited time, and he is eventually forced to spew the seawater back to its rightful reservoir. Tragically, the boy disappears beneath the waves, and First Brother gets charged with the boy’s death. Before his execution, First Brother is granted his wish to return home to bid farewell to his mother. With the entire village watching, the brother accepts death by decapitation upon his return, but miraculously his neck is able to withstand the force of the executioner’s mighty axe. He is once again granted a chance to see his mother before his next execution. Upon his return, he is tossed into the deepest part of the sea, but yet again he survives death by drowning. After another visit with his mother, he is thrown into a pit of fire but lives to see another day. With one more chance to see his mother, the brother is finally tossed into an airless oven filled with whipped cream, but he steps back out as alive as ever. One by one, during visits with their mother, the four brothers secretly assumed First Brother’s place and each was able to use his own superhuman ability to survive. As a result of First Brother’s apparent fortitude and remarkable ability to survive, the judge revises his ruling and declares, “We have tried to get rid of you in every possible way and somehow it cannot be done. It must be that you are innocent.” In the end, First Brother is cleared of his charges and freed to return home to live happily ever after with his family.</p>
<p>We tell the story of the five brothers to illustrate some loose-fit parables. Although the five brothers look identical, each has his own special ability and vulnerability. Similarly, the SCP and EMPAs share common valuation for cultural competence, social justice, community, collaboration, and mentoring of students and early career professionals, yet each has its own mission, membership, initiatives, strengths, and weaknesses. Maybe it is wishful thinking, but we would like to believe that our organizations are stronger when we come together, complementing each organization’s unique assets, particularly in the face of adverse forces and oppression, much like the folklore of the five brothers. Yet this togetherness will never replace the individuality of each organization, for it is this individuality that makes the togetherness strong.</p>
