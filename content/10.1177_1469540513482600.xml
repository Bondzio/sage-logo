<p>Ethnographic accounts of the kinship practices that emerged in the last few decades with the help of assisted reproductive technologies frequently used the concepts of ‘normalization’ and ‘naturalization’ to explain how ‘pioneers’ of these family forms dealt with their novel experiences. The normalization/naturalization framework, I argue, obscures dimensions of the experiences of single women and lesbian couples who buy ‘donor’ sperm; I use the concepts of ‘the canny,’ ‘the uncanny,’ ‘confabulation,’ and ‘poetic license’ to illuminate these dimensions. Despite, and because of, the fact that these women buy sperm in order to obviate unwanted kin ties with the biological father, the existential status of the sperm and the absent presence of the biological father generate unease. With remarkable frequency, published memoirs of these maverick moms are peppered with synonyms for ‘the uncanny’ – ‘creepy’, ‘freaky’ and ‘strange’. The practices of sexing, naming, clothing, photographing, treating as imaginary correspondents or conversation partners, and purchasing symbolically-related consumer goods and services are used, often with ‘poetic license’, not just to make the strange familiar, but also to accentuate the strangeness of their relationship with the absent presence of the biological father.</p>

<p>Ethnographic accounts of the kinship practices that emerged in the last few decades with the help of assisted reproductive technologies frequently used the concepts of ‘normalization’ and ‘naturalization’ to explain how these family ‘pioneers’ dealt with their novel experiences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1469540513482600">Lewin 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1469540513482600">Ragoné 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1469540513482600">Franklin 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1469540513482600">Thompson 2005</xref>; Nordqvist 2010). In this article, I show how the related concepts of ‘the canny/uncanny’, ‘confabulation’ and ‘poetic license’ help illuminate dimensions of the experiences of single women and lesbian couples who buy ‘donor’ sperm that the ‘normalization/naturalization’ framework obscures. I focus on the troubling, ‘ghostlike’ presence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1469540513482600">Hertz 2006</xref>) that the biological father may have, even, or perhaps especially, when women buy sperm in order to obviate unwanted kin ties with these men.</p>
<p>Simmel maintains that ‘a money economy’ is ‘the most favourable situation for bringing about inner independence and the feeling of individual self-sufficiency’ (1978: 298). Women’s ability to buy sperm is recognized by single mothers by choice (SMCs) and lesbian mothers as an important source of self-sufficiency; a sub-head of Stonesifer’s how-to book is ‘Who Needs Men? The Thrill of Being Self-Sufficient’ (1994: 118). Yet, in spite of this apparent freedom, I have been struck by the level of discomfort the absent father poses. He appears in three sequential guises in narratives of SMCs and two-mom families – during donor selection, during insemination, and after a child has been born<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1469540513482600">1</xref></sup> – and in each of these manifestations, the ‘medicalization and commodification of intimacies’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1469540513482600">Plummer 2003</xref>: 27–28) and the ambiguous existential status of the man/sperm, generates unease. With remarkable frequency, first-person accounts are peppered with synonyms for ‘the uncanny’ including ‘creepy,’ ‘freaky,’ ‘bizarre,’ ‘weird,’ and ‘alien,’ ‘strange’ (and the related noun, ‘stranger’).</p>
<p>In my studies of American pregnancy-loss support group members (2000a, 2000b, 2001, 2003, 2004, 2006b, 2012, 2013b), I found that many bereaved parents used the practices of sexing, naming, clothing, picturing, treating as imaginary correspondents, conversation partners, and/or companions, and purchasing symbolically-related consumer goods to conjure and domesticate the presence of their wished-for but absent child. There are striking similarities between the strategies that SMC, two-mom families, and families that have suffered a pregnancy loss use in dealing with the ambiguous, problematical status of a missing family member.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1469540513482600">2</xref></sup> Among SMCs and two-mom families, these acts sometimes seem designed to make the strange familiar; other times, they appear to be deployed in order to acknowledge and even accentuate the strangeness.

<sec id="sec2-1469540513482600"><title>Background and methods</title>
<p>In the early 1980s, organizations supporting American women who wanted to start a family without a male partner were established. SMCs<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-1469540513482600">3</xref></sup> are, for the most part, heterosexual, white, well-educated,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-1469540513482600">4</xref></sup> urban, and over 35.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-1469540513482600">5</xref></sup> An estimated three-quarters of SMCs use sperm purchased from a sperm bank (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1469540513482600">Harmon, 2005</xref>) and it is these SMCs upon whom I focus here. My research on SMCs is based on the books (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1469540513482600">Mattes, 1994</xref>; Morrissette, 2008), newsletters, blogs, and chat rooms of two organizations (Single Mothers by Choice and Choice Moms), social scientific studies (especially <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1469540513482600">Hertz, 2006</xref>), an in-depth case study of one American SMC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1469540513482600">Layne, 2012</xref>, in press), and most importantly for this article, published memoirs of American SMCs<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-1469540513482600">6</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1469540513482600">Sloan, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1469540513482600">Askowitz, 2008</xref>; Soseth, 2008), and a documentary film about the filmmaker and three other American SMCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1469540513482600">Fishel, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>By the 1990s, increasing numbers of lesbian couples in the USA began to create families together using donor sperm, a trend often referred to as the ‘gayby boom’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1469540513482600">James, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1469540513482600">Blake, 2009</xref>). In terms of age, race and class, this group of mothers is similar to SMCs. Material on this type of family is drawn from social scientific studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1469540513482600">Lewin, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1469540513482600">Sullivan, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1469540513482600">Mamo, 2007</xref>), two published memoirs of North American lesbian-coupled mothers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1469540513482600">Aizley, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1469540513482600">Miller, 2010</xref>), and two published collections of first-person accounts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1469540513482600">Aizley, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1469540513482600">Goldberg and Brushwood Rose, 2009</xref>), and email correspondence with several north American clients of the UK-based group, Pride Angel, that sells do-it-yourself insemination kits.</p>

<sec id="sec3-1469540513482600"><title>The ‘canny/uncanny,’ ‘confabulation,’ and ‘poetic license’</title>
<p>In a 1919 essay on ‘The Uncanny’,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-1469540513482600">7</xref></sup> Freud gathered together the preceding aesthetic and literary theories on this topic. I draw on Freud’s presentation and reflections on these theories, rather than his particular contributions to the subject, to explore the feelings expressed in narrative accounts. In other words, I am not engaging in or advocating a psychoanalytic approach, but rather bringing to bear neglected aesthetic theories to discourse analysis in the anthropology of reproduction.</p>
<p>One of the most striking features of the concept ‘canny’, <italic>heimlich</italic>, is that it has two nearly opposing meanings. The first is ‘belonging to the house or the family … familiar tame, intimate … arousing a sense of peaceful pleasure and security’ as within the four walls of one’s own house (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1469540513482600">Freud, 1949</xref>: 371–372). The second is ‘concealed, kept from sight’, that which is ‘hidden, secret, mysterious’ (1949: 129). It is in this sense that the meaning of ‘canny’ resembles its opposite. The ‘uncanny’, <italic>unheimlich</italic>, refers to the ‘unhomey, unfamiliar, untame, uncomfortable, eerie, weird’ (Freud, 1991: 375).</p>
<p>One reason the ‘uncanny’ creates feelings of uneasiness is thought to be because it is ‘novel’ and ‘unfamiliar’(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1469540513482600">Freud, 2003</xref>: 125). According to this view, ‘the essential condition’ for creating a ‘sense of uncanniness’ is ‘intellectual uncertainty’ hence, ‘the uncanny would always be an area in which a person was unsure of his way around’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1469540513482600">Freud, 2003</xref>: 125). This sense of the ‘uncanny’ is also evident from its etymological root. ‘Canny’, from the Anglo-Saxon root ‘ken’, means ‘knowledge, understanding, or cognizance’. ‘Uncanny’, thus is ‘an idea beyond one's ken’, something outside one's familiar knowledge or perceptions. Freud uses ‘the uncanny’ to describe ‘the class of frightening things that leads us back to what is known and familiar’(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1469540513482600">Freud, n.d</xref>.: 1). SMCs and lesbian moms engage in a number of practices that traffic back and forth between the familiar and the bizarre, the comfortable and the strange.</p>
<p>One of the frequent ways SMCs and lesbian moms produce and manage the canny/uncanny dimensions of their experience is via ‘confabulation’. The root <italic>fabulari</italic> means to talk or chat, hence the usage ‘to engage in a confab with someone’. It is also the root of ‘fable’ so ‘to confabulate with another person is “to fable with” that person …’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1469540513482600">Hirstein, 2006</xref>: 7). In this sense, ‘confabulation’ is considered to be a ‘basic feature of the human mind, having to do with the way we form beliefs and report them to others’, an element of ‘the human gift for story-telling’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1469540513482600">Hirstein, 2006</xref>: 5). When members of these new family forms engage in ‘confabulation’, their acts can be understood to be attempts to make their family-making stories more plausible, i.e., efforts at ‘normalization’. Other times, however, these confabulatory practices accentuate and play with the queerness of the situation.</p>
<p>Since the early 1900s, ‘confabulation’ has been used to designate a psychiatric disorder involving the memory. In the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders IV, it is defined as ‘the recitation of imaginary events to fill in gaps in memory’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1469540513482600">Hirstein, 2006</xref>: 2). Because of this psychiatric association, it is hard to use the term in a non-pejorative sense. Another avenue for understanding these practices, one that obviates this issue, is fiction, and in particular the concept of ‘poetic license’. Freud refers to ‘poetic license’ in his essay on ‘the uncanny’, noting that this allows ‘the imaginative writer’ to ‘select his [sic] world of representation so that it either coincides with the realities we are familiar with or departs from them in what particulars he [sic] pleases’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1469540513482600">Freud, 2003</xref>: 156). In fairy tales, for instance, the world of reality is left behind from the very start, and the animistic system of beliefs is frankly adopted. ‘Wish-fulfillments, secret powers, omnipotence of thoughts, animation of inanimate objects’(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1469540513482600">Freud, 2003</xref>: 156), all common features of fairy tales, are evident in the narratives of these non-normative family-makers.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-1469540513482600">8</xref></sup></p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec4-1469540513482600"><title>Phantom fathers</title>
<p>SMCs and two-mom families are acutely aware that their family does not correspond to the social norm. During the 1990s and 2000s, as SMCs and lesbian-couple families were becoming more common, ‘father-absent families’ became a focus of the ‘family values’ debate in the USA and all manner of social problems were attributed to the abandonment of the ‘unified model of father, mother and child’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1469540513482600">Quayle, 1992</xref>). Although SMCs and lesbian couples no doubt realize that ‘the “typical” American family – with its married mother and father and its two cherubic kids – is becoming more atypical every year’, many recognize that ‘it is still accepted as the norm’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1469540513482600">Miller, 2010</xref>: 13). One of the motivations for Rose and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1469540513482600">Goldberg (2009</xref>: 8) to write their book on lesbian mothers was to provide a counterweight to the ‘still all-pervasive ideals of the “nuclear family”.’</p>

<sec id="sec5-1469540513482600"><title>Sperm shopping: Man among men</title>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1469540513482600">Soiseth (2008</xref>: 104) found ‘choosing a father … a strange and somewhat creepy process’. Another SMC likened the process to ‘a bizarre sort of blind date’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1469540513482600">Mattes, 1994</xref>: 34). Miller describes ‘this business of shopping for sperm’ as a ‘bizarre role of the dice’ (2010: 15). Askowitz thought ‘getting sperm from a bank to make a baby was bizarre, something out of a freaky newspaper story … I didn’t want my baby being part of that strange beginning’ (2008: 46).</p>
<p>The act of purchasing sperm is a clear source of discomfort. The government, organizations, and corporations that deal in the exchange of human tissue go to a great effort to protect the sanctity of human bodies by prohibiting, or at least disguising, the commercial aspects of their exchange. Making sperm into a consumer product through purchase creates uneasiness and, as we shall see, to a certain extent, this transformation fails. One of the SMCs quoted by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1469540513482600">Sloan (2007: 38</xref>) in her chapter ‘Buying Dad: How to Make the Most Natural Thing in the World Unnatural’ describes how ‘bizarre’ it felt to be ‘picking out the father of your child like you’re picking out shoes’. Askowitz recalls that she was offered sperm that was on sale, ‘a two for the price of one special’, and observed that she had not anticipated ‘picking my baby’s biology – from the sale rack’ (2008: 70). Shuler had trouble deciding between donors so picked her top ten and had the clinic go down the list, ordering different sperm each month until she got pregnant. She found it ‘fun to discover who the “donor of the month”’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-1469540513482600">9</xref></sup> In fact, the European Sperm Bank does feature ‘donors of the month’ which/with they offer on special. The bizarreness of having such expansive choice and control when selecting from sperm banks leads Sloan to liken herself to a science fiction character – ‘I felt like Madeline Kahn as Empress Nympho, picking escorts “Yes, no, no, no, no, yes”’ (2007: 38).</p>
<p>One of the most common domains of consumption to which sperm is likened is food. Aizley puts it this way, ‘the genetic world is our oyster, and buying sperm is much like shopping at Sam’s Club or Costco. There are so many choices, such mass quantities of hair, skin tone, and childhood diseases, of grandparents’ hobbies and maternal aunts’ educational backgrounds … as we cruise down the aisles with our genetic shopping list’ (2003: 24–25). Shuler observed, ‘For anyone who has trouble choosing among the moo – goo-gai-pan, moo shu pork or sweet and sour shrimp at a Chinese restaurant, selecting the father of your child could be a really tough one’ (2010: 18). When given the choice of having the sperm sent with dry ice or in a tank of liquid nitrogen, Aizley chooses dry ice because ‘it’s so much friendlier sounding … I can picture … the sperm arriving on ice like shrimp cocktail or a frozen daiquiri’ (2003: 46). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1469540513482600">Askowitz (2008</xref>: 75) puns, describing how much each ‘freeze pop’ of sperm costs. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1469540513482600">Soiseth (2008</xref>) compares sperm selection to choosing the ingredients for something to bake.</p>
<p>The interchangeability of men that the market in sperm creates is one of the features of the experience that provokes feelings of unease. Several women relate how, when they learned that the sperm they had selected had ‘sold out’, or was ‘out of stock’, they simply went ‘back to the catalogue to pick another’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1469540513482600">Miller, 2010</xref>: 15). After Aizely and her partner had settled ‘on four finalists’, they picked the father-to-be by drawing straws only to learn that ‘the six-footer’ they had selected was ‘sold out’ (2003: 33). Others replace the ‘father’ they had selected with a substitute if they don’t get pregnant. Miller tried a donor who ‘came from the same mishmash of European heritage as her partner, had a master’s degree, and had parents who were both university professors’, for four inseminations to no avail, then switched to the sperm of a medical student on the assumption, ‘his sperm might have some special insider knowledge about how to penetrate an egg’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1469540513482600">Miller, 2010</xref>: 19).</p>
<p>Interchageablity contributes to the feelings of ‘uncanniness’ and is evident in the use of dolls to represent the bio dad. The cover art for <italic>Buying Dad</italic> is of a row of identical Ken dolls with different skin tones, hair color and outfits. The picture has high creep value. Freud noted that dolls are often associated with feelings of ‘the uncanny’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1469540513482600">Freud, 1949</xref>: 385). This capacity of dolls is heightened by an additional characteristic associated with the ‘uncanny’ – ‘repetition’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1469540513482600">Freud, 2003</xref>: 142). These dolls are identical in all core respects; in terms of what matters in this context, their maleness, they are entirely interchangeable. A similar trope is found in the marketing materials of the London Sperm Bank, which combine two generic symbols of maleness – male pictograms and the geometric sign for men. A row of identical pink pictograms of men are shown with the geometric male symbol superimposed over their genital areas. The symbol is hanging down and the point of the arrow/penis has been replaced with a square, suggesting a lock box; the choice man is distinguished only by an erect uptick/dick. These illustrations exemplify a feature that Simmel associated with money societies where although individuals are dependent on a much broader array of people than are people in ‘simple’ societies, it is ‘the interchangeability’ of the people upon whom we depend that allows such a great degree of freedom (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1469540513482600">Simmel 1978</xref>: 299) (Figure 3).</p>
<p>One of the ways SMCs and lesbian couples deal with the discomfort generated by choosing is by assigning each potential donor a nickname. Much like the womb names given during the liminal period of pregnancy, these nicknames speak to the uncertainty of the ‘person's true identity’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1469540513482600">Layne, 2006</xref>). Miller describes how she and her partner ‘began by looking for a Man’ but ended up picking ‘a semi-fictional guy’, the ‘characteristics of a man …, hidden behind a scrim of anonymity’ (2010: 11).</p>
<p>The nicknames make it easier to talk about phantom father possibilities, but ironically, they do so by objectifying men based on appearance, much as men have been criticized for doing to women. For instance, Aizley and her partner named the donors they are considering ‘Squirrel’, ‘Unibrow’, ‘Big Jew’, and ‘Giant Jew’, and the one they ultimately pick ‘Baldie’ (2003: 33–34). Bowers and her partner selected an anonymous donor whom they nicknamed ‘Mr. Honesty’, since he admitted the reason he donated was for the money (2009). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1469540513482600">Sloan (2007</xref>: 3–5) not only nicknamed the sperm donors she used (‘Don Juan’ who was later renamed ‘Mr. Blanks’, and ‘Green Eyes’), but also the two men at the hardware store who refilled the nitrogen tank in which she kept the sperm frozen (‘Short Guy’ and ‘Tall Guy’).</p>

<sec id="sec6-1469540513482600"><title>Up close and personal: Sperm in a can, one’s house, one’s car, and one’s vagina</title>
<p>Once the sperm is purchased and has been delivered either to a doctor’s office or one’s home, its ‘uncanny’ qualities loom large. Just as with bereaved parents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1469540513482600">Layne, 2013b</xref>), one source of ‘uncanniness’ is the breaching the socially accepted boundaries between private and public, i.e. by bringing into the light something that by convention should be kept concealed. Such breaches can also be a source of humor. In the comedy film <italic>Baby Mama</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1469540513482600">McCullers, 2008</xref>), Tina Fey plays an SMC, a single, childless, professional woman who decides to undergo pregnancy on her own. After having selected her sperm donor, she is shown exiting the sperm bank onto a crowded sidewalk, gingerly holding her purchase – a thermos-shaped stainless steel container with a Pennsylvania Cryobank label clearly visible. As she passes men on the sidewalk, she extends her arm out in front of her, creating as much distance as possible between herself and the sperm.</p>
<p>Another factor that contributes to purchased sperm’s capacity for engendering feelings of ‘the uncanny’ has to do with ‘disembodiment’, ‘the process whereby body parts, fluids, and organs are removed from their physical and somatic contexts and viewed as independent of the human forms from which they come’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1469540513482600">Moore, 2007</xref>: 56). Although it is ‘normal’ for sperm to separate from men, the distance, both in terms of time and space, between when/where it is separated from the man, and when/where SMCs and lesbian couples encounter it, adds to the strangeness of the experience. In this way, the purchased sperm resembles the ‘severed limbs, a severed head, a hand detached from the arm, feet that dance by themselves’ that Freud describes as ‘highly uncanny’. This sense of uncanniness is heightened, as Freud observed, when these detached body parts ‘are credited … with independent activity’ (2003: 150). The fact that sperm is still ‘alive’ and purchased precisely because of its capacity for ‘independent activity,’ make it a highly potent source for ‘uncanny’ feelings. Several films on donor conception, including Fishel’s film on single mothers by choice, include close up film footage of moving sperm (Figure 4).</p>
<p>Furthermore, the existential quality of purchased, disembodied sperm is unclear: is it an ‘it’? a ‘baby’? a ‘man’? or some combination of these?<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-1469540513482600">10</xref></sup> First-person accounts reveal efforts to personify, masculinize or feminize, infantilize, and dehumanize it. Sometimes it is treated as an ‘it’, sometimes as the wished-for ‘child’, sometimes as a ‘man’, and even, in one case, as a ‘woman’ (when dressed up to resemble/impersonate a woman’s lesbian partner). In tellingly ironic wording, one SMC criticized those who ‘think of the donor as just sperm. But <italic>it</italic> is a person, and <italic>it</italic> is half of my child’s DNA’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1469540513482600">Sloan 2007</xref>: 41 emphasis added).</p>
<p>One way to deal with the unease that sperm, or more accurately, semen,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-1469540513482600">11</xref></sup> may cause is to pretend it’s something else, something more impersonal. For example, because the term ‘insemination’ gave her ‘a weird feeling in [her] stomach’, Soiseth decides to use the term ‘injection’ instead (2008: 97).</p>
<p>Some women who choose donor insemination are quite familiar with sperm; others have never encountered it before. Miller personified the sperm used for her first insemination as ‘pioneers in my uterus,’ and, with a nod to science fiction, as ‘venturing where no sperm had gone before’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1469540513482600">Miller, 2010</xref>: 18). She describes how she felt lying on the table at the clinic ‘waiting to be impregnated with the sperm of a complete stranger’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1469540513482600">Miller, 2010</xref>: 17). Another woman recalls sitting on the exam table after insemination realizing that ‘her body [had] been invaded’ and she didn’t know ‘from whom the semen [was]’ (Stonesifer, 1994: 136).</p>
<p>For those who inseminate at home, the sperm may be even more disturbing (Nordqvist, 2011). A ‘vat of liquid nitrogen sitting in the middle of the room’ disturbs the hominess of home, that to which the first meaning of ‘the canny’ refers. Miller reports that it felt like ‘a third person – both anonymous donor and potential child – standing on the rug, staring at us’ (2010: 25) as she and her partner attempted to make love in order to create ‘the intimacy that is supposed to go with getting pregnant’. She found the vat/man/child so disturbing she turned the other way in the bed so as to not have to see it but still found all she ‘could think about was sperm’. Noting how unfamiliar this was, she remarked, ‘This is not what a lesbian generally wants in bed’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1469540513482600">Miller, 2010</xref>: 25).</p>
<p>The mixing of commerce, medicine and intimacy is a source of apprehension and uneasiness. When Miller and her partner find they are unable to make love while being watched by their vat of sperm, they decide to ‘get down to <italic>business</italic>’– her partner put on latex gloves, read the ‘handling/thawing instructions’, and removed the catheter from its plastic package–a process which they understandably found ‘weird’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1469540513482600">Miller, 2010</xref>: 25, 26 emphasis added).</p>
<p>In an effort to decrease the ‘weirdness’ of the disembodied sperm of a ‘stranger’, women who buy sperm often attempt to domesticate it using similar practices to those used by bereaved parents when dealing with their dead newborns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1469540513482600">Layne, 2012</xref>) – conversing with, taking photos of, dressing, sexing, and naming.</p>
<sec id="sec7-1469540513482600"><title>Conversing with</title>
<p>Purchased sperm and its material traces or symbolic stand-ins are sometimes addressed conversationally, especially when in non-medical settings. For example, Soiseth, who had been provided the first name of her anonymous donor, vividly describes her interactions with her chosen sperm/man while it/he is in her house:<disp-quote>
<p>Olaf, manifest in the DNA frozen inside his millions of sperm, waits in his beige container. … I feel him there as I eat dinner. When I can’t stand the silence anymore, I turn and say, ‘Want to join me?’ I lift the container to the chair across from me and talk about the egg-white discharge [of ovulation that she is waiting for], about my day. [After dinner], I take the container with me to the living room to sit beside me as I watch TV. There’s not a peep of complaint when I keep changing the channel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1469540513482600">Soiseth, 2008</xref>: 115, 119).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-1469540513482600">12</xref></sup></p></disp-quote><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1469540513482600">Sloan (2007</xref>: 5) describes introducing her sperm to her sister and her mother while lying in bed at her mother’s house after inseminating herself. She held up ‘the empty inch-long plastic vial’ and said: ‘I should introduce you to Dad.’ ‘Caroline this is Dad. Dad, Caroline.’ Her mother replied: ‘Nice to meet ya, Dad.’ (Figure 5).</p>
<p>In an eerily similar manner, Aaron Sachs, the son of a lesbian couple who used anonymous sperm, reports that in college he used to ‘often joke … with my friends or the girls I was dating. ‘Hey, would you like to meet my father?’’ and then would show them the information sheet he had on his donor and introduce them saying, ‘X, I’d like you to meet my father. Father, please say hi to X’ (2009: 76).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-1469540513482600">13</xref></sup> Though materially different, the paper information sheet and the empty plastic vial are both marshaled to make present ‘the man behind the sperm’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1469540513482600">Hertz, 2006</xref>: 61).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec8-1469540513482600"><title>Taking photos of</title>
<p>Photography is used to keep present a lasting record of the transitory sperm. Sloan and Soiseth both report taking ‘tons of pictures’, of their personified/masculinized sperm/man. Remarkably, both chose to photograph him on the move. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1469540513482600">Sloan (2007</xref>: 5) has her ‘Mom take a picture of me strapping “Dad” in his nitrogen tank into the backseat’ of her car. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1469540513482600">Soiseth (2008</xref>: 118) takes ‘a picture of Olaf in his seat belt before lugging the container’ into the clinic.

In Johnny Symons’ documentary, <italic>Beyond Conception</italic>, a lesbian couple is filmed carrying their purchase out of the sperm bank together and strapping it into the built-in baby seat in the back of their car (Figure 6).</p>
<p>A good friend of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1469540513482600">Askowitz’s (2008</xref>: 4) who was a professional photographer accompanied her to her first insemination.

<sec id="sec9-1469540513482600"><title>Dressing and sexing</title>
<p>I found one case of dressing, or more accurately, ‘cross-dressing’ the sperm. Aizley ‘dresse[d] up the tank’ to look like her partner, with her partner’s favorite hat, one of her shirts, and her glasses, ‘Voila! It’s her, and the sperm is hers, and we’re one big normal family!’ (2003: 66).</p>

<sec id="sec10-1469540513482600"><title>Poetic license in crafting fantasy fathers for and with the child</title>
<p>Several mothers report that once they are pregnant, the sperm donor fades from their consciousness but reappears once again when the child starts asking ‘the Daddy questions’. Because the profiles provided by sperm banks offer only limited information, many women use the child’s otherwise unexplained characteristics ‘to craft a man in her [child’s] own image’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1469540513482600">Hertz, 2006</xref>: 65).</p>
<p>Drawing on in-depth interviews with 65 SMCs, Hertz describes the process by which, together with their children, mothers craft ‘fantasy fathers’, a process that she believes is important for the mental health of the children. ‘Mothers and their children … create stories about who those men are in order to help children pin down or concretize their self-images’ (2006: 60). Together, they ‘create a man who is a positive yet invisible presence’. Hertz concludes that the resulting men are ‘more ghostlike than real’ (2006: 63).</p>
<p>One SMC told me how despite the fact that she had told her daughter many times about the nice man in California who helped her make her, her four-year old daughter started telling people her father had died. This ‘confabulation’ provided a more readily comprehensible explanation to herself and her peers about who and where her ‘daddy’ was than the account her mother had supplied. The mother was unsure whether she should allow her daughter this ‘poetic license,’ at least for the time being, or whether she needed to correct her.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn14-1469540513482600">14</xref></sup></p>
<sec id="sec11-1469540513482600"><title>Naming</title>
<p>Naming the sperm donor/bio father also occurs at this stage of SMC narratives, in response to the prompting of their children. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1469540513482600">Soiseth (2008</xref>: 278) ends her memoir describing how on Father’s Day when her daughter was three, she learned that her daughter ‘had an elaborate fantasy about her father who, like an imaginary friend, is present in her life and comforts her’ and who she believed would soon be coming to live with them. Soiseth explained to her daughter that her father lived in Denmark, they didn’t know him, and he would not be coming to live with them. Her daughter was unfazed and told her: ‘His name is Taylor.’ Soiseth laughed and said: ‘Sure, we can call him Taylor.’ To which her daughter replied, ‘His name is Mumbaram’ and Soiseth replied that that name was also okay (2008: 281). Much as parents and children feel entitled to choose a name for a new baby who is ‘on the way,’ but not yet fully there, this mother and child felt they had the license to pick a name for this absent presence in their family’s imaginary.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec12-1469540513482600"><title>Corresponding with and picturing</title>
<p>One SMC told of how she and her son ‘wrote letters to [the anonymous sperm donor] in case we ever know who he is.’ Hertz likens this to writing letters to Santa Claus (2006: 65), a comforting, benevolent, fictional male character. That same mother reported that she and her son drew pictures ‘of what we think he looks like’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1469540513482600">Hertz 2006</xref>: 65).</p>

<sec id="sec13-1469540513482600"><title>Buying symbolically-related consumer goods and services</title>
<p>Some SMC and two-mom families worry that their children will grow up feeling ‘they have been missing something’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1469540513482600">Cole, 2009</xref>: 142). One of the ways mothers try to make up for this absence is by making sure there are other ‘male role models’ in their children’s lives (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1469540513482600">Layne, 2010</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1469540513482600">2013a</xref>). Another is by providing their child or children with consumer goods and services that reflect the donor’s ethnic identity, much as families who adopt internationally do (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1469540513482600">Dorow 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1469540513482600">Traver, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1469540513482600">Yngvesson, 2003</xref>). One thread on the SMC web forum is ‘paternal heritage’. One woman anticipates that she will expose her child to Turkish cooking as a way of honoring the biological father’s ethnic background. One Jewish, lesbian couple from the San Francisco Bay Area who used the sperm of a Chinese American try to hire baby sitters who are Chinese because they feel ‘it is important that [their son] be exposed to the Chinese aspects of his ethnicity', (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1469540513482600">Sullivan, 2004</xref>: 105). The Asian American who features in my in-depth case study of an SMC has opted for Spanish (rather than Mandarin Chinese) lessons for her three-year old daughter because the sperm donor she used is Cuban and interestingly, she has chosen ‘Carmen’ as her pseudonym in our publications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1469540513482600">Layne 2013a</xref>, in press).</p>

<sec id="sec14-1469540513482600" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title>
<p>Sometimes, the practices used to conjure and manage the absent family member can be understood as acts of ‘normalization’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn15-1469540513482600">15</xref></sup> and/or ‘naturalization’, but the cases explored here indicate that these concepts do not do justice to the complexity of these family-making practices. One reason for this is that both ‘normalization’ and ‘naturalization’ are unidirectional; they attempt to redefine something that is experienced as ‘abnormal’ or ‘unnatural’ as something ‘normal’ and ‘natural’. The movement is always from the ‘socially defiant’ to the ‘socially accepted.’ The concepts of the ‘canny’ and ‘uncanny’, in contrast, point to the fluidity of such distinctions and the fact that at least some of these parents’ practices move in both directions. Sometimes they make the strange more familiar, other times, their practices, including those of ‘confabulation’ and ‘poetic license’, accentuate the strangeness of their experiences rather than normalizing them.</p>
<p>Heterosexual SMCs have ambiguous relations with ‘normal’. Most SMCs assert that family-making without a man is not what they wanted or planned. In SMC circles ‘going it alone’ is referred to as ‘Plan B’ and many talk of having to grieve the dream of a white wedding and a house with a picket fence. Indeed, some do not give up on this dream and hope that somewhere along the line, they will still find ‘Mr. Right’. Nevertheless, becoming mothers in this way is something they do choose, plan, and consciously pursue, well aware that they in so doing they ‘depart’ (and/or ‘deviate’) from the norms ‘that govern family creation’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1469540513482600">Hertz, 2006</xref>: 50). Yet, while SMCs ‘free themselves from the social norms of married motherhood’ and ‘forge their own path’, they do ‘not set out to break new ground’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1469540513482600">Hertz, 2006</xref>: 138). Despite having ‘chosen unusual routes to motherhood,’ their ‘desire to have ordinary children – to fit in’ is paramount and as a result, ‘they end up reaffirming certain kinds of kinship rather than challenging them’. In fact, Hertz believes that single mothers by choice are tolerated as an alternative to the nuclear family only to the extent that they ‘stay below the radar’ (2006: 139). As we have seen, the dissonance between the social norm and the chosen path is registered in the expression of the uncanny.</p>
<p>Lesbian mothers, whether single or coupled, are also well aware that they are forging new family forms and ‘pioneering new languages, laws, roles, and relationships’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1469540513482600">Brushwood Rose and Goldberg, 2009</xref>: 8) but they are positioned in a very different way from the missing member of the nuclear triad. Lesbian women do not wish for a husband in the way that many straight SMCs do, and their stance vis-à-vis certain social norms also differs. Cade Russo-Young (2009: 212), the daughter of a lesbian couple conceived with donor sperm in the late 1970s, paints a very dissimilar picture of her mothers than SMCs who strive to ‘stay under the radar.’ She describes them as having ‘burst onto the scene, bright and colourful and unafraid’, ‘making up the rules as they went along’, and thinking of themselves as ‘part of a new movement in America’. Lesbian moms appear to be more likely than straight, single mothers by choice to ‘revel in their families’ uniqueness, see the unexpected as a strength, something to be celebrated, despite – or even because of – the challenges that difference poses’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1469540513482600">Brushwood Rose and Goldberg, 2009</xref>: 9). Practices such as dressing up a vat of frozen sperm to look like one’s lesbian lover, or introducing a empty sperm vial as ‘Dad' take the creepiness out of these unfamiliar situations, not by ‘normalizing’, but by what queer theorists would call ‘by troubling the normal’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1469540513482600">Mamo, 2007</xref>: 6).</p>
<p>Despite these differences between heterosexual SMCs and lesbian moms, both appear to be troubled by the mixing of commerce and intimate family making. According to Simmel, ‘money is responsible for impersonal relations between people … [it] makes possible relationships between people but leaves them personally undisturbed’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1469540513482600">Simmel, 1978</xref>: 297, 303). As we have seen, despite these women’s choice to purchase sperm in order to use the alienating power of money to free themselves from unwanted kin ties with the biological father, ‘buying dad’ is disturbing. It is disturbing not only because of breaking the social taboo of treating people like objects that can be bought and sold; it is equally disturbing because the alienating power of money fails. Once purchased, sperm fails to behave like a consumer product. Unlike shoes; this product cannot be returned to the store or put back into circulation in the market. Shuler explained that she didn’t want to buy in bulk– ‘I didn’t need a bunch of extra sperm lying around. What do you do with it? It’s not like you can set it out at a garage sale’ (2010: 24). And unlike food, which once consumed, by insertion into the body, is gone; after sperm is consumed by insertion into the body, at least if successful, it does not go away but grows and grows into an ever-more noticeable presence. So, too, the man from whence it came.</p>
<p>Despite efforts transmogrify through poetic license and confabulation the donor into a absent presence suitable for the cosy confines of family life, some SMCs and lesbian couples are still haunted by him. At first Aizely’s partner felt a keen need to see a picture of the potential donors, but later agreed it would be better not see them, ‘it’s better … to fantasize a man who looks like your partner, than to raise your family in the shadow of a stranger whose photo lurks upstairs in a locked file cabinet … like some sort of ghost daddy’ (2003: 30). Even without a picture, the profile, (knowledge materialized on paper) can be troubling. Once pregnant, Aizely was ‘freaked out’ when she looked at her donor’s profile. ‘It’s like throwing on fluorescent lights in a room once dimly lit by candles and the glow of burning incense’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1469540513482600">Aizley, 2003</xref>: 281).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn16-1469540513482600">16</xref></sup> She regrets not having kept ‘the truth’ locked up in the filing cabinet.</p>
<p>But though of the materiality of a real live person out there somewhere is disturbing, his materiality is also understood as an additional resource, one worth paying extra for. Sperm donors are now seen as an asset SMCs and lesbian couples can provide their children as evidenced in the increasingly popular practice of selecting ‘yes’ donors – men who are willing to make themselves known to the children they help create. Clearly, the concept of ‘having it both ways’ is both exemplified and challenged by the practice of ‘buying dad.’</p>

<p>Bonaccorso’s (2009:57--63) account of heterosexual Italian couples using donor sperm in the late 1990s provides an interesting comparison. She found these couples, much like the SMCs and lesbian moms described in this article, experienced the donor as a “mysterious” “unsettling” unbid presence and preoccupation before and during insemination. For the heterosexual couples, after insemination his importance diminished and his contribution was recast as a ‘depersonalized, trivialized, deemphasized collection of cells.’ Among the women I have studied, as we have seen, the donor's existence is not so easily sidelined because of the obvious absence of a father in SMC and two-mom families.</p></fn>

<p>She confides that she ‘felt sort of naughty-like I was “sleeping around” but without the possible danger of contracting an STD!’ (2010: 15). When her ‘Top Ten donor roulette’ resulted in a pregnancy on her third try she couldn’t remember who ‘the man of the month’ was and had to dig out his profile (2010: 28).</p></fn>

<p>Moore notes the propensity to anthropomorphize sperm, usually as ‘men’ but sometimes having qualities associated with children (2007: 48).</p></fn>
<fn id="fn11-1469540513482600"><label>11</label>
<p>According to Moore, the term ‘sperm’ is used more frequently than ‘semen’ and because sperm is so often anthropomorphized in popular culture, women are more likely to visualize ‘sperm cells dashing through tunnels and racing through obstacle courses, rather than semen floating in cervical mucus’ (2007:5).</p></fn>
<fn id="fn12-1469540513482600"><label>12</label>
<p>Note the sexual reversal here. In the USA men control the ‘control panel’ much more frequently than women and change the channels much more frequently, often to the dismay of their female partners (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1469540513482600">Bellamy and Walker, 1996:142</xref>).</p></fn>

<p>Shuler, too, conflates the printed profile with the man. Once she was pregnant she ‘put the profile away in a safe place. The donor had been a means to an end and that having been accomplished, could be relegated to the filing cabinet’ (2010: 28).</p></fn>

<p>As it happens, this family had recently taken possession of the grandfather’s house, a man who in many ways held a similar position in this child’s family imaginary, as a benevolent, male, kin figure whom she had never met because he had died.</p></fn>
<fn id="fn15-1469540513482600"><label>15</label>
<p>Fishel’s website describes her hope that her documentary will help ‘normalize a process that felt bizarre and foreign’ (2010).</p></fn>

<p>Freud gives as an example of the blurring of the two opposing meanings of canny, a person who is a ‘stranger’ who then becomes a ‘familiar’ (2003: 127). In this passage, the second meaning of ‘canny’ is apparent, that which is, or should be, ‘concealed,’ ‘kept secret’, ‘locked away’ (2003: 129, 133).</p></fn></fn-group></notes>
