<abstract>
<p>Can ambiguous vision statements help to initiate strategic change? We draw on organizational and political concepts to make the case that ambiguity in the expression of future aspirations enables a sense of alignment between local and larger organizational goals that eases the political path to successful change. We also explore the paradox that, occasionally, the path out of ambiguity involves the initial injection of even more ambiguity into an already ambiguous situation. In addition, we demonstrate that consideration of a practical problem (how to effectively initiate strategic change) and a nonobvious recommendation (to employ an intentionally ambiguous vision) leads to a deeper exploration of key processes involved in the revision of personal and organizational knowledge.</p>

<p>It is the age of ambiguity. We live in a turbulent era that requires our institutions to change with dramatically changing times. In such an unsettled world where the necessity for leading change from the top has become such a staple of modern organizational life, how then might organizational leaders most effectively launch strategic change? The received wisdom on strategy formulation and implementation suggests that the most effective way to initiate change is to articulate the desired outcomes of the change effort with as much clarity and specificity as possible (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1056492612447229">Andrews, 1971</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1056492612447229">Ansoff, 1965</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1056492612447229">Drucker, 1954</xref>). The apparent operating assumption is that if organization members clearly understand the ultimate strategic goals to be accomplished, they will be more inclined to accept top management’s vision and take the necessary steps to make that vision become a reality. This venerable view seems intuitively obvious and echoes the longstanding research findings on goal setting, which demonstrate that effective goals are those that are specific, challenging, measurable, achievable, and so on. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1056492612447229">Locke &amp; Latham, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1056492612447229">Locke, Shaw, Saari, &amp; Latham, 1981</xref>). We reconsider the general application of these findings to the strategic change context, however. Although, specifically stated goals or vision statements clearly are effective in many contexts, those contexts usually involve incremental change efforts where the paths and the goals of change are straightforward and obvious.</p>
<p>Strategic change efforts are different. Although strategic change is a relatively rare event, when it happens, it is inevitably consequential (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-1056492612447229">Rajagopalan &amp; Spreitzer, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr81-1056492612447229">Tichy, 1983</xref>). Our focus is on major change of the kind that is transformational, often entailing fundamental shifts in the way the organization sees its relationship with its environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr84-1056492612447229">Van de Ven &amp; Poole, 1995</xref>). Change of this scope and gravity involves a high level of uncertainty and flux, and often turns on gaining buy-in from powerful stakeholders with diverse preferences and interests, which means that solving the political problem of simultaneously satisfying multiple stakeholder demands is paramount (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1056492612447229">Kotter, 1996</xref>). For that reason, we argue that there can be greater potential for success if the initiation of a major change effort is intentionally framed in ambitious but more ambiguous terms. We delve into this pragmatically important issue as an avenue for reconsidering our theoretical understanding of strategic change and as an avenue for developing theory that is relevant to practice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1056492612447229">Beer, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1056492612447229">Corley &amp; Gioia, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr82-1056492612447229">Thomas &amp; Tymon, 1982</xref>).</p>
<sec id="section1-1056492612447229">
<title>An Alternative View of Strategic Change Initiation</title>
<p>Substantial organizational change is disruptive, often requiring revisions in fundamental assumptions, interpretations, knowledge, language, actions, and practices at individual and collective levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1056492612447229">Kanter, Stein, &amp; Jick, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1056492612447229">Kotter, 1996</xref>). This kind of change is precarious, in that it requires organization members to make new sense of what the organization is trying to accomplish, how leaders are trying to accomplish it, and who has the power to realize and benefit from it. For these reasons, strategic change might best be viewed as a complex cognitive, behavioral, and political enterprise (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr80-1056492612447229">Swidler, 1986</xref>). At its essence, however, the <italic>initiation</italic> of change is fundamentally a cognitive and image-based venture—a process that revolves around the vision used to frame changes in desired ways of being, seeing, and doing. Our guiding stance, therefore, is that <italic>when strategic change is necessary, an ambiguous vision can help to launch the change effort</italic>—where ambiguity connotes either multiple possible interpretations or a useful vagueness in precise meaning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1056492612447229">Corley &amp; Gioia, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1056492612447229">Eisenberg, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1056492612447229">Levine, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1056492612447229">March &amp; Olsen, 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr86-1056492612447229">Weick, 1979</xref>). Contrary to arguments that strategic change requires clear, albeit encompassing vision statements (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1056492612447229">Battilana, Leca, &amp; Boxenbaum, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1056492612447229">Greiner &amp; Bhambri, 1989</xref>), we argue that such change might better be initiated with a more imprecise, equivocal, and malleable orientation.</p>
<p>Before expanding on this thesis, we would like to note some boundary conditions. First, some scholars have rightly noted that strategic change can occur in various degrees (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1056492612447229">Boeker 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1056492612447229">Greenwood &amp; Hinings, 1993</xref>) ranging from incremental shifts to radical leaps (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1056492612447229">Anderson &amp; Tushman, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr87-1056492612447229">Weick &amp; Quinn, 1999</xref>). For incremental strategic change efforts (e.g., realigning key products across changing markets), we continue to believe that clear and specific visions are the watchword. Our consideration, however, concerns the kind of change that calls for major reconfigurations and alterations in the relationships between the organization’s internal and external contexts. Under such conditions, we argue that the accompanying upheavals can be more effectively handled by capitalizing on ambiguity at the inception of the change process. At this crucial time, ambiguous goals are not the end states to be achieved but are triggers for challenging members’ existing understandings and engaging them in novel sensemaking—the kind of sensemaking that can lead to localized interpretations and solutions that facilitate the acceptance of change (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1056492612447229">Fiss &amp; Zajac, 2006</xref>). Our point of departure for arguing the relevance of this point of view stems mainly from observations made in political science—a source of thought with increasing relevance for business.</p>
<p>In addition to accounting for political insights, another key to appreciating the underlying processes of strategic change involves understanding how people go about making sense of proposed organizational changes. At an elemental level, the success of any major change effort involves a shift in the way organization members currently understand or “know” their organization. When a new vision is articulated, it constitutes new or revised ways of seeing, but that new vision must be interpreted in light of existing conceptions to arrive at the desired future image of the “new” organization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1056492612447229">Gioia &amp; Thomas, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1056492612447229">Labianca, Gray, &amp; Brass, 2000</xref>). Some revision or transformation of organizational knowledge (about business models, value propositions, practices, etc.), therefore, needs to occur before change can be accomplished.</p>
<p>Consider, for example, the ambiguous strategic vision of “becoming a Top-10 public institution” noted by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1056492612447229">Gioia and Chittipeddi (1991)</xref> within a university setting. This new “Top-10” concept has equivocality—meaning that it is open to multiple possible interpretations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr86-1056492612447229">Weick, 1979</xref>). That is, to be consistent with this vision, members must somehow revise the way they understand their organization. The underlying motivational message in this vision statement is that “we are not currently a top 10 institution, but we can and should become one.” Valero Energy’s vision statement, for instance, in launching their recent strategic change effort has a similar linguistic structure, “to become a world-class competitor in the global energy business.” In both cases, the implication is that members need to think differently, perhaps even to revise aspects of their identity or “who we are as an organization” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1056492612447229">Albert &amp; Whetten, 1985</xref>) to achieve the high-aspiration vision. The process of interpretation and reinterpretation prompted by this kind of vision statement connotes that members need to develop a different way of understanding themselves.</p>
<p>Revisions to institutionalized ways of knowing and understanding can only be triggered, however, by destabilizing employees’ existing knowledge and/or frameworks for understanding and practice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1056492612447229">Nag, Corley, &amp; Gioia, 2007</xref>). An ambiguous vision assists in the necessary destabilization by providing a context within which the creation of new ways of knowing and understanding can occur, even in precarious political environments, allowing change to take hold and begin gaining vital momentum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1056492612447229">Jansen, 2004</xref>). The key to visionary ambiguity lies in its capacity for allowing employees to apply their own interpretations—to change their perceptions, conceptions, and actions in a fashion that they can view as being broadly consistent with the larger vision (as Verizon learned in its campaign framed around the vision of becoming “the most respected brand in communications”). This kind of innocuous-sounding vision can help to minimize change-inhibiting conflict among competing factions, because everyone (and every subunit of the organization) can find ways to fit into the equivocal vision, whereas a clear and precise vision with specific goals and priorities is automatically exclusionary for some (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1056492612447229">Corley &amp; Gioia, 2004</xref>). Ultimately, then, visionary ambiguity disarms resistance—probably the single strongest factor that inhibits the success of many change efforts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1056492612447229">Kotter, 1996</xref>).</p>
<p>To articulate the conceptual case for the virtue of vagueness in initiating strategic change, we first consider relevant literature on ambiguity, drawing especially on writings in political science, where the use of motivated ambiguity has developed into an art form in achieving desired outcomes. We then draw on research concerning organizational knowledge to inform our view of the relationship between visionary ambiguity and organizational change. One of our intentions is to demonstrate that considering a consequential practical problem (how best to launch strategic change) and a nonobvious approach to that problem (employing an intentionally ambiguous vision) leads to deeper theoretical insights (a better understanding of key processes involved in the revision of personal and institutionalized organizational knowledge to accomplish change). From the political arena, we know that ambiguous visions work, so their likely transferability to business seems clear and promising. What is less clear, however, is just <italic>how</italic> ambiguity facilitates the initiation of strategic change.</p>

<title>Ambiguity in the Organizational and Political Domains</title>
<p>Perhaps the first in-depth treatment of ambiguity as applied to organizations was <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1056492612447229">March and Olsen’s (1976)</xref> volume on ambiguity and choice. This work is probably best known for highlighting the prevalence of ambiguity in organizational life, as well as the human penchant for trying either to ignore it or eliminate it. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr85-1056492612447229">Weick (1977)</xref> also dealt with ambiguity under the rubric of “equivocality,” arguing that ambiguity/equivocality acts as a trigger for sensemaking that leads to a workable understanding, thus lowering the disquieting level of ambiguity. Of particular relevance to the idea of visionary ambiguity, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1056492612447229">Lazarus (1966)</xref> noted that “ambiguity permits maximum latitude for idiosyncratic interpretations of situations” (p. 118), so ambiguity confers flexibility.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1056492612447229">1</xref></sup> The key insight here is that if ambiguity can be contained within manageable bounds, it allows a range of reasonable interpretations that can be construed as consistent with a vision.</p>
<p>Meyerson’s later work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1056492612447229">1990</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1056492612447229">1991</xref>) showed how occupational and organizational cultures influence the interpretation and actions of employees. She also noted that most organizational settings tend to discourage ambiguity and have structures and procedures in place to deal with any ambiguities that do arise. Taken together, these treatments of ambiguity in organizations usually regard it as either detrimental or bothersome—something that should be clarified, reduced, and, if possible, eliminated. Researchers in organizational communication have noted, however, that strategic ambiguity in language use involves “the ways in which people may communicate unclearly but still accomplish their goals . . . [by taking] advantage of the diverse meanings that different people can give to the same message” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1056492612447229">Eisenberg &amp; Goodall, 1997</xref>, p. 24), a statement that echoes an interesting observation from political science . . .</p>
<sec id="section3-1056492612447229">
<title>Ambiguity in the Political Arena</title>
<p>The study of ambiguity has a notably longer history, as well as a much more optimistic orientation, in political science. Indeed, the political view of ambiguity is one of appreciation and even admiration. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1056492612447229">Downs (1957)</xref> first noted that by avoiding clear positions on issues, candidates could avoid alienating constituents who held different positions and, thus, could maximize voter support by minimizing specificity. Although many views of democracy idealistically “call for clarity and specificity in issue stands” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-1056492612447229">Page, 1978</xref>, p. 152), so that voters can understand candidate positions and engage in rational, policy-oriented voting, unambiguous issue stands are actually a political rarity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-1056492612447229">Shepsle, 1972</xref>). In fact, ambiguity serves the interest of the candidate in gaining the widest possible support for election, which is why ambiguity has long characterized political speech (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1056492612447229">Aragones &amp; Neeman, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1056492612447229">Campbell, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1056492612447229">Edelman, 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1056492612447229">Glazer, 1990</xref>).</p>
<p>Ambiguity also has become a notable hallmark of modern legislation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1056492612447229">Chock, 1995</xref>) and ways of communicating political choices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1056492612447229">Huckfeldt, Beck, Dalton, Levine, &amp; Morgan, 1998</xref>). Political visions tend to be stated in evocative, albeit abstract, terms that connote alignment with ideals and thus tap widely shared values and beliefs without accounting for specific realities—attributes that famously led the former governor of New York, Mario Cuomo, to observe that “You campaign in poetry; you govern in prose”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1056492612447229">2</xref></sup> as a commentary on the necessities of gaining enough support to be elected, before facing the harder work of implementation. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-1056492612447229">Page (1976)</xref> also noted that because political leaders have only partial control over the rhetoric surrounding an issue and the emphasis an issue receives in a campaign, they must be ambiguous in their stances so as to be better able to deal with shifts in public opinion. Similarly, Matland observed that ambiguity minimizes conflict among competing parties in helping to pass contentious legislation because “many legislative compromises depend on language sufficiently ambiguous that diverse actors can interpret the same act in different ways” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1056492612447229">1995</xref>, p. 158)—a fact that has not gone unnoticed by business scholars and leaders (witness AT&amp;T’s attention to the theme of quality: “. . . we’re focused on delivering the high quality customer service that is our heritage” or Porsche’s allusion simply to excellence—“Excellence is expected . . . We have an uncompromising determination to achieve excellence in everything we undertake”). It is notably difficult to disagree with such aspirational, if ambiguous statements.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-1056492612447229">Page’s (1978)</xref> research on presidential candidates revealed two important aspects of effective ambiguous language, <italic>nonspecificity</italic> and <italic>low emphasis</italic>. Nonspecificity involves vagueness in descriptions of an actual position held and can take two forms: imprecision in describing outcomes and imprecision about the means by which general goals might be achieved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1056492612447229">Matland, 1995</xref>). Both types of vagueness imply easy translations to the context of organizational leaders attempting to initiate strategic change. Nonspecificity can be employed by providing few details about what the ultimate outcome of the change effort will be (which, given the complexities of modern organizations, is probably unknowable anyway) and just how the ultimate end state will be accomplished—thus implying ambiguity about ends and means. Similarly, leaders might rely on imprecise hints about the preferred goals or methods of change so that those with the most appropriate knowledge have enough flexibility to create an effective path to the goals, regardless of how they are eventually defined. The other aspect of ambiguous language, low emphasis, involves infrequent allusions to contentious concerns, a tactic critical to avoiding conflict among opposing sides of an issue. By avoiding specific stands and sensitive topics, then, political and organizational leaders alike can avoid starting a conflict or, if necessary, to appear to remain above the fray in attempting to manage multiple factions with multiple preferences for means and ends.</p>
<p>The received wisdom, repeatedly validated in politics, is that specific policy proposals are usually ineffective in winning votes because they appeal to relatively narrow audiences and often alienate groups needed to forge consensus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1056492612447229">Levine, 1985</xref>). Alienating as few constituents (politically) or stakeholders (organizationally) as possible is crucially important—a position on either extreme is counterproductive, whereas a position in the middle satisfies no group adequately. Thus, the most effective approach is to avoid divisive issues by placing little emphasis on them and, instead, pursuing matters on which consensus can be achieved—thus implying the need for stating positions ambiguously. This counsel amounts to an effective enactment of the philosophy of American pragmatism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1056492612447229">Dewey, 1922</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1056492612447229">James, 1907/1949</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-1056492612447229">Peirce, 1903/1997</xref>), with its strong preference for building consensus and solving problems rather than maintaining some sort of ideological purity by stating preferences in clear, specific terms. Consider a number of visible firms that have sounded the theme of being the “first choice” for consumers: Hewlett-Packard (“To make H-P the partner of choice for our customers”), Home Depot (“. . . to be the employer, retailer, investment and neighbor of choice in the home improvement industry”), and State Farm Insurance (“. . . to be the customer’s first and best choice in the products and services we provide”).</p>
<p>Does it work? Oh, yes, in the political arena, it certainly does. Political science research has provided some revealing insight into the consequences of leaders presenting ambiguous messages to their followers. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1056492612447229">Huckfeldt et al. (1998)</xref> found that people’s responses to ambiguous political messages often led to the outcomes desired by the candidate. When confronted with an ambiguous message, they found that people tend to turn to their interpretations of past events/messages to form an opinion about the meaning of the current message. This usually results in people “hearing what they want to hear” from the candidate’s message, thus increasing the likelihood of having their expectations or desires met. This tendency to interpret messages in terms favorable to the listener is actually quite useful, when properly and ethically used, in influencing people to be receptive to an otherwise difficult-to-accept demand for change—a finding with major implications for the initiation of strategic change in organizations.</p>
<p>Important elements of the conceptual and practical wisdom underlying this constellation of observations and findings has been summed up in two colorful, guiding aphorisms common in the political domain and applicable to the organizations. Aphorism 1 is former Speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives, Tip O’Neill’s, pithy assertion that “All politics is local” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-1056492612447229">O’Neill &amp; Hymel, 1994</xref>), which provides the insight for organizations that if change leaders hope to achieve consensual commitment to a vision for change, that vision must be seen as accommodating local interests while also serving cosmopolitan needs. Guiding Aphorism 2 is the venerable and upbeat observation by Otto von Bismarck from the 19th century that “Politics is the art of the possible,”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-1056492612447229">3</xref></sup> which optimistically, yet effectively, expresses the belief that the role of change leaders is to develop ways of circumventing controversy even when powerful players’ goals are in conflict. Ambiguity can bring parties together and provide enough common ground to agree on the overarching vision, if not the means to achieve it, whereas a clear vision clearly identifies those likely to be privileged (and underprivileged) by any specific image of the future organization.</p>
<p>An insightful historical example of the beneficial effects of ambiguity is also available from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-1056492612447229">Padgett and Ansell’s (1993)</xref> analysis of Cosimo di Medici’s enigmatic actions in guiding Renaissance Florence toward his vision. His subtle actions constituted variously interpretable “moves” applicable to many ongoing power games in Machiavellian Florence, which allowed him to navigate treacherous courses of action while holding many competing factions together. Although he maintained a lively state of intrigue for his own ends and the ends of Florentine society, the key to his success was his ability to satisfy multiple parties simultaneously via his credibly ambiguous language and robust actions—a historical lesson with implications for modern organizations.</p>

<p>Any realistic portrayal of modern business organizations recognizes that (a) there are inevitably many different stakeholders interested in the consequences of any proposed change; (b) these multiple parties have numerous, and often conflicting, preferences and goals; and (c) these various factions are suspicious that their power bases and routines might be undermined by the change (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1056492612447229">Kotter, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1056492612447229">Kouzes &amp; Posner, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1056492612447229">Nag et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-1056492612447229">Sonenshein, 2010</xref>). And, as any savvy politician knows, clarity in the face of this set of circumstances is not conducive to success. To begin a transition into an ill-defined unknown with a constellation of wary and worried constituents, it is safer to frame change in terms that can encompass as many stakeholders’ interests as possible.</p>
<p>In politically charged change situations, then, it is prudent to avoid alienating factions, if at all possible, because even the suggestion of a major change produces a state of flux. Local conditions become ripe with possibility, but also with unpredictability. Even small and currently inconsequential factions can become influential in the unstable milieu of change. Intentions announced and promises made can be subject to changed circumstances over very short periods of time. For example, the first President Bush’s famous declaration “Read my lips . . . No new taxes!” is instructive. Had he not made this statement, the ensuing tax increase might have been seen as a strong act of leadership. But the statement locked him into a specific pledge in the face of circumstances that soon changed in subtle but strong fashion, requiring a subsequent action that was directly counter to the pledge. A similar dynamic applies to business organizations. Change announcements that specify too many details constrain adaptability (to new technologies, competitors, etc.) that can make small political factions grow into formidable political forces. For some, change creates a welcome political opportunity; for many others, it creates uncertainty and ambiguity that most would rather avoid.</p>
<p>Paradoxically, then, the path out of uncertainty often begins with more, not less, ambiguity. It is during the crack-in-time moment of the announcement of an intended change that a vision framed in ambitious but ambiguous symbolic terms becomes crucial and therefore harbors the greatest potential for influencing strategy and the adaptability of the organization. As one CEO put it, “We want to become a first-class organization.” What is a “first-class organization”? It is simply not clear initially what the phrase means. Only later will the ambiguous label become more defined as progress is made toward the negotiated realization of some form of the vision. In the early stages of a change effort, maintaining a deliberate state of visionary ambiguity is an enabling tactic—that is, it enables people to envision a way out of a currently untenable situation. Dealing with ambiguity is, of course, one of the defining hallmarks of leadership (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1056492612447229">Bennis, 2003</xref>). The intriguing twist here is that the ambiguity is intentionally created by the very leaders charged with the responsibility for guiding people out of the ambiguity created by proposing the change in the first place.</p>
<p>We can also note that change is most effectively initiated if it is framed around an evocative symbolic value or vision (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1056492612447229">Collins &amp; Porras, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1056492612447229">Kouzes &amp; Posner, 2002</xref>). Using symbols in politics and organizations has traditionally been seen as addressing only the “expressive” side of experience, with the dismissive connotation that symbols (including visions) have few implications for actual instrumental accomplishment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1056492612447229">Edelman, 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-1056492612447229">Pfeffer &amp; Moore, 1980</xref>). The advantages of evocative symbols in framing a change effort, however, can become quite instrumental and functional in initiating strategic change (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1056492612447229">Gioia &amp; Chittipeddi, 1991</xref>), even including a strategic change as complicated as a merger (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1056492612447229">Clark, Gioia, Ketchen, &amp; Thomas, 2010</xref>). Furthermore, if a symbol is attractive and ambiguous (e.g., “a top-10 public university,” “a first-class organization”), it allows diverse stakeholders to interpret the meaning of the image in different ways, yet still think of themselves as pursuing a larger goal (i.e., elite status), and thus, as being part of a shared vision. As a result, ambiguity around a visionary image creates the potential for bandwagon effects (Who would not want to be top 10?), while also creating the means to get change moving without pinning down precise actions, changes in resource allocations, or structural alterations. Moreover, the ambiguity found within the vision of being a top-10 university entertains apparent non sequiturs, for example “there are probably 15 or 20 institutions in the top 10” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1056492612447229">Gioia &amp; Chittipeddi, 1991</xref>) that actually reveal the facilitating wisdom inherent in the encompassing definition of “top 10.” In fact, it is literally true that there <italic>are</italic> 15 or 20 institutions in the top 10, depending on the criteria invoked to declare the top 10. The key point, however, is that different factions can initially choose which criteria to impose in their self-directed initial pursuit of the vision.</p>

<title>Revising Organizational Knowledge: How Visionary Ambiguity Fosters Change</title>
<p>Based on organizational and political thinking, it is clear that broad, ambiguous vision statements can help foster change in some contexts, perhaps especially in the initiation of strategic change. What we currently lack, however, is an explanation of how this process might take place. Understanding how it occurs can also give us insight into important microdynamics underlying how institutionalization and institutional change occurs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr83-1056492612447229">Townley, 2002</xref>). Recent research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1056492612447229">Nag et al., 2007</xref>) indicates that this process is rooted in the revision of organizational knowledge—in other words in revising how organization members make sense of their experience. To understand the process, it helps to begin with a key question: “What happens to organizational knowledge during periods of major change?”</p>
<sec id="section6-1056492612447229">
<title>The Deeper Roots of Change</title>
<p>There are a number of ways of contrasting various forms of knowledge—for example, explicit versus tacit, individual versus collective, and simple versus complex knowledge. All these contrasts, although useful for many purposes, tend to assume a rather static view of knowledge, as well as a view of knowledge mainly as <italic>something possessed</italic> by organization members—a view that is insufficient for understanding the dynamic nature of knowledge and its revision during periods of major change. A more recent view of organizational knowledge, grounded in the early works of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1056492612447229">Dewey (1922)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1056492612447229">James (1907/1949)</xref>, with later enrichments by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1056492612447229">Bourdieu (1977)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1056492612447229">Giddens (1984)</xref>, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-1056492612447229">Schatzki (1996)</xref>, is one that also considers knowledge to be embedded in social practices. This perspective views organizational knowledge not merely as some “mute” and disembodied economic asset, but also as a situated, emergent phenomenon that inheres in routinized and meaningful practices of organizational members (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1056492612447229">Brown &amp; Duguid, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1056492612447229">Lave &amp; Wenger, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1056492612447229">Nag et al., 2007</xref>).</p>
<p><italic>Practice</italic> in this context is a rather complex concept that alludes to more than just observable behaviors or routines. More significantly, practice refers to the meaningful actions of organizational members that are grounded in some specific context of organizational experience (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1056492612447229">Cook &amp; Brown, 1999</xref>). In this conception, knowledge is viewed as an ongoing interplay between purposeful thinking and meaningful acting. Most importantly, the focus is not only on knowledge as some<italic>thing</italic> that an organization or its members have but also on how that knowledge is used by organization members as a tool for understanding and improving what they actually <italic>do</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1056492612447229">Cook &amp; Brown, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-1056492612447229">Pentland, 1992</xref>). The key insight from this perspective is that organizational knowledge not only exists as a set of heuristics or bits of knowledge independent of organizational members but also manifests in the ways that organizational members justify and perform their work.</p>
<p>The processes by which knowledge gets revised in the context of major change implies some sort of “frame-breaking” experience (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1056492612447229">Bartunek, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1056492612447229">Goffman, 1974</xref>) in which an organization’s existing beliefs, meanings, and activities are called into question and need to be supplanted with new or revised meanings and activities. The acquisition of new organizational knowledge has predominantly been seen as needing to come from outside the organization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1056492612447229">Argote &amp; Ingram, 2000</xref>) via new hires, benchmarking rivals, competitor intelligence, technology transfer, and so on (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1056492612447229">Garud, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-1056492612447229">Song, Almeida, &amp; Wu, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr88-1056492612447229">Zahra &amp; Nielsen, 2002</xref>). Such assumptions and prescriptions, however, tend to underplay the difficulties that organizational members face in adopting unfamiliar new knowledge from external sources (including problems with the “not invented here” syndrome). Consequently, organization members are often unable to integrate strange, new, outside knowledge into their existing frameworks. We focus instead on the process of <italic>knowledge revision</italic> because it represents the reworking of preexisting knowledge into new knowledge. The knowledge revision perspective offers a view that builds on an organization’s existing knowledge but focuses on the changes and adaptations that knowledge undergoes to create new understandings and responses.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-1056492612447229">
<title>A Different Way of Understanding</title>
<p>Put simply, intrinsically new knowledge can come from organization members reinterpreting and revising their current knowledge in light of new goals and orientations. The key to the process, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1056492612447229">Durkheim (1915</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1056492612447229">1973)</xref> long ago noted, is that people cannot assimilate concepts without fundamentally altering them. The essence of his argument is that each individual must put his or her own interpretation on concepts to be able to make sense of them in the context of personal experience and to make them consistent with her or his own worldview. In other words, people perform subtle revisions or transformations of concepts to tailor them to personal conceptions, desires, and needs. This is a key point for understanding not only personal knowledge but also alterations in organizational knowledge that must occur in any major change effort. The consequence of this perspective for organization study is that “new” organizational knowledge arises not just from importation from outside, but also via revision and adaptation of existing inside knowledge. For understanding organizational change, the implication is that when individuals consider ideas and concepts existing at the organizational level (e.g., an overarching vision), and interpret and transform them to suit their particular contexts, purposes, and requirements (local adaptation), they essentially create new knowledge that manifests itself as various “revisions” of existing ideas and concepts. The new revisions may range from altered knowledge structures at the individual level to new interpretive schemes, activities, modified routines, strategy decisions, and so on at the collective level.</p>
<p>There are several consequences of this conceptualization for gaining a deeper understanding of organizations and organizational change. First is the important recognition that organizational knowledge is a key element of institutions and institutionalization, and therefore that knowledge revision is a key aspect of institutional change. Second is the recognition that organization members alter ideas and concepts existing at the organizational level to suit their personal needs, preferences, and interests. Similarly important is the realization that interpretive and pragmatic latitude resides in concepts that have enough ambiguity to support multiple understandings. For these reasons, organizational knowledge revision and/or adaptation can be triggered, aided, and guided by an ambiguous statement of aspiration. Knowledge revised according to the interpretation of that visionary aspiration then has the great advantage of providing people the means for including desired change ideas into their own ways of understanding—which is why, for instance, that Verizon’s visionary aspiration of being “the most respected brand in communications,” or Wells Fargo’s vision of “being the best, most trusted and admired financial services company” allow employees to adapt those high-minded (if somewhat obscure) ideas into personal and local aspirations, understandings, actions, and practices that actually affect organizational effectiveness.</p>

<title>Ambiguity’s Role in Revising Organizational Knowledge</title>
<p>As noted earlier, initiating any major change requires some visionary statement that helps to destabilize existing ways of knowing and doing. Simply destabilizing things, however, is not sufficient; it is important to capitalize on the induced state of flux to revise existing knowledge because substantive change will only occur if there is a change in ways of conceiving the organization and its purposes and directions. Achieving such change implies framing the change in a way that provides broad enough direction to allow varied interpretations to create new or revised knowledge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-1056492612447229">Nonaka, 1988</xref>). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1056492612447229">Figure 1</xref> captures the progression and main features of the organizational change process initiated by an ambiguous vision statement.</p>

</fig>
<p>Visionary ambiguity can assume a number of “locations.” It is most obviously located in the expression of the vision itself—in the form of metaphorical language, with its lack of specific details (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1056492612447229">Eisenberg, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-1056492612447229">Page, 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-1056492612447229">Putnam &amp; Sorenson, 1982</xref>). More importantly, however, it also resides in organization members’ interpretations of the expressed vision. Given the propensity for people to interpret an image in light of their own interests and preferences, they will tend to construe a vision in terms that make sense to them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr86-1056492612447229">Weick, 1979</xref>), even as the framers of those visions might work to “give sense” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1056492612447229">Gioia &amp; Chittipeddi, 1991</xref>) about their preferred interpretation of their ideas. The key to finding common ground between these sensemaking and sensegiving disparities lies in creating a visionary symbol with adequate interpretive leeway. For instance, when one innovative petroleum company adopted the characterization of itself as a “discovery company” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-1056492612447229">Reger et al., 1998</xref>), this ambiguous, multiple-entendre vision was not aimed only at outsiders. One of its major effects was internal, because it set the stage for organization members to see themselves differently, to revise, reconstruct, and reinvent their way of understanding themselves and their practices and yet be consistent with the mission of the firm as an oil company. The symbolic vision implicitly says, “we want to be a company that explores, that innovates, that finds new markets” (all of which are forms of discovery). The recipient of that vision can define “discovery” as appropriate to their specialty skills—a message that heralds the need for revised understandings that creates the potential for bona fide change.</p>
<p>An ambiguous vision statement (i.e., one with nonspecificity and/or low emphasis) provides an occasion for members to experiment with revising various elements of their interpretive frames and their practices, and so on (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-1056492612447229">Sackmann, 1992</xref>). Under stable conditions, organizational meanings and activities are routinized, thus serving to maintain the organizational status quo. In times of major change, however, visionary ambiguity creates the grounds for new and divergent sensemaking. Individuals adapt ambiguous concepts by developing new meanings for them and changing their activities and business processes to be consistent with the new meanings. The revision of knowledge during change, therefore, might manifest itself in the form of variations/modifications in organizational routines, plans, practices, and so on. At the cognitive level, individuals can alter their existing frameworks for understanding by localizing their interpretations of the vision to suit their own requirements and applications, thus generating a series of, for example, custom business unit plans and actions that influence the activities of the local unit in the service of the larger vision.</p>

<title>Implications and Amplifications of Visionary Ambiguity in Launching Strategic Change</title>
<p>Intentionally injecting ambiguity into an organization’s political and cultural environment can be a risky enterprise, so its use should be reserved for those rare occasions where major or strategic (not incremental) change is necessary. We would posit, for instance, that visionary ambiguity is likely to have limited utility—or even be counterproductive—for change initiatives that are incremental (e.g., when an organization is engaging in a strategic realignment of its key brands across changing markets). Although this kind of change might entail significant internal reorganization and reallocation of resources, there might be little or no need to alter relationships with internal and external stakeholders that define the organization’s core identity and external image. Under such conditions, the benefits of visionary ambiguity are likely to be superseded by the need for a clearly defined set of means and ends for carrying out a restructuring. Visionary ambiguity becomes more critical when the underlying change affects the foundations or core domains in which the organization operates. For instance, an organization could face a situation requiring fundamental transformation if it had been recently divested and found itself operating in a completely novel and different competitive environment. Similarly, there are examples of organizations faced with the sudden onset of disruptive technologies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1056492612447229">Christensen, 1997</xref>) in which desired end states are not clear in advance, so the most effective approach to attain them is unclear. Under these circumstances, visionary ambiguity can act as a means to initiate radical/transformative change efforts.</p>
<p>Of course, it is important to emphasize that visionary ambiguity is most appropriate for <italic>launching</italic> strategic change (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1056492612447229">Gioia, 1998</xref>, on “optimal ambiguity,” as well as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1056492612447229">Clark et al., 2010</xref>, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-1056492612447229">Sonenshein, 2010</xref>, for more on ambiguity in change implementation). To be sure, trying to maintain an ongoing state of ambiguity is a dangerous game, so it is essential to establish increasingly specific goals relatively soon. After the launch phase, subsequent change implementations need to limit the sense that “anything goes” and establish a core set of more specific consensual goals to be accomplished by the organization as a whole. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1056492612447229">Matland (1995)</xref> noted, one implication is that “. . . ambiguous policies can breed limited accountability and can lead to the creation of mini-fiefdoms with leaders pursuing their own interests” (pp. 166-167). This potential for “local entrepreneurs” to emerge as leaders in the wake of ambiguity and thus influence subsequent interpretation processes is a possibility that needs to be managed. Leaders who emerge from chaotic conditions are not always positive forces, especially when they create their own domains of power and control that can work against the organization’s strategic interests. The ideal process of strategic change launched with visionary ambiguity is consistent with a “guided evolution” model of change (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1056492612447229">Lovas &amp; Ghoshal, 2000</xref>). That is, ambiguity induces variation; changes in interpretations, knowledge revisions, and actions then ensue. Those changes that serve the general vision for change are selected and retained by appropriate incentive and reward systems that evolve in parallel. Leaders identify those changes and goals that can be made to work, reinforce them, and structure reward systems to institutionalize them. The process constitutes a progression from ambiguous inception to specific conclusion.</p>
<p>In general, the process of knowledge revision provides an alternative perspective on conceptualizations of changing knowledge beyond traditional views only in terms of internal aggregation of knowledge or importation of knowledge from outside the firm’s boundaries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1056492612447229">Cohen &amp; Levinthal, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr88-1056492612447229">Zahra &amp; Nielsen, 2002</xref>). It also represents an alternative to views that knowledge generation starts from the individual level and then manifests in a larger organizational or social setting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1056492612447229">Crossan, Lane, &amp; White, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1056492612447229">March, Sproull, &amp; Tamuz, 1991</xref>; see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-1056492612447229">Nonaka &amp; Takeuchi, 1995</xref>). The knowledge revision view instead sees individuals and groups as active <italic>revisors</italic> of preexisting organizational knowledge. This distinction is important, because it implies that what individual members consider to be their own “unique” knowledge is essentially their revision of organizational-level ideas and concepts for local application. This subtle but powerful process of knowledge revision is more consistent with recent views that treat knowledge not as a “possession” but as a dynamic interplay between organizational knowledge and the local revisions of that knowledge in practice. Views of knowledge-as-possession imply that changing understanding requires “replacing one piece of knowledge” with another. Knowledge revision instead implies individual and collective revision of knowledge to meet new demands. Visionary ambiguity creates the occasion for the revision of knowledge that <italic>enables</italic> strategic change that leads to improved organizational effectiveness. This adaptive/transformational view of knowledge makes it cognitively “safe” for organization members facing change to think anew without completely giving up past learning and experience. Expecting people to uproot and throw away what they know is simply not a viable or workable view of the way people actually understand. The knowledge revision view sees new knowledge as predicated on the reinterpretation of existing knowledge and shifting in a substantive, not substitutional, manner.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-1056492612447229">
<title>Recapitulation and Conclusion</title>
<p>Most change efforts involve fairly straightforward, incremental changes and, in these common contexts, specifically stated visions and goals remain the watchword. For major strategic change efforts, however, treating ambiguity as an ally to be embraced, rather than an adversary to be avoided, is consistent with a more realistic portrait of modern business organizations, one that recognizes that large organizations are made up of factions with differing interests, preferences, and power bases. Those differences can quickly paralyze or sabotage a change effort if the specifics of a proposed change pit factions against each other, as they so often do. Ambiguity grants the necessary latitude to accommodate the varied desires of multiple stakeholders while disarming grounds for resistance. The key insight is that under an ambiguous vision, everyone can initially interpret the vision differently and still define themselves as consistent with the guiding image. Ambiguity, then, is not the enemy of order, but a means by which orderly transitions can occur.</p>
<p>Of course, it might be possible to dictate change and its trajectory <italic>if</italic> one has enough power to force the issue. But that case is increasingly rare. In modern organizations, power sharing is now so common that a more encompassing model needs to be entertained. The efficacy of initiating strategic change is enhanced not by diluting and weakening a vision so that no one is offended, but by blurring (and paradoxically strengthening) the vision by having everyone define it in their own image and willingly buy into it. It is common for strategy textbooks to counsel the formulation of encompassing visions. We are advocating not only broad, but ambiguous visions. Visionary ambiguity works. It works because any individual member or department can transform the meaning of that vision (and thus his or her organizational knowledge) into one’s own image and still be consistent with the articulated vision of change.</p>
<p>The fundamental notion of visionary ambiguity derives mainly from practical observations from the political sphere, which is perhaps not surprising. The political perspective has become increasingly relevant to organization study because finding common ground in the context of differing preferences and interests frequently revolves around the enlightened use of ambiguity. It is for this reason that we believe that managing major strategic change efforts in modern business might turn on the idea that the evocative intentions of a vague vision can credibly substitute for the potentially disruptive details about likely consequences, at least in the beginning of big change initiatives. The specific details and objectives come later. Given the multiple constituencies to be satisfied in strategic change efforts, stating clear goals is likely to be a poor choice compared with the articulation of an ambitious, but ambiguous, symbolic vision.</p>

<p>Ambiguity and flexibility are related but somewhat different concepts. Ambiguous visions are indeed flexible visions, but ambiguity provides a greater degree of interpretive latitude than flexibility. Ambiguity concerns a vision’s ability to accommodate multiple meanings at the same time; flexibility concerns a vision’s ability to be adapted to different contexts or to a different strategic direction at a given point in time based on environmental exigencies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1056492612447229">Harrigan, 1985</xref>).
