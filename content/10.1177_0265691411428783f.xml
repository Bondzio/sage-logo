<sec id="sec1-0265691411428783f"><title>Debra Blumenthal, <italic>Enemies and Familiars. Slavery and Mastery in Fifteenth-Century Valencia</italic>, Cornell University Press: Ithaca NY, 2009; 306 pp.; 9780801445026, $45.00 (hbk)</title>
<p>Over the last few years we have witnessed a resurgence in studies concerned with slavery in the Hispanic, Mediterranean and Atlantic world. The results have been crucial for our understanding of both Muslim slavery and the transportation of Black Africans to America. In this context, Debra Blumenthal’s book adds new data on the phenomenon of slavery in medieval Valencia, especially for the second half of the fifteenth century. One of its greatest strengths is that the author breaks with the traditional, masculine concept of slave communities, and takes account of the presence of slave women and children. Blumenthal also has a good approach to the social aspect of slavery, putting great emphasis on knowing the daily lives of male and female slaves, reconstructing their experiences, habits and routines. The author certainly knows how to sift through historical sources and gives us a full picture of the human landscape. It brings together the rich documentary sources on slavery conserved by the Kingdom of Aragon, especially those from Valencian archives, which have holdings devoted to slavery, such as the Captives’ Books of Confessions.</p>
<p>Up to a few years ago, the historical source most used in the study of slavery in the flourishing port of Valenica was the holdings on the Bailía General in the Archives of the Kingdom of Valencia, in which the phenomenon of slavery was seen as Saracen, essentially masculine, and basically sustained by privateering. However, Blumenthal has been able to bring together various types of documents from diverse archives (the Archive of the Kingdom of Valencia, the Archive of Judicial Records and the Municipal Archive), which allow her to present a fuller and more differentiated picture of the ethnic and social background of the slaves. She thereby rediscovers the memory of slaves of Black African, Russian, Tatar, Circassian and Canary origin, as well as of some Greek Orthodox Christians who were enslaved.</p>
<p>The book is organized into seven chapters, which are easy to read thanks to careful editing and the author’s evident passion for her theme. The first, ‘Defining <italic>De bona guerra</italic>’ discusses the supply of the slaves themselves. There were three main sources: war and piracy, penal servitude and trade. The second chapter concentrates on a study of the slave market itself, not so much from the economic standpoint, but more as an analysis of the process of buying and selling and an examination of those agents involved in these transactions. The third sets the productivity of the slaves against the common image of slave-owning as a mark of high socio-economic status. Other authors have argued this before, and Blumenthal restates the position, analysing new cases of slaves who worked on the land or in handicrafts. Similarly, the next chapter engages with the discussion about the slave as a member of the family, and criticizes the classical paternalist image of the master as provider, on the basis of various specific cases, such as that of Miquel, a Tatar slave who attacked his mistress while she was kneading dough. Chapter 5 is apposite, dealing with the role that male and female slaves played in determining the social status of their masters in Valencian society at that time. In this way, it digs deeper into notions such as shame, sex and dignity, using the relationship of slavery as a backdrop and bringing the vital anthropological perspective with which to frame these concepts. The two final chapters deal with the emancipation of male and female slaves and examine their life experiences as freed men and women, as well as the opportunities for integration into fifteenth-century Valencian society.</p>
<p>As for the historiography of medieval and modern slavery in Spain and Europe, it should be pointed out that certain works are absent from the bibliography. This may be the result of the time lag between the completion of the author’s doctoral thesis (‘Implements of Labor, Instruments of Honor: Muslims, Eastern and Black African Slaves in Fifteenth-Century Valencia’, University of Toronto, 2000) and the publication of this book. But although this volume may be a little less up-to-date than it could have been, it nonetheless represents a most important advance in the study of medieval European slavery – a key theme for understanding numerous aspects, both material and ideological, of world history.</p>
