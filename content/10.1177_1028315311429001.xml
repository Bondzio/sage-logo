<abstract>
<p>Recent Finnish policies have encouraged Finnish higher education institutions to develop a market-oriented approach to international higher education by implementing fee-based educational programmes for students from outside the European Union (EU) and the European Economic Area (EEA). From the Finnish government’s perspective, higher education is no longer merely a public service but it is also a private good, as the government is starting to consider international higher education as a means of generating extra revenue. Although the intention of the reforms in this area is apparent, concrete implementation strategies remain unclear. This article discusses what the Finnish government, higher education institutions, and other stakeholders should take into account when considering strategies for implementing tuition fee policies, based on international experience. It also provides a picture of one aspect of the recent reform of international higher education in Finland as well as other challenges related to the reform.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Higher education has always been inherently international in terms of research, teaching, and the mobility of scholars and students (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1028315311429001">Healey, 2008</xref>, p. 354), but what appears to be a recent trend in the international dimension is an increase in competition and commercialisation as a result of globalisation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1028315311429001">Marginson, 2004</xref>). The market for international higher education has often been understood through the concept of cross-border education, which is generally defined as the movement of people, programmes, providers, knowledge, ideas, projects and services across national boundaries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1028315311429001">Knight, 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1028315311429001">2006</xref>).</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1028315311429001">Knight (2006)</xref> specifies two dimensions for looking at cross-border higher education activities. One dimension refers to the subjects of movement, including people, programmes, providers, and projects/services. The other dimension is concerned with three conditions for cross-border delivery: These are development cooperation/aid education projects, academic exchange and linkage agreements, and commercial/profit-oriented initiatives. Knight has also suggested two significant trends along these two dimensions. One is the shift from student mobility to programme and provider mobility. The other is the shift in international education policy from an “aid” approach to a “trade” rationale. This coincides with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1028315311429001">van der Wende’s (2001)</xref> assertion that “whereas political, cultural, and academic rationales have been driving internationalisation over the last decades in higher education, now, increasingly, economic rationales have started to play a role” (p. 250).</p>
<p>Finland is currently in the process of joining the global trend. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1028315311429001">Hölttä (2007)</xref> has classified the internationalisation of Finnish universities into five consecutive but overlapping modes: a) traditional individual-based mobility, b) internationalisation based on bilateral institutional agreements, c) programme-based internationalisation (mainly in the framework of the European Union), d) internationalisation based on institutional and disciplinary networks, and e) market-oriented internationalisation. The internationalisation of Finnish higher education institutions (HEIs) has been traditionally characterised by the features of Hölttä’s modes two, three, and four, with a long tradition of higher education provided free of charge. However, the recent higher education reform, introduced through new national legislation (Universities Act, 558/2009), intends to make the transformation to a market-oriented model.</p>
<p>According to the Strategy for the Internationalisation of Higher Education Institutions in Finland 2009-2015 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1028315311429001">Finnish Ministry of Education, 2009</xref>), Finnish HEIs are encouraged to export fee-based educational services. The current legislation allows Finnish institutions to charge tuition fees for degree education to students coming from outside the European Union (EU) or the European Economic Area (EEA, hereafter referred to as international students), either through a “made-to-order” model or in some international master programmes selected for a trial period.</p>
<p>In the trade or market model, the funding of international higher education is no longer a primary public responsibility, but rather education is increasingly becoming a private good (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1028315311429001">Marginson, 2004</xref>). Such a model requires quite different strategies, institutional support services, and diversified funding for the investments in product development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1028315311429001">Hölttä, 2007</xref>). However, neither the Finnish government nor Finnish HEIs have been well prepared for such changes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1028315311429001">Aarrevaara, Dobson, &amp; Elander, 2009</xref>, p. 101).</p>
<p>Although realising that Finnish HEIs are facing many operational challenges in their quest to export education, such as a lack of experience and knowledge in marketing, insufficient motivation and commitment, and a lack of coordination in exporting education (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1028315311429001">Cai, Hölttä, &amp; Kivistö, 2012</xref>), this article deals with the challenges in implementing tuition fee policies at the strategic level. This article is thus a discussion of the relevant issues that the Finnish government, HEIs, and other stakeholders should take into account when implementing the tuition fee policies for international students. It considers some of the key questions that have been considered by other higher education exporting countries when devising their strategies and plans. These questions are a) what should be expected from international students? b) how much should be charged for tuition fees? c) why do students study in a host country? d) what type of education export should be the priority?</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-1028315311429001">
<title>Introduction of a Tuition Fee Policy to Finnish Higher Education</title>
<p>In Finland and in the other Nordic welfare states, the central and long-standing goal of the national higher education policy has been to provide equal opportunities for students from all socioeconomic backgrounds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1028315311429001">Finnish Ministry of Education, 2005</xref>, p. 49). This policy goal is especially evident when one examines the proportion of expenditure on higher education that comes from public sources. According to the latest OECD statistics, Finland’s higher education system is one of the most publicly funded in the world. In 2007, the public expenditure on higher education, both on institutions and on subsidies to households, comprised 1.6% of Finland’s GDP, being the highest (together with Denmark) among the OECD countries. (The EU19 average is 1.1%). Finland, along with Denmark and Norway, is also among the top three countries in funding HEIs from public sources. In 2007, 95.7% of the expenditure on Finnish HEIs came from public sources. (The EU19 average was 79.4%; in Norway, the proportion was 97.0% and in Denmark, 96.5%, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1028315311429001">OECD, 2010</xref>, pp. 220-235).</p>
<p>Although equal opportunity and equity have been the driving forces of Finnish higher education policy for four decades, the complete absence of tuition fees for international students creates a problematic situation. Given the high share of public funding, free higher education has actually generated a threat in the form of regressive income redistribution. Unlike the situation with tax-paying domestic students, the public rate of return is negative when international students move abroad soon after they graduate. At worst, this could mean that the money is transferred from low-income Finnish taxpayers (who are still underrepresented in terms of higher education attendance) to international students, who are often from the middle- and upper-socioeconomic classes. For this reason, imposing fees for international students can also be interpreted as a means of promoting the political goal of an equity policy in the form of greater distributional justice.</p>
<p>In spite of these ideological concerns, the reform is also for economic purposes. In the recent reform in Finland, international education has been considered as a revenue generator for HEIs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1028315311429001">Finnish Ministry of Education, 2009</xref>). Such a market approach is underlined by two assumptions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1028315311429001">Elonen, 2010</xref>). First, as there are no new economy-boosting companies such as Nokia in sight in Finland, the country needs to search for alternative sectors that could bring employment and generate income. Education is the one of these sectors. Second, it seems that there is a growing demand for good quality education around the world, and this state of affairs is likely to continue in the future. For the Ministry of Education (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1028315311429001">2009</xref>), the introduction of tuition fees for international students is not only an instrument to increase the international attractiveness of HEIs but also a way to develop the export of education as a service trade.</p>
<p>Even though many in the higher education sector have received the reform with hope and enthusiasm, it has also created controversy and led to criticism. Some politicians believe that tuition fees will be counterproductive to internationalisation as tuition-free education has been the way to attract international students to Finland. In their opinion, the fees would not be a major source of revenue for the universities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1028315311429001">Parties sharply divided, 2007</xref>). Moreover, domestic students are afraid that the introduction of tuition fees for international students might open the door for tuition fees in general (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1028315311429001">National Union of University Students in Finland, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Regardless of these disputes, a market or export approach to international higher education has been introduced in Finland. The current legislation in Finland has allowed HEIs to charge tuition fees to international students for degree education under two conditions. First, the 2007 Amendments to both the Universities Act (1997/645) and the Polytechnics Act (2003/351) allowed Finnish HEIs to charge fees for their degree education programmes if the fees are paid by a third organisation rather than individual students. This was called the <italic>“made-to-order” model</italic>. Second, according to the new Universities Act (558/2009) and the additional Amendments to the Polytechnics Act (2003/351), both effective from the beginning of 2010, Finnish HEIs are able to charge tuition fees to international students on a 5-year trial basis for separate master’s programmes, provided that the arrangements include a scholarship scheme. If the 5-year experiment on tuition fee-based master’s programmes shows positive results, it is likely that all international students will pay for degree programmes in Finnish HEIs in the future.</p>
<p>Along with the legislation change concerning tuition fees, the Finnish government published the Strategy for the Internationalisation of Higher Education Institutions in Finland 2009-2015 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1028315311429001">Finnish Ministry of Education, 2009</xref>). The strategy has set five primary aims for internationalisation: a) to develop a genuinely international higher education community, b) to increase the quality and attractiveness of HEIs, c) to promote the export of expertise, d) to support a multicultural society, and f) to promote global responsibility.</p>
<p>A ministerial working group has also developed the Education Export Strategy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1028315311429001">Finnish Ministry of Education, 2010</xref>), with several visions and measures. These are a) the precondition for education export should be based on a strong domestic education system and the high quality of education, b) the export of education will bolster other export business, c) the operation of education as an export industry entails networking and cooperation between the actors involved, d) the export of education will offer versatile solutions instead of single products and services, e) education exports will target chosen geographical areas and focus on selected fields, f) both the education exporters and educational institutions need to invest in product development to access to the international education market, and g) higher education institutions have a key position in education export.</p>
<p>The current governmental planning for education export mainly focuses on the perspective which occurs in a broad strategic analysis, with a strong statement of vision and mission, and achievable outcomes. However, either the strategy for internationalisation of higher education or the strategy for exporting education lacks thoughtful consideration on implementation. It is not clear by what means the objectives in the national plan can be achieved. Although emphasising the strengths and opportunities for exporting Finnish higher education, these strategy documents have not paid enough attention to the potential challenges, especially if tuition fees are introduced for most international students after the 5-years trial period. Moreover, the corresponding strategic planning is absent at the institutional level of Finnish higher education. This has been evidenced by interviews with staff from several Finnish HEIs on their readiness to meet the challenges presented by the export of education (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1028315311429001">Cai et al., 2012</xref>).</p>
<p>As the tuition fee policy and the concept of education export are in sharp contrast with Finnish tradition, it is not an easy task for the government to draw up a perfect plan in the initial stage. The reform will be implemented in incremental steps. Currently, the commercial aspect of educational activities still remains small compared with the overall level of international education in the country. Nevertheless, it is the time for the government, HEIs, and other stakeholders to analyse critically the current situation in Finland, to try to foresee the potential challenges based on international experience and establish their own implementation strategies.</p>

<title>Global Trends in Export of Higher Education</title>
<p>The changes towards seeing international higher education as an export industry were first noticed in the 1980s. Full cost tuition fees for international students were introduced in the United Kingdom in the early 1980s as one of the reforms to encourage HEIs to seek funding sources outside the government funding scheme (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-1028315311429001">Williams, 1997</xref>). In Australia, the education of international students started to move from a taxpayer-subsidised activity towards an export industry in 1986, when the federal government policy “made it illegal for universities to subsidise international students from government funds” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1028315311429001">Adams, 2007</xref>, p. 411). Similar changes took place in New Zealand, ushered in by the 1989 Education Act, which introduced tuition fees on a full cost recovery basis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1028315311429001">New Zealand Ministry of Education, 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>Although the tendency of international higher education to become an export sector has been legitimised in the main English-speaking countries—Australia, Canada, New Zealand, the United Kingdom and the United States—<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1028315311429001">Healey (2008)</xref> asserts that such a trend is unsustainable in the medium-term. His arguments are based on an analysis of the supply and demand side drivers in the higher education sector. On the supply side, when charging fees for domestic students is allowed, many universities may “begin to retreat from internationalisation and return to their ‘core activities’ of research and teaching domestic students” (p. 354). On the demand side, “as the higher education sectors in developing countries scale up and consumers become more sophisticated, it is likely that demand to study abroad, particularly at the lower status universities now so dependent on international students, will decline rather than continue to grow at recent rates” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1028315311429001">Healey, 2008</xref>, p. 354). Nevertheless, Healey also predicts that the trends in education export will not change within the next 15 years. Other critical views about the nature of global higher education can be seen in two studies by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1028315311429001">Marginson (2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1028315311429001">2007</xref>), which are mainly concerned with the inequalities and externalities created by the education export and global higher education.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the export of education is seemingly still a growing phenomenon worldwide, Europe included. Most European countries have traditionally employed a noncommercial approach to international education as their central strategy. However, several nations, such as France, Germany, and the Netherlands have started to adopt an export approach to international higher education (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1028315311429001">The Academic Cooperation Association, 2008</xref>). Recently there have been policies promoting the export of education in the Nordic countries, which had previously been amongst the most prominent promoters of tuition-free higher education. Denmark started to charge fees for international students in 2006, and Sweden has taken a similar stance from 2011. However, despite these developments, and with the exception of the United Kingdom, the export of higher education is still a very marginal phenomenon in the European higher education area.</p>

<title>What Should be Expected From International Students?</title>
<sec id="section5-1028315311429001">
<title>International Experience</title>
<p>Most European countries have three sets of expectations for bringing international students into higher education: to generate revenue, to attract talented students to the domestic labour market, and to enhance mutual awareness and business cooperation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1028315311429001">Cai, 2005</xref>). These expectations have also been reflected in the four approaches to cross-border education, namely “revenue-generating,” “skilled migration,” “capacity building,” and “mutual understanding” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1028315311429001">OECD, 2004</xref>, p. 4).</p>
<p>Revenue generation has been much sought after in some countries. In the United Kingdom and Australia, for instance, tuition fees paid by international students have become an important financial resource for HEIs. Such practices have provoked a major change throughout Europe in tuition fee policies. In most European countries, tuition fees would mainly concern non-EU students and help make up for the dwindling public expenditure on higher education. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1028315311429001">Altbach (1997)</xref> predicted, “it seems only a matter of time until Europe’s public universities charge [for] tuition” (p. 16).</p>
<p>Besides the financial benefits, recruiting international students is also a means for attracting highly skilled and talented international students into the European labour markets. The European countries welcome international students particularly to areas that are affected by a potential labour shortage. However, offering education to international students is also an effective approach to enriching the mutual cultural awareness between education providing countries and student source countries. Recruiting international students for degree programmes not only provides new contact opportunities between students, researchers, and institutions but also provides a firm basis for economic cooperation in the long run through the development of a mutual awareness and understanding.</p>
<p>However, the philosophies underlying these approaches are somewhat contradictory, which will make the policy orientation concerning international students more complicated and even controversial. The revenue generation approach is the most economically driven. In contrast, the mutual understanding approach encompasses political, cultural, academic, and development aid goals. Finally, the skilled migration approach shares the goals of the mutual understanding approach but strongly emphasises the demands of the labour market. When implementing the tuition fee policy, the government needs to clarify what their expectations are of international students recruited into higher education.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1028315311429001">
<title>Implications and Challenges for Finland</title>
<p>In a fee-free higher education system, there is an expectation that graduates from Finnish HEIs would either be employed in Finland or return home, becoming ambassadors and promoters for Finland. Thus, international education could boost the Finnish economy indirectly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1028315311429001">Mughul &amp; Pekkola, 2009</xref>). Although free education was and it still is one way for Finland to attract international students in many of its higher education degree programmes, it has also had some side effects. First, the intake of international students in Finland is limited by its financial capacity. Second, the HEIs lack the incentive to develop the relevance of their international programmes towards the needs of Finnish society. The market approach to international education is expected to solve the problems by increasing the capacity of Finnish HEIs to accommodate more international students, on the one hand and to promote the links between higher education and industry, on the other.</p>
<p>The government’s new strategy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1028315311429001">Finnish Ministry of Education, 2009</xref>) considers, though implicitly, that the internationalisation of higher education is a way to internationalise the entire society and to create new networks and business opportunities. However, what is especially highlighted in the strategy is that international higher education itself is seen as a profitable business.</p>
<p>Although the government intends to embrace all three aspects of the internationalisation of the student body, the question is whether all the objectives can be achieved at the same time. For instance, the government has set up two objectives for exporting education by 2015: a) the number of international degree students will increase considerably and b) international education will be developed as an export industry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1028315311429001">Finnish Ministry of Education, 2009</xref>, pp. 10-40). However, the two policy goals might be contradictory. As the majority of current international students chose to study in Finland because of its free education (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1028315311429001">Kärki, 2005</xref>, p. 21), charging for tuition could have a negative impact on the enrolment of international students in Finnish higher education. This has been the experience in Denmark and Sweden (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1028315311429001">Tse, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>Exporting education tends to be a privilege of the English-speaking countries due to the importance of the English language in career success (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1028315311429001">Elder, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-1028315311429001">Wiers-Jenssen, 2008</xref>, p. 106). Finland as a non-English-speaking country does not have this inherent advantage in exporting its higher education, and therefore a pure “revenue-generating” model does not fit the Finnish context. Moreover, the market-oriented model may encounter challenges in implementation due to Finland’s strong welfare state tradition.</p>
<p>In spite of an emerging desire to commoditise international education in Finland, it is worth noting that in countries such as Canada, where a similar shift from seeing international education as development aid to seeing it as trade took place 20 year ago, there has been an increasing call for preserving and fostering the importance of the humanitarian and cultural aspects of international educational activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1028315311429001">Cudmore, 2005</xref>, p. 47). Especially in the situation where “[Finnish] higher education institutions have been left out of fast-growing educational markets” and “the export and professional marketing of competence are still in their infancy” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1028315311429001">Finnish Ministry of Education, 2009</xref>, p. 15), it may be risky to commoditise international student recruitment in a radical way. Given the unique Finnish context, one could ask if more attention should be paid to “skilled migration” and “mutual understanding” approaches rather than overemphasising revenue generating.</p>

<title>Tuition Fees: How Much Should be Charged?</title>
<sec id="section8-1028315311429001">
<title>International Experience</title>
<p>Setting the level of tuition fees is a matter of both efficiency and equity concerns (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1028315311429001">Jacobs &amp; van der Bloeg, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1028315311429001">Psacharopoulos, 2008</xref>). In terms of efficiency, coherent bases for setting tuition fees include the level of student demand, the cost of provision, and the level of public subsidy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1028315311429001">Bevc &amp; Uršič, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1028315311429001">Santiago, 2008</xref>). Equity concerns create pressures for governments to set an upper limit for tuition fees (a fee ceiling) thereby limiting the autonomy of HEIs’ pricing strategies. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1028315311429001">Adams (2007)</xref> has distinguished two basic models in the countries that have a long tradition of charging fees for higher education. The first model includes countries such as Australia, New Zealand and the United Kingdom, in which the education of international students has been regarded as an export industry. Tuition fees collected from the students not only cover education costs but also generate a surplus for the institutions. In the other model, the fee levels are below the full cost of education, and American and Canadian public institutions provide an example of this.</p>
<p>During the last decade, many countries have undertaken reforms with respect to tuition fee policies. Within the EU there has been a trend towards charging tuition fees for full-time study in public HEIs. Some countries have introduced them recently, whereas in some countries they are under current policy discussion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1028315311429001">Bevc &amp; Uršič, 2008</xref>). Currently, approximately one third of HEIs in OECD countries charge tuition fees that exceed 1,000 Euros per year from domestic students. In the United States, the average tuition fee in public institutions exceeds 3,500 Euros. Among the EU19 countries, only in Italy do tuition fees exceed 800 Euros per full-time domestic student (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1028315311429001">OECD, 2010</xref>, pp. 247-248). Several countries make a distinction based on students’ citizenship. In many countries, the average tuition fees charged by public institutions for students who are not citizens of countries in either the EU or the EEA are twice the fees charged for citizens of these countries. As institutions in the Nordic countries have no tradition of collecting tuition fees from domestic students, they face a dilemma in setting an appropriate tuition fee level from the efficiency perspective. In general, it is expected that the tuition fees should cover the full cost of the education provided and will therefore depend partly on the type and content of the course or programme. As limits for fees are not stipulated by legislation in either Sweden or Denmark, it is up to the individual HEIs to set the level of fees. That is, the equity concerns prescribed by these governments have no direct role in setting the fees by HEIs. In Denmark, the annual tuition fee for full-time degree students ranges from 6,000 to 16,000 Euros (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1028315311429001">Study in Denmark, 2011</xref>) and in Sweden annual fees range from approximately 9,000 to 15,700 Euros (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1028315311429001">Study in Sweden, 2011</xref>). Both Denmark and Sweden have introduced scholarship programmes to assist qualified students, as well as introducing tuition fees.</p>
<p>In Sweden, for instance, the explicit rationale for introducing tuition fees was in realisation of the fact that Sweden was one of the few remaining countries that had not started to charge tuition fees for international students. Because of this, Swedish institutions were not on an equal footing with other institutions in the global higher education market. By establishing tuition fees, it was believed that Swedish HEIs would be better identified by the quality of the education and study environment they offered, instead of as being a no-cost option (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1028315311429001">Gair, 2011</xref>, p. 18; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1028315311429001">Swedish Ministry of Education and Research, 2010</xref>). Determining whether Sweden has achieved its goals with the introduction of tuition fees—that is, by competing globally for talented students on the basis of quality rather than free tuition—will only be determined in the coming years as Swedish HEIs attempt to establish themselves as a destination for tuition fee-paying international students. However, the first impacts after the introduction of fees have not been encouraging. Applications by international students for places in Swedish HEIs went down from 91,788 applications for the 2010-2011 academic year to 26,846 applications for the 2011-2012 academic year (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1028315311429001">Gair, 2011</xref>, p. 62). Nevertheless, it might be too early to draw conclusions from these figures, as it reportedly took Denmark about 3 or 4 years before international student application numbers recovered to previous levels after it introduced tuition fees in 2006 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1028315311429001">Tse, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>A thorough analysis should be also conducted to determine whether the level of fees set by Swedish HEIs has had an impact on this decline of applications. Given the aforementioned level of Danish tuition fees (6,000-16,000 Euros), the average level of fees should not be too high, although some Swedish programmes, such some offered by Umeå University, charge annual fees as high as 38,000 Euros (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1028315311429001">Gair, 2011</xref>, p. 25).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-1028315311429001">
<title>Implications and Challenges for Finland</title>
<p>In many ways, determining fees is still an open question for Finnish HEIs. Although a ministerial working group proposed the introduction of an annual tuition fee of between 3,500 and 12,000 Euros in August 2005 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1028315311429001">Call for annual, 2005</xref>), the current legislation does not set any specific parameters for Finnish HEIs on charging fees. However, the new Universities Act (558/2009) mentions that the fee for “made-to-order education” must cover at least the costs incurred in providing the education.</p>
<p>Determining the true cost of educating international students has been difficult at the institutional level. Finnish HEIs are in the process of developing their cost accounting methods, but reliable and comparable information on the costs of running fee-based international programmes is still largely missing between and inside the institutions. Similarly, there is a lack of information about the relative demand. From this perspective, it is not surprising that, at the moment, only a handful of Finnish HEIs have provided exact information concerning their tuition fee levels. For instance, Aalto University has set a flat fee of 8,000 Euros for all master’s programmes regardless of the field (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1028315311429001">Aalto University, 2011</xref>). Without a doubt, Swedish and Danish experience will also have had an impact on Finnish HEIs on matters relating to the setting of appropriate fee levels for their programmes.</p>
<p>The Ministry of Education (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1028315311429001">2009</xref>, p. 42) in Finland expects that the additional income derived from the export of education will become an incentive for Finnish HEIs to market their competence and education programmes. This could indicate that the government has no intention of subsidising the fee-based programmes despite the scholarship schemes that HEIs are required to establish. Rather, it is expected that HEIs could and should generate surplus from their fee-based activities. If this is the case, revenue generation is one of the Finnish government’s main expectations from international students.</p>
<p>Even though the trade model has been determined as being an appropriate model, the move from a traditional tuition fee free system to that end must be a gradual process. Even in New Zealand, for instance, some newly developed international education programmes still receive seed funding before they become self-sustaining (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1028315311429001">McInnis, Peacock, Catherwood, &amp; Brown, 2006</xref>, p. 2).</p>
<p>Thus, would it be more realistic to think that charging fees is just a means of coping with the deficiency of government funding? If this is the case, the government should not expect international students to cover fully the cost of providing education. Rather, the government, HEIs, and industry need to take responsibility for supporting international higher education, especially in its initial stages.</p>
<p>There should be a continuing discussion and clarification at the national level on who should pay for the education. Even thought the funding of international higher education will no longer be a primary public responsibility, it does not necessarily mean those paying for education will be replaced exclusively by international students. The current reform in Finland demonstrates an inclination towards the Australian model. However, perhaps the model used in American and Canadian public HEIs might be more suitable for Finland.</p>

<title>Why Do Students Study in Another Country?</title>
<sec id="section11-1028315311429001">
<title>International Experience</title>
<p>A number of studies dealing with the motivations for students to study abroad have been undertaken. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1028315311429001">McMahon (1992)</xref> outlined the factors affecting students’ choice in studying abroad between “push” and “pull” models. The push factors are mainly concerned with the home country and they create a generalised interest in overseas education but do not give specific direction to individuals. These factors are the level of economic wealth, the degree of involvement of the home country in the world economy, the priority placed on education by the government of the home country, and the availability of educational opportunities in the home country. The pull factors are derived from host countries, which try to differentiate between study destinations. These include relative size of the student’s home country’s economy compared with the host country, economic links between the home country and the host country, the host country’s national political interests in the home country, and the host nation’s support for international students.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1028315311429001">Mazzarol and Soutar (2002)</xref> have identified three stages in the process of a student’s decisions for choosing his or her study destination. In the first stage, the student decides to study abroad rather than locally, and the decision is influenced mainly by push factors. In the second stage, the student decides on a host country driven by pull factors. In the last stage, the student selects a host institution. In addition to the pull factors listed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1028315311429001">McMahon (1992)</xref>, a number of other factors make a particular institution more attractive than others. Relevant factors include the institution’s reputation for quality, its market profile, the range of courses offered, alliances or coalitions, offshore teaching programmes, staff expertise, the degree of innovation, the use of information technology, resources, the size of the alumni base, and promotion and marketing efforts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1028315311429001">Mazzarol, 1998</xref>).</p>
<p>Drawing on a number of student surveys (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1028315311429001">Bodycott, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1028315311429001">Böhm et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1028315311429001">Lee, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1028315311429001">Mazzarol &amp; Soutar, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1028315311429001">Simpson &amp; Tan, 2009</xref>), the most common factors attracting students to a destination country can be summarised as follows:</p>
<list id="list1-1028315311429001" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>Knowledge and awareness of the host country</p></list-item>

<list-item><p>Geographic proximity</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>Nevertheless, all the aforementioned studies and student surveys focus mainly on the mobility of international students to English-speaking countries in the West. There is a lack of equivalent research on the motivations of students to study in non-English-speaking countries. In particular, it remains unknown what the motives for international students to come to Finland are and how to enhance the attractiveness of Finnish higher education in the competitive global education market.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-1028315311429001">
<title>Implications and Challenges for Finland</title>
<p>A traditional perception of Finland has been that it is remote from important economic and industrial centres, it tends to be expensive, it has a climate that deters international students or immigrants, and it has a difficult language. All these factors have constrained the development of international higher education in Finnish HEIs and will continue to do so (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1028315311429001">OECD, 2009</xref>, p. 65). According to the results of international student surveys elsewhere mentioned above, Finland may be less attractive for international students because of a relative lack of awareness of it, a scarcity of social educational links to most parts of the world, and its remote location to most targeted student markets. In spite of these challenges, a tuition fee free education system has been the major drive to keep the inflow of international student growing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1028315311429001">Cai &amp; Hölttä, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1028315311429001">Kärki, 2005</xref>). The number of international master’s students has increased from about 1,500 in 1999 to 3,600 students in 2010 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1028315311429001">KOTA Online, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>As indicated in a survey conducted by Finnish student unions, when students have to pay, they also require value for their money (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1028315311429001">Kärki, 2005</xref>). The Finnish government and HEIs believe that the excellence of teaching and research in Finnish higher education will continue to attract international students to study in Finland (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1028315311429001">Finnish Ministry of Education, 2009</xref>, p. 10; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1028315311429001">Takkinen, 2010</xref>). It is even clearly addressed both in the Strategy for the Internationalisation of Higher Education Institutions in Finland 2009-2015 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1028315311429001">Finnish Ministry of Education, 2009</xref>) and in the Finnish Education Export Strategy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1028315311429001">Finnish Ministry of Education, 2010</xref>), that only quality will bring success.</p>
<p>Ensuring the quality of education is certainly essential for the development of international higher education in Finland, but it does not necessary guarantee its success in attracting international students in the global market place. As the quality of education can hardly be measured and perceived by students (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1028315311429001">Marginson, 2006</xref>), students are inclined to judge the quality of a higher education system or a particular institution by its international reputation and the career success of graduates.</p>
<p>Student surveys in the United Kingdom and Australia provide evidence that when students choose a study place in a higher education institution, they are more influenced by university prestige than the quality of teaching and student services provided (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1028315311429001">James, Baldwin, &amp; McInnis, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1028315311429001">Moogan, &amp; Harris, 1999</xref>). This is because compared with quality, institutional reputation can be easily identified through university rankings, students’ awareness, and information available in public media (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1028315311429001">Marginson, 2006</xref>). In this respect, Finnish higher education will usually be disadvantaged, as there are few Finnish HEIs in the top 100 of international university rankings. In spite of often being criticised for their idiosyncratic nature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1028315311429001">Bellon, 2006</xref>), ranking systems have become an inevitable indicator for international students when they are considering choice of an institution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1028315311429001">Lawrence, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>There is a global tendency that the career success of graduates is often used to measure directly the quality of higher education (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1028315311429001">Teichler, 2009</xref>, p. 15). Therefore, how an individual is capable of gaining initial employment after graduation from an educational institution, is an important issue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1028315311429001">Harvey, Locke, &amp; Morey, 2002</xref>). The concept of employability was emphasised in the Bologna process in 1999, and since then, it has gained an important place in higher education (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1028315311429001">Teichler, 2009</xref>, p. 16). When promoting Finnish higher education in international education markets, it is very important to convince the students of a promising employment future. However, there is little information concerning the employment situation of international students that have graduated from Finnish HEIs. This again can become a bottleneck for marketing Finnish higher education.</p>

<title>What are the Models for Exporting Education?</title>
<sec id="section14-1028315311429001">
<title>International Experience</title>
<p>According to the GATS (General Agreement on Trade in Services), all forms of educational activity that charge tuition fees for commercial purposes are counted as part of educational service business, and it provides four models for exporting educational services. These are a) cross-border supply, b) consumption abroad, c) commercial presence, and d) presence of natural persons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1028315311429001">Knight, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-1028315311429001">World Trade Organisation [WTO], 1999</xref>). Cross-border supply mainly refers to the provision of distance education courses and services. Consumption abroad mainly refers to citizens of one country studying in another country. Commercial presence refers primarily to the situation where educational institutions from one country set up schools and other educational institutions engaged in education and related services, in another country. Presence of natural persons refers primarily to the citizens of one country engaging in professional teaching and training in another country.</p>
<p>It has been predicted that the dominance of traditional student mobility, namely studying abroad, will be gradually supplemented by “offshore” education, defined as “taking a degree or other post-secondary courses offered by a foreign university without leaving their home country” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1028315311429001">OECD, 2004</xref>, p. 3). This trend has also been noted in a World Bank report. The report states that “while the main form of this trade is through the movement of students to universities abroad, newer forms are emerging in which foreign universities provide higher education in partnership with local institutions or by themselves, either through an in-country presence, or through a virtual presence” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1028315311429001">Bashia, 2007</xref>, p. 11). Although distance learning is also increasingly applied in offshore education, as “not all students are suitable for distance learning” and “not all subjects are best taught via this form of learning,” the education provision through in-country presence is dominating over virtual education delivery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1028315311429001">Naidoo, 2009</xref>, p. 312).</p>
<p>Compared with the traditional form of international education where students come to study at degree awarding institutions, bringing education services to the students’ home country may have a larger market potential in terms of student resources and the impact on the receiving country (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1028315311429001">OECD, 2004</xref>, p. 3).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section15-1028315311429001">
<title>Implications and Challenges for Finland</title>
<p>The models of education export under discussion among Finnish HEIs include mainly the following: a) charging international students’ fees for some pilot master’s programmes, b) developing “made-to-order” degree programmes commissioned by foreign organisations, and c) expanding existing fee-based, short-term training programmes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1028315311429001">Cai et al., 2012</xref>). All these education services normally require international students to study in Finland, and too little attention has been paid to providing degree education abroad or offshore education.</p>
<p>Recent legislation reforms in Finland have provided opportunities for Finnish HEIs to develop offshore education. The Finnish Ministry of Education has also observed the global shift from the traditional model where students travel to study abroad towards new models of international education, “such as branch campuses, franchising, made-to-order education, bilateral training agreements, twinning, joint degrees, e-learning and corporate universities” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1028315311429001">Finnish Ministry of Education, 2009</xref>, p. 20). As there is a shared concern that the introduction of tuition fees could pose serious challenges for recruiting international students to Finland, organising educational programmes abroad may be an alternative, and an even more effective way to attract international students, particularly from developing countries where demand for higher education cannot be met by the domestic supply. Of course, offshore education might not offer students the same cultural and linguistic experience as studying in foreign countries, but it involves lower personal costs than studying abroad and can lead to a beneficial spill over in the receiving country’s higher education (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1028315311429001">OECD, 2004</xref>, p. 3).</p>
<p>Moreover, although more and more Finnish enterprises have established their businesses abroad, they need increasing numbers of competent, local employees who have mastered both the technologies and skills required by the companies and have gained an understanding of both Finnish and local cultures. The involvement of Finnish higher education provision abroad may facilitate the training of the local labour force in line with the needs of Finnish companies.</p>
<p>However, compared with recruiting international students to study in Finland, Finnish HEIs face more challenges abroad, in that few Finnish HEIs have the know-how on how to operate in an overseas market with a different culture, and the Finnish legislation still remains vague on how Finnish HEIs can operate in offshore education and charge fees for it (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1028315311429001">Cai, 2011</xref>).</p>

<sec id="section16-1028315311429001" sec-type="discussion">
<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Whether we like it or not, the application of a trade approach to international higher education is becoming an irreversible worldwide trend. In such a model, education is increasingly seen as a private good mainly benefitting individuals, who therefore should pay for their studies. This trend has also been reflected in the recent higher education reform in Finland. The current governmental strategies on the internationalisation of higher education and on education exports from Finland indicate that the Finnish government not only favours tuition fees for international students but also has optimistic views for the future. The policy makers’ position might be based on the experiences of major higher education exporters, such as the United Kingdom, Australia, and New Zealand. For instance, even though British universities have been charging the highest fees in Europe since the 1980s, the soaring study costs have not stemmed the flow of international students. However, the unique advantages of the United Kingdom, such as the availability of diversified courses delivered in English, colonial history, and the environment it provides for improving English language skills, are not available for many other countries. Therefore, Finland, as a small and relatively unknown country with a language rarely spoken outside its borders, must develop its own approach based on its particular social and economic context.</p>
<sec id="section17-1028315311429001">
<title>Finland’s Hybrid Expectations of International Students</title>
<p>What Finland expects from the recruited international students will lead to different approaches to cross-border education. The Finnish approach needs to be developed based on an understanding of the relationship between the internationalisation of higher education and the economic development priorities in the country. The Finnish economy is heavily based on high-tech industries alongside some traditional sectors (such as forest industry and machinery), and export is the key to the country’s economic growth. Although most exports go to neighbouring countries, Finland also attaches great importance to developing markets in some of the emerging economies, such as China (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1028315311429001">Finnish Customs, 2009</xref>). These countries are also regarded as promising education markets in the Strategy for the Internationalisation of Higher Education Institutions in Finland 2009-2015 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1028315311429001">Finnish Ministry of Education, 2009</xref>). After the talented young students from these countries have graduated from Finnish higher education, it is anticipated that they will become cultural ambassadors and business promoters for Finland. Thus, international higher education can be a catalyst for economic growth in Finland. For this purpose, international higher education must be considered partially as a public good and it thus deserves government support, benefitting the whole community over time.</p>
<p>The revenue generation approach seems to be somewhat overemphasised in the current governmental strategies. Collecting tuition fees from international students is important for enlarging the capacity of international education in Finland, but it is mainly a way to counterbalance the shortage of public investment rather than to create a source of income for Finnish HEIs. Therefore, a better strategy at the current stage of development would be for the government to provide one-off, fixed period seed money for HEIs to launch their degree programmes in areas which appear to be most profitable for each HEI and beneficial for the economic development in Finland. This funding should be made available through competitive bids. Only those prospective programmes that offer guarantees of good quality and demand should be selected to receive funding. The governmental seed funding can also steer education exports towards a few priority disciplinary areas and some focused student markets, as was suggested in the recent minister working group’s report on Education Export Strategy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1028315311429001">Finnish Ministry of Education, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>Even though this funding is somewhat against the spirit of the higher education reform (i.e., making HEIs more responsible for their own finances, strategies and programme offerings), it is important as HEIs lack both the tradition and experience in operating in the international higher education markets. This is even more important at the present time when the Finnish economy is still recovering from the global economic recession.</p>
<p>In the end, the government and business sectors should exert influence on international higher education through both policy and financial intervention. The aim is to enhance dialogue and cooperation between Finland and the countries on its economic priority list with respect to higher education, to maximise the potential economic interests from these markets.</p>
<p>Of course, universities should also invest in product development and student recruitment. This has been clearly stated in the Export Education Strategy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1028315311429001">Finnish Ministry of Education, 2010</xref>). However, the matter relating to investment must be taken into account in the funding negotiation processes between the Ministry of Education and universities.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section18-1028315311429001">
<title>Feasible Tuition Fee Standards in Finland</title>
<p>If the expectation in recruiting international students extends beyond the revenue generation approach, one principle for setting the fee levels is that the students should not be expected to pay all the costs of their education. The other rationale is that the tuition fees should be reasonable to make the programmes price-competitive. For instance, if the tuition fees charged in Finland were close to those charged in the United Kingdom and the United States, international students are likely to desert Finland for countries with English as their mother tongue.</p>
<p>If Finnish HEIs cannot create a tuition fee revenue stream from the students sufficient for covering the full education cost, they may have difficulties in running fee-based programmes. In this situation, the initial seed funding from the government for developing fee-based programmes would be indispensable. When these programmes become more mature, HEIs should pursue self-sustainability by diversifying their financial sources to include both tuition fees and contributions from Finnish industry.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section19-1028315311429001">
<title>Branding Finnish HEIs for Attracting International Students</title>
<p>The government requires all HEIs that choose to collect tuition fees for their English-language master’s programmes to provide scholarship options for international students enrolled in these programmes. However, it is mainly an expedient to counterbalance the possible loss of young international talent because of the introduction of tuition fees, in addition to its role of ensuring the equality of student access. Nevertheless, the establishment of scholarship funds is a great challenge for individual universities.</p>
<p>Generally speaking, there has yet to be a systematic consideration of the factors that affect international students’ choice to study in Finland. Nor are there sound grounds for such consideration. For this reason, more empirical studies on this matter are urgently needed.</p>
<p>Two hypothetical factors, namely “reputation” and “employability” based on the findings of student surveys elsewhere, were mentioned above. Institutional visibility in global ranking lists, such as the Times Higher Education Supplement’s “World University Rankings” and Shanghai Jiao Tong University’s “Academic Ranking of World Universities,” is an important prestige generator, but at the moment, most Finnish HEIs have no chance of dramatically improving their standing. For this reason, the government and universities should reach a mutual understanding of the specific fields in which Finnish HEIs might successfully compete globally. Success in one field is likely to create a “halo effect,” radiating to the other programmes offered by the same institution.</p>
<p>One way to improve the visibility of Finnish higher education would be the full utilisation of the European Union programmes aimed at improving the attractiveness of the European Higher Education Area. For instance, prestigious Erasmus Mundus cooperation and mobility programme can operate as pathfinder for the international recognisability of high quality Finnish higher education, as the Erasmus Mundus programme period 2009-2013 is specifically aimed at the enhancement of quality in European higher education and the promotion of the European Union as a centre of excellence in learning around the world (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1028315311429001">Education, Audiovisual and Culture Executive Agency [EACEA], 2011</xref>). Furthermore, as a small country, Finland could and should be able to derive great benefits from the development of a more coordinated European or Scandinavian approach to the export of higher education to the rest of the world. In addition, both HEIs and national agencies could establish opportunities for stronger collaboration, for example through the benchmarking of best practises and developing joint marketing campaigns for the export of European higher education.</p>
<p>However, as much as European cooperation can benefit Finnish higher education, at the same time other European and Scandinavian HEIs are the competitors of Finnish institutions. Therefore, the reputation building of Finnish higher education should be based strongly on the national brand. The current Finnish strategies on internationalisation of higher education tend to build the national prestige of Finnish higher education on existing national accomplishments. For instance, the remarkable success of Finland’s school education in the OECD’s PISA studies and in the global ranking lists measuring competitiveness, innovation and creativity, should all be used fully. In addition, Finland should also highlight its competitive advantages through matters such as the Nordic welfare model, low levels of corruption and high ethical standards compared with many other European countries and the Anglo-American models.</p>
<p>What we want to highlight here is that developing the export of education should go beyond the education sector per se. For promoting Finnish higher education, especially in the initial stage, the HEIs need to use famous Finnish industry brands to establish their visibility and image in targeted markets. Once the education programmes for international learners are in operation, they become a cost-effective approach to promoting Finnish industry as well. Education is a soft way to get companies’ names and products to prospective clients. Collaboration between higher education and industry should entail financial support from industry to higher education and human resource provision from higher education to industry. Strengthened links between the two sectors would improve the employability of international students who have graduated from Finnish HEIs and this would thus become a positive signal in attracting more international talent to study in Finland.</p>

<title>Potential Models for Exporting Finnish Higher Education</title>
<p>The above discussions have revealed the dilemmas in the strategies of internationalisation in Finland. For instance, a dramatic increase in numbers of international students and the growth of revenue from the international education trade can hardly be achieved simultaneously in Finland. It has been argued that charging some international students tuition fees would be unlikely to generate much additional revenue unless international students made up a substantial proportion of the total student population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1028315311429001">Aarrevaara et al., 2009</xref>, p. 101). Even though Finland tries to increase the quantity, there is a risk that the source of students will change from being those who are the most talented to those coming from rich families.</p>
<p>Because of the inherent disadvantages of Finland in attracting international students, and the paucity of experience and knowhow of Finnish HEIs in marketing, it is unlikely that an adequate number of international students will enroll in Finnish higher education in the near future. Therefore, international higher education is unlikely to become an engine for direct growth in the economy. We maintain that if revenue generation is not realistic at the current stage, it is better not to lose the opportunities that come from international education attracting skilled immigration to Finland and promoting cultural awareness between Finland and the rest of the world.</p>
<p>Is the objective of developing international higher education as a traded service then likely to fail? Our answer is no. The objectives for revenue generation will be achieved if Finnish HEIs shift their attention to offshore education markets. As was mentioned earlier, offshore education is becoming an emerging for-profit cross-border activity. Australia is a striking example of a country whose provision of cross-border higher education is increasingly implemented in the student’s home country largely to broaden the sources of revenue and to expand its international profile (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1028315311429001">Pyvis &amp; Chapman, 2004</xref>, p. 1). Between 1996 and 2006, offshore enrolments increased from 18% to 30% of all international students enrolled in Australian institutions, and there are forecasts that by 2025 the figure will reach 47% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1028315311429001">Naidoo, 2009</xref>, p. 323).</p>
<p>Although the number of international students studying in Finland might remain relatively stable, we predict that a considerable increase in enrolment will be seen at the Finnish subcampuses or joint venture schools abroad, especially in countries with a shortage of domestic higher education supply. In doing so, the high quality of Finnish education and rigorous quality control system will become an advantage in offering offshore education. As there are fewer restrictions on study places, operating offshore education would provide financial rewards for the HEIs involved. Moreover, the education provision abroad will also meet the needs of Finnish enterprises there and help promote cultural and value ties with the countries where Finnish offshore education is located. Thus, offshore education can be the best solution to meet all expectations for educating international students.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section21-1028315311429001">
<title>Final Remarks</title>
<p>To achieve the objectives of the strategies proposed above, systematic coordination at the national level is required. In this regard, the Finnish government has established a coordination programme “Future Learning Finland” (FLF) to promote cooperation and networking among the operators involved in education export with the objectives of developing solutions to meet customers’ needs and looking for new business opportunities. This is a very important step in promoting Finnish education exports. However, this coordination takes place mainly at the operational level. There should also be coordination between government, higher education, and industry in strategic planning and financing. It is worth noting that the FLF is more like an application of general national exporting education strategies in the field of education. As exporting education does not follow the same logic as exporting goods, such an approach needs to be adjusted by integrating it with specialised knowhow on how to operate in already developed market areas. Moreover, the FLF programme will only last for 3 years. Thus, to establish a permanent coordination platform for sustainable development is needed, which is indeed an important goal of the programme.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the discussion and suggestions in this article are tentative. More empirical research, forecast studies, and timely observations are required to understand the current situation and to develop further strategies. The current “Strategy for the Internationalisation of Higher Education Institutions in Finland 2009-2015” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1028315311429001">Finnish Ministry of Education, 2009</xref>) should also be evaluated after an appropriate period of time. Information about the effectiveness of the strategy, especially in terms of operating in the higher education market should be analysed and disseminated to the relevant stakeholders, and if necessary, effective actions should be taken to adjust the strategy. Although this article has a specific focus on Finland, the discussions and suggestions could also be relevant to other European countries sharing similar characteristics with Finland, namely, non-English-speaking countries intending to introduce tuition fees for international students.</p>
