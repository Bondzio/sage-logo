<abstract>
<p>Methylphenidate is a psychostimulant originally used for the treatment of attention-deficit disorder. Methylphenidate inhibits neuronal neurotransmitter transporters involved in the uptake of dopamine and norepinephrine at the level of the synapse. Inhibition of these transmitter transporters leads to increased concentrations of dopamine and norepinephrine in the synapse, which results in increasing alertness. The stimulant effect of methylphenidate has been used for the treatment of major depression, poststroke depression, cognitive enhancement in patients with brain tumors, neurodegenerative disorders, HIV disease, fatigue, and as a treatment for delirium and sedation associated with opioid use. Other areas where methylphenidate has been evaluated include gait disorders in the elderly individuals and the treatment of apathy in dementia. Analgesic effects have been demonstrated in preclinical models but true analgesic effects remain to be proven in humans. This article reviews the current use of methylphenidate for symptom management with a critical look at the evidence base for its efficacy in the conditions described.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Psychostimulants have been used for many decades in medicine for their alerting properties and for the treatment of depression associated with medical illness. Methylphenidate is one of the most commonly used psychostimulants in the field of palliative care and has been found to have specific uses in palliative medicine. Methylphenidate has been used to treat symptoms such as fatigue associated with cancer or chronic illness; opioid-related sedation; depression; and cognitive dysfunction associated with diseases such as cancer, HIV, neurodegenerative diseases, and delirium. The purpose of this review is to consider the mechanism of action, pharmacological properties, and neuropsychological effects of methylphenidate and to examine the evidence base for the use of methylphenidate in the management of important symptoms that occur in palliative medicine.</p>

<p>Methylphenidate has a phenylisopropylamine structure which is similar to that of amphetamine. It differs from amphetamine in that it has a piperidine ring attached.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1049909111427029">1</xref>
</sup> Methylphenidate has 2 centers of chirality, and there are potentially 4 isomers.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1049909111427029">1</xref>
</sup> The available product consists of a racemic mixture of <sc>dl</sc>-threo diastereomers (not mirror images of each other). The enantiomer responsible for clinical activity is the <sc>d</sc> isomer,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1049909111427029">2</xref>
</sup> which has more potent activity than the <sc>l</sc> isomer in terms of inhibition of tritiated dopamine and <sc>l</sc>-noradrenaline uptake into striatal and hypothalamic areas of the brain.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1049909111427029">3</xref>
</sup> The piperidine ring makes methylphenidate lipid soluble.<sup>

</sup>
</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-1049909111427029">
<title>Pharmacodynamics</title>
<p>Methylphenidate interacts with neuronal plasma membrane neurotransmitter transporters by interfering with the uptake of dopamine, norepinephrine, and, to a lesser extent, serotonin.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1049909111427029">5</xref>
</sup> The methylphenidate molecule has a high affinity for dopamine and norepinephrine transporters with a Ki = 0.06 μmol/L and 0.10 μmol/L, respectively, and weak interaction with the serotonin transporter (Ki = 132 μmol/L).<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1049909111427029">6</xref>
</sup> The <sc>d</sc> isomer is the primary isomer responsible for interference with the uptake of neurotransmitters.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1049909111427029">7</xref>
</sup>
</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1049909111427029">
<title>Mechanism of Action</title>
<p>By inhibition of the dopamine transporter, methylphenidate causes increased levels of dopamine in many areas of the brain ranging from the prefrontal area to the striatum.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1049909111427029">8</xref>
</sup> Dopamine receptor positron-emission tomography studies also show decreased dopamine ligand binding consistent with this effect of increased dopamine levels. Norepinephrine levels are increased in these same areas.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1049909111427029">8</xref>
</sup> The overall effect is increased alertness. Unlike modafinil, methylphenidate does not affect histamine release in the central nervous system (CNS).<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1049909111427029">9</xref>
</sup>
</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1049909111427029">
<title>Formulation</title>
<p>Methylphenidate is available in an immediate-release formulation, a sustained-release formulation, a transdermal formulation, and an osmotic-release capsule.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1049909111427029">10</xref>
</sup> The use of methylphenidate in palliative care has generally been confined to the immediate-release formulation. Immediate-release formulations are available in 5, 10, 20, and 30 mg doses. Sustained-release formulations consist of various products including osmotically controlled sustained release capsules available in 8, 27, 36, and 54 mg capsules, and wax matrix formulations with doses available including 5, 10, 20, or 30 mg depending on the manufacturer. Transdermal formulations are available but have not been studied in palliative medicine.</p>

<title>Pharmacology</title>
<sec id="section7-1049909111427029">
<title>Immediate-Release Methylphenidate</title>
<p>Methylphenidate is absorbed with a bioavailability<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1049909111427029">11</xref>
</sup> of 23%. Time to maximum concentration ranges from 1 to 3 hours. The half-life for the immediate-release formulation is 2.5 to 3 hours. Food can delay the time to peak concentration. Methylphenidate is renally excreted (90%). The volume of distribution is 6 L/kg. Methylphenidate has a protein binding of 10% to 33%.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-1049909111427029">
<title>Sustained-Release Methylphenidate Formulations</title>
<p>Pharmacokinetic studies of sustained-release methylphenidate have shown a somewhat longer <italic>T</italic>
<sub>max</sub> (3-4 hours) and <italic>T</italic>
<sub>1/2</sub> (4 hours), which is due most likely to prolonged absorption rather than true time to elimination.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1049909111427029">12</xref>
</sup> Typical of sustained-release formulations, the <italic>C</italic>
<sub>max</sub> of sustained-release methylphenidate is lower than that of immediate-release methylphenidate.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1049909111427029">13</xref>
</sup> Because of the nature of the wax-matrix tablet, cutting these tablets increases the rate of dissolution, and chewed tablets behave similarly to an equivalent dose of standard methylphenidate.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1049909111427029">11</xref>
</sup> The sustained-release preparation has a volume of distribution of 6 L/kg. The potential exists for delayed absorption with fatty meals and resultant erratic peak levels.<sup>

<sec id="section9-1049909111427029">
<title>Transdermal Methylphenidate</title>
<p>When methylphenidate is administered transdermally, the first detectable concentrations are observed usually at 3 hours after administration. Removal of the patch is associated with excretion biexponentially with elimination times of 3 to 4 hours in children with attention-deficit disorders.<sup>

<title>Methylphenidate Metabolism</title>
<p>The metabolism of methylphenidate is accomplished by de-esterification.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1049909111427029">10</xref>
</sup> De-esterification produces ritalinic acid, which is the major metabolite and has no physiologic activity. Ritalinic acid has a half-life of 3 to 4 hours. There is extensive presystemic hepatic metabolism of the drug as peak levels of methylphenidate and ritalinic acid occurs simultaneously. There is very little fecal excretion though methylphenidate is renally excreted. There is limited involvement of the cytochrome oxidase system in the metabolism of methylphenidate, at least suggested by in vitro studies, but these may not reflect clinical realities (see drug interactions).<sup>

<title>Use of Methylphenidate in Patients With Cardiac Disease</title>
<p>Treatment of depression in patients with cardiac disease has led to concerns about cardiovascular effects of methylphenidate, including valid concerns such as arrhythmia promotion and problems with elevated heart rate and blood pressure. One small series of patients with cardiac disease receiving methylphenidate for depression<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1049909111427029">17</xref>
</sup> showed positive therapeutic response in 4 depressed patients who developed cardiovascular complications after cardiac surgery that contraindicated the use of tricyclic antidepressants. These 4 patients showed rapid remission of depressive symptoms without adverse side effects.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section15-1049909111427029">
<title>Drug Interactions</title>
<p>Since the main mechanism of action is via the enhancement of dopamine and catecholamine transmission, the main drug interactions of concern involve other drugs given simultaneously that operate by similar mechanisms and enhance these effects. The use of monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors is contraindicated due to the risk of hypertensive crisis (headache, palpitation, and neck stiffness). Despite the in vitro lack of evidence that cytochrome P450 (CYP) is involved in the metabolism of methylphenidate, reports exist that inducers of CYP3A4 can lower methylphenidate levels.<sup>

</sup> in frail adults with advanced cancer given methylphenidate for depression and fatigue found that among 62 patients, new symptoms caused by methylphenidate included agitation (16%), insomnia (16%), dry mouth (15%), nausea (10%), tremors (6%), anorexia (5%), headache (3%), palpitations (2%), and vomiting (2%). Adverse effects with methylphenidate appeared to improve spontaneously despite continued therapy. Lasheen and colleagues<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1049909111427029">19</xref>

With respect to concerns about appetite suppression, 2 uncontrolled studies that used methylphenidate to treat depression in 10 and 59 patients with advanced cancer found no impairment of appetite as an adverse effect of therapy.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1049909111427029">20</xref>

<title>Methylphenidate for the Treatment of Depression in Patients With Cancer</title>
<p>The rapid onset of action of psychostimulants such as methylphenidate associated with the alleviation of depressive symptoms can be a great benefit to depressed patients.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1049909111427029">22</xref></sup>Methylphenidate has also been used in the treatment of depression in patients with terminal illnesses such as cancer. Early studies of the use of methylphenidate in patients with cancer showed improvement in depression without toxicity, as well as improvement in appetite.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1049909111427029">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1049909111427029">24</xref>
</sup> Remission of depression can be rapid. A study of depression in 30 patients with cancer treated with methylphenidate found that 10 patients showed substantial improvement and 13 showed moderate improvement in their depressive symptoms, often within days.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1049909111427029">25</xref>
</sup> Adverse effects were minimal and one third received therapy with methylphenidate for up to 1 year. Olin and coworkers retrospectively assessed the response of depressed patients with cancer (N = 59) to either methylphenidate or dextroamphetamine hospitalized over a 5-year period.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1049909111427029">26</xref>
</sup> Of the 59 patients, 35 met criteria for major depression and 27% met criteria for adjustment disorder with mixed mood. The majority of patients had solid tumors the most common being colon, breast, and lung cancer. The majority of patients (44) received dextroamphetamine, with 15 receiving methylphenidate averaging 8 mg daily (range 5-30 mg). Twelve of the 15 patients receiving methylphenidate experienced improvement in mood with a rapid response, most within 2 days. Nearly, 30% of patients receiving methylphenidate had an improvement in appetite. Methylphenidate can have a positive effect on patients in hospice. Macleod<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1049909111427029">27</xref>
</sup> evaluated the use of methylphenidate in 26 hospice patients who had cancer and clinical depression diagnosed with the <italic>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</italic> (Third Edition [<italic>DSM III</italic>]). Methylphenidate was given in 5 to 20 mg daily doses with at least 5 days of treatment. The starting dose was 10 mg, and this was doubled if there was no response after 2 days. Forty-six percent of patients studied showed a significant positive response. The average methylphenidate dose given was 17.7 mg daily. Response in this study was measured using the Clinical Global Impression scale (clinician rated tool to assess response).<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1049909111427029">27</xref>

<p>Bruera<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1049909111427029">29</xref>
</sup> evaluated the effect of methylphenidate on neurocognitive function in 20 patients receiving parenteral opioids in a placebo-controlled crossover study. After a baseline assessment, patients were randomized to receive immediate-release methylphenidate at a dose of 10 mg with breakfast and 5 mg at noon or placebo for 2 consecutive days. On day 3, there was a crossover to the alternative therapy for 2 more days. Neurocognitive function was assessed by finger tapping, simple arithmetic tests, and tests of verbal and visual memory. At the end of the trial, patients and investigators were asked to give their opinion on the most effective therapy. Compared with placebo, there were statistically significant improvements in drowsiness (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .001), confusion (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .05), tapping speed at 10 and 30 seconds (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .001) simple arithmetic (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .001), reverse digit memory (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .001), and visual memory (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .001).Both patients and investigators favored methylphenidate in 13 of 20 cases (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .01). The same investigators<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1049909111427029">30</xref>
</sup> evaluated the ability of methylphenidate to potentiate the analgesic effect of opioids and/or to decrease sedation associated with opioid use. Comparing methylphenidate (10 mg with breakfast and 5 mg with lunch) for 3 days versus placebo for 3 days, 32 patients were studied with respect to pain intensity, need for breakthrough dosing, and sedation. Patients receiving methylphenidate had less pain and less need for extra analgesic dosing (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .02 and &lt;.002, respectively). Sedation was experienced with less intensity in the methylphenidate arm (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .02) and was preferred to placebo by both investigators and patients. The same group of investigators evaluated methylphenidate to counteract opioid-related, sedation-involved patients receiving opioids for incident pain. This trial was open-labeled and not controlled and consisted of 15 patients.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1049909111427029">31</xref>
</sup> The dose of methylphenidate for the study was 10 mg at 8 <sc>am</sc> and 15 mg at noon. Opioid dose was escalated by 30% after the methylphenidate was started and continued to escalate 20% per day until the maximum tolerated dose was reached. In 14 patients, pain and sedation was less, and the amount of total daily morphine was increased within 48 hours (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .01; <italic>P</italic> &lt; .01). Patients reported feeling better on the methylphenidate versus the way they felt on placebo (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .05). Subsequent work again confirmed that methylphenidate can counteract the sedation associated with opioid use.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1049909111427029">32</xref>
</sup> Wilwerding evaluated the effect of methylphenidate on sedation in patients receiving at least 80 mg morphine equivalents per day. Patients were not required to have sedation to enter the study.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1049909111427029">33</xref></sup>Patients who were eligible for the study (N = 43) received either placebo or methylphenidate 10 mg at breakfast and 5 mg at lunch and then were crossed over to the alternative therapy. Patients over 70 years of age had their methylphenidate dose reduced to 5 mg before breakfast and lunch. Sedation was measured with visual analog scale (VAS) and patient preferences were also measured. The study did show a reduction in sedation but carryover effects and a large number of dropouts (not toxicity related) complicated the interpretation of the results.</p>

<title>Methylphenidate to Improve Cognition: Brain Tumors</title>
<p>Cognitive dysfunction is a common symptom burden to patients with brain tumors. There is evidence that methylphenidate can ameliorate aspects of the cognitive decline associated with brain tumors. Based on preliminary evidence<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1049909111427029">34</xref>
</sup> to support amelioration of cognitive dysfunction, a study of 30 patients with gliomas who were receiving radiation therapy demonstrated that methylphenidate could improve cognition.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1049909111427029">35</xref>
</sup> The optimal dose appeared to be 10 mg orally twice daily. Clinical improvements included improved gait, stamina, motivation, and possibly bladder control. Adverse effects, which consisted of shakiness and irritability, resolved with the discontinuation of the methylphenidate. Seizure threshold was not lowered with the use of methylphenidate, and the maximum dose was 30 mg/d.</p>

The extent of cognitive dysfunction was evaluated at baseline by psychomotor methods such as button pushing, visual recognition testing, and the combination thereof. Patients were then randomized to 1 arm, and after a 3-day washout period, received the alternative regimen. Neurocognitive testing was done 1 hour after the study intervention was done. Improvements were most apparent in the patients with a greater degree of psychomotor slowing initially and then used methylphenidate.

Patients who entered the study had fatigue severity ratings of at least 4 (0-10 severity scale). There was a requirement for hemoglobin of at least 10. Patients received either methylphenidate 5 mg every 2 hours as needed (maximum of 4 doses daily) or placebo at the same schedule of administration. Patients were called daily to monitor for adverse effects and to ensure that their fatigue diary was being completed. The duration of the study was 7 days. Patients were subsequently offered methylphenidate for an additional 4 weeks if they so chose. The primary end point was the FACIT-F subscore on day 8. A total of 112 patients were randomized, with 52 in the methylphenidate arm and 53 in the placebo arm (7 dropouts). Fatigue intensity improved significantly on day 8 in both the methylphenidate and placebo groups. There were no differences in fatigue scores between the study groups when measured by either the FACIT-F (<italic>P</italic> = .31) or the ESAS (<italic>P</italic> = .14).

<p>Dexmethylphenidate (<sc>d</sc>-isomer of methylphenidate) was evaluated for the management of cognitive impairment and fatigue associated with chemotherapy in a placebo-controlled trial. The primary outcome was change in fatigue over an 8-week period. Fatigue was measured by the FACIT-F. The study population consisted of 154 patients (majority with breast and ovarian cancer). The study found that dexmethylphenidate was superior to placebo for the management of fatigue at week 8 (<italic>P</italic> = .02). Patients did not experience improvement in cognitive function. Both arms of the study experienced adverse effects such as headache, but there was more nausea in the dexmethylphenidate arm, and more diarrhea and insomnia in the placebo arm. A recent study with long-acting methylphenidate and cancer-related fatigue found no benefit.<sup>

<p>Breitbart and colleagues<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1049909111427029">42</xref>
</sup> evaluated methylphenidate, pemoline, and placebo for the management of fatigue in patients with HIV infection. One hundred and forty-four patients were randomized to methylphenidate hydrochloride, 7.5 mg (1 capsule) twice daily; pemoline, 18.75 mg (1 capsule) twice daily; or placebo (1 capsule) twice daily, as their initial starting dose. The maximum doses allowed for each drug in the study was 60 mg/d for methylphenidate hydrochloride, 150 mg/d for pemoline, and 8 capsules per day for the placebo. At baseline, several assessments of mental and physical fatigue were employed, such as the digit symbol subtest from the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale–Revised, the Trail-Making Test, the Grooved Pegboard Test, and the Finger Tapping Test. The 2 tools used to measure fatigue were the Piper Fatigue scale (PFS) and the Visual Analog scale for Fatigue Severity (VAS-F). A measure of muscular endurance was also included in the study and consisted of timed isometric unilateral straight-leg lifting. Changes in the PFS were the primary end point. The investigators also evaluated other data such as performance status, depression via the Beck Depression Inventory, overall symptoms via the Brief Symptom Inventory, and overall health status survey via 36-Item Short-Form Medical Outcome Study Health Status Survey. Patients were seen weekly for 6 weeks and had access to a research nurse for problems between visits. Adverse effects were also assessed during the weekly appointments using the Systematic Assessment for Treatment Emergent Events tool. Abnormal movements were evaluated with the Extrapyramidal Side Effects Rating scale, weight was measured weekly, and compliance was assessed by pill counting. Patients were removed from the study if there was need for hospitalization due to HIV complications or intolerable adverse effects from the study drugs. The total study duration was 6 weeks. There were 53 patients in the methylphenidate group, 45 in the pemoline group, and 46 in the placebo group. Forty-one percent of the methylphenidate, 36% of the pemoline, and only 6% of placebo patients experienced significant improvement. The study demonstrated that pemoline and methylphenidate were equally effective in reducing fatigue by at least 5 points on the PFS and were able to more rapidly improve fatigue than placebo. In addition, the improvements were unrelated to the extent of disease, severity of depressive symptom, or use of antidepressant medications. The average dosing of methylphenidate was 51 mg/d with over half of the patients taking this dose. There were fewer patients in the pemoline group. The most common adverse effects were jitteriness and hyperactivity, with nearly half of both the methylphenidate group and the pemoline group experiencing this symptom. This shows a greater proportion than with the placebo. Most of these symptoms resolved without dose adjustment. There were no extrapyramidal effects or differences in weight between the 3 study arms. There was a correlation between improvement in fatigue and quality of life and improvement in depression and overall distress. On the Medical Outcomes Study Health Status Survey subscales, there was a strong correlation between improvement in fatigue and role functioning subscale, suggesting a positive impact on physical activity.</p>

Patients included in the study were living in a “community-living” arrangement and had executive function impairment manifested as memory problems. Twenty-six patients were randomized to a single dose of 20 mg of methylphenidate or placebo in sessions of 1 to 2 weeks apart. Patient gait was assessed by the Timed Up and Go test, which assesses functional mobility and fall risk. Executive function was measured by computerized neuropsychological methods such as the Go-No-Go test (measure of attention), and other tests of nonverbal memory. The results showed that a single dose of methylphenidate but not placebo improved the Timed Up and Go times and measures of executive function, with the exception of memory or finger tapping.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>The psychostimulants, by nature of their alerting properties, have been investigated in palliative medicine for the management of opioid-related sedation, fatigue, depression, as more recently, improvement in cognitive function for patients with brain tumors. Methylphenidate is the most commonly used psychostimulant in palliative medicine. Methylphenidate interacts with neuronal plasma membrane neurotransmitter transporters by interfering with the uptake of dopamine, norepinephrine, and to a lesser extent serotonin. This is postulated to lead to increased levels of neurotransmitters which in turn lead to increased level of alertness. This effect has the potential for benefit in relieving many symptoms encountered in palliative medicine. Methylphenidate has found a role in palliative care for the management of depression associated with cancer as an “augmentation therapy,” as an agent to counteract sedation associated with opioid use and as a means of improving cognition in cancer and neurodegenerative diseases. The response in patients with depression can be quick, often within a few days. The use of methylphenidate to counteract the sedation associated with opioid use allows easier dose escalation. In patients with CNS malignancies, methylphenidate can improve cognitive function, gait, stamina, and motivation to perform activities. Methylphenidate has improved “executive” aspects of cognitive function in patients with HIV and improves cognition in patients with multiple sclerosis. Fatigue is a common use for psychostimulants and methylphenidate appears to be beneficial in patients with neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson disease and HIV. Unfortunately in cancer, a rigorously performed placebo-controlled trial found no advantage of methylphenidate over placebo in the treatment of fatigue. Methylphenidate has been evaluated in the management of hypoactive delirium and has been known to improve mood in poststroke depression. There is also evidence in preclinical models of an analgesic effect when methylphenidate is added to opioid therapy, but this has not yet been proven in human studies. The demonstrated impact of methylphenidate on “executive function” necessitates further research in areas where cognitive impairment is common, such as in cognitive dysfunction associated with chemotherapy.</p>
