<abstract>
<p>Older people living alone (OPLA) are considered vulnerable because of fewer resources, such as social support. As self-management becomes increasingly important in chronic care, evidence is needed on how to better support OPLA. This review synthesizes the evidence from 32 publications on the challenges as well as strategies of OPLA in managing chronic conditions. On the basis of a systematic database search and review process, being independent and being at home were identified as crucial when living alone in later life; both involve decision making and the adjustment of routines to manage everyday life and chronic conditions. These findings show that OPLA are vulnerable because of difficult living situations, limited resources, or a lack of support, and they actively manage their conditions using various strategies to remain independent, but these may cause fragile arrangements that can jeopardize independence. Awareness of these strategies is a starting point to develop interventions for self-management support in chronic illness.</p>

<body>
<p>Chronic illness self-management is considered a key element in chronic care and in health policy and practice. Interest has grown to control chronic conditions by empowering individuals to better manage challenges imposed by long-lasting illness and impairments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0164027511429808">Adams, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-0164027511429808">Wagner et al., 2001</xref>). Chronic illness self-management is what individuals and their families do; it includes a broad set of attitudes, behaviors, and skills they carry out in everyday life to control an illness, to minimize its impact on health and functioning, manage the health care system, and cope with the psychosocial consequences of living with chronic conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0164027511429808">Gallant, Spitze, &amp; Prohaska, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0164027511429808">Grey, Knafl, &amp; McCorkle, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-0164027511429808">Strauss &amp; Glaser, 1975</xref>).</p>
<p>Diverse self-management interventions have been developed and implemented in various settings. Self-management programs focus on individuals with particular diseases, for example, arthritis, diabetes, asthma, or HIV/AIDS; also, generic lay-led self-management approaches exist, which have been adapted for culturally diverse populations in different countries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0164027511429808">de Silva, 2011</xref>). Along with the trend of promoting self-management support, there is concern whether it addresses those most in need and embraces the challenges of vulnerable populations, meaning those most at risk for poor physical, psychological, or social health outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0164027511429808">Aday, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0164027511429808">Schröder-Butterfill &amp; Marianti, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>A particularly vulnerable and growing group in health care are older people living alone (OPLA). Living alone, meaning living in a nonfamily household by oneself, is a main demographic trend in Western societies, and this group has increased dramatically in industrialized countries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-0164027511429808">United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-0164027511429808">U.S. Census Bureau, 2007</xref>; ). OPLA are considered vulnerable for various reasons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0164027511429808">Larkin, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0164027511429808">Shi &amp; Stevens, 2005</xref>). They tend to have less social support, higher poverty rates, and greater challenges in everyday life, such as mobility issues, security risks, and housing problems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0164027511429808">Age Concern, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0164027511429808">Collins &amp; Paul, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0164027511429808">Davis, Grant, &amp; Rowland, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0164027511429808">Fisher, Baker, Koval, Lishok, &amp; Maisto, 2007</xref>). OPLA also experience complex health needs, such as higher rates of psychological distress or risks for developing certain chronic conditions because of lifestyle factors (smoking, alcohol, or dietary habits), which have an impact on their health services use (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0164027511429808">Burnette &amp; Mui, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0164027511429808">Guzman, Sohn, &amp; Harada, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0164027511429808">Lidfeldt, Nerbrand, Samsioe, &amp; Agardh, 2005</xref>). Living alone is also considered a risk factor for poorer health outcomes after hospital discharge and higher readmission rates or nursing home admissions after hospitalization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0164027511429808">Murphy et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0164027511429808">Schmaltz et al., 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>Given the rapid growth of the aging population and the rising number of OPLA, an in-depth understanding of their needs and challenges helps offer adequate self-management support. Therefore, this article’s objective is to describe the needs and challenges of OPLA, as well as strategies in chronic illness self-management when living alone in later life, on the basis of a review of systematically identified literature on the perspectives of OPLA.</p>
<sec id="section1-0164027511429808" sec-type="methods">
<title>Methods</title>
<p>A systematic integrative review was conducted incorporating multiple perspectives and types of literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0164027511429808">Conn et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-0164027511429808">Whittemore &amp; Knafl, 2005</xref>). A comprehensive database search covering publications from 1965 to December 2008 (updated February 2011) was combined with an extensive hand search (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0164027511429808">Figure 1</xref>). A two-stage search strategy was used for the health care–related databases. In a preliminary limited search (Stage 1) basic search terms were generated to develop database specific search concepts. Age and methodological aspects were used as primary search concepts to identify potentially relevant studies along with Medical Subject Headings and keyword search terms. In Stage 2, a full database search was conducted in MEDLINE, CINAHL, PsycINFO, and GeroLIT using database-specific search concepts. In the first search, priority was given to search sets on (a) “living alone” combined with (b) “self-care/self-management,” (c) “perspective of elderly people,” and (d) “chronic illness.” This combination produced few potentially useful articles, so priority was then given to the first search set (“living alone”) combined with disease-specific search sets on cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, arthritis, and depression, as well as an additional set on “aging” (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0164027511429808">Table 1</xref>).</p>

<p>The search sets also guided the hand search and reference mining, which consisted of the following parts: checking reference lists of most promising articles (via Scopus and the ISI Web of Science); manually searching annual issues of selected journals on health, aging, and chronic illness (3,903 abstracts with a minor output of 6 potentially relevant records); and searching Scopus for publications with qualitative research designs (updated February 2011). E-mail alerts and RSS feeds were used for an ongoing tracking of records published in key journals.</p>
<p>After screening the records, a total number of 173 references were assessed for eligibility with a priori defined inclusion and exclusion criteria (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0164027511429808">Table 2</xref>). In selected promising cases, first authors were contacted for missing information.</p>

<p>To achieve rigor in the review process, different quality assessment instruments were used for each type of research design. Qualitative studies were evaluated with a focus, for example, on the clarity of objectives, audit trails in the data analysis, or adequate use of quotations following the recommendations of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0164027511429808">Evans (2007)</xref>. For quantitative studies, a generic quality index score adapted from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0164027511429808">Beck (1995)</xref> was used. It included the following nine criteria: first author’s expertise, funding, sampling, sample size, research design, instrument reliability and validity, data collection, data analysis, and confounding variables. The scoring for each criterion ranged from 1 to 3, except for funding (0 or 1), instrument reliability and validity (0 to 3), data analysis (1 to 4), and design (1 or 2). The total possible score was 23 points. The first author evaluated records for quality, and they were excluded if they scored less than 10 points. In total, 32 publications were included with research findings from various disciplines (key characteristics are listed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0164027511429808">Table 3</xref>, and a summary of studies appears in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0164027511429808">Table 4</xref>).</p>

<title>Challenges in <italic>Chronic Illness</italic> Self-Management When Living Alone in Later Life</title>
<p>According to included studies, OPLA may differ in various ways and appear to be a heterogeneous group, yet there are similarities and common themes in terms of how they experience and manage everyday life and chronic conditions (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0164027511429808">Figure 2</xref>). When living alone in later life, chronic illness becomes integral in everyday life and is regarded as a common aspect of life (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0164027511429808">Rubinstein, Kilbride, &amp; Nagy, 1992</xref>). Its recognition may be practically subliminal; illness may be a phenomenon that is usually an undercurrent in everyday life, and its premature fatal outcomes may crystallize only in crisis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0164027511429808">Burnette, 1994</xref>).</p>

<title>Being Independent: Paramount but Difficult</title>
<p>Being independent and maintaining independence is the key challenge of OPLA with chronic conditions (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0164027511429808">Aoun, Kristjanson, Oldham, &amp; Currow, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0164027511429808">Rubinstein et al., 1992</xref>). Most studies emphasized their participants’ desire for independence as paramount, no matter the stage of functional and/or cognitive limitations (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0164027511429808">Schank &amp; Lough, 1990</xref>). Independence stands for the ability to live alone and to make one’s own choices; it is regarded as one of the most enjoyable aspects of living alone, and some older persons are often proud that they are still able to live alone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0164027511429808">Eshbaugh, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0164027511429808">Harris, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>Various aspects contribute to the key role of independence while living alone in later life. Independence is embedded in the meaning of an individual’s life and work history; it can mean being financially secure, being liberated from previous obligations and gender roles, as well as having more personal freedom (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0164027511429808">Petry, 2003</xref>). Independence is linked to the meaning of home, as it signifies independence (see the next paragraph), and mobility (e.g., to drive or to walk) is crucial to live independently (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0164027511429808">Harris, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0164027511429808">Hinck, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>Yet being independent is a continuous struggle when living alone in later life, and to lose one’s independence by ill health is most feared (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0164027511429808">Haak, Fänge, Iwarsson, &amp; Dahlin-Ivanoff, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0164027511429808">Rubinstein et al., 1992</xref>). OPLA are facing “hardships of solo navigation” in chronic illness self-management (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0164027511429808">Burnette, 1994</xref>, p. 11) and have to cope with losses, anguish, or confusion during the life course affecting their health (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0164027511429808">Haak, Ivanoff, Fänge, Sixsmith, &amp; Iwarsson, 2007</xref>). Along with functional and cognitive decline, this leads to role changes for OPLA in later life, summarized as a transition from an actor to a spectator: Formerly active persons gradually transition into more passive, less demanding activities.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0164027511429808">
<title>Being Home: A Central but Ambiguous Place</title>
<p>Home is central for OPLA, but its status is also ambiguous (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0164027511429808">Dahlin-Ivanoff, Haak, Fänge, &amp; Iwarsson, 2007</xref>). It is perceived as a symbol to remaining independent, but it is always threatened by age-related functional decline. During the aging process, home becomes increasingly important, and OPLA want to stay at home as long as possible because of their social networks and affiliations to home (i.e., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0164027511429808">Harris, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>Home has many functions. It means privacy and freedom, as well as autonomy, and it is a symbol of being a person. It retains a connection to the community but is also the place where people can truly be themselves, and for OPLA, it is linked to autonomy as part of their emotional selves (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0164027511429808">Aoun et al., 2008</xref>). Home not only means structure and consistency but also security and safety, as OPLA experience comfort in the places with which they are familiar. It enables access to things needed the most as well as to support or care, and it is the locus of participation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0164027511429808">Haak, Fänge, et al., 2007</xref>). Home allows OPLA to remain connected to a meaningful past or to feel togetherness with others, and it functions as an antidote for loneliness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0164027511429808">Dahlin-Ivanoff et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0164027511429808">Hinck, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>Yet the world at home has its challenges. Functional and cognitive decline jeopardizes freedom, autonomy, and privacy if the necessity to move to institutionalized care becomes apparent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0164027511429808">Dahlin-Ivanoff et al., 2007</xref>). Home can limit choices and become a place where it is no longer safe to stay because of various reasons (e.g., rural or isolated areas with limited access to support and care, inability to care for one’s home, or impoverished communities with structural issues). All of these factors can raise concerns as to whether one’s home is still the right place for human habitation (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0164027511429808">Porter, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0164027511429808">Roberts &amp; Cleveland, 2001</xref>). Severe emotional challenges such as feelings of loneliness and isolation are also frequently reported. The inability to leave home is considered a cause for depression, and subsequently, home may appear as a prison (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0164027511429808">Burnette, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0164027511429808">Rubinstein et al., 1992</xref>). Consequently, living alone can be experienced as if there is no way out of this situation, which is perceived as one of the most negative experiences of living alone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0164027511429808">Black, White, &amp; Hannum, 2007</xref>). In either way, home is best described as the “hub of existence” for OPLA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0164027511429808">Dahlin-Ivanoff et al., 2007</xref>, p. 28).</p>

<title>Health, Illness, and Impairments: Gradually Eroding the Ability to Care for Oneself</title>
<p>Health and challenges in functional and cognitive decline are crucial when living alone in later life (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0164027511429808">Schank &amp; Lough, 1990</xref>). Maintaining health is paramount for OPLA, as they must confront health problems without immediately available help. No one may be at hand to assist with tasks in day-to-day chronic illness management, such as reminding one to take medication, administering eye drops, talking to health care providers, and so on (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0164027511429808">Rubinstein et al., 1992</xref>). Progressive functional and cognitive aging gradually erodes one’s ability to carry out activities and to self-manage illness; OPLA may experience this as it slowly usurps daily life and leads to a loss of control (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0164027511429808">Jett, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0164027511429808">Nygard &amp; Starkhammar, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>OPLA may view illness and increasing impairments as normal in old age while still being positive about their health. Some do not deny their declining health; they expect pain or fatigue and have a realistic appraisal of their needs, even among those with mild dementia (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0164027511429808">Burnette, 1994</xref>). Yet, some OPLA are unaware of their needs and problems related to both declining health and living arrangements because of memory loss or denial (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0164027511429808">Harris, 2006</xref>). It may also be of importance in terms of when a person has a chronic condition and how successfully it is managed; if it is part of one’s identity at an early age because of successful adaptation, small changes in health may be less threatening than for someone who has not experienced health problems until later life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0164027511429808">Rubinstein et al., 1992</xref>).</p>
<p>Declining health challenges everyday life and may cause severe emotional experiences, such as worrying about the risk for falling or being hindered from doing things (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0164027511429808">Aday, Kehoe, &amp; Farney, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0164027511429808">Aoun et al., 2008</xref>). Fears exist that declining health may slow them down and jeopardize their active lives as it diminishes personal strength as well as out-of-home activities and thus is related to sadness and suffering (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0164027511429808">Black et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0164027511429808">Nygard &amp; Starkhammar, 2003</xref>). An acute crisis in a chronic illness trajectory is most challenging for OPLA, as it brings their vulnerability to a sharp focus and may compromise their independence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0164027511429808">Burnette, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0164027511429808">Rubinstein et al., 1992</xref>).</p>

<title>(Self-)Managing and Decision Making: Being in Control and Dealing With Uncertainty</title>
<p>For OPLA, it is crucial to both feel and be competent in managing everyday life as well as chronic conditions. Living on their own and making their own decisions were found to be of overriding importance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0164027511429808">Brown &amp; May, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0164027511429808">Petry, 2003</xref>). If daily life is managed actively and meaningfully, this may represent mastery and control (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0164027511429808">Haak, Fänge, et al., 2007</xref>). OPLA wish to be an integral part of decision making about their living arrangements or care, and they may regard themselves as the central actors in managing their conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0164027511429808">Ahn &amp; Kim, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0164027511429808">Harris, 2006</xref>). Some still feel competent with household chores or personal care in later phases of functional decline (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0164027511429808">Gilmour, Gibson, &amp; Campbell, 2003</xref>), and especially the most vulnerable elders want to have the freedom of choice, which is synonymous with maintaining independence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0164027511429808">Rubinstein et al., 1992</xref>).</p>
<p>When a person becomes fragile, it interferes with self-management as well as decision making, and dealing with uncertainty and even frustration become common challenges when living alone in later life (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0164027511429808">Gilmour et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0164027511429808">Shih &amp; Shih, 1999</xref>).

<title>Formal Services: (Un)Met Needs, Barriers, and Threats to Independence</title>
<p>In later life, OPLA have an increased need for formal support. Home help as well as community nursing services are widely used, and institutionalized care is considered when people’s conditions change (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0164027511429808">Aoun et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0164027511429808">Huang &amp; Lin, 2002</xref>). Again, staying at home as long as possible is imperative, and the help of others is perceived positively as long as OPLA feel in charge and have the ability to make decisions to remain independent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0164027511429808">Haak, Fänge, et al., 2007</xref>). From the perspective of OPLA, there are various challenges, especially access to care: scarce assets but high cost (e.g., for medication), long distances to services, necessary but missing assistive technology for independent living, and so forth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0164027511429808">Brown &amp; May, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0164027511429808">Burnette, 1994</xref>). They also experience inadequate care and difficulties in interpersonal communication with health professionals, who may devalue or ignore problems. This causes feelings of anger, frustration, or distrust toward service providers and results in an inability to fully use services (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0164027511429808">Porter, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0164027511429808">Shih &amp; Shih, 1999</xref>).</p>
<p>Health literacy is also crucial for OPLA. Poor understanding of illness and care protocols challenges their self-management, and culminating events can lead to injudicious decisions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0164027511429808">Gilmour et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0164027511429808">Shih, Gau, Lo, &amp; Shih, 2005</xref>). It can be precluded by complications of health and function or the complexity of health information, which are difficult to interpret and can be a barrier to certain benefits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0164027511429808">Rubinstein et al., 1992</xref>). This may cause feelings of powerlessness because of a lack of adequate information or a limited understanding of the potential as well as the limits of services (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0164027511429808">Haak, Fänge, et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0164027511429808">Shih &amp; Shih, 1999</xref>).</p>
<p>An underestimated challenge in using formal care is its threat to OPLA’s independence, self-management, and decision making. At home, service providers may be viewed as “intruders” to the person living alone because other people are in control and may decide how and when to perform activities (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0164027511429808">Porter, 2005</xref>). Formal services may change daily routines, be in opposition to one’s cultural values, decrease one’s freedom and spontaneity, affect one’s privacy and security, and involve various professionals, leading to uncertainty about their current and future status (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0164027511429808">Essen, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0164027511429808">Gilmour et al., 2003</xref>).

<title>Social Support: Needed Yet Reluctantly Tolerated</title>
<p>Social support is crucial for chronic illness self-management, especially when living alone in later life.

<p>OPLA also experience challenges in terms of social support.

<title>Strategies of OPLA in <italic>Chronic Illness</italic> Self-Management</title>
<p>Even though OPLA are considered vulnerable and face various challenges in everyday life with chronic illness, included are studies that emphasize their active roles and engagement. Although some manage well and others struggle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0164027511429808">Harris, 2006</xref>), their illness is essentially self-managed although often not optimally (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0164027511429808">Burnette, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0164027511429808">Rubinstein et al., 1992</xref>). This section addresses strategies of OPLA in chronic illness self-management. According to their overriding intention to continue living alone at home for as long as possible, it can be summarized as an ongoing adjustment and struggle to remain independent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0164027511429808">Haak, Fänge, et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0164027511429808">Porter, 2005</xref>).</p>

<title>Making One’s Own Decisions and Stretching the Limits</title>
<p>To be able to make one’s own decision about remaining independent may be one of the most important factors from the perspective of OPLA. Especially when OPLA experience gradual functional and cognitive decline with impairments, being in charge of as well as involved with decision making about their lives and their care is vital (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0164027511429808">Harris, 2006</xref>). They are actively weighing their motivation and available resources about whether and how to use support from others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0164027511429808">Burnette, 1994</xref>).</p>
<p>Decision making related to formal support is a prominent theme and characterized by ambiguity. From the perspective of OPLA, it can be either empowering or threatening to their independence, leading to a loss of control. They seek and use formal services on their own terms, demonstrating independence, self-reliance, and resourcefulness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0164027511429808">Brown &amp; May, 2005</xref>). Formal services are used, for instance, to restore health and functioning, for an adequate level of personal care, a safe home, and for companionship (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0164027511429808">Aday et al., 2006</xref>). Yet because formal services may be a potential threat to independence, studies have found that OPLA balance actual and future needs as well as resources, for example, by selectively choosing services (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0164027511429808">Aoun et al., 2008</xref>). Being loyal to trusted services and hesitating in seeking care from new, unknown services is also important (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0164027511429808">Brown &amp; May, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>In terms of decision making, OPLA may also stretch their limits. They may struggle to the utmost limits only not to become dependent and a burden to others, for instance, by delaying formal care, not using it regularly, or even rejecting it until it is severely needed and there is no other option but to use it; in emergencies, they seek help and set aside independence and self-reliance (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0164027511429808">Haak, Fänge, et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0164027511429808">Hinck, 2004</xref>). Informal support may also be rejected because it implies dependency, and they do not want to squander finite resources of social support (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0164027511429808">Gilmour et al., 2003</xref>).</p>

<title>Maintaining Meaningful Activities and Exercise</title>
<p>Aging and illness not only lead to functional and cognitive impairments but also to declining quality performance in activities of daily living and chronic illness management. This includes a shift in daily life from outside the home to at-home services (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0164027511429808">Haak, Ivanoff, et al., 2007</xref>). Yet OPLA express a need to manage their activities meaningfully and to construct as well as keep up a daily schedule; it is a strategy to stay healthy and have a sense of accomplishment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0164027511429808">Hinck, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0164027511429808">Rubinstein et al., 1992</xref>). Being active is considered imperative to remain independent and to self-manage; it includes managing household chores, reading, listening to music, walking for exercise, eating a balanced diet, and so on (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0164027511429808">Jett, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0164027511429808">Letvak, 1997</xref>).

<sec id="section13-0164027511429808">
<title>Creating a New Rhythm by Gradual Adjustments and Adaptations</title>
<p>Because of aging and illness, OPLA must constantly adjust to health changes, which may call for a new rhythm in life and gradually adaptations routines to accommodate impairments and forestalling frailty (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0164027511429808">Rubinstein et al., 1992</xref>). Often, they construct rigid daily and weekly routines at home and center on essential care around themselves. Patterns of living are modified to accommodate physical discomfort or restricted mobility and to adjust to the transition from an active, outward life to a difficult and involuntary life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0164027511429808">Birkeland &amp; Natvig, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0164027511429808">Hinck, 2004</xref>). For instance, new activities are needed, or existing ones are performed in other ways, which may take more time but be worthwhile because tasks such as preparing a meal or taking care of oneself independently provide meaning.</p>
<p>Adaptations may not always be based on planned strategies. Some challenges of everyday life and chronic illness are not deliberately evaluated, because everyday activities are mainly completed as nonconscious routines and patterns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0164027511429808">Hinck, 2004</xref>). Chronic illness management may be based on learning by “trial and error”; for instance, the potential for injury may be discovered only after repeated falls or injury. OPLA pay attention to their symptoms, learn what is needed over time, and try to actively respond to problems either randomly or with strategies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0164027511429808">Nygard &amp; Starkhammar, 2003</xref>). Again, this appears to be a balancing act for OPLA between managing well at home, becoming fatigued, and declining (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0164027511429808">Hinck, 2004</xref>). Recognizing unsafe activities is a gradual process, and adaptability may face final limits when living at home is no longer safe; then, one must be adaptable enough to realize that the circumstances might call for change (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0164027511429808">Rubinstein et al., 1992</xref>).</p>

<title>Creating and Maintaining a Functional Home</title>
<p>Home becomes a central place in later life. Once access to the larger world is cut off for various reasons, OPLA intensively develop a multifunctional world in their remaining life space (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0164027511429808">Rubinstein et al., 1992</xref>). They adapt their environment according to their needs, and a functional home is a necessity for independence: It facilitates meaningful activities and avoids or at least delays the need for replacement (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0164027511429808">Dahlin-Ivanoff et al., 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>Creating a functional home has various dimensions. Adjusting the physical environment is important (e.g., organizing closets, adjusting toilet seat height, moving furniture, adjusting the lighting; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0164027511429808">Haak, Fänge, et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0164027511429808">Nygard &amp; Starkhammar, 2003</xref>). Technical aids and assistive technology are also used (e.g., having a monitoring system installed or using the telephone); it provides OPLA with a sense of security if emergency assistance is required but also helps OPLA stay in touch with significant others (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0164027511429808">Birkeland &amp; Natvig, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0164027511429808">Letvak, 1997</xref>). Information technology, especially computers, is used as a memory aid to keep track of appointments or to deal with memory loss (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0164027511429808">Harris, 2006</xref>). OPLA devise individual systems to organize their lives and to maintain control. Daily and weekly routines are part of this system, which most commonly includes written notes, color cues, or the use of regular places at home (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0164027511429808">Nygard &amp; Starkhammar, 2003</xref>). For an outside observer, the multifunctionality of rooms can seem chaotic; the need to have things immediately accessible for daily activities and chronic illness management can make rooms multiplex, crowded, or even messy. Yet it obeys a new logic of ordering dictated by health needs and newly established perceptions of orderliness; the smaller the living space, the greater the potential for an intense involvement in it (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0164027511429808">Rubinstein et al., 1992</xref>).</p>
<p>From the perspective of OPLA, a functional home is constantly in jeopardy and has drawbacks as well. Assistive technologies may be ambiguous, because access to them is limited because of cost, and OPLA experience them as a sign of no longer being able to self-manage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0164027511429808">Aoun et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0164027511429808">Dahlin-Ivanoff et al., 2007</xref>). In particular, monitoring systems may be regarded as constraining and a violation of privacy. OPLA may resist them for as long as possible and continue to perform activities they would have otherwise discontinued or transferred to others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0164027511429808">Essen, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0164027511429808">Haak, Fänge, et al., 2007</xref>).</p>

<title>Using Social Support for Sharing, Compensating, Comparing, and Substituting</title>
<p>Social networks are crucial for independence and for chronic illness self-management (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0164027511429808">Nygard &amp; Starkhammar, 2003</xref>). They provide a range of services, which help OPLA substitute or compensate for activities that can no longer be performed independently: food-related tasks, household chores, transportation, medication management, handling financials, socialization, or even emotional support (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0164027511429808">McDonald, Quandt, Arcury, Bell, &amp; Vitolins, 2000</xref>). Even if OPLA become homebound, they can remain connected by bringing people into their homes and not allowing physical impairments or advancing age to limit them socially (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0164027511429808">Haak, Ivanoff, et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0164027511429808">Letvak, 1997</xref>).</p>
<p>Social networks are also used in chronic illness self-management to share experiences and to compare with others. Talking to others may be helpful to share problems with someone, to relieve emotional pressure, and to alleviate depression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0164027511429808">Black et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0164027511429808">Dahlin-Ivanoff et al., 2007</xref>). It is an opportunity for OPLA to compare themselves and their situations with others and, if applicable, to realize that others are worse off (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0164027511429808">Jett, 2003</xref>). By sharing experiences, one also gets advice and inspiration through insights into other peoples’ perspectives, which can then be used for planning and seeking formal service use (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0164027511429808">Brown &amp; May, 2005</xref>). Social networks are also important to mean something to someone; visiting others is seen as beneficial and is, if possible, an opportunity to leave home and create the feeling of being active (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0164027511429808">Burnette, 1994</xref>).</p>
<p>Yet using social support has its limits because its sustainability is dynamic. Although some studies found that OPLA were speaking to friends and relatives up to four times a week (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0164027511429808">Burnette, 1994</xref>) others identified extremely isolated individuals with hardly any sustainable social support (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0164027511429808">Rubinstein et al., 1992</xref>). Social networks may diminish in later life because of geographical distance to significant others (e.g. children living abroad, friends dying; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0164027511429808">Haak, Ivanoff, et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0164027511429808">Letvak, 1997</xref>).</p>

<title>Withdrawing and Preferring Solitude</title>
<p>Along with the previously mentioned self-management strategies comes the question of how to deal with the challenge of an altered ethos of choice when living alone in later life. A prominent strategy of OPLA is to develop a culture of living alone: they withdraw from social life and prefer solitude to assert their independence and to continue to make their own decisions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0164027511429808">Rubinstein et al., 1992</xref>). It means being free to choose within the constraints of a diminished world and to be out of reach of other people’s demands; it helps maintain privacy, to escape being observed and intruded by others, as well as to keep one’s own choices when functional decline affects independence at home (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0164027511429808">Essen, 2008</xref>). Withdrawal is also used to deal with pain, stigma, side effects of medications, or the fear of being pitied (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0164027511429808">Black et al., 2007</xref>).

The debate around this topic easily centers on OPLA being vulnerable, as old age is often associated with loneliness, isolation, and frailty (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0164027511429808">Campion, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0164027511429808">Shi &amp; Stevens, 2005</xref>). There clearly is a gender-specific focus on women’s challenges of living alone with chronic conditions, and the situation of elderly men appears to be hardly investigated. Overall, the literature outlines an active role of OPLA in managing everyday life and chronic illness. Their motivation is based primarily on a wish to remain independent and to be at home for as long as possible, which becomes central in later life when living alone; they value positive aspects of living alone, especially being able to make their own decisions, and they use problem solving to adapt to life changes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0164027511429808">Breheny &amp; Stephens, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0164027511429808">Mack, Salmoni, Viverais-Dressler, Porter, &amp; Garg, 1997</xref>).</p>
<p>The active role of OPLA corresponds with the general interest in user involvement in health policy and practice, which is condensed in the call for self-management support in chronic care (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0164027511429808">Adams, Greiner, &amp; Corrigan, 2004</xref>). In chronic illness research, the key role of patients in health care as the central actor on stage has long been identified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-0164027511429808">Strauss, 1990</xref>). Yet this correspondence with the active engagement of OPLA outlined in this review must be handled carefully: Their role gradually changes from actor to spectator because of aging and declining functional capabilities, and there are risks inherent in their self-management strategies such as stretching the limits or withdrawing from social life. They make themselves invisible (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0164027511429808">Seale, Addington-Hall, &amp; McCarthy, 1997</xref>) and this may shape social isolation among OPLA. It can be both an active as well as passive process; they withdraw from social life but are also forced into isolation because of changes in health, environment, or declining social networks. It may also explain why OPLA rarely seek help for themselves. The accepting as well as receiving of formal and informal support in old age must be considered carefully (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-0164027511429808">Webber, Fox, &amp; Burnette, 1994</xref>). The active component in becoming a hidden population should wave red flags in health and social care. The challenges of OPLA crystallize in crises, with sometimes fatal outcomes; unexpected situations such as accidents or critical events reveal the before hidden vulnerability of OPLA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0164027511429808">Klinenberg, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-0164027511429808">Sörensen &amp; Pinquart, 2000</xref>). Poor strategies in everyday life and chronic illness self-management often only become visible in moments of complexity and crisis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0164027511429808">Gallagher, Marshall, Fisher, &amp; Elliott, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0164027511429808">Haslbeck &amp; Schaeffer, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>The meaningful activities and creative individual systems OPLA develop to manage everyday life and chronic conditions also seem of importance. Chronic illness self-management appears to be deeply embedded in everyday life, and OPLA use individual self-management strategies closely related to how they live their lives and tackle the challenges and problems related to it. This active engagement in managing everyday life and chronic illness was identified in various studies and may be related to a general positive attitude toward living alone in later life among individuals by being creative in problem solving despite reduced independence and physical limitations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0164027511429808">Callen &amp; Wells, 2003</xref>). In these individual systems, social networks play an important role (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0164027511429808">Gallant et al., 2007</xref>). Even though social support appears to be more and more limited in later life, OPLA may manage a surprisingly complex process of attaining and maintaining the support they need to deal with chronic conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0164027511429808">Gallagher et al., 2008</xref>). Yet, again, these arrangements may be temporary as their situations make them vulnerable to rapid change, and their health must always be interpreted in relation to this (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0164027511429808">Fänge &amp; Dahlin-Ivanoff, 2009</xref>).</p>
<sec id="section18-0164027511429808">
<title>Review Method and Limitations</title>
<p>The systematic integrative review approach has proven to be useful in identifying important themes on living alone in later life with chronic conditions. The findings can be used as a means of giving individuals such as OPLA a voice by documenting their experiences, preferences, and priorities captured by the growing evidence base from research in health care (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0164027511429808">Britten, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0164027511429808">Evans, 2007</xref>). Key topics in recently published studies, such as the struggle to remain independent, support findings that were reported 30 years ago (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0164027511429808">Rubinstein, 1986</xref>). Because traditional systematic reviews tend to focus primarily on findings from indexed database searches, the integrative approach is a useful way to also include such important evidence that would be otherwise left aside.</p>
<p>The review findings must be considered with care because of challenges and limitations in the review process. Existing evidence is spread across disciplines, including a “Babylonian-like” mix of terms related to living alone in later life, which may explain why literature on the subject under investigation and especially qualitative research appears to be poorly indexed in databases (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0164027511429808">Evans, 2002</xref>). It explains the time-consuming search and evaluation process, as various relevant articles were located via reference mining and snowballing and not identified in the database search. Even though a team approach in evaluating the search findings and data extraction would have been preferable, the search was not performed in duplicate, and most records were evaluated and respectively analyzed by the first author because of the large number of potentially relevant references as well as limited resources and time.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>The urge of OPLA for independence and to remain at home as long as possible matches trends in health policy and practice to provide support and care at home. Self-management support can enhance services to help OPLA maintain their autonomy in everyday life and to slow down the trajectory toward becoming dependent on others. It also highlights a well-known topic: the need to shift the focus, organization, and resource flow in health care toward the home, where the majority of work in chronic illness management is done (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-0164027511429808">Strauss, 1990</xref>), and this is where self-management support in chronic illness should happen in the first place. A “one-size-fits-all” strategy in self-management support therefore may not be beneficial for OPLA (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0164027511429808">de Silva, 2011</xref>). Our review findings support the call for tailoring self- management interventions to individual demands of people (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0164027511429808">Lawn &amp; Schoo, 2010</xref>). Self-management support should primarily be targeted toward the home and be flexible so that it can adjust to the needs of an individual or a community.</p>
<p>It may be difficult to identify evidence on the subject matter because of heterogeneous study populations; thus, it is challenging to translate research-based recommendations in health policy and practice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0164027511429808">Bayliss et al., 2007</xref>). However, future research activities should embrace a synthesizing approach in terms of existing literature. It is also important to focus on carving out the needs and challenges of particular groups, such as older men living alone, given that almost three decades ago, they were declared a minority among older people and have been a neglected group both in research and care (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0164027511429808">Rubinstein, 1986</xref>). Finally, for future research, it is important to both understand and further investigate the contributing or even causal factors that influence the self-management strategies of OPLA. For instance, withdrawal and preferring solitude as well as developing a culture of living alone may be related to or even the result of depression. How interventions such as the treatment of depression may have an impact on chronic illness self-management can therefore guide approaches on influencing withdrawal and isolation.</p>
