<abstract>
<p>A novel hydroxyapatite-wollastonite/silk fibroin (AW/SF) composite was prepared for bone repair and replacement by a modified coprecipitation method. The wollastonite powders introduced in the composite were sintered with full crytallinity and ground to the diameter of 30–50 nm. The FT-IR and XRD analyses showed that the silk fibroin, wollastonite, and hydroxyapatite co-existed in the composite, but the newly formed hydroxyapatite had low crystallinity ascribing to the low temperature procedure. The composite exhibited both higher compressive strength (84.4 MPa) and Barcol hardness (48.5) than the hydroxyapatite/silk fibroin (HA/SF) composite without any wallostonite involved. And the composite in this work showed excellent bioactivities while held in simulated body fluid (SBF).</p>

<sec id="sec1-0021998311421040" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title>
<p>When bones in bodies are damaged due to injury or illness sometimes, they can be repaired and replaced by nature bones or biomaterials. However, natural bones can induce infection problems and antigenic reaction.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0021998311421040">1</xref></sup> In the last two decades, biomaterials for bone replacement are becoming increasingly important, so biomaterials for hard tissue repair and replacement have been widely studied. Hydroxyapatite, glass ceramics, and bioglasses are now used clinically as bioactive materials, in powder, granules or bulk form due to their ability to bond to bones.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0021998311421040">2</xref></sup><sup>–</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0021998311421040">4</xref></sup></p>
<p>Natural bone is a complex inorganic–organic composite material in which hydroxyapatite nanocrystals and collagen fibrils are well organized into hierarchical architecture.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0021998311421040">5</xref></sup> And nature bone’s unique composition and structure have presented valuable clues to achieve bone-like artificial materials.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0021998311421040">6</xref></sup> More efforts have been devoted to the composites of hydroxyapatite in conjugation with some bioactivity proteins or polymers, such as chitosan, gelatin, chondroitin sulfate, and silk fibroin.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0021998311421040">7</xref></sup><sup>–</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0021998311421040">9</xref></sup> Among them, replacing collagen with silk fibroin (SF) was studied extensively, and hydroxyapatite/silk fibroin (HA/SF) composite has been synthesized in low temperature successfully with high biological activity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0021998311421040">10</xref></sup> But the mechanical strength of HA/SF composite could not meet the clinical requirements for weight-bearing bones because of its low temperature procedure. The bone cements used nowadays mostly are composites of hydroxyapatite and wollastonite. Such materials that calcined at high temperatures are completely crystalline structures and usually had higher mechanical strength, but the fact that they were weak in the prospects of degradation and bioactivities as biomaterials should not be neglected. Neither HA/SF composite nor bone cement mentioned above could combine the mechanical properties with the biological properties very well. In addition, researchers found that pure wollastonite also shows high biological activity and compatibility. Moreover, wollastonite powders were used as fillers in organic materials like polymers to produce composites with improved mechanical and bioactive properties in some previous studies.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0021998311421040">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0021998311421040">12</xref></sup> Bearing the above points in mind, chemical-synthesized wollastonite powders were introduced on the basis of HA/SF materials, attempting to obtain the hydroxyapatite–wollastonite/silk fibroin (AW/SF) composite with enhanced mechanical strength, but still preserving the good biological activity like that of HA/SF material. What’s more, no previous reports were published on the development of AW/SF composite.</p>
<p>In this study, AW/SF composite was synthesized by the coprecipitation method of dropwise adding the SF-Ca(NO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub> and Na<sub>3</sub>PO<sub>4</sub> solution simultaneously into the wollastonite suspension. The structure, mechanical properties, and <italic>in vitro</italic> bioactivity of the composite were investigated.</p>

<sec id="sec3-0021998311421040" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and method</title>
<p>In this work, Na<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub>, Ca(NO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>·4H<sub>2</sub>O, Na(PO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>3</sub>·12H<sub>2</sub>O, NaOH, Na<sub>2</sub>SiO<sub>3</sub>·9H<sub>2</sub>O purchased from Sinopharm chemical reagent Co. Ltd., China, were all analytical grade. Domestic silk fibers were provided by National Engineering Laboratory for Modern Silk of Soochow University. Na<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub> was used to degum the silk fibers. Wollastonite (CaSiO<sub>3</sub>) powders were prepared by the method of co-precipitation, using Ca(NO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>·4H<sub>2</sub>O and Na<sub>2</sub>SiO<sub>3</sub>·9H<sub>2</sub>O as raw materials. After washing, the CaSiO<sub>3</sub> precipitate was sintered at 860°C and then ground in ball mill for finer particles. The AW/SF composite powders were synthesized by a modified co-precipitation method.</p>
<p>A flow chart of the process used for the fabrication of the AW/SF composite powders is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0021998311421040">Figure 1</xref>. With the inorganic/organic weight ratio (70/30) of natural bone as a guideline, the weight ratio of hydroxyapatite/wollastonite/silk fibroin in the composite was regulated to be 50/20/30. Domestic silk fibers can be degummed three times to remove the sericins by boiling in 1 wt% Na<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub> solution for 20 min. Then the fibroin fibers were rinsed thoroughly with deionized water and dried in air. The extracted SF was then dissolved in the liquated Ca(NO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>·4H<sub>2</sub>O directly to form the SF-Ca(NO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub> solution. Specifically, the weight ratio of silk fibroin/Ca(NO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>·4H<sub>2</sub>O should be kept at 1/5.88. At the same time, Na<sub>3</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>·12H<sub>2</sub>O should be dissolved in the deionized water. Wollastonite suspension was obtained by dispersing the chemical-synthesized and sintered wollastonite powders in deionized water. The SF-Ca(NO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub> solution and Na<sub>3</sub>PO<sub>4</sub> solution were simultaneously dropwise added to the wollastonite suspension placed in magnetic stirrer, maintaining the temperature at 37°C and the solution pH value at 11. The Ca/P ratio in the precursor was kept at 1.67. After all the reagents were added, the reaction should be kept for 2 h at the original conditions. AW/SF particle suspension solution was obtained after 72 h staying at room temperature. The suspension was then filtrated and washed with deionized water and anhydrous ethanol three times, respectively. After washing, the precipitate was dried at 80°C for 20 h. As a contrast, the HA/SF composite without wollastonite was also prepared correspondingly, by the way of dropwise adding the Na<sub>3</sub>PO<sub>4</sub> solution to the SF-Ca(NO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub> solution, while the other conditions were the same to that of the preparation procedure of the AW/SF composite. For mechanical and biological tests, the composites were compressed into cylindrical tablets with a diameter of 10 mm and height of 4.4–5.0 mm via subsequent cold isostatic pressing at a pressure of 100 MPa.

<sec id="sec4-0021998311421040"><title>Characterization</title>
<p>The morphology and element analysis of the composite particles were observed with a transmission electron microscope (TEM) (Morgagni 268D, FEI) equipped with an energy dispersive analysis X-ray system (EDS). Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectra were recorded using a spectrometer (Nicolet 6700, Thermo Scientific). Crystalline states of the as-prepared composite powders were analyzed by X-ray diffractometer (XRD) (X’Pert-Pro MPD, PaNalytical) with a CuKα beam. The XRD datawere collected in a range of 20°–80° with a step size of 0.0334° and a counting time of 10 s. The measurements of the compressive strength and hardness were conducted to examine the mechanical performance of the composites. Hardness was measured by a Barcol impressor. The compressive strength tests were carried out by a universal materials tester. For these mechanical tests, five tablets were used for each type of composite. Simulated body fluid (SBF) was used to prove the similarity between <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> behavior of certain bioceramic compositions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0021998311421040">13</xref></sup> Therefore, <italic>in vitro</italic> bioactivity test was performed in a SBF medium of pH 7.4. The ratio of tablets weight to SBF volume was kept at about 5 mg/mL. The vessels with SBF and tablets in should be placed in a water bath at 37°C.The SBF solution was prepared by using the method described by Kobuko, as shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0021998311421040">Table 1</xref>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0021998311421040">14</xref></sup> Samples were soaked in SBF, and removed separately after different intervals. The bioactivity was evaluated by examining the formation of the bone-like layer on the surface of the tablets after soaking in the SBF solution for 1, 3, and 7 days. The samples after soaking were cleaned with deionized water and anhydrous ethanol, and dried at room temperature. Scanning electron microscope (SEM) (Quanta-200, FEI) and EDS were used to detect the morphology and composition of the formed layers on the surface of the composite. The ion concentration changes of Ca, P, and Si of the SBF solution after soaking for different periods were determined using an inductively coupled plasma–atomic emission spectrometry (ICP-AES) (Vista MPX, Varian).

<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0021998311421040">Figure 2</xref> shows the XRD patterns of HA/SF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0021998311421040">Figure 2</xref>(a)) composite and AW/SF composite (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0021998311421040">Figure 2</xref>(b)). From <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0021998311421040">Figure 2</xref>, several main hydroxyapatite peaks can be observed in both XRD patterns. It can be seen that the XRD pattern of HA/SF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0021998311421040">Figure 2</xref>(a)) confirms the predominant hydroxyapatite crystal phase, as it was revealed that SF could induce the crystallization of hydroxyapatite even in low temperature.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0021998311421040">10</xref></sup> To be specific, ion complexes were firstly formed, as a result of the chemical interactions between <inline-formula id="ilm1-0021998311421040"><mml:math xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="inline" id="mml-math1-0021998311421040"><mml:mrow><mml:msup><mml:mrow><mml:mtext>Ca</mml:mtext></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mn>2</mml:mn><mml:mo>+</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:msup></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula> and hydrophilic polar groups in silk fibroin.

We can also find that the two composites present notable line broadening and overlap of hydroxyapatite peaks due to the poor crystallinity of hydroxyapatite in both samples, which is similar with that of hydroxyapatite from human bones.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0021998311421040">15</xref></sup> The low degree of crystallization of hydroxyapatite crystals can be attributed to the low temperature procedure. The sharper peaks of sintered wollastonite powders appear in the XRD pattern of AW/SF composite, confirming that the inorganic compositions of AW/SF composite are hydroxyapatite and wollastonite. It also indicates that the existence of wollastonite does not affect the formation of hydroxyapatite crystals at least.

<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0021998311421040">Figure 3</xref> shows the FT-IR spectra of HA/SF composite (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0021998311421040">Figure 3</xref>(a)) and the AW/SF composite (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0021998311421040">Figure 3</xref>(b)) in the spectral range of 2000–400 cm<sup>−1</sup>. The characteristic peaks of hydroxyapatite and silk fibroin can be detected in both FT-IR spectra of the two composites. The bands at 1651, 1557, and 1234 cm<sup>−1</sup> are assigned to amide │I (C = O), amide ││II (N–H), amide │││ III (C–H) of the silk fibroin (random coil structure and reverse β-sheet structure co-exist). The peaks of hydroxyapatite are captured at around 1100, 1033, and 959 cm<sup>−1</sup>, which are ascribed to the P–O stretching vibration mode, whereas the bands at 605 and 564 cm<sup>−1</sup> to the O–P–O bending mode, both are considered to be from the PO<sub>4</sub><sup>3−</sup> group in hydroxyapatite crystals. On the other hand, the band at 459 cm<sup>−1</sup> in the spectrum of AW/SF composite (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0021998311421040">Figure 3</xref>(b)) can be assigned to Si–O–Si bending vibration mode, while bands at 1070, 1033, and 941 cm<sup>−1</sup> to the Si–O stretching vibration mode,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0021998311421040">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0021998311421040">17</xref></sup> both from the wollastonite crystals. Additionally, overlapping of the band at 1033 cm<sup>−1</sup> causes the increase in peak intensity there. So the FT-IR results are in well agreement with the XRD results discussed above.

<p>The characteristic morphology of AW/SF composite powders at low magnification is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0021998311421040">Figure 4</xref>(a). The composite particles displayed irregular shapes with a mean size of 50 nm, and the particles were not agglomerated. In the center of the aggregate, darker than the surrounding area, should be the wollastonite powders which have been sintered with full crystallinity, while the hydroxyapatite crystallizes were partly on the surface of wollastonite powders. Considering the high-energy process of TEM test, silk fibroin may be partly or even completely evaporated, that is why no silk fibroin could be observed here. For the purpose of confirming the descriptions above, energy dispersive X-ray spectrum (EDS) analysis was further conducted. The EDS analysis result for the selected interface area between hydroxyapatite and wollastonite is given in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0021998311421040">Figure 4</xref>(b). In all six different elements can be observed. The Ca and O came from both hydroxyapatite and wollastonite; the P and Si were from the two components, respectively. As to the Cu and C, they could be attributed to the copper mesh and carbon film in the device.

<p>It is commonly accepted that compressive strength for inorganic–organic hybrid materials can be considered as an indication of the interfacial bonding strength between the mineral and organic components.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0021998311421040">18</xref></sup> In the AW/SF composite materials, silk fibroin can be seen as the organic matrix, hydroxyapatite and wollastonite are mineral phases. Many earlier research studies on the HA/SF composite have illustrated that there are strong interactions between Ca<sup>2+</sup> and carboxyl groups and hydroxyl groups of the SF to form ionic complexes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0021998311421040">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0021998311421040">10</xref></sup> The Ca<sup>2+</sup> ions play a bridging role between silk fibroin and hydroxyapatite, binding and interwining them tightly together. And in this work, wollastonite was added in the materials for the purpose of improving mechanical properties of the composite, considering the fact that pure wollastonite ceramics are excellent in both mechanical and bioactive properties. According to the mechanism of mechanical reinforcement postulated by some researchers,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0021998311421040">19</xref></sup> chemical reactions may also take place between wollastonite and SF, leading to the improvement of mechanical properties, because SF has higher surface charge density and the ability to form ionic complexes. In the procedure of preparing AW/SF composite powders, wollastonite powders may be decomposed and Ca<sup>2+</sup> ions got into the solution, the Ca<sup>2+</sup> ions can also play the same role as those from hydroxyapatite. Then the surface was enriched in silicon and Si–OH groups were easily formed to accelerate the nucleation and growth of the hydroxyapatite.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0021998311421040">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0021998311421040">21</xref></sup> All these reveal the fact that chemical reactions might happen between silk fibroin, hydroxyapatite and wollastonite, bringing about the strong chemical bonding with each other. This is a clear indication of how the addition of wollastonite to the composite enhances their robustness. From the macroscopic view, AW/SF composite powders can be easily compressed into tablets or cylinders under a certain pressure in room temperature while in the same condition pure hydroxyapatite or wollastonite powders could hardly be. This also indicates that strong chemical bonding exists between SF, hydroxyapatite and wollastonite in AW/SF composite. On the other hand, the existence of stress transfer between the organic and mineral components can improve the compressive strength of the composite to a certain extent.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0021998311421040">22</xref></sup></p>
<p>The diameter of the Barcol indentions, about 160 µm, is much larger than the average powder size. On this basis, it can be reasonably assumed that the hardness reflects the bonding strength among the aggregates, rather than with an aggregate. So the AW/SF materials have higher hardness values than that of HA/SF, because of the strong bonding strength discussed above. Additionally, it is widely accepted that hardness may decrease with the porosity increasing,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0021998311421040">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0021998311421040">24</xref></sup> but more explicit evidences about this view are yet to be explored.</p>
<p>Based on the analysis above, conclusion can be drawn that the improvement of compressive strength and hardness should be mostly ascribed to the addition of wollastonite powders. The prepared composite is a potential material with enough mechanical strength for application in tissue engineering.</p>

Obvious changes of the sample surface of the AW/SF composite can be seen from the SEM micrographs as the immersion time went by.

The third day (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0021998311421040">Figure 5</xref>(c)), the sample surface became rougher and the crystals seemed to have a direction. This might be associated with the preferential self-assembly of apatite crystallites along <italic>c</italic> axis, because of the existence of silk fibroin in the composite.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0021998311421040">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0021998311421040">31</xref></sup> When large numbers of crystallites were formed and gathered together, it showed a homologous direction in macroscopy. With increasing immersion time, the layer appeared much denser and thicker, the sample surface was completely covered by the newly formed layer and the direction disappeared after 7 days in the SBF solution. While under the same condition in the SBF solution for 7 days, the surface of the HA/SF composite only presented some isolated particles. The probable explanation for the difference was that the wollastonite was dissolved and Si–OH groups were formed on the AW/SF composite surface, which were helpful to the nucleation and growth of newly formed crystals.

As there was no Si ion in the SBF solution, the rapid increase in the concentration of Si indicates the degradation of wollastonite in the SBF solution. The concentration of P ions decreased very steeply by 3 days and came to the value of 0.0665 mM after 7-day immersion. It meant that the P ions needed to form the bone-like layer were mostly supplied from the SBF solution. The concentration of Ca ions increased in the early stage of soaking because of the quick dissolution of both hydroxyapatite and wollastonite. Then the formation of bone-like layer accelerated and the concentration of Ca ions gradually decreased. As time went by, there were fewer P ions left and the formation speed of the layer became slower. Correspondingly, the Ca ions in the SBF solution increased slowly with the continual dissolution of the materials during the period from 3 to 7 days.

The elements detected are mainly Ca, P, O, and C, and quantitative analysis yield a Ca to P ratio of around 1.63, corresponding to the bone-like apatite. That no Si was found in the spectrum means that the original surface of AW/SF composite has been fully covered by the apatite layer after immersion, as a result of the interaction between the composite and the SBF solution. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0021998311421040">Figure 7</xref>(b) shows the high resolution graphic of the newly formed layer after 7-day immersion.

<p>The novel hydroxyapatite-wollastonite/silk fibroin (AW/SF) composite that partially mimicked the composition of natural bone was investigated. The composite was successfully obtained through a modified co-precipitation method. AW/SF composite shows better mechanical properties of both compressive strength and Barcol hardness than that of HA/SF composite. AW/SF composite also demonstrates the fine ability of inducing bone-like apatite formation in the SBF solution, possessing the potential for excellent bioactivity. These findings suggest that AW/SF composite may be a promising biomaterial for bone ingrowth and implant fixation.</p>
