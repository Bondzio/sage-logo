<abstract>
<p>Fatigue and depression have been shown to be significant problems in children with multiple sclerosis. The rate at which these conditions occur in children with other acquired demyelinating syndromes is unknown. In this cross-sectional study, the authors evaluated 49 children with demyelinating disorders (multiple sclerosis and acute disseminated encephalomyelitis) and 92 healthy controls for depression and/or fatigue using the Behavior Assessment System for Children, Second Edition behavior and mood rating scale and Varni PedsQL Multidimensional Fatigue Scale. The parents of acquired demyelinating syndrome patients were more likely to report elevated depressive symptoms (30.8% vs 10.8%, <italic>P</italic> = .008). Elevated parent and self-reported total fatigue (25% vs 0%, <italic>P</italic> &lt; .001, 26.7% vs 8.6%, <italic>P</italic> = .024) was seen in the patient cohort. The authors conclude that fatigue and depression are far more common in children with acquired demyelinating syndromes than in controls. Clinical attention to and implementation of effective therapies oriented toward these conditions in children with acquired demyelinating syndromes is needed.</p>

<body>
<p>Pediatric onset (less than age 18) of multiple sclerosis constitutes approximately 3% to 5% of all cases of multiple sclerosis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0883073812450750">1</xref></sup> Disease burden in children with multiple sclerosis, as seen in brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), is frequently extensive, even at onset.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0883073812450750">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0883073812450750">3</xref></sup> Despite this, relatively slow accrual of physical disability occurs in patients with pediatric onset multiple sclerosis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0883073812450750">4</xref></sup></p>
<p>However, cognitive impairment, including deficits in executive function, processing speed, working memory, attention, and confrontation naming, is seen early on.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0883073812450750">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0883073812450750"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0883073812450750"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0883073812450750"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0883073812450750">9</xref></sup> Indeed, one study has shown that almost one-third of patients with pediatric multiple sclerosis had evidence for impairment in memory, complex attention, executive function, or language after an average disease duration of only 3 years.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0883073812450750">6</xref></sup> One 2-year longitudinal follow-up study of this cohort has shown cognitive impairment in 70% of children, while three-fourths of children who had impairments at baseline were found to experience deteriorating performance.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0883073812450750">5</xref></sup></p>
<p>Increasing evidence points to the presence of a significant psychosocial burden in this group of patients. Previous studies have suggested that depression and fatigue are significant issues in this population, and may vary by geographic location. One US study found depression in half of the evaluated children with multiple sclerosis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0883073812450750">8</xref></sup> In an Italian study, almost 75% of children with multiple sclerosis reported fatigue, although only 6% reported depression. Discrepancies between these findings may be related to difference in constructs, measurements, or interpretation of symptoms. Regardless, both depression and fatigue represent potentially significant areas of concern in pediatric multiple sclerosis, but the extent of these problems has not been clearly established. Furthermore, examination of the interactions between fatigue and depression in this population has not been performed.</p>
<p>In addition, acute disseminated encephalomyelitis, considered to be a self-limited demyelinating condition that occurs primarily in childhood, represents another entity in which little information on psychosocial outcomes is available. Small case series suggest that some children, particularly those presenting with severe clinical symptoms, experience neurocognitive deficits.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0883073812450750">10</xref></sup> However, the presence and extent of depression and fatigue in this population following the acute demyelinating event has not been described. With this in mind, the authors evaluated depression and fatigue in children with demyelinating disorders, including multiple sclerosis and acute disseminated encephalomyelitis, in a prospectively collected cohort of children followed at a specialized pediatric multiple sclerosis center in the United States. A comparison healthy control group from the same geographic area was enrolled in this study and assessed using the same psychometric tools.</p>
<sec id="section1-0883073812450750" sec-type="methods">
<title>Methods</title>
<p>This cross-sectional study included consecutive children with acquired demyelinating disorders seen at a Pediatric MS Center of Excellence between 2007 and 2011. Children with demyelinating disorders (n = 49; multiple sclerosis n = 36, acute disseminated encephalomyelitis n = 13) were included if they satisfied proposed criteria (International Pediatric MS Study Group) for pediatric demyelinating disorders (2007).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0883073812450750">11</xref></sup> Healthy controls (n = 92) were recruited from the same local geographic area as the majority of the patient cohort through an institutional review board–approved advertisement. Control participants were excluded if they had history of head injury, neurologic condition, learning or attention problems, or psychiatric diagnosis or if English was not their primary language. Demographic and clinical information was collected using a standardized data collection instruments endorsed by the US Network of Pediatric MS Centers of Excellence. The National Multiple Sclerosis Society Consensus Neuropsychological Battery for Pediatric Multiple Sclerosis was given to all patients and control participants. This battery is described in detail elsewhere.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0883073812450750">12</xref></sup></p>
<p>This analysis focuses on results from 2 specific tests within the National Multiple Sclerosis Society Consensus Neuropsychological Battery for Pediatric Multiple Sclerosis: Behavior Assessment System for Children, Second Edition <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0883073812450750">13</xref></sup> and Varni PedsQL Multidimensional Fatigue Scale.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0883073812450750">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0883073812450750">15</xref></sup> The Behavior Assessment System for Children, Second Edition is a broad mood and behavior questionnaire ranging in length from 139 to 176 questions based on age and form (parent or self-report). Both parent and self-report forms were given. The Depression Index scaled score (T-score) was used in analyses, as different forms have different number of items making analysis of raw scores more difficult. T-scores were also used to assess the number of participants having a clinically elevated score, as described by the test (ie, T-score ≥ 60). This score was calculated using combined sex normative data from the computer software scoring program. The Varni PedsQL Multidimensional Fatigue Scale also includes both parent and self-report scales and assesses fatigue on 3 dimensions (General, Cognitive, Sleep/Rest). Raw scores were used for statistical analyses. The Behavior Assessment System for Children, Second Edition and Varni PedsQL Multidimensional Fatigue Scale were administered by a neuropsychologist (JBP) or clinical assistant under the supervision of a neuropsychologist (JBP). Institutional review board approval was obtained from the Children and Youth Institutional Review Board of SUNY Buffalo.</p>

<title>Statistical Analysis</title>
<p>Statistical analyses were conducted using SPSS. Comparisons of age and parent education between groups were completed using analysis of variance (ANOVA). Examination of sex distribution between groups was conducted using chi-square analyses. Additional chi-square analyses were used to examine the percentage of participants with scores falling within clinically elevated ranges for depression (Behavior Assessment System for Children, Second Edition, Depression Index, T = 60-69 [moderate], T ≥ 70 [severe]) and fatigue(PedsQL Multidimensional Fatigue Scale; Total Fatigue = 36-53 [moderate], ≥ 54 [severe], General, Cognitive and Sleep/Rest = 12-17 [moderate], ≥ 18 [severe]). analysis of covariance was used to examine group differences on measures, with sex as a covariate. When comparing multiple groups (multiple sclerosis, acute disseminated encephalomyelitis, healthy controls), post hoc comparisons were conducted using hypothesis-wise <italic>t</italic> tests with Bonferonni correction for multiple comparisons. Pearson <italic>r</italic> correlations were used to examine associations between parent and self-report measures, and between measures of depression (Behavior Assessment System for Children, Second Edition, Depression Index) and fatigue (PedsQL Multidimensional Fatigue Scale).</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>Average age of patients was 12.86 years (± 4.15) and in healthy controls 11.84 years (± 3.71). Disease duration was 2.8 years (± 2.95) and age of onset 10.11 years (± 5.10). The female to male ratio was 1.6:1 in patients and 0.8:1 in controls, χ<sup>2</sup> = –3.549(1), <italic>P</italic> = .060 (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0883073812450750">Table 1</xref>). There were no differences between controls and patients (multiple sclerosis + acute disseminated encephalomyelitis) on age or parent education.</p>

<title>Depression and Fatigue in Patients in Comparison to Controls</title>
<p>Chi-square analyses show that parents of patients with demyelinating disease were more likely to report elevated depressive symptoms on the Parent Report Behavior Assessment System for Children, Second Edition (T-score ≥ 60) (28.6% vs 10.9%, χ<sup>2</sup> = 7.093, <italic>P</italic> = .008), whereas on the self-report measure of depression, there was no significant difference between groups (χ<sup>2</sup> = 2.232, <italic>P</italic> = .14), with 7.1% of the healthy controls group and 13.9% of the patient group having elevated T-scores. Parent-reported fatigue could not be examined statistically because of the small number of healthy controls with elevated fatigue. Percentages of participants in the healthy controls group with elevated fatigue scores on any subscale of fatigue ranged from 0% to 5.26%, n = 57, while in acquired demyelinating syndrome patients the percentage ranged from 25% to 38.89%, n = 36. Self-reported Total Fatigue clinical elevations were more likely to be seen in children with acquired demyelinating syndromes (26.7%, n = 30) compared to controls (8.6%, n = 58) (χ<sup>2</sup> = 5.114, <italic>P</italic> = .024). Similar findings were evident in Cognitive Fatigue (χ<sup>2</sup> = 3.717, <italic>P</italic> = .054). Differences between groups were not significant in Sleep/Rest Fatigue (<italic>P</italic> = .331), and analysis could not be conducted for General Fatigue (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0883073812450750">Tables 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0883073812450750">3</xref> for percentages).</p>

<p>Comparisons of means showed significant differences between acquired demyelinating syndrome patients and healthy controls on measures of parent-reported depression (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .001). There were also significant differences between controls and patients on all measures of parent-reported fatigue, Total Fatigue (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .001, General Fatigue (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .001), Sleep/Rest Fatigue (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .001), Cognitive Fatigue (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .001).

Group differences were not seen in self-reported depression.</p>
<p>Post hoc analysis, examining multiple sclerosis and acute disseminated encephalomyelitis patients separately, showed significant differences between parent-reported depression (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .001) in controls in comparison to patients with multiple sclerosis (<italic>P</italic> = .002) and acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (<italic>P</italic> = .005). Differences between acute disseminated encephalomyelitis and multiple sclerosis were not significant. As for fatigue, parent- and self-reported Total, General, Sleep/Rest, and Cognitive Fatigue differed between patients and controls (all <italic>P</italic> &lt; .001), with post hoc analyses showing significant differences between controls and patients with multiple sclerosis and acute disseminated encephalomyelitis in all categories within parent reports (all <italic>P</italic> &lt; .01). Parent reports of fatigue in acute disseminated encephalomyelitis and multiple sclerosis patients did not differ significantly. Interestingly, however, differences between multiple sclerosis patients and controls were seen in 3 out of 4 self-report (patient) measures of fatigue (all <italic>P</italic> &lt; .04), but not between acute disseminated encephalomyelitis patients and controls (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0883073812450750">Tables 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0883073812450750">3</xref>).</p>

<title>Correlational Analyses</title>
<p>Among controls, parent- and self-reported depression correlated significantly with all measures of fatigue (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0883073812450750">Table 2</xref>).</p>
<p>In patients (acute disseminated encephalomyelitis + multiple sclerosis), there were significant correlations between parent-reported depression and self-reported General and Cognitive Fatigue. Correlations were not significant between fatigue and depression within parent or self-report measures, respectively.</p>
<p>When exploring correlations in multiple sclerosis patients alone, there were correlations between parent-reported depression and self-reported General and Cognitive Fatigue. Self-reported Cognitive Fatigue and age were negatively correlated as well, suggesting greater “cognitive” Fatigue (eg, attention, thinking quickly, multitasking) in younger patients. There were no correlations between age or parent education with other measures.</p>
<p>Within the patient groups, there were no correlations between disability as measured by the Expanded Disability Status Scale or age of onset with any measure of fatigue or depression.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In this article, the authors have described self- and parent-reported fatigue and depression in a group of patients with pediatric onset demyelinating disorders in comparison with controls. The authors found evidence of depression in almost 3 times as many children with demyelinating disorders than in controls; this stands in marked contrast to that reported in the Italian pediatric multiple sclerosis cohort, where only 6% reported depression.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0883073812450750">16</xref></sup> This may be related to cultural differences in reporting symptoms, differences in measures used, or differences in age or disease presentation in their cohort. Fatigue was also a significant concern, again, with approximately one-fourth of children and their parents reporting fatigue. Importantly, fatigue appeared to be independent of depression in children with multiple sclerosis. These results were not dependent on Expanded Disability Status Scale, age of onset, sex, and age.</p>
<p>Within the demyelinating patient group, perception of symptoms varied between patients and parents. Parent-reported symptoms of depression were correlated with elevated symptoms of fatigue (self-report), but not depression. Discordance between parental and child reports in childhood depression is a widely reported phenomenon. One study found that although mothers reliably report school-related functioning, they are less accurate in their reporting of covert depressive symptoms in adolescent girls.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0883073812450750">17</xref></sup> Concordance may also be related to the age and sex of the child as well as parental mood. One study has shown increasing concordance between parent and child reports as the age of the child increases. The same report showed an association between maternal depression and more severe symptom reports in the mothers than children, and a greater likelihood of reporting depressive symptoms parents than boys, but not girls.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0883073812450750">18</xref></sup></p>
<p>In this cohort, it is possible that parent-reported symptoms of depression were increased because of misinterpretations of fatigue for symptoms of childhood depression (withdrawal, anhedonia, etc). The alternative hypothesis may be true as well: children, while experiencing depressive symptoms, may have identified these symptoms as fatigue. As noted above, parent/guardian mood may also influence reporting, and, as the authors did not assess mood in caregivers, they cannot comment on the possible effect parental mood may have had on this finding. Finally, social embarrassment and stigma related to depression may influence reporting: children may be less willing to report symptoms because of embarrassment or fear of how the report will be interpreted when reviewed. The authors cannot comment on the effect of this phenomenon on the findings.</p>
<p>These findings highlight the importance of including both parent and self-reports. Limiting evaluations of depression to parent report only may lead to a risk of possibly misconstruing fatigue as depression or misunderstanding self-perception of mood and functioning. Limitations of the study include the relatively small number of patients and the limited geographic distribution of the patients. Larger prospective, controlled studies are needed to confirm the findings of the study.</p>
<p>The authors did not find a correlation between disability (Expanded Disability Status Scale) and fatigue or depression. The authors emphasize, however, that the lack of correlation between disability (Expanded Disability Status Scale) and fatigue or depression may be related to the limited range of Expanded Disability Status Scale in this sample: most of the children in this sample had minimal to no disability, as measured by the Expanded Disability Status Scale. As noted by others, physical disability is slow to accrue in patients with pediatric onset multiple sclerosis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0883073812450750">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0883073812450750">19</xref></sup> It is possible that another measure of disease severity, such as, for example, lesion load, may show correlations with fatigue and/or mood. This is an important area of future investigation, which should also focus on associations among cognitive functioning, fatigue, and symptoms of depression.</p>
<p>This report suggests that both fatigue and depression are common in the population with pediatric demyelinating disorders. Fatigue and depression have been reported in other pediatric chronic illnesses, such as inflammatory bowel disease<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0883073812450750">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0883073812450750">21</xref></sup> and childhood cancer.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0883073812450750">22</xref></sup> Depression is reported more frequently in children with epilepsy than healthy children (8% vs 2%),<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0883073812450750">23</xref></sup> and depressive symptoms have been found to be greater than controls in a meta-analysis of studies of pediatric chronic conditions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0883073812450750">24</xref></sup> Because the authors did not include a comparative group of children with other chronic illnesses in this study, it is not clear whether levels of fatigue or depression in this cohort are significantly greater than in children with other chronic conditions. The rate of depression in this cohort is greater than that found in the above-mentioned epilepsy study. However, as there were also differences between the number of controls reporting depression in the epilepsy study in comparison to this study, the actual difference between the 2 groups is unknown. It is possible that the presence of inflammatory CNS disease may underlie the higher levels of depression in this group if the rates in the pediatric demyelinating population are truly higher. This is a key area of future exploration. In addition, fatigue and depression require further examination in this population because of their potentially significant effects on academic performance and social development.</p>
<p>Acute disseminated encephalomyelitis is generally considered a self-limited illness from which children are thought to experience full recovery.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0883073812450750">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0883073812450750">26</xref></sup> In this study, the authors found that patients with acute disseminated encephalomyelitis had greater parent-reported fatigue than healthy controls, as well as greater parent-reported depression. This study adds to a growing body of literature that suggests the presence lingering neurocognitive and behavioral problems in this group.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0883073812450750">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0883073812450750">27</xref></sup> Evidence of ongoing psychosocial problems, such as that of high levels of depression and fatigue, as found in this study, suggests a need for increased awareness and monitoring of these patients.</p>
<p>At present, although much information regarding frequency of relapse and use of disease modifying therapies in the pediatric multiple sclerosis population has been published, less information is available on symptomatic interventions for problems frequently seen in association with demyelinating illness in childhood. Future research should focus on the impact of fatigue and depression on daily functioning in this population, as well on the development of interventions to prevent or improve these conditions.</p>
