<abstract>
<p>Hard turning with minimal fluid application is an emerging machining technique in which cutting fluid is applied in the form of a minimal high velocity narrow pulsed jet so that for all practical purpose it resembles dry and wet turning but at the same time offers better cutting performance. Semi-solid assisted machining is a novel concept to control cutting force, cutting temperature, tool wear and to improve surface finish. In the present investigation, an attempt is made to improve the cutting performance during turning of hardened AISI 4340 steel with minimal fluid through the application of a semi-solid lubricant namely grease in pure form and as a mixture with 10% graphite applied at the tool–chip interface, tool–work interface and at the back side of the chip using a special semi-solid lubricant applicator developed for this purpose. The results indicated that the use of semi-solid lubricants – grease and graphite at the tool–chip interface along with minimal fluid application reduces tool vibration, cutting force, cutting temperature, tool wear and improves surface finish.</p>

<sec id="sec1-1350650112468376" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title>
<p>Conventionally, when parts requiring high hardness as functional requirement are to be machined, the work piece is turned to the near net shape, hardened to the required hardness and ground to the final dimension. This lengthy process cycle can be avoided if the hardened work piece is directly turned to the final dimension. This is possible by hard turning. Recently, the concept of hard turning has gained considerable attention in metal cutting as it can apparently replace the traditional process cycle of turning, heat treating and finish grinding for assembly of hard wear resistant steel parts.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1350650112468376">1</xref></sup> Hard turning can facilitate low process cost, low process time, better surface quality and lower waste. But hard turning involves very large quantities of cutting fluid. Procurement, storage and disposal of cutting fluid involve expenses and it has to comply with environmental legislations such as OSHA as well. Pure dry turning is a solution to this problem as it does not require any cutting fluid at all. But pure dry turning requires ultra-hard cutting tools, extremely rigid tools and it is difficult to implement in the existing shop floor as the machine tool may not be rigid enough to support hard turning.</p>
<p>In this context, turning with minimal fluid application (MFA) is a viable alternative where in, extremely small quantities of cutting fluid with high velocity are applied in the critical contact zones, so that for all practical purposes it resembles pure dry turning and at the same time, free from all the problems related to large-scale use of cutting fluid as in conventional wet turning.</p>
<p>In MFA, extremely small quantities of cutting fluids are applied at critical zones in the form of a high-velocity pulsed jet so that fluid particles reach the tool–chip interface provides enhanced rake face lubrication, which was investigated by Varadarajan et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1350650112468376">2</xref></sup> and he observed that the overall performance on the basis of cutting force, tool life, surface finish, cutting ratio, cutting temperature and tool–chip contact length was superior to that during dry turning and conventional wet turning. In MFA, since only a very small quantity of cutting fluid is used for the dual purpose of cooling and lubrication, some effective system is needed to further improve its cutting performance and to prevent damage to the machine tool and the surface generated. Modern tribology has facilitated the use of semi-solid lubricant along with MFA in this direction.</p>
<p>Lathkar et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1350650112468376">3</xref></sup> investigated the effect of machining on tool wear and surface finish with graphite-based grease mixed with base oil applied in minimal quantity lubrication and he observed that the cutting performance was superior to that during dry machining. Shaji and Radhakrishnan<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1350650112468376">4</xref></sup> studied the effect of graphite in surface grinding and reported improvement in surface finish. Also using graphite, calcium fluoride, barium fluoride, and molybdenum trioxide in grinding, cutting performance found to be improved considerably.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1350650112468376">5</xref></sup> The effect of solid lubricant assisted end milling of AISI 1045 steel with graphite and molybdenum disulphide lubricants on surface quality, cutting forces were analysed and it is reported that there was a considerable improvement in the process performance as compared to that of machining with cutting fluids.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1350650112468376">6</xref></sup> Solid lubricants like MoS<sub>2</sub>, MoS<sub>2</sub> base grease, graphite-based grease and silicon compound mixed with SAE20 oil have indicated the improved surface quality in different proportions while machining aluminium and brass.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1350650112468376">7</xref></sup> Also, the graphite and molybdenum disulphide assisted ceramic grinding processes has reported considerable improvement in process performance.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1350650112468376">8</xref></sup> Dilbarg and Rao<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1350650112468376">9</xref></sup> investigated the effect of solid lubricants during hard turning while machining bearing steel. From the results, it was observed that there was a tremendous improvement in the surface finish with the use of solid lubricants compared to dry hard turning. Vamsi Krishna and Rao<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1350650112468376">10</xref></sup> investigated the influence of solid lubricants during turning operation and he observed that the application of solid lubricants on the back side of the chip offers better cutting performance. In another study, they reported improvement in cutting performance using solid lubricant like graphite and boric acid.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1350650112468376">11</xref></sup> Guleryuz et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1350650112468376">12</xref></sup> studied the machining performance of TiN coated and patterned carbide inserts incorporating indium as a solid lubricant during turning of 4340 steel and reported that indium was very effective in reducing flank wear. Abhang and Hameedullah<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1350650112468376">13</xref></sup> analysed the possibility of using 10% boric acid by weight mixed with base oil SAE 40, to reduce heat generated in machining zone and to improve cutting performance. Better results were reported using micro-holes filled MoS<sub>2</sub> solid lubricants which were made on the surface of the cemented carbide tool and the cutting performance of the tool was improved compared with that of the conventional one.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1350650112468376">14</xref></sup></p>
<p>Above-mentioned studies indicate that the use of solid lubricant in machining has proved to be effective, if it can be applied properly. If the frictional force at the interaction zone is minimized by providing effective lubrication, the heat generated can be reduced to some extent which in turn reduces tool wear, cutting force and improve surface finish.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1350650112468376">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1350650112468376">16</xref></sup> Application of proper lubricant in refined and defined way will results in better cutting performance. Advancement in modern tribology has identified many solid lubricants and semi-solid lubricant is a environmental clean technology in machining to obtain desirable control of cutting force, cutting temperature, tool vibration and tool wear.</p>
<p>In this study, an attempt is made to investigate the effect of semi-solid lubricant such as grease in pure form and as a mixture with 10% graphite on tool wear and surface finish during hard turning of AISI 4340 steel with MFA using hard metal inserts with sculptured rake face. Also, comparative performance analysis of semi-solid lubricant assisted machining with conventional dry turning and turning with MFA was conducted.</p>

<p>The tool holder used had the specification PSBNR 2525 M12. Multicoated hard metal inserts with sculptured rake face geometry with the specification SNMG 120408 MT TT5100 from TaeguTec were used as cutting tools in this investigation. PSBNR 2525 M12 tool holder is a hardened steel and it can be used in hard turning process. The selection of cutting tool and the tool holder was done based on the information available in Varadarajan et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1350650112468376">2</xref></sup> and the recommendations of the cutting tool manufacturers, M/s TaeguTec India (P) Ltd.</p>

<sec id="sec4-1350650112468376"><title>MFA system</title>
<p>The fluid applicator consists of a fuel pump (Bosh type) of a four-cylinder compression ignition engine, which is coupled to an infinitely variable electric drive. The fuel pump has a plunger with helical groove which can rotate about its axis and the degree of rotation of plunger determines the quantity of fluid delivered per stroke. There is a provision for rotating the plunger so that the quantity of fluid delivered per stroke can be controlled accurately. The cutting fluid was delivered through a fuel injecting nozzle (Bosh type) with specification DN0SD151 with a spray angle of 0°. The plunger reciprocates as the motor rotates and delivers one pulse of cutting fluid for each revolution through the fluid injector. The pressure of the cutting fluid at the injector before it is delivered through the nozzle can be set at any predefined value. The fluid coming out of the injector consists of myriads of tiny droplets/(particles) of few microns in size, the velocity of which depends upon the pressure set at the fluid injector nozzle (70 m/s).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1350650112468376">17</xref></sup> Higher the pressure, higher will be the velocity of the individual particles. In the fluid application system developed, it is possible to vary the pressure, frequency of pulsing and rate of delivery independently. The system can supply a pulsing jet of cutting fluid at four locations in the same machine tool or to four separate machine tools simultaneously. A specially formulated mineral oil based cutting fluid which acted as an oil-in-water emulsion, was applied as a narrow pulsed jet at tool–work interface.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1350650112468376">18</xref></sup> The experimental setup for MFA used in the study is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1350650112468376">Figure 1</xref>.

<sec id="sec5-1350650112468376"><title>Development of semi-solid lubricant applicator</title>
<p>Semi-solid lubrication is a recent technique introduced in machining to obtain safe, environmental, economical and technical benefits. In this semi-solid lubricant application, heat transfer is predominantly in the evaporative mode which was more efficient than the conventional heat transfer prevalent in wet turning. Also, it enables application of extremely small quantities of proprietary of semi-solid lubricant at the contact zone during turning which can act as a coolant as well as a lubricant. Grease is a semi-solid lubricant which composed of calcium, sodium soap base emulsified with mineral oil (designation-LGWA 2DIN 51825 code KP2N-30). It is used in high-pressure applications and during metal cutting where liquid lubricants cannot be retained. Semi-solid lubricant applicator of pneumatic type is used in the present investigation to deliver grease in desired directions. It mainly consists of a cylinder, a piston rod, nylon piston ring and a nozzle. The compressed air from the compressor flows through the tubes and this causes the piston ring to move forward. As the piston ring moves forward, the grease will be delivered through the nozzle at desired direction and location. To control the amount of grease which comes out of the nozzle, the apparatus also consists of a control valve which is used to control the flow of air from the compressor to the cylinder. To control the air flow, adjustable flow meter where its inlet is connected to the compressor and its outlet is connected to the inlet of the semi-solid applicator. Fixtures are used for holding the semi-solid lubricant applicator in three different directions. In the present investigation, grease in pure form and grease impregnated with 10% graphite were used. It is applied using a grease gun, which applies the grease to the part being lubricated under pressure, forcing the solid grease into the spaces in the part. Fabricated part of the semi-solid lubricant applicator is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1350650112468376">Figure 2</xref> and the application of semi-solid lubricant in different directions is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1350650112468376">Figure 3</xref>.

<sec id="sec6-1350650112468376"><title>Experimental setup</title>
<p>Experiments were carried out on a Kirloskar Turn master-35 lathe. A photograph of the setup used for this investigation is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1350650112468376">Figure 4</xref>. The main cutting force, the flank wear, the tool vibration, surface finish and the average cutting temperature were measured during each experiment. The main cutting force was measured using Kistler tool force dynamometer. The flank wear was measured using a tool maker’s microscope, surface finish was measured using perthometer and tool vibration was measured using piezoelectric type vibrometer (RATNA V206 Make) and the pickup of the vibrometer was mounted at the bottom of the tool holder using a magnetic holder. The signals from the pickup were fed to a signal conditioner and an indicator. The average cutting temperature was measured using an extrapolative measuring technique developed by Varadarajan et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1350650112468376">19</xref></sup> Cutting temperature was measured by planting two K-type thermocouples K1 and K2 flush to the two sides of the insert and predicting the average cutting temperature as a function of the temperature as indicated by the two thermocouples using a finite element model. The analysis was carried out using ANSYS software on a three-dimensional model of the tool insert which had an overall size of 25 × 25 × 5 mm<sup>3</sup>. The bottom of the insert and the two sides that are in contact with tool holder were insulated for thermal isolation from the tool holder. Convective boundary conditions were assumed on the other three sides, which were exposed to the atmosphere. The temperature at the tip of the insert was assumed to vary from minimum value to maximum value in steps of 50℃. The temperature at the nodal points where the thermocouples were located were back calculated from the details of the temperature assumed at the tool tip using the model developed. Based on the set of data consisting of cutting temperature (<italic>T</italic><sub>C</sub>) and the temperature at the predefined nodal point (<italic>N</italic>), a correlation between <italic>N</italic> and <italic>T</italic><sub>c</sub> was developed. Cutting experiments were conducted in which cutting temperature was measured using tool–work thermocouple technique to validate the predictions by the finite element model. It was observed that there was a good agreement between the cutting temperature as predicted by the finite element model and that measured using tool–work thermocouple technique. The pressure at fluid applicator was kept at 80 bar, the rate of fluid application at 5 mL/min, the frequency of pulsing was maintained at 300 pulses/min, composition of cutting fluid = 10% + rest water and quantity of semi-solid lubricant = 8 g/min.

<p>Analysis of variance (ANOVA) was carried out using Qualitek software to assess the percentage influence of the individual parameters of tool vibration, cutting force, cutting temperature, surface finish and tool wear. The authors used the response Table methodology<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1350650112468376">20</xref></sup> and Qualitek software to analyse the results. The results of the 18 experiments are summarized in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1350650112468376">Table 2</xref>.</p>
<p>The input variables namely the cutting velocity, feed and the depth of cut were varied at three levels. Three level tests for each factor were used because the considered variables are multilevel variables and their outcome effects are nonlinear. During the 18-run experiment, cutting speed, feed rate, composition and direction of semi-solid lubricant application were varied as in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1350650112468376">Table 3</xref> and the parameters which were kept constant during each experiment are presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-1350650112468376">Table 4</xref>. Experiments were conducted with three replications. The main cutting force, the average cutting temperature, surface finish, tool wear and the displacement of tool vibration were measured during each experiment. The cutting velocity, feed rate and depth of cut combinations were arrived at based on the results of preliminary experiments and the recommendations of the cutting tool manufacturers M/s TaeguTec India (P) Ltd.

<sec id="sec9-1350650112468376"><title>Effect of semi-solid lubricant on cutting performance</title>
<p>Based on relative significance of operative parameters on cutting performance (shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-1350650112468376">Figures 5</xref> to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-1350650112468376">9</xref>), it is observed that the rate of semi-solid lubricants form the most significant parameter influencing surface finish, tool wear, tool vibration, cutting force and cutting temperature. Among the rate of semi-solid lubricants used in this study, it is seen that the application of semi-solid lubricant impregnated with graphite in accompaniment with MFA brought forth better cutting performance. It is also seen that semi-solid application in the tool–chip interface in accompaniment with MFA corresponding to D1 can bring forth lower cutting force when compared to the other direction. For semi-solid lubricant to be effective, low coefficient of friction, low shear strength and formation of thin adherent film on the surface of the sliding material are considered as an essential factors.</p>
<p>Work reported by Leskover and Grun,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1350650112468376">21</xref></sup> Tonshoff and Brinkomere<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1350650112468376">22</xref></sup> and Astakhove<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1350650112468376">23</xref></sup> suggest formation of microcracks on the work near the tool tip due to the extreme thermal conditions prevailing there. The cutting fluid particles entering at the tool–work interface can reach the tool–chip interface through the microcracks that exist on the work near the tool tip. Varadarajan et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1350650112468376">19</xref></sup> developed an extrapolative technique based on finite element analysis to predict the average temperature at the tool tip and it is reported that the average cutting temperature can be as high as 1100℃ depending on the cutting parameters for a tool–work combination comprising of AISI 4340 steel of 46 HRC and multicoated hard metal inserts with sculptured rake face. It is reported that the main cutting force is of the order of 600 N acting on the very small area that forms the tool–chip interface and this results in extreme pressure/stress conditions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1350650112468376">2</xref></sup></p>
<p>The mineral oil that is used as a base for the commercial cutting fluid has got a fuming point of 185℃ and at extreme cutting conditions the cutting temperature at the tool–chip interface can go up to 600℃ which is almost three times its fuming point of the mineral oil. Hence, there is every possibility of the degradation of the cutting fluid. This is also evident from the results of the cutting experiments. Whenever high cutting temperatures are encountered, there is increase in the cutting force component which suggests degradation in the lubricating ability of the cutting fluid.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1350650112468376">2</xref></sup></p>
<p>Tool wear and main cutting force are the indices of the lubricating ability of a cutting fluid. Low cutting force components and low tool wear are indications of better rake face lubrication. Whenever high cutting temperatures were encountered, it can be presumed that there is degradation of the lubricating ability of the cutting fluid as explained earlier and this degradation of the lubricating ability is marked by an increase in the main cutting force component. For example, when the cutting temperature was 600℃, the main cutting force component was 230 N and when the cutting temperature was 750℃, the cutting force component went up to 450 N.<sup>2</sup> This increase in the main cutting force component can be considered as a measure of the deterioration of the lubricating ability of the cutting fluid. When the solid lubricant is applied at the tool–chip interface, it takes the latent heat of fusion from the tool–chip interface which reduces the severity of the thermal conditions that prevail at the tool–chip interface and prevents the complete degradation of the lubricating properties of the cutting fluid particles present at the tool–chip interface.</p>
<p>Moreover, a mixture comprising of cutting fluid particles, molten solid lubricant and the graphite particles act as a dielectric that prevents intermolecular and interatomic interaction between the chip and the tool surfaces. During turning operation, tool–chip contact length is a measure of the interaction between the tool and the chip.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1350650112468376">24</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1350650112468376"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1350650112468376">26</xref></sup> Lower the tool–chip contact length, lower will be the interaction between the tool and the chip and vice versa. In the present investigation, the tool–chip contact length was the least when the MFA was carried out along with application of silicon grease impregnated with graphite at the tool–work interface. This reduction in the tool–chip contact length can be considered as an index of lower surface interaction between the chip and the tool.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1350650112468376">27</xref></sup> This prevents adhesion of the chip to the tool surface and changes the conditions prevailing at the tool–chip interface from sticking to one of sliding leading to drastic reduction in cutting force.</p>
<p>During MFA, a pulsing jet cutting fluid consisting of myriads high velocity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1350650112468376">17</xref></sup> tiny droplets (particles) of few microns in size generated by a fluid application was applied at critical zones. When the cutting fluid is applied at the tool–work interface, some quantity of the cutting falls on the uncut work surface which forms the top side of the chip during the next rotation. The top side of the chip is characterized by myriads of microcracks with nascent crack tips. In normal case, the microcracks can coalesce due to intense surface interaction. When they coalesce, the chip becomes stronger and shows a tendency to bend towards the rake surface which leads to increased tool–chip contact length and associated increase in the main cutting force, tool wear and surface roughness.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1350650112468376">28</xref></sup> But when tiny droplets of cutting fluid get adsorbed on the top side of the chip owing to their small size and high velocity, they dope the nascent surfaces generated and prevent the coalesce of crack tips. This leads to the weakening of the back side of the chip and the chip tends to bend away from the tool rake face resulting in reduction of tool–chip contact length and associated benefits such as lower cutting force, tool wear, tool vibration, cutting temperature and better surface finish.</p>
<p>Also, graphite which is known to have low frictional effects at the interface, sliding action and ability to reduce the shear strength of material at the machining zone enable to form an effective lubricant film. When semi-solid lubricant impregnated with graphite in accompaniment with MFA is applied during machining, the formation of thin film of lubrication on the rake face of the tool reduces the frictional forces between the tool and chip, which subsequently reduces the temperature developed and prevents the tool wear which further leads to substantial improvement in cutting performance.</p>

<p>Based on comparison results, it is evident that the main cutting force produced in MFA along with semi-solid lubricants is lower than that of the dry and turning with MFA. In the case of dry turning, the cutting force is 402.54 N and in turning with MFA, the force reduces to 388.103 N, whereas in MFA along with semi-solid lubricants, the cutting force is 369.17 N. In MFA, along with semi-solid lubricants, the cutting fluid is supplied at high pressure (80 bar) and semi-solid lubricants are applied at the tool–chip interface. This result in better friction reduction between tool and chip compared to turning with MFA which in turn reduces the cutting force. The reduction in cutting force results in better surface finish which also reduces tool vibration. It is also observed that MFA along with semi-solid lubricants has very low roughness value than that in dry and minimal fluid environment. Such condition is not prevailed in wet turning because there is no such fragmentation phenomenon. Also, in MFA along with semi-solid lubricants, due to cooling by convective as well as evaporative heat transfer and formation of thin film lubrication, cutting temperature and tool wear reduces marginally when compared to turning with MFA, which is not possible in case of dry turning.</p>

<list-item><p>Semi-solid lubricant like grease and graphite should be applied at the tool–chip interface at rate of 8 g/min along with the MFA at the rate of 5 mL/min at the tool–chip interface to reduce performance indices like tool vibration, tool wear, cutting temperature, main cutting force and to improve surface finish.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>This study illustrates the use of semi-solid lubricants along with MFA as a viable alternative for hard turning with MFA, dry and wet turning. It is also a possible environmental friendly alternative for effective control of heat generated at the machining zone.</p></list-item>
