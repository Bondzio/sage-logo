<title>Background</title>
<p>Within the area of dementia care, occupational therapists are asked to predict occupational competence in everyday living and often do so by assessing cognitive competence. Considering the cognitive changes that occur with dementia over time, the construct of cognitive competence is a key consideration. Still, a gap exists in the literature examining the relationship between cognitive competence and occupational competence.</p>
</sec>
<sec>
<title>Purpose</title>
<p>This study developed a consensus among participating Canadian occupational therapists regarding the components of cognitive competence they considered essential to predict occupational competence in people with dementia.</p>
</sec>
<sec>
<title>Method</title>
<p>A three-round Delphi study was completed with English- and French-speaking occupational therapists (<italic>n</italic> = 127; 116; 125) experienced in dementia care.</p>
</sec>
<sec>
<title>Findings</title>
<p>Ten cognitive components were identified as essential to predict occupational competence in individuals with dementia.</p>
</sec>
<sec>
<title>Implications</title>
<p>The 10 identified components provide direction for assessment practices and education in dementia care and for development of measurement tools.</p>

<title>Description</title>
<p>Dans le domaine des soins aux personnes atteintes de démence, on demande aux ergothérapeutes de prédire la compétence occupationnelle dans la vie quotidienne, ce qu’ils font souvent en évaluant la compétence cognitive. Compte tenu des changements cognitifs qui se produisent au fil du temps chez une personne atteinte de démence, le construit de la compétence cognitive est un facteur clé à prendre en considération. Pourtant, il existe toujours des lacunes à ce sujet dans la littérature traitant de la relation entre la compétence cognitive et la compétence occupationnelle.</p>

<p>The goal of “aging in place” is increasingly highlighted in social policy and health care; however, aging persons with dementia may face challenges as declining cognition raises questions regarding safety (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0008417413481574">Bertrand, Willis, &amp; Sayer, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0008417413481574">Willis, 1996</xref>). Considering the link between dementia and everyday occupational performance, occupational therapists working in dementia care often assess the impact of cognitive impairment when developing interventions to optimize occupational competence and to inform decisions regarding appropriate living arrangements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0008417413481574">Baum &amp; Katz, 2010</xref>). Although occupation-focused practice would ideally involve assessing occupational performance and competence directly, this is often not feasible within the time, resources, and other constraints of contemporary practice. Thus, this assessment is often accomplished by an evaluation of “cognitive competence,” since cognitive impairments are often assumed to be the primary source of interference with occupational performance and competence for persons with dementia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0008417413481574">Baum &amp; Katz, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0008417413481574">Davidson, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0008417413481574">Molloy, Darzins, &amp; Strang, 1999</xref>). To advance the evidence base for approaches to assessment used by occupational therapists in dementia care, it is critical to identify the components of cognitive competence that are most important to inform predictions of occupational competence.</p>
<p>Occupational competence encompasses the ability to choose, organize, develop, and perform meaningful occupations to be competent within a particular environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0008417413481574">Polatajko, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0008417413481574">Polatajko et al., 2007</xref>). Within dementia care, concerns often focus on the occupational competence of persons with dementia within their living environment. The practice of assessing cognitive competence to predict occupational competence rests on the assumption that there is a relationship between these two constructs. Exploring the evidence for a relationship between cognitive competence and occupational competence is complicated, as there are numerous ways to conceptualize and assess cognitive competence and related cognitive constructs. At a broad level, cognition has been defined as a process of thought and information processing, including the capacity to acquire and use information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0008417413481574">Sternberg, 1999</xref>). Linking cognition to occupational competence, the psychology literature describes everyday cognition as the cognitive domains underlying competent performance of tasks for everyday living (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0008417413481574">Burgess et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0008417413481574">Poon, Welke, &amp; Dudley, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0008417413481574">Winograd, 1993</xref>). Various definitions of cognitive competence exist (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0008417413481574">Allaire &amp; Willis, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0008417413481574">Cooney, Kennedy, Hawkins, &amp; Hurme, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0008417413481574">Kuther, 1999</xref>), with no universal consensus on the best definition. A definition offered by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0008417413481574">Molloy et al. (1999</xref>) was used to inform this study because of its emphasis on everyday living. These authors describe cognitive competence as the ability to execute those cognitive components that are essential for decision making in everyday living, and they distinguish between the “practical aspects” of everyday living and the “cognitive aspects of decision-making” of everyday living (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0008417413481574">Molloy et al., 1999</xref>, p. 49).</p>
<p>Given the multidimensional nature of cognitive competence, evidence regarding the specific dimensions most predictive of occupational competence could enhance occupational therapy assessment practices in dementia care. However, consensus on the components of cognitive competence that are most predictive of functioning in everyday living has not yet clearly been achieved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0008417413481574">Royall et al., 2007</xref>). As well, despite acknowledgement of the complexity of everyday function, few investigations have focused on the extent to which impairments in cognition or cognitive competence translate to difficulties in performing necessary and meaningful activities in everyday-life contexts as experienced in nonclinical settings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0008417413481574">Cullum et al., 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>At a broad level, a relationship between cognition and occupational competence has been demonstrated by several studies conducted with older adults with and without a diagnosis of dementia (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0008417413481574">Cullum et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0008417413481574">Diehl et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0008417413481574">Williams et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0008417413481574">Zanetti, Frisoni, Rozzini, Bianchetti, &amp; Trabucchi, 1998</xref>). For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0008417413481574">Laks et al. (2005</xref>) determined that impairment in function, as measured by a questionnaire assessing activities of daily living among community-dwelling elderly persons, served as a more reliable indicator for dementia in populations with low education than did tests of cognition alone, such as the Mini Mental State Exam. A study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0008417413481574">Farias, Harrell, Neumann, and Houtz (2003</xref>) conducted with 42 people with Alzheimer’s disease found that neuropsychological test performance was moderately predictive of functional status. They used a performance-based scale of activities of daily living and a caregiver-/informant-based rating scale of instrumental activities of daily living. Even though these studies often assess function in ways that do not fully capture the complexity of occupational competence (e.g., often looking at performance in a few isolated tasks of activities of daily living), they do offer some empirical support for the presumed relationship between measures related to cognitive competence with measures related to occupational competence. However, although the measures of performance used may correlate with the capacity of a person to perform a particular task, they do not address the likelihood that the person will actually carry out the task in the home environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0008417413481574">Farias et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0008417413481574">Thornton, Deria, Gelb, Shapiro, &amp; Hill, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>The everyday-cognition literature, which focuses on the study of cognition in an everyday context, examines the cognitive skills necessary for everyday living in several ways that can contribute to our understanding of cognitive competence as it relates to occupational competence. For example, problem solving, working memory, and inductive reasoning have been examined as cognitive skills that contribute to everyday function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0008417413481574">Allaire &amp; Marsiske, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0008417413481574">Diehl, Willis, &amp; Schaie, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0008417413481574">Marsiske &amp; Willis, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0008417413481574">Royall et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0008417413481574">Willis, 1996</xref>). Other studies have focused on more global cognitive constructs, such as speed of processing, episodic memory, and verbal abilities, as predictors of everyday problem-solving ability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0008417413481574">Burton, Strauss, Hultsch, &amp; Hunter, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0008417413481574">Patrick, Perugini, &amp; Leclerc, 2002</xref>). However, in their systematic review for the Committee on Research of the American Neuropsychiatric Association, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0008417413481574">Royall et al. (2007</xref>) concluded that although the prediction of functional capacity based on cognitive test performance is an important issue, they admitted that there has been relatively little empirical study of the specific cognitive correlates of functional outcomes. These authors stated, “It appears that the psychometric prediction of functional outcomes could be improved by increased attention to the specific cognitive domains that are most strongly associated with disability and a more parsimonious use of cognitive measures to achieve that goal” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0008417413481574">Royall et al., 2007</xref>, p. 257). However, to date, the proportion of variance in functional outcomes accounted for by cognitive tests is limited, and thus the evidence base for the link between occupational competence and results of cognitive testing requires further attention. Their recommendations include better integration of the cognitive and functional literature to enhance assessments and develop better measures.</p>
<p>The everyday-cognition literature provides support for the link between components of cognition and occupational competence, and the use of performance-based measures of everyday function is beginning to gain popularity in this field (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0008417413481574">Goldberg et al., 2010</xref>). Some of the everyday-cognition research with older adults has focused directly on the objective measurement of the behavioural performance of everyday task performance, such as telephone use or medication management (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0008417413481574">Barberger-Gateau et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0008417413481574">Laks et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0008417413481574">Lawton &amp; Brody, 1969</xref>), and some have focused on measures of problem-solving abilities. However, this literature shows substantial heterogeneity with regard to the domains of function addressed and measurement approaches used. In addition, traditional paper-and-pencil measures and interview-based simulations of everyday problems with limited ecological validity are typically used. This variability in what domains of function are measured and limitations in how function is measured, as well as lack of agreement among findings, have all contributed to a lack of consensus regarding specific aspects of cognitive competence that are most predictive of occupational competence. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0008417413481574">Marsiske and Willis (1995</xref>) compared three different instruments that were purported to measure everyday problem-solving abilities in older adults. These three measures, which had high face validity for everyday life, were relatively unrelated to each other. Although they all were concerned with measuring the same thing, they assessed different aspects of everyday problem solving. The findings of this study highlighted the concept of everyday problem solving as a multidimensional construct, reflecting the multidimensionality of the performance of everyday occupations.</p>
<p>In summary, existing literature that attempts to address how aspects of cognition and cognitive competence relate to everyday function has not yet captured the contextually specific and dynamic nature of occupational competence, nor has it clearly identified which components of cognitive competence are most essential to predict occupational competence. As consensus regarding the answer to this question has not been achieved in the literature, this study aimed to draw from the tacit knowledge and expertise of occupational therapy clinicians to address this issue in a new way and provide future directions for practice, research, and education. The value of tacit knowledge, gained through clinical experience, has been supported by authors such as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0008417413481574">Thornton (2006</xref>), who argues that best practice rests on a body of tacit knowledge that forms a foundation of good clinical judgement and integrates research, expertise, and values. The importance of tacit knowledge is that it is contextual, and given the complexity of occupational competence, this seems to be key. Although acknowledging that tacit knowledge, as any form of knowledge, should be subjected to critical examination, this study aimed to provide an initial framework to inform future efforts to build the required evidence for practice. The objective was to determine a consensus opinion among participating Canadian occupational therapists regarding the components of cognitive competence that are essential to predict occupational competence in persons with dementia.</p>

<title>Method</title>
<p>Consistent with its origins from the Oracle of Delphi, Delphi methodology was developed in the 1960s as a structured, interactive method of forecasting that relied on a panel of experts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0008417413481574">Linstone &amp; Turoff, 1975</xref>). Delphi methodology involves a multistage process where the results of a series of questionnaires or rounds generate a higher level of agreement until opinions are refined or consensus is reached (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0008417413481574">Cook, Brismée, Fleming, &amp; Sizer, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0008417413481574">Couper, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0008417413481574">Sumsion, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0008417413481574">Yousef, 2007</xref>). This methodology provided a framework for using the tacit knowledge of experienced occupational therapists to identify a consensus of opinion regarding the essential components of cognitive competence required to predict occupational competence in persons with dementia.</p>

<sec id="section2-0008417413481574">
<title>Overview of Study Procedure</title>
<p>Three rounds of surveys were administered using Survey Monkey, a web-based survey tool (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0008417413481574">SurveyMonkey.com, 2012</xref>). Surveys were available in English and in French. French translation was completed with the assistance of both a French-speaking occupational therapist and a speech-language pathologist. This translation was validated with the use of forward and back translation. Participants were asked to identify, and subsequently rank, the essential components of cognitive competence in persons with dementia to predict or determine occupational competence. The study was approved by the Health Sciences Research Ethics Board at the University of Western Ontario.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0008417413481574">
<title>Participants</title>
<p>In a Delphi study, “expert” participants should be knowledgeable about the topic and associated with the disciplinary areas of expertise required by the specific issue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0008417413481574">Hsu, 2007</xref>). There is debate, however, about the use of the term <italic>expert</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0008417413481574">Hasson, Keeney, &amp; McKenna, 2000</xref>). It can be argued that if the question being investigated relates to clinical intervention, then clinicians practicing in that field are the experts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0008417413481574">Jones &amp; Hunter, 2000</xref>). However, there are no formal designations of expert within the profession of occupational therapy in Canada. In the absence of professional guidelines, the literature suggests establishing key competencies and emphasizing experience (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0008417413481574">Hoening et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0008417413481574">Marshall &amp; Luffingham, 1998</xref>). To determine a minimum level of expertise for inclusion in the study, it was decided to draw from requirements for an advanced occupational therapy practitioner. Job descriptions, available at the time, for advanced clinical practitioners were drawn from the Canadian Arthritis Society and the Hospital for Sick Children, which required 2 and 3 years of experience in a specific field of practice, respectively. For the purpose of this study, occupational therapists with a minimum of 2 years of experience working with people with dementia within the past 10 years were considered to be expert.</p>
<p>The primary source for recruitment was the Canadian Association of Occupational Therapists (CAOT) by way of electronic newsletter and a subsequent e-mail to those who agreed to participate. At the time of recruitment, the most recent CAOT membership survey indicated there were 792 members (19% of membership) who indicated that the primary age group they worked with was seniors older than the age of 65. Five hundred and ninety-six members (14%) worked within the area of cognition, and 115 (2%) worked specifically within dementia care (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0008417413481574">CAOT, 2009</xref>). Recruitment advertisements were also placed in all provincial and territorial occupational therapy association electronic newsletters.</p>
<p>The sample size varied across the three rounds but remained larger than suggested adequate sample sizes for Delphi methodology. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0008417413481574">Hsu (2007</xref>) states that there is no exact criteria concerning selection of participants and reported that the majority of Delphi studies use between 15 and 20 respondents. In the present study, 127 therapists responded to Round 1, 116 responded to Round 2, and 125 responded to Round 3. The retention rate was evaluated against the total number of therapists who responded to Round 1, resulting in a retention rate of 91.3% for Round 2 and 99.2% for Round 3. Complicating these retention rate statistics, a small number of individuals completed Round 2 or 3 without completing one or more of the preceding rounds, but in total, 95 therapists consistently completed all three rounds. All responses were included in the analysis, within the round(s) to which participants responded, as the goal was to generate a consensus of opinion. Participants by province, derived from Round 1 data, can be seen in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0008417413481574">Table 1</xref>. Since not all occupational therapists practicing in Canada are CAOT members, it was difficult to estimate the study response rate. As provincial organizations were used in the solicitation of occupational therapists from across Canada, it was reasonable to estimate the potential pool of participants using the Canada-wide occupational therapy population of 13,122 in 2009 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0008417413481574">Canadian Institute for Health Information, Health Human Resources, 2009</xref>). Based on the 2008-2009 CAOT membership statistics, 2% of occupational therapists worked in dementia care, suggesting that 262 occupational therapists could be eligible (CAOT, 2009). Thus, Round 1 sampled (conservatively) 48.4% of the target population, which is considered to be a robust sample size, as this is greater than the expected response rate of 30% for electronic surveys (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0008417413481574">Bowling et al., 2006</xref>).</p>

<p>Descriptive data were obtained for the sample in the first round regarding years of experience, recency of experience, and place of work (community, hospital, long-term care facility). Years of working experience among this group of therapists ranged from 2 years to 40 (<italic>n</italic> = 116, <italic>M</italic> = 10.81, <italic>SD</italic> = 7.30). At the time the survey was completed, 71.3% of the sample (<italic>n</italic> = 116) was working in the field of dementia. Most therapists worked either in the hospital or the community as compared with long-term care, but many worked in more than one location. One hundred and seventeen therapists were trained in Canada, 9 were trained outside of Canada, and 1 did not indicate place of training.</p>

<title>Data Collection</title>
<p>Participation in the electronic survey required basic computer literacy. Those participants who did not wish to use SurveyMonkey had the option of communicating directly with the researcher via e-mail or could receive and complete the survey by fax or post. One participant returned the surveys by fax.</p>
<sec id="section5-0008417413481574">
<title>Round 1</title>
<p>The primary purpose of Round 1 was to generate items for inclusion in the consensus process. Therapists were given definitions of cognitive competence and occupational competence from which to work. Cognitive competence was defined as the ability to execute those cognitive components that are essential for the occupations of everyday living. Occupational competence was defined as the ability to perform those everyday occupations competently and, in the context of dementia care, safely. An open-ended question was used to generate a large pool of items from participants’ perspectives, which was then presented for ranking in subsequent rounds. Participants were asked, “Please list all the components of cognitive competence that you think are essential to predict occupational competence in persons with dementia.”</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0008417413481574">
<title>Round 2</title>
<p>The purpose of Round 2 was to generate a convergence of opinion regarding the importance of components of cognitive competence. Participants were provided with a list of the components generated from Round 1 and were asked, “Please indicate how important you think each of the following components of cognitive competence is to the prediction of occupational competence in persons with dementia.” A 4-point Likert-type scale was used to elicit an opinion and force a decision as there was no neutral option. Categories on the Likert-type scale were <italic>very important</italic>, <italic>important</italic>, <italic>not important</italic>, and <italic>not at all important</italic>.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-0008417413481574">
<title>Round 3</title>
<p>Round 3 worked toward building further consensus. Using the same 4-point Likert-type scale, therapists were asked, “Please indicate how important YOU think each of the following components of cognitive competence is to predict occupational competence in persons with dementia, considering the group’s responses.” Participants were provided with a summary of the group’s ratings for each component that resulted from the analysis of Round 2 data and were given a chance to review or revise their ratings, in comparison to the group’s responses, without bias or losing face, thus increasing honesty (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0008417413481574">Hammell, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0008417413481574">Sumsion, 1998</xref>).</p>

<title>Data Analysis</title>
<p>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0008417413481574">Sumsion (1998</xref>) recommends that a decision be made regarding how consensus will be determined before the rounds are sent out. Consistent with Delphi methodological literature, which suggests consensus is achieved when 50% to 70% of respondents are in agreement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0008417413481574">Hammell, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0008417413481574">Hasson, Keeney, &amp; McKenna, 2000</xref>), an agreement threshold of 60% was set for this study so that items ranked as important by at least 60% of the sample would be included in the final consensus statement. The data analysis and interpretation processes were informed by an interdisciplinary advisory team composed of (a) an occupational therapist with qualitative research experience, (b) a psychologist experienced in the field of measurement, (c) a psychologist experienced in cognitive psychology, and (d) a geriatrician. In addition, a senior occupational therapist experienced in dementia care assisted in the analysis of Round 1 data to ensure relevancy of terminology to current practice.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-0008417413481574">
<title>Round 1</title>
<p>French responses to the open-ended questions in Round 1 were translated and then combined with the English responses. A working group was created consisting of the author, a senior occupational therapist experienced in working with persons with dementia, and an occupational therapist with qualitative analysis experience. The working group members independently coded the responses identified and grouped individual responses into categories on the basis of similarities in relation to the cognitive component it represented. Groupings and category names were then shared and discussed by the working group. Responses that were not initially seen as similar by the raters were discussed until 100% consensus of agreement was reached regarding their assignment to a component category. For example, the working group came to a consensus that individual responses, such as “time sense” and “temporal awareness,” were similar to the category “orientation to time,” and thus they were all grouped together. As a data management strategy, a decision rule was created whereby components identified by at least 5% of the participants were included for distribution in Round 2.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-0008417413481574">
<title>Rounds 2 and 3</title>
<p>Raw scores of English and French responses were combined. Percentages were calculated for each response category on the Likert-type scales and were analyzed by frequency of ratings. In addition, to explore any relationships between cognitive components ranked for importance and demographic variables, we computed bivariate correlations between the cognitive components as rated on Round 2 and experience, age, and location of practice collected in Round 1. There were no differences in ranked responses of French- and English-speaking therapists with regard to rankings of importance other than “planning,” whereby 56% English-speaking participants ranked it as important, compared to 59.3% French-speaking participants who ranked it as very important.</p>

<title>Findings</title>
<sec id="section12-0008417413481574">
<title>Round 1</title>
<p>Forty-five different components of cognitive competence were identified through the analysis of the open-ended responses with 35 components identified by at least 5% of the participants (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0008417413481574">Table 2</xref>). The categories of “orientation” and “memory” were parsed as more explicit types of memory were identified by the analysis. This situation was also the case for communication and self-awareness.</p>

<title>Round 3</title>
<p>Consensus was achieved using the 60% rule as determined at the outset of the study; however, <italic>all</italic> 35 cognitive components had 60% agreement of being important or very important. Since using such a large number of cognitive components would make a consensus statement cumbersome and less meaningful, it was decided to include only those components that were identified by 60% of therapists as being very important in Round 3 (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0008417413481574">Table 4</xref>). Using this criterion answered the research question more directly, which was to identify the components of cognitive competence that are <italic>essential </italic>to predict occupational competence in persons with dementia. Ten cognitive components were identified: attention, awareness, comprehension, initiation, insight into abilities, judgment, working memory, problem solving, safety awareness, and sequencing. On the basis of a review of the responses to the open-ended question posed in Round 1 of the Delphi, the “awareness” responses were interpreted to relate to awareness of the environment. Executive function was eliminated since the advisory committee agreed by consensus that all of the other components could be considered components of executive function. The last column, “not at all important,” was also eliminated in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0008417413481574">Table 4</xref>, as there was only one response for processing speed.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Occupational therapists in this study generated a consensus of opinion on the cognitive components essential to predict occupational competence in individuals with dementia.</p>
<p>The components of cognitive competence identified can be considered to be executive functions, similar to propositions in the neuropsychological literature that emphasize the centrality of executive function to everyday cognition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0008417413481574">Bell-McGuinty, Podell, Franzen, Baird, &amp; Williams, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0008417413481574">Burgess et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0008417413481574">Manchester, Priestley, &amp; Jackson, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0008417413481574">Royall, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0008417413481574">Salthouse, 2005</xref>). At face value, beyond their relation to executive function, it appeared that the 10 components identified fit into two larger groups: cognitive (e.g., problem solving, sequencing) and awareness (e.g., judgment, insight).</p>
<p>The identified components were further interpreted in relation to recent neuropsychological models to conceptualize how these components might reflect broader cognitive constructs. Several models were considered, such as naturalistic actions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0008417413481574">Giovannetti, Libon, Buxbaum, &amp; Schwartz, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0008417413481574">Schwartz, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0008417413481574">Schwartz, Segal, Veramonti, Ferraro, &amp; Buxbaum, 2002</xref>), and everyday problem solving (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0008417413481574">Farias et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0008417413481574">Marsiske &amp; Willis, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0008417413481574">Willis et al., 1998</xref>). It was concluded from this comparative process that the work of Stuss and colleagues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0008417413481574">Stuss, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0008417413481574">Stuss &amp; Alexander, 2000</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0008417413481574">2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0008417413481574">Stuss et al., 2002</xref>) on frontal lobe executive function provided a particularly useful framework to consider the components identified by occupational therapists in this study.</p>
<p>Executive functions are considered to be higher-order cognitive functions of the frontal lobes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0008417413481574">Aron, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0008417413481574">Godefroy, 2003</xref>). One of the most important roles of the frontal lobes may be for affective responsiveness, self-awareness, and consciousness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0008417413481574">Stuss &amp; Alexander, 2000</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0008417413481574">Stuss and Alexander (2007</xref>) contended that although it may be the interaction of emotional status and cognition that determines many behaviours, “it is the cognitive aspect of tasks that are defined by executive functions” (p. 902). This statement supports the findings of this study, as the components identified as indicators of cognitive competence are considered to be executive functions and focus on the cognitive aspects of tasks of everyday living.</p>
<p>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0008417413481574">Stuss and Alexander (2000</xref>) described executive functions as strategic processes necessary to complete tasks. More specifically, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0008417413481574">Stuss (2007</xref>) described executive cognitive functions as “high-level cognitive functions that are involved in the control and direction (e.g., planning, monitoring, energizing, switching, inhibiting) of lower level, more automatic functions” (p. 293). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0008417413481574">Stuss (2007</xref>) explained that the frontal lobes are not domain specific or anatomically tied to behaviours, as once thought, but form two major functional divisions: executive-cognitive and behavioural-emotional self-regulatory functions. Within the executive-cognitive division are task-setting and monitoring components. Two other functional domains are also described: energization regulating and metacognitive or higher-order integrative functions. Behavioural-emotional self-regulation is required in situations where analysis by cognition, habit, or environmental cues is not sufficient for the most adaptive response. Disorders of energization include apathy and an inability to act or make decisions, both of which can have an important impact on self-regulation. The fourth category is related to the metacognitive aspects of human nature that integrate social cognition and self-awareness, wherein “self-awareness implies a metacognitive representation of one’s own mental states, beliefs, attitudes, and experiences” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0008417413481574">Stuss, 2007</xref>, p. 298).</p>
<p>Comparing this model to the cognitive components identified in the consensus statement, it is interesting to see that the 10 essential components identified by the occupational therapists in this study can be grouped according to the proposed executive-cognitive and behavioural-emotional self-regulatory functions as well as in energization and metacognition (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-0008417413481574">Table 5</xref>). Thus, the consensus of the occupational therapists in this study is supported by this neuropsychological theoretical conceptualization of executive functions. In addition, Stuss’s (2006) description of frontal lobe function as “adaptability” rather than being domain-specific can help provide a framework to consider the dynamic, complex ways executive function components interact to enable occupational competence. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0008417413481574">Stuss (2006</xref>) described this adaptability as the fluid recruitment of different processes under different task demands. This concept is important to consider as occupational therapists work to gain an understanding of the cognitive components underlying occupational competence. The ability to deconstruct everyday occupations could improve the ability to assess those cognitive components required for competence in maintaining safe, meaningful everyday occupations that are so often compromised in persons with dementia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0008417413481574">Farias et al., 2003</xref>). A complex construct, such as cognitive competence, likely involves multiple processes that interact and interconnect to form a network that contributes to occupational competence, rather than a unitary localized process. The assessment challenge is to try to differentiate these components to consider indicators that can be predictive of occupational competence.</p>

<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0008417413481574">Stuss (2007</xref>) described executive functions as strategic processes necessary to complete tasks, categorizing them into four functional domains.

<title>Strengths and Limitations</title>
<p>The Delphi methodology proved to be a useful strategy for gathering a consensus of opinion from experienced clinicians on the topic of cognitive competence using their knowledge developed through their clinical experience. It also created an avenue for knowledge creation and exchange among participants, as responses of the entire group were provided in Rounds 2 and 3. As in all studies, sample characteristics, including the number and representativeness of participants, affect external validity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0008417413481574">Bowling et al., 2006</xref>). However, the Delphi methodology focuses more on expertise than representativeness. The inclusion criteria ensured respondents were knowledgeable and current in the practice of dementia care. Although responses were requested from all provinces and territories to ensure inclusion from diverse regions of the country, no responses were received from three, and most participants were from Ontario and Québec.</p>
<p>This study was not able to address two major criticisms of the literature addressing the relationship between aspects of cognition and functional performance. First, although this study highlights the complexity of components of cognition related to function as based in the tacit knowledge of occupational therapists particularly addressing what appears to be executive function, it does not address the need for functional assessments that capture the complexity of occupational competence. Second, the capacity to capture ability versus actual performance has not been addressed. Future research focused on devising assessment approaches that capture the complexity of occupational competence and both ability and performance are required to advance occupational therapy practice in this area.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>This study presents a preliminary framework of the cognitive components required to assess cognitive competence as a predictor of occupational competence in persons with dementia. This framework, grounded in the tacit knowledge of occupational therapists, can inform clinicians within their practice as well as curriculum for the education of future students. It provides a way forward to enhance evidence-based occupational therapy assessment in dementia care by providing a guide for selection of existing tools and informing the development of ecologically valid standardized measures. Future research could build on this work by deconstructing everyday occupations to provide further evidence of the components of cognitive competence essential for occupational competence.</p>
