<p>The Cudlipp Award, presented by the <italic>British Journalism Review</italic> at the Press Awards to the best popular campaign or investigation in any national UK newspaper, was won this year by the <italic>Daily Mirror</italic> for its two-decade campaign to clear Liverpool fans of culpability for the Hillsbrough stadium football disaster. The judges were unanimous in selecting the campaign, which culminated in “superb, dramatic and moving coverage of the report that exonerated the fans and revealed a police cover-up”. They said the vivid prose of <italic>Mirror</italic> writer Brian Reade over the years was greatly influential in their decision.</p>
<p>The award was presented to Brian Reade at the Lancaster London Hotel in March. He said: “I've been on this story for 24 years and I just think it's overwhelming that it's finally been recognised by national newspapers. This story has had so many years in the wilderness and the <italic>Daily Mirror</italic> kept it going since 1989. Ultimately I'd love to dedicate this award to the families that never stopped believing they'd get justice. This is down to mothers' love.”</p>
<p>Reade led the campaign for the families of the Hillsborough disaster victims, which resulted in the death of 96 Liverpool fans in April, 1989. The <italic>Mirror</italic> stood by the families and fought for an apology from the government – which was delivered by Prime Minister David Cameron last year.</p>
<p>There was a record number of entries for the Cudlipp Award and the judges said it was difficult to whittle them down to a shortlist of six. They were particularly impressed by the <italic>Daily Mail's</italic> long and ultimately successful campaign to prevent the extradition of the Asperger's victim Gary McKinnon, accused by the United States of hacking into NASA and Pentagon computers. They also praised the prompt and enterprising campaign launched by the <italic>Sunday Post</italic> to expose the unethical business practices of a puzzle promoter, despite the firm being a major advertiser in the paper. Both these entries were highly commended.</p>
