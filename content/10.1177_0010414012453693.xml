<abstract>
<p>This article examines the legality of homosexual acts quantitatively in a cross-national perspective with a large sample of countries from 1972 to 2002. Employing path dependence as its theoretical framework, this work explains how political, economic, and legal institutions at the domestic and international levels affect the lives of individual citizens. The rights and privileges of individuals, the findings of this study indicate, are determined by a wide array of variables, including legal origin, economic development, religion, democratization, and the position of the nation in the international community. The authors use recently released cross-national data concerning decriminalization of homosexual intercourse, economic conditions, and political institutions. A generalized estimating equation analyzes decriminalization of homosexual acts. A Cox proportional hazards model examines how long it takes to introduce this legal reform. Last, this study also offers some important lessons about civil rights and liberties more generally.</p>

<p>In 1998, while responding to a report on a shooting in a private dwelling, the Houston police entered the apartment of John Lawrence. On entering the residence, the police found Mr. Lawrence, an adult man, engaging in consensual homosexual activity with another adult male by the name of Tyron Garner. Lawrence and Garner were arrested and convicted on charges of violating a legal ban on sodomy in the state of Texas. The state court of appeals upheld the provision, prohibiting two adults of the same sex from engaging in certain sexual acts. The Texas court used a <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0010414012453693">1986</xref> decision of the U.S. Supreme Court, <italic>Bowers v. Hardwick</italic>, as controlling precedent. In <italic>Bowers</italic>, the Court recognized as constitutional prohibitions on same-sex sex, which in some states had been in place for centuries. However, when the U.S. Supreme Court reviewed <italic>Lawrence v. Texas</italic> in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0010414012453693">2003</xref>, the justices handed down a 6–3 decision, not only reversing the decision of the state court but also overruling the decision in <italic>Bowers</italic>. The decision in <italic>Lawrence</italic> legalized consensual same-sex intercourse in the United States. Yet prohibitions against sodomy still exist in 80 nations and territories worldwide. In 7 of those, individuals may pay with their lives for engaging in homosexual activity. This article studies the decriminalization of homosexual activity cross-nationally with a large sample of countries over a period of several decades (1972–2002).</p>
<p>Our key argument is based on legal path dependence. We contend that nations with legal systems based on English common law inherited a prohibition on homosexual acts, which influenced the provision of gay rights—in some cases for centuries to come. For instance, homosexual intercourse became illegal in New Zealand when it became part of the British Empire in 1840. The prohibition against any type of sexual relations between men was expanded later in the 19th century, and it was not until 1986, with the amendment of the Crimes Act and the passage of the Homosexual Law Reform Act, that consensual sex between men over the age of 16 became legal. Other examples include Australia, India,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0010414012453693">1</xref></sup> and Israel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0010414012453693">Frank, Boutcher, &amp; Camp, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0010414012453693">Joseph, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0010414012453693">Sanders, 2009</xref>). Using original data in addition to data drawn from <italic>State-Sponsored Homophobia: A World Survey on Laws Prohibiting Same Sex Activity Between Consenting Adults</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0010414012453693">Ottoson, 2009</xref>) and a variety of other sources, we examine the questions of why, and when, nations decriminalize homosexual acts.</p>
<p>Although there has been some work on the legality of homosexual relations in particular countries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0010414012453693">Healey, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0010414012453693">Schmid, 2000</xref>), particularly within the states of the United States (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0010414012453693">Eskridge, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0010414012453693">Kane, 2003</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0010414012453693">2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0010414012453693">Pinello, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0010414012453693">Robertson, 2006</xref>), and some comparisons between countries in the West (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0010414012453693">Ben-Asher, 1989</xref>; Hensle, 2009; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr80-0010414012453693">West &amp; Green, 1997</xref>), there has been very little cross-national inquiry of the legality of homosexual acts outside of the West (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0010414012453693">Frank et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0010414012453693">Sanders, 2009</xref>). With quantitative research limited to a relatively small number of nations and to cross-sectional snapshots, there also exists a paucity of time-series cross-national quantitative analysis beyond the United States.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0010414012453693">2</xref></sup> Furthermore, the research that does exist is mostly outside of political science and therefore focuses, for instance, on liberalization and its sociological antecedents, such as level of individualization in society (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0010414012453693">Frank, Camp, &amp; Boutcher, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0010414012453693">Frank &amp; McEneaney, 1999</xref>). Instead, here we examine institutional and legal evolution and the political and economic variables that led to changes in law and policy. Unlike work that examines legal trends, such as contractions or expansions in the scope of legal regulation (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0010414012453693">Frank et al., 2010</xref>; Frank &amp; McEnaney, 1997), we examine the actual decriminalization of sodomy. As such, our examination centers on formal laws on the books and their practical implications.</p>
<p>The findings show that some of the key influences on bans on homosexuality are exogenous, not endogenous. Our study indicates that the legality of homosexual acts is determined by a wide array of variables, including the type of legal system,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0010414012453693">3</xref></sup> economic development, religiosity, democratic conditions, and globalization. Although the focus here is the rights of a minority defined by sexual orientation, this study also offers some important lessons about civil rights more generally (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0010414012453693">Haider-Markel &amp; Meier, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0010414012453693">Nownes, 2004</xref>). Legal path dependence explains why a legal ban on homosexual activity exists and how long it endures. Path dependence is not the cause for change. Rather, path dependence means that the system has a tendency by and large to be resistant to change. It is variables such as globalization and modernization that counteract the forces for stability generated by path dependence. Such variables destabilize the legal status quo of path dependence and hence lead to legal change.</p>
<p>This article is important theoretically, but also significant from a policy perspective. In a world where 80 nations and territories criminalize the consensual sexual activities of same-sex adults, and where such activity can, in some instances, lead to the death penalty (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0010414012453693">Ottoson, 2009</xref>), a better understanding of the causes of such criminalization and the factors that lead to the <italic>de</italic>criminalization of homosexual activity is important.</p>
<p>What is more, the legality of homosexual acts is only one piece of the puzzle. It is important to recognize at the outset that countries where homosexual acts are legal are not necessarily places where homosexuals are <italic>treated</italic> equally. For example, fewer than 30 countries offered in 2008 some kind of civil union for same-sex couples (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0010414012453693">Ottoson, 2009</xref>). Legality, hence, is not the ultimate measure of discrimination against sexual minorities. With that in mind, an examination of the legality of homosexual activities is key to developing a better cross-national understanding of rights (of sexual minorities specifically as well as more generally).</p>
<sec id="section1-0010414012453693">
<title>Legal Path Dependence</title>
<p>Path dependence refers to the “dynamics of self-reinforcing . . . processes in a political system” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0010414012453693">Pierson &amp; Skocpol, 2002</xref>, p. 699). This type of process is widespread in politics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0010414012453693">Pierson, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-0010414012453693">Stinchcombe, 1965</xref>). Once certain institutional rules are in place, alternatives forgone in earlier stages of the historical process cease to be available (Shepsle, 1986). Path dependence appears in the evolution of laws and legal systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0010414012453693">North, 1990</xref>) but applies also to a variety of other political phenomena (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0010414012453693">Collier &amp; Collier, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0010414012453693">Ertman, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0010414012453693">Huber &amp; Stephens, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0010414012453693">Kurth, 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0010414012453693">Shefter, 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-0010414012453693">Skocpol, 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-0010414012453693">Skowronek, 1993</xref>).</p>
<p>We argue that legal path dependence is a key to understanding decriminalization of homosexual intercourse cross-nationally. The key to the analysis of homosexual acts is related to the legal system put in place by the state. The “original sin” linked to the criminalization of gay sexual activity is that of the export of the common law system that criminalized buggery in Great Britain in 1533. Common law adopted by other nations (or alternatively imposed on them), in conjunction with subsequent judicial decisions and statutes passed over the centuries, led to criminalization of homosexual acts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0010414012453693">Sanders, 2009</xref>). Conversely, the adoption and “export” of other legal systems, particularly French civil law, did not have this effect, as sodomy was decriminalized immediately following the French Revolution. As a result, countries that were less influenced by British law were much less likely to criminalize same-sex relations.</p>
<p>Two major self-enforcing mechanisms help entrench one legal system over alternative ones. The first is large setup (or fixed) costs. Setting up a new system of law entails costs, which, short of a major event, such as a revolution or occupation by a foreign nation, are prohibitively high. These costs, therefore, considerably diminish the chances of implementing a new system of law. The second mechanism involves adaptive expectations. Once a certain legal system is in place (e.g., after a territory is occupied and colonized), the belief that this system will persist is enhanced (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0010414012453693">North, 1990</xref>). The longer the system persists, the stronger the belief becomes.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0010414012453693">North (1990)</xref> contends that although there are multiple potential equilibria, which means that more than one legal system is possible and the final outcome is uncertain, an equilibrium, even one superior to the status quo (e.g., a superior legal system), may not win adherence. This is so because of the initial advantage of the existing system. Once established, an existing legal system is “locked in” and thus difficult to change. Consequently, increasing returns and significant transaction costs resulting from imperfect markets shape institutional change. Once an equilibrium solution is locked in, evolution happens in a particular path, determined by legal and political institutions. This path dependence is a way “to narrow conceptually the choice and link decision making through time” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0010414012453693">North, 1990</xref>, p. 98).</p>
<p>Path dependence applies to the evolution of law in a variety of ways and common law is a prominent example of such institutional development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0010414012453693">North, 1990</xref>). Largely speaking, path dependence is an impediment for major and dramatic changes in the evolution of law. For instance, one reason why legal systems are hard to change is the interdependence among legal education, case law, judicial selection, and the existence of juries and other major institutions. Thus, it would be difficult to change from a system based primarily on codes to one based on cases. Doing so would require fundamental changes such as reforming legal education and the retraining of magistrates, judges, and justices. Along the same lines, the adoption of a jury system in systems with no juries would require among other changes, a distinction between law and fact, trials that occur on consecutive days, and judges and lawyers trained to deal with juries. Granted, certain laws are not locked in. Speed limits, for example, are not entrenched in the system. In most countries, those limits may be changed easily. However, by its nature, the legal framework of common law has the capacity to lock in laws, particularly if different players have vested interests in those laws. Those vested interests may be economic, moral, religious, or sociopolitical in nature.</p>
<p>The legal framework in common law consists of constitutional provisions, acts of the legislature, and judicial decisions. It is a precedent-based system in which past decisions are integrated into the law; as such, in keeping with stare decisis each case sets a legal precedent. Therefore, the law changes marginally as new cases are decided and a new legal precedent is set, thus becoming part of the legal structure. Judicial decisions “reflect the subjective processing of information in the context of the historical construction of the legal framework” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0010414012453693">North, 1990</xref>, p. 97). The Northwest Ordinance, for instance, passed in 1787 by the Continental Congress, illustrates path dependence and the historically derived continuity it implies. This ordinance is an example for how following the initial adoption of a certain legal framework, the likelihood of change in the law decreases. Furthermore, when there is change, it is gradual rather than abrupt. The ordinance stemmed from preexisting English and colonial provisions and concerned government and settlement of the West and its integration into the new nation. Because of the vested economic and political interests of various parties, for decades to come the political and economic structure in the territories was derived from the framework dictated by the ordinance. Along the same lines, for political, moral, religious, and, in some cases, economic reasons, the legal status of gay marriage or abortion law in the United States is difficult to change.</p>
<p>The legality of homosexual acts in common law systems, we argue, was heavily influenced by path dependence. More specifically, the effect of the English Buggery Act of 1533 on the legal status of sodomy was somewhat similar to the effect of the Northwest Ordinance on American expansion to the West. Legal prohibitions against sodomy were entrenched in English law (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0010414012453693">Rayside, 1992</xref>). Although certain laws prohibiting homosexual acts in the military appeared as early as the 11th century, it was Henry VIII of England who introduced such legislation into English criminal law in the form of the Buggery Act of 1533. The Buggery Act made buggery (referring to an act of sodomy) punishable by death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0010414012453693">Dundes, 2002</xref>). It was not until 1861 that the capital punishment prescribed by the law was removed.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0010414012453693">4</xref></sup> The Sexual Offences Act of 1967 provided limited decriminalization of homosexual acts. The act implemented some of the recommendations in the Wolfenden Report published in 1957.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0010414012453693">5</xref></sup> Thus, it took 10 years of campaigning for only a subset of the recommendations in the report to be etched into law. With processes such as colonization, these prohibitions found their way into other countries with common law systems and, by ways of path dependence, influenced how laws concerning homosexuality and same-sex acts developed in those jurisdictions.</p>
<p>Conversely, in other colonial empires, such as France, same-sex sexual relations have been legal since 1791. The criminal code drafted by the National Constituent Assembly after the French Revolution rejected the definition of crimes based on the proscriptions of the Christian religion. Homosexual acts were thus not mentioned in the new penal code. The Napoleonic Code of 1804 and its subsequent Penal Code of 1810 did not undo the decriminalization of homosexual intercourse.</p>
<p>French civil law was introduced in many countries under French occupation during the Napoleonic Wars. Because of path dependence, this has had extensive influence in Europe and because of colonization, beyond the continent as well (e.g., in many Latin American countries, many of which adopted it voluntarily after the Spanish occupation was over). Notably, path dependence applies to the case of French Code just as well. As provisions prohibiting homosexual acts were absent from the Napoleonic Code of 1804 and the Penal Code of 1810, there was no prohibition on same-sex sex entrenched in the legal system in nations that adopted civil law. Hence, law in civil law jurisdictions developed along a different path. The legal system was lacking a prohibition on sodomy in many civil law countries. Consequently, this equilibrium was locked in. Any attempts to alter the status quo by proposing alternative equilibria, even if superior in certain ways, were unlikely to succeed because of the prohibitively high cost of change once path dependence was set in motion.</p>
<p>Although Great Britain was exporting a legal system that outlawed sodomy, French code (which in various forms was imposed by France, Spain, and the Netherlands on their colonies, or adopted voluntarily by many other states) did not contain such a provision. For centuries to come, its influence on the way legal and political institutions dealt with the issue of homosexual acts was, thus, fundamentally different. As for systems with origins in communist or socialist law, many of these states have gone through a process of democratization in the 1990s. As a part of this process, those states adopted a civil law system. Although some of those states had had antisodomy laws in place, the process of democratization in many cases was followed by decriminalization of gay sexual activity.</p>
<p>A common law system is not the only legal variable to increase the likelihood of antisodomy laws, as some religions proscribe homosexual acts. Establishment of a state religion, or even more so a legal code that stems from religious principles, increases the likelihood that legal proscriptions against homosexual acts would be codified. For example, on May 11, 2001, the Egyptian police arrested 52 men. The group, who later became known as Cairo 52, was aboard the Queen Boat, a floating gay nightclub. Although all 52 pleaded innocent, they stood trial, some of them more than once. They were found guilty of charges ranging from habitual debauchery to contempt for religion. Even in the face of international criticism, the courts carried on with the trials, in a nation where Islam was the state religion.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0010414012453693">6</xref></sup></p>
<p>Based on the principles of the Koran, the central text of Islam, and Hadith, which is the oral traditions determining the Muslim way of life, Islam proscribes homosexual acts. Like in versions of Judaism and Christianity, from its beginning as a religion, Islam rejected homosexual intercourse. Some nations with a Muslim majority but that are relatively secular in nature or multireligious (e.g., Indonesia) do not treat homosexual activity as a crime; as such, there are no prohibitions against it in their legal codes. In some cases (e.g., Turkey), tolerance to homosexual sexual activity has been entrenched in the system for years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0010414012453693">Murray &amp; Roscoe, 1997</xref>). Yet nations in which Islam is the state religion (e.g., Egypt), and in Islamic states where Sharia law and the Koran are the primary sources for legislation, there typically exists a codified prohibition of homosexual activity. Furthermore, in several of those latter states (e.g., Saudi Arabia, Somalia, and Mauritania), death is the prescribed punishment for engaging in such activity.</p>
<p>Taken together, the legal code and state religion create a powerful explanation as to why certain states are less prone to decriminalize sodomy. Because of path dependence, nations with common law systems operate within a legal framework in which homosexual intercourse is a criminal act. Such legal status quo is hard to change because of path dependence. The existing equilibrium is locked in, and thus path dependence impedes change. Likewise, in Islamic law, sodomy is prohibited. In sum, the two key variables standing in the way of change belong to two separate categories. Legal path dependence indicates that a chief influence on the legal code, and in the context of sodomy law in particular, is exogenous. National laws and criminal provisions depend on factors such as colonial experience. The effect of religion, on the other hand, falls into the category of internal factors such as local culture, domestic political institutions, and religious heritage, which influence the likelihood of legal change.</p>
<p>We now turn to those variables that <italic>reduce</italic> the costs associated with changing the legal status quo. As a result, they increase the likelihood that decriminalization would occur. Notably, the catalysts of legal change are not limited to local politics. Some of them are related to external factors and to international institutions, connections, and circumstances. The type of legal system (common law or Islamic Law) had an influence on the evolution of gay rights in the different political systems. However, the effect of this “original sin” was gradually mitigated as nations became more democratic, provided better representation for minorities, and globalized and as their economy developed and they modernized.</p>

<title>Explaining the Legality of Homosexual Acts Cross-Nationally—Literature Review and Hypotheses</title>
<p>To explain prohibitions against homosexual activity, we propose that there are four primary and interrelated factors at play: the type of legal system, the democratic conditions and the political opportunity structure for minority populations, the state of economic development within the country, and the extent to which a country is globalized socially, economically, and politically. We hypothesize that these dynamics jointly influence whether a nation has codified prohibitions on same-sex sexual activity.</p>
<sec id="section3-0010414012453693">
<title>Type of Legal System</title>
<p>Because of path dependence, we expect homosexual bans to be more prevalent in common law countries. Other nations in our data have civil law. Some of them have had this system for centuries. Many of the republics of the former Soviet Union changed their originally communist or socialist systems to civil law on democratization in the 1990s.</p>

<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0010414012453693">Sanders (2009</xref>, pp. 12-15) stresses that much of the prohibitions against homosexual activity in Islamic nations were imported from Western systems of common law. We do not dispute this contention, yet we argue that apart from common law, Islam should have an independent effect.</p>

<title>The State of Economic Development and Modernization</title>
<p>As economic conditions improve, we expect the decriminalization of homosexual activity to be more likely. Political inclusion and political opportunity structures are related to changes in the economic composition of a state. Economic development and modernization thus lead to political inclusion. In a variety of ways, such as through literacy, education, and cultural change, modernization can change the view of who should be accepted in society as equal.

<title>Globalization</title>
<p>Conventional theories of sovereignty have emphasized the nation-state as the guarantor of rights and liberties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0010414012453693">Anderson, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-0010414012453693">Weber, 1919/1994</xref>). Yet some have argued that globalization erodes the nation-state and leads to porous national boundaries in terms of legal arrangements, capital flow, immigration, and a variety of other ways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0010414012453693">Butler &amp; Spivak, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0010414012453693">Grewal, 2005</xref>). Globalization reduces transaction costs across a range of human interactions, opening up new opportunities and exposing social systems to new ways of thinking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0010414012453693">Hollingsworth, 1998</xref>).</p>
<p>In relation to the theoretical framework developed here, information about alternative legal arrangements should be more readily available in a globalized state. Subsequently, it becomes easier to identify alternative legal frameworks and the way civil rights and liberties in general and gay rights in particular are organized in other jurisdictions. Political entrepreneurs, public opinion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0010414012453693">Lax &amp; Phillips, 2009</xref>), political organizations, and social movements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0010414012453693">Barclay, Bernstein, &amp; Marshall, 2009</xref>) are then able to more easily recognize alternative legal arrangements within which to settle gay rights. This in turn increases the likelihood of decriminalization of sodomy. In addition, the world culture and normative diffusion literature argues that the strengthening of links between countries allows for the diffusion of new human rights and norms of tolerance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0010414012453693">Boli &amp; Thomas, 1997</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0010414012453693">1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0010414012453693">Finnemore, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0010414012453693">Meyer, Boli, Thomas, &amp; Ramirez, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0010414012453693">Ramirez &amp; McEneaney, 1997</xref>). Furthermore, literature about the regulation of sexuality worldwide underscores the importance in this context of global trends (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0010414012453693">Frank et al., 2010</xref>).

<title>Legal Change—Analyzing the Risk of Decriminalization</title>
<p>Once our first set of analyses lends support to the notion that legal path dependence means that common law systems are more likely to have sodomy laws on the books and civil law systems are less likely to have such laws, we move on to the examination of legal change. What would be the variables that influence when a nation repeals the law of sodomy? To that end, in a second set of analyses, we limit ourselves to common law nations only. Based on the first set of analyses, we know that those states are more likely to have a prohibition on same-sex sex in the first place. The goal of the second set of analyses is to determine which variables, of the ones developed in our theoretical model, increase the risk of decriminalization.</p>
<p>We expect globalization and economic development to reduce the costs associated with changing the legal status quo related to sodomy. Therefore, with more globalization and with more development and modernization should come increased risk of decriminalization of sodomy. The same may be said for democratic conditions. As the review of the literature and the theory outlined above indicate, democratic conditions should facilitate decriminalization and thus increase the instantaneous risk of repeal. Conversely, with Islam as state religion or in an Islamic state, the risk of decriminalization should decrease.</p>

<title>Data and Method</title>
<p>Data are taken from the May 2009 report of the International Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Intersex Association titled <italic>State-Sponsored Homophobia: A World Survey on Laws Prohibiting Same Sex Activity Between Consenting Adults</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0010414012453693">Ottoson, 2009</xref>) and from the University of Gothenburg Quality of Government Institute’s June 2009 Quality of Government Dataset (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-0010414012453693">Teorell, Charron, Samanni, Holmberg, &amp; Rothstein, 2009</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0010414012453693">7</xref></sup> In our combined Global Sexual Discrimination data set, states are categorized into one of three groups, with a state’s assignment depending on (a) whether consensual homosexual intercourse is legal or illegal within the nation and (b) if legal, in what year legality was attained. These criteria determine the values for our dependent variables (whether same-sex sex was legal in a certain nation-year and the duration it took the nation to decriminalize).</p>
<p>As <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0010414012453693">Table 1</xref> indicates, our first group—91 countries—details nations where consensual homosexual intercourse has been outlawed throughout the nation’s entire existence. Some of the 91 countries in which sodomy was illegal throughout ceased to exist before the end of the period (e.g., East Germany). Indeed, by 2008, in only 80 nations and territories worldwide was sodomy illegal. Our second group depicts states that have <italic>de</italic>criminalized homosexual relations sometime within the past four decades, and the year of legalization; there are 49 such nations in our data. Our third group lists the 63 nations in which consensual homosexual intercourse has been legal since at least 1970.</p>

<p>Many of the countries decriminalizing sodomy since 1970 did so in the 1990s. As <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0010414012453693">Figure 1</xref> demonstrates, between 1970 and 2008, the 1990s was the decade with the most cases of legalization. More than half of the countries in the database that legalized homosexual acts during the time period studied accomplished this legal reform sometime in that decade. A considerable number of the countries legalizing homosexual relations during this period were republics from the former Soviet Union. For instance, in 1998, the year with the greatest number of cases of legalization, three of the six countries legalizing consensual homosexual intercourse were Tajikistan, Kyrgyzstan, and Kazakhstan.</p>

<p>As for our predictors, the common law dummy variable equals 1 for nations with a common law system. The value is 0 otherwise.

To measure the political inclusion of women, we use the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0010414012453693">Inter-Parliamentary Union (2005)</xref> Women in National Parliaments data. We use the data for the legislative body as a whole in unicameral systems, and where there exists more than one legislative chamber, we use only the percentage of women in the upper house.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-0010414012453693">8</xref></sup> To measure <italic>economic development</italic> (and the associated shift toward modernization), GDP per capita in constant U.S. dollars at base year 2000 is used. Missing data were imputed by using the CIA World Factbook (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0010414012453693">Gleditsch, 2002</xref>), and logged GDP values are used for estimation. To measure international connections we use the KOF Index of Globalization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0010414012453693">Dreher, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0010414012453693">Dreher, Gaston, &amp; Martens, 2008</xref>). The indexes for the globalization variables range from 0 to 100. Higher values indicate higher levels of globalization. The overall index of <italic>globalization</italic> is the weighted average of <italic>economic globalization, social globalization</italic>, and <italic>political globalization</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-0010414012453693">Teorell et al., 2009</xref>). The measure for economic globalization is defined as the long distance flow of services, goods, capital, information, and perceptions that accompany market exchanges. This index measures not only actual flows of trade and investments but also trade restrictions, such as tariff rates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0010414012453693">Dreher, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0010414012453693">Dreher et al., 2008</xref>). The index of political globalization is measured by the number of embassies and high commissions in a country, the number of memberships the country has in international organizations, participation in UN peacekeeping missions, and the number of international treaties signed since 1945 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0010414012453693">Dreher, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0010414012453693">Dreher et al., 2008</xref>). Last, the social globalization measure includes three categories of indicators: personal contacts (e.g., telephone traffic and tourism), information flows (e.g., number of Internet users), and cultural proximity (e.g., trade books and number of Ikea warehouses per capita; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0010414012453693">Dreher, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0010414012453693">Dreher et al., 2008</xref>). In line with previous work (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0010414012453693">Frank et al., 2010</xref>), we also control for the region of the world where the nation is located with a series of dummies, with Western nations as the excluded category. Descriptive statistics and a correlation matrix are available in the <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-0010414012453693">appendix</xref>.</p>
<p>The type of legal system in our data is strongly associated with the way homosexual intercourse is treated within the existing legal framework. Indeed, almost 6 out of every 10 countries in which homosexual activity is illegal (the largest group in our data set) have common law systems. Conversely, of the countries in which antisodomy laws were not on the books since at least 1970, more than 80% have civil law as their legal system. In addition to the type of legal system, we also hypothesized that the level of globalization would decrease transaction costs and increase the norms associated with tolerance. According to Hypothesis 7, globalization would increase the likelihood that homosexual acts would be decriminalized. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0010414012453693">Figure 2</xref> lends preliminary support to that contention. On the horizontal axis is the level of globalization, from minimal (left) to maximal. The bottom portion of each column represents the percentage of nations within the corresponding level of globalization in which homosexual acts are legal. As the level of globalization increases, we find the likelihood that homosexual acts are decriminalized to increase. Although 60% of the nations with minimum levels of globalization criminalize homosexual activity, only 11% of those with maximum levels of globalization do so.</p>

<p>We use time-series cross-sectional data, listing all states in the abovementioned data sets for which data are available from 1972 to 2002. To test Hypotheses 1–7, we employ a generalized estimating equation (GEE) model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr82-0010414012453693">Zorn, 2001</xref>). A marginal approach, such as the GEE, is appropriate in this case since we are interested generally in what variables influence decriminalization of homosexual acts, rather than the propensity to do so in a particular nation, for which a conditional approach would suffice (p. 475). Since the dependent variable <italic>legal</italic> is dichotomous (1 = <italic>homosexual acts are legal</italic>, 0 = <italic>homosexual acts are illegal</italic>), and because of the data structure described above, we employ a GEE model with first-order autoregressive component and logit as the link function. We use robust standard errors clustered on the country. Hypotheses 8–11 concern the timing of legal change. In this case, we are interested in estimating the hazard rate, that is, the “risk” that decriminalization would occur at a certain time, given that it had not occurred previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0010414012453693">Allison, 1984</xref>). We thus estimate a Cox proportional hazards model to test the remaining four hypotheses.</p>

<p>What factors influence the likelihood that consensual same-sex sexual acts are legal? <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0010414012453693">Table 2</xref> presents the results of two GEE models. These multivariate analyses corroborate several of our hypotheses. As suggested in Hypotheses 1 and 2, having a common law legal system significantly decreases the likelihood that the nation has decriminalized homosexual acts. Likewise, when Islam is the state religion, or when the state is an Islamic state, same-sex sexual relations are likely to be outlawed. It is important that even when we control for the effect of common law, Islamic law has an independent effect. This finding challenges contentions that antisodomy laws in the Islamic world are a product of Western influence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0010414012453693">Sanders, 2009</xref>).</p>

<p>Our findings also lend support to the component of our theory concerning globalization. Ceteris paribus, nations with high levels of globalization, and particularly those with increased levels of political globalization (Model II), are significantly more likely to decriminalize homosexual activity. What is more, our theoretical contentions concerning economic conditions and modernization win support in the data. As Hypothesis 6 states, as gross domestic product (GDP) per capita increases, a nation is less likely to have antisodomy laws on its books. This finding is highly significant.</p>
<p>Last, we fail to find support for the democratic conditions component of our theory. It is surprising that neither the variable measuring political inclusion of women (percentage of women representatives in the legislature) nor the variable gauging the democratic nature of the polity has a statistically significant effect on the legality of homosexual acts. Hypotheses 4 and 5, therefore, fail to find support in the data. World region controls provide us with little additional information. The only one of the dummy variables for world region, which is significant, is the Eastern Europe variable in Model I. This lends some support to the notion that nations in Eastern Europe are systematically less likely than Western nations (the excluded category) to decriminalize sodomy. This finding, however, largely disappears in Model II and is thus insufficiently robust.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0010414012453693">Table 2</xref> details which factors affect the likelihood of decriminalization of sodomy. To examine the effects of the different predictors, we now turn to examine predicted probabilities. The effects of GDP and Islam as state religion are consistently significant in both models in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0010414012453693">Table 2</xref>. We find that the likelihood of decriminalization in Islamic states where GDP per capita is less than $3,000 is .07. Conversely, when the state is not Islamic and when GDP per capita is greater than $11,000, the probability of decriminalization is approximately 10 times larger. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0010414012453693">Figure 3</xref> demonstrates the critical influence of common law systems. The vertical axis indicates the predicted probability that homosexual intercourse is decriminalized. The three columns on the right indicate the predicted probability of decriminalization at different levels of globalization in common law systems. The corresponding predicted probabilities in countries where the legal system is not based on common law are shown in the columns on the left. As predicted in Hypothesis 1, the probabilities in the columns for nations not based on common law are larger across the board than in common law nations. Moreover, the analysis further substantiates Hypothesis 7 concerning the effect of globalization. As the nation becomes more globalized, the likelihood that homosexual acts will be decriminalized increases considerably. For instance, the likelihood that consensual same-sex intercourse will be decriminalized increases eighteenfold when we compare nations with common law systems and low levels of globalization to globalized nations, whose legal systems are not based on common law.</p>

<title>Analyzing Legal Change</title>
<p>The results of our GEE time-series cross-sectional analyses lend strong support to our key hypothesis—common law nations are less likely to decriminalize. We now turn to examine which variables, within common law nations, influence the timing of decriminalization. To that end we estimate a Cox proportional hazards model.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0010414012453693">Table 3</xref> presents the results of Cox proportional hazards models explaining the risk that a common law nation would legalize same-sex intercourse between consenting adults, given that it had not been done previously. Model II specifies the Islamic state predictor as well. Both models include controls for world regions (not presented in the table). We find statistically significant effects for democratic conditions and Islam. The effect for democracy in the polity is in the anticipated direction and statistically significant. The same is true for the effect of Islamic state or Islam as state religion. Ceteris paribus, a one-unit increase in the democratic conditions predictor increases the instantaneous relative risk of decriminalization of sodomy by 5% to 8%. When state religion is Islam, on the other hand, the risk of legal change drops by 90% compared to non-Islamic states. The effects for globalization and number of women representatives in the nation’s legislature are not significant.</p>

<title>Discussion and Conclusions</title>
<p>In this article, we developed a theory explaining prohibitions on same-sex sexual acts cross-nationally and then tested it empirically. The findings show that some of the key influences on bans on same-sex relations are exogenous. Legal path dependence explains why a legal ban on homosexual activity exists and how long it endures. Colonial heritage, therefore, plays a key role in how legal change of the type studied unfolds. Path dependence is not the cause for change. Rather, path dependence means that the system has a tendency by and large to be resistant to change. It is variables such as globalization and modernization that counteract the force for stability generated by path dependence. Those variables destabilize the legal status quo because of path dependence.</p>
<p>In common law systems, legal prohibitions on homosexual activity find their origins in colonial times. Those prohibitions were entrenched in the system, with vested interests of various types making change unlikely. Thus, because of path dependence, where the legal system originates from English common law, the likelihood of decriminalization decreases considerably. When legal institutions prohibiting homosexual activity are in place from the nation’s founding, the costs associated with changing the legal status quo are high. Likewise, when a state’s legal origin stems from Islam, a religion that prohibits sexual relations between two consenting male adults, the likelihood that homosexual activity is legal decreases.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-0010414012453693">9</xref></sup></p>
<p>Several factors reduce the costs associated with changing the legal status quo and thus increase the likelihood of decriminalization. When the nation is globalized, information concerning alternative legal arrangements is readily available. With economic, social, and political globalization, it is easier for legal institutions to “travel” between jurisdictions and to be imported from other nations. Consequently, in a globalized nation, it may be easier for political entrepreneurs and interest groups to utilize public opinion and work successfully toward legal change (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0010414012453693">Canaday, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0010414012453693">Rimmerman &amp; Wilcox, 2007</xref>). Globalization is another type of exogenous effect on the political phenomenon studied. We also find support for the effect of economic development and the associated process of modernization. When GDP per capita is higher, securing the resources needed to change the path determined by preexisting legal institutions becomes more feasible. Although we find support for three of the four parts of the theory we proposed to explain the legality of consensual same-sex intercourse, the most dramatic effects result from combinations of those predictors. It is the combination of Islamic law and GDP, for instance, that could increase the likelihood of decriminalization tenfold, and it is the combination of common law and globalization that could multiply this likelihood by as much as 18.</p>
<p>Once the results of the time-series cross-sectional analysis substantiated the key role that colonial legacies play for the decriminalization of sodomy, we turned to examine which variables influence the risk that decriminalization takes place. The Cox proportional hazards model was estimated with data from common law systems. The results confirm the hypothesized effects of Islam and democratic conditions. Democratic conditions increase the instantaneous risk that decriminalization would happen, given that it had not happened in the past. Islam has the opposite effect.</p>
<p>The theoretical framework employed in this study focuses on legal development as it is affected by domestic and international institutions, religion, and economic conditions. We do not intend to discount the significance of public opinion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0010414012453693">Brace, Sims-Butler, Arceneaux, &amp; Johnson, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0010414012453693">Haider-Markel &amp; Kaufman, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0010414012453693">Lax &amp; Phillips, 2009</xref>) or the critical role social movements play for gay rights (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0010414012453693">Barclay et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0010414012453693">Cook, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0010414012453693">Pinello, 2003</xref>). In fact, some of the variables we study may be conducive to shifts in public opinion and may result in higher levels of activity of social movements. For instance, in a politically globalized nation, the polity is more likely to be informed of changing global standards with respect to the legality of homosexual activity. Changes in public opinion may follow suit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0010414012453693">Frank et al., 2009</xref>). Along the same lines, economic development may result in more resources made available for campaigns (legal or otherwise) waged by social movements. Barring issues of data availability, we would include control variables for public opinion and for the role of social movements in our models.</p>
<p>Our research provides substantial insight into the factors that contribute to the decriminalization of consensual same-sex relations. In addition, it teaches important lessons about how legal and political institutions develop and change over time, and about how those institutions interact with economic conditions and with global trends to influence the very private lives of individual citizens. The liberty of individuals to engage in the type of sexual activity they desire and the right of members of a group defined by sexual orientation not to be discriminated against are determined by institutional evolution, which in some cases is centuries old. What is more, it is global forces and economic trends well beyond the bedrooms of individual citizens that determine their political rights and liberties.</p>

<p>The Report of the Departmental Committee on Homosexual Offences and Prostitution (better known as the Wolfenden Report) was commissioned by the British government after a series of prominent people were convicted for homosexual behavior.

<p>As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0010414012453693">Ottoson (2009)</xref> indicate, there is no general prohibition on homosexual acts in the Egyptian Penal Code.
