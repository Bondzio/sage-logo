<abstract>
<p>This study examines conflict among heterosexual mixed-weight (i.e., one overweight and one healthy weight partner) and matched-weight couples (<italic>N</italic> = 43 couples). Participant sex, eating together, partner health support, and negative partner influence were examined as moderators of the association between weight status and conflict. Using dyadic models, we found that mixed-weight couples, specifically couples including overweight women and healthy weight men, reported greater conflict both generally and on a daily basis, compared to matched-weight couples; however, general conflict was reduced with greater perceived support from the partner. Mixed-weight couples who reported eating together more frequently also reported greater general conflict. These findings suggest that mixed-weight couples may experience more conflict than matched-weight couples, but perceived support from the partner can buffer this conflict. This research suggests that interpersonal dynamics associated with mixed-weight status might be important for romantic partners’ relational and personal health.</p>

<body>
<p>The prevalence of overweight and obese adults continues to grow in the United States, with 68% of adults being categorized as overweight or obese (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0265407512451199">Flegal, Carroll, Ogden, &amp; Curtin, 2010</xref>). These overweight and obese individuals are more likely to experience health conditions such as diabetes, sleep apnea, and cardiovascular diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0265407512451199">Poirier et al., 2006</xref>), making weight a significant health issue. It seems reasonable to assume that for some of these overweight individuals, dealing with health problems associated with obesity and managing or losing weight is a constant struggle. Because relationship partners are likely affected by each other’s health habits, weight concerns and related struggles may be a source of conflict between partners (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0265407512451199">Ledyard &amp; Morrison, 2008</xref>), especially among mixed-weight couples (i.e., one partner is overweight and one partner is healthy weight).</p>
<p>Research on relationship quality among mixed-weight couples suggests that relationship satisfaction is lower for both men and women when the female partner has a higher body mass index (BMI) than the male partner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0265407512451199">Meltzer, McNulty, Novak, Butler, &amp; Karney, 2011</xref>). That is, being an overweight woman in a relationship with a healthy weight man might be associated with more negative relationship consequences (e.g., relational conflict) than being an overweight man in a relationship with a healthy weight woman, or being similar in weight to one’s partner. Understanding relational conflict in mixed-weight couples is important given the adverse health consequences stemming from women’s perceptions of poor relationship quality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0265407512451199">Kiecolt-Glaser &amp; Newton, 2001</xref>). For overweight women, being in a troubled relationship might be especially deleterious, given that poor relationship quality, or conflict, could compound existing weight-related health problems. In order to more comprehensively understand relationship quality among mixed-weight couples, the present study focuses on previously understudied relationship processes (e.g., eating behaviors, partner health support, and negative partner influence), and their association with weight status and conflict in romantic relationships. </p>

<title>Relationship quality among mixed-weight couples</title>
<p>Although weight has been a growing focus in the field of relationship research, much of the literature addresses relational partners’ body image (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0265407512451199">Boyes &amp; Latner, 2009</xref>) or the influence of one’s own BMI on relationship outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0265407512451199">Sheets &amp; Ajmere, 2005</xref>) instead of assessing relationship implications stemming from weight differences among partners (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0265407512451199">Meltzer et al., 2011</xref>). Some research indicates that conflict occurs between partners when individuals are struggling with their weight or weight loss (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0265407512451199">Hafner, Rogers, &amp; Watts, 1990</xref>), suggesting the need to examine the associations between conflict and weight in couples. In addition to the negative association between conflict and relationship satisfaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0265407512451199">Noller, Feeney, Bonnell, &amp; Callan, 1994</xref>), negative interactions, including conflict and strain from the partner, are associated with greater health problems (e.g., asthma, blood pressure, diabetes; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0265407512451199">Walen &amp; Lachman, 2000</xref>) and can also be harmful to individuals’ psychological well-being (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0265407512451199">Lincoln, 2000</xref>). Specifically, conflict can contribute to depressive symptomology among spouses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0265407512451199">Choi &amp; Marks, 2008</xref>), and is sometimes associated with greater relational negativity and divorce potential and less positive connection in relationships (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0265407512451199">Stanley, Markman, &amp; Whitton, 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>Although the literature on relational implications stemming from couples’ weight status is somewhat limited, the extant research suggests that women’s weight is a salient component of relationship quality. Research in this area indicates that women with lower BMIs report greater marital harmony (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0265407512451199">Markey, Birch, &amp; Markey, 2001</xref>), but women with higher BMIs report less marital quality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0265407512451199">Boyes &amp; Latner, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0265407512451199">Markey et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0265407512451199">Sheets &amp; Ajmere, 2005</xref>) and also report that their relationships are more likely to end (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0265407512451199">Boyes &amp; Latner, 2009</xref>). Heavier women might report lower relationship quality as a function of their perceived negative evaluations from their partners. When women perceive a negative evaluation about their body from their spouse (e.g., spouse’s comments) they report greater body dissatisfaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0265407512451199">Pole, Crowther, &amp; Schell, 2004</xref>) and sometimes employ unhealthy behaviors (e.g., bingeing) as a coping response to these negative feelings. One study found that in an attempt to please their male partners, overweight women suppressed their emotions, which was associated with a reduction in their partners’ negative feelings about them; however, these women also ate more on days that they reported suppressing their emotions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0265407512451199">Butler, Young, &amp; Randall, 2010</xref>). Thus, these women were caught in a double bind whereby they either expressed their emotions and received more negative evaluations from the partner, or they chose to suppress their emotions and their partner’s negative feelings were reduced. Unfortunately, both of these scenarios could contribute to their own and their partner’s perceived relational conflict.</p>
<p>In concordance with previous research on weight in relationships, which suggests that thinner women are more satisfied in relationships (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0265407512451199">Markey et al., 2001</xref>) and men are more satisfied with thinner female partners (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0265407512451199">Meltzer et al., 2011</xref>), we first hypothesize that:</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>H1: The association between mixed-weight status and conflict will be moderated by sex, such that couples including an overweight woman and a healthy weight man will report greater relationship conflict than matched-weight couples or couples with an overweight male partner and healthy weight female partner.<sup>

<title>Eating behaviors in mixed-weight couples</title>
<p>Romantic partners have the potential to influence each other’s health behaviors, including diet and exercise (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0265407512451199">Craig &amp; Truswell, 1990</xref>). Indeed, some research indicates that eating habits converge among relational partners. For example, couples often plan meals together, and husbands’ and wives’ eating and drinking behaviors become more similar once they get married (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0265407512451199">Bove, Sobal, &amp; Rauschenbach, 2003</xref>). One situation in which dietary convergence might occur is shared mealtimes, where one romantic partner might attempt to influence the other’s eating behaviors. When couples are comparable in weight status (e.g., both healthy or both unhealthy), their food choices may not be controversial (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0265407512451199">Bove et al., 2003</xref>). These couples might consider eating together to be a positive experience. Conversely, when partners have conflicting health or weight philosophies, it might contribute to food choice conflicts.</p>
<p>When inconsistencies arise between individuals’ alleged health and weight philosophies and their actual food choices, partners report greater conflict, especially when these individuals feel that their partners are criticizing their food choices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0265407512451199">Bove et al., 2003</xref>). Food regulation might also occur more often among mixed-weight couples, and may contribute to conflict in their relationships. As an example, prior work has shown that individuals who are dissatisfied with their partners’ bodies or have partners with a relatively high BMI are more likely to monitor and restrict their partners’ eating behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0265407512451199">Markey, Gomel, &amp; Markey, 2008</xref>). Restricting the partner’s eating behaviors might make eating together a less positive, or even a negative, relationship experience.</p>
<p>Given that food, eating, and weight issues may be more problematic for mixed-weight couples, especially when it is the female partner who is an unhealthy weight, our second hypothesis is:</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>H2: The associations between mixed-weight status, sex, and conflict will be moderated by frequency of eating together, such that couples with an overweight woman and healthy weight man who eat together more frequently will report greater relationship conflict than couples who eat together less frequently.</p>

<sec id="section3-0265407512451199">
<title>Perceived partner health support, negative partner influence, and weight in relationships</title>
<p>Support is an important element in relationships. Although some research indicates that support receipt might have a neutral or negative effect on individuals’ well-being (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0265407512451199">Bolger, Zuckerman, &amp; Kessler, 2000</xref>), perceptions of available support from significant others is generally beneficial for individuals’ well-being. Perceiving that support from the partner is available is positively associated with relationship quality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0265407512451199">Cramer, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0265407512451199">Cutrona, 1996</xref>), negatively associated with conflict (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0265407512451199">Cramer, 2006</xref>) and relational strain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0265407512451199">Walen &amp; Lachman, 2000</xref>), and can promote a positive relational tone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0265407512451199">Cutrona, 1996</xref>). Further, spouses who exhibit more positive, supportive behaviors also exhibit fewer negative behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0265407512451199">Lawrence et al., 2008</xref>), which might be associated with less conflict.</p>
<p>Perceived support from the partner might be particularly beneficial in mixed-weight relationships, especially if this support is targeted towards individuals’ health. In a review of studies including social support in weight management interventions, results suggest that support is positively associated with weight management (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0265407512451199">Verheijden, Bakx, van Weel, Koelen, &amp; van Staveren, 2005</xref>). That is, healthy weight maintenance is improved among individuals who have people available to provide social support (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0265407512451199">Kayman, Bruvold, &amp; Stern, 1990</xref>). Partners do not always use supportive strategies to influence their partners’ weight management or maintenance, however. Some research indicates that individuals who are trying to prevent their partners from engaging in health-compromising behaviors are likely to use negative influence tactics more frequently than positive influence tactics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0265407512451199">Butterfield &amp; Lewis, 2002</xref>). These negative partner influence tactics might exacerbate any conflict that already occurs among mixed-weight couples. Consequently, it is important to examine the extent to which partners’ use of positive (i.e., support) and negative (i.e., negative partner influence) communication is associated with conflict in mixed-weight relationships. Further, because research suggests that women are attuned to their male partners’ negativity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0265407512451199">Pole et al., 2004</xref>), perceiving that the partner is available to provide health-related support might be especially beneficial to couples including overweight women with healthy weight male partners, but perceiving that the partner is using negative influence tactics might be more harmful to these couples.</p>
<p>In line with research suggesting that perceived availability of support from the partner can promote a positive emotional tone and even reduce negative interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0265407512451199">Cutrona, 1996</xref>), and that partners are more likely to use negative influence tactics when they are trying to prevent their partner from engaging in health-compromising behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0265407512451199">Butterfield &amp; Lewis, 2002</xref>), our third hypothesis is:</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>H3a: The associations between mixed-weight status, sex, and conflict will be moderated by partner health support such that couples with an overweight woman and healthy weight man will report less conflict when they report greater perceived health support from the partner, compared to similar couples with less perceived health support from the partner.</p>
</disp-quote>
<disp-quote>
<p>H3b: The associations between mixed-weight status, sex, and conflict will be moderated by negative partner influence such that couples with an overweight woman and healthy weight man will report greater conflict when they report greater perceived negative influence from the partner, compared to similar couples with less perceived negative influence from the partner.</p>

<title>Participants</title>
<p>Participants included 43 heterosexual couples (86 individuals), ranging in age from 18 to 69 years old (<italic>M = </italic>31.6, <italic>SD </italic>= 12.7). Age was fairly normally distributed, with 37% of the individuals between the ages of 18 and 25, 42% between the ages of 26 and 40, and 21% over the age of 41. Participants’ relationship length ranged from three months to 39 years, with a mean of 6.24 years (<italic>SD </italic>= 7.14). In addition, 48% of participants reported being married and 52% reported being in a cohabiting relationship.</p>
<p>The sample was 80% European American, 2.5% African American, 2.5% Asian American, and 15% other. Thirty-four percent of participants reported a yearly household income of US$24,000 or less, 24% of participants reported making US$25,000–50,000, 17% reported making US$50,000–75,000, 2% reported making US$75,000–100,000, 3% reported making US$100,000–150,000, and 2% reported making more than US$150,000. In terms of the highest level of education obtained by the participants, 1% reported less than high school, 5% reported high school, 3% reported a professional program, 37% reported some college, 24% reported an undergraduate degree, and 13% reported a graduate degree.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0265407512451199">
<title>Procedures</title>
<p>Data from this study were collected as part of a larger study on relationships, eating, and emotions that included three parts: an initial baseline questionnaire, a laboratory portion, and a seven-day diary. Data from the baseline questionnaire and daily conflict assessed from the diaries were used in the analyses for this study. The only measures used from the laboratory portion were physical assessments of participants’ height and weight.</p>
<p>Participating couples were recruited through Craig’s List and had to meet the following criteria: (1) both individuals were over the age of 18; (2) both individuals were willing to participate in a study; and (3) the individuals had been in a romantic relationship for at least six weeks. Participants that completed all portions of the study received US$90. Eligible couples were mailed an informed consent form and a packet of baseline questionnaires to be completed before their laboratory session. Partners completed the questionnaires separately and were instructed not to discuss their answers with each other. The questionnaires took approximately one hour to complete. Participants returned the baseline questionnaires to the research assistant during the laboratory session, during which their height and weight measurements were taken (other procedures and measures from the laboratory session are not relevant to the present analyses).</p>
<p>Upon completion of the laboratory session, couples were asked to complete a seven-day structured diary, in which participants responded to scales assessing a variety of variables (e.g., arguing). Couples were asked to complete their diaries two times per day, once around the middle of the day (e.g., 12:00 pm) and the other in the evening before bed (e.g., 9:00 pm), in order to account for the potential change in interpersonal interactions over the course of the day (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0265407512451199">Laurenceau &amp; Bolger, 2005</xref>). Participants were instructed to complete the questionnaires at convenient times within the range of the target times (i.e., the middle and end of each day), because this idiographic approach has been shown to enhance compliance by allowing participants to synchronize reporting times with their schedule (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0265407512451199">Bolger, Davis, &amp; Rafaelli, 2003</xref>). All constructs were assessed with single face valid items to avoid participant burden and increase compliance. For each item, participants responded with respect to either the time period since they last completed the questions or, for the first day’s entry, since they awoke that morning.</p>

<sec id="section7-0265407512451199">
<title>Measures</title>
<sec id="section8-0265407512451199">
<title>Weight status</title>
<p>Participants’ BMI was calculated based on their height and weight, which was determined during their visit to the laboratory (kg/m<sup>2</sup>). Participants were either coded as healthy weight or overweight according to their BMI, following national guidelines (healthy weight: BMI ≤ 25 and overweight: BMI &gt; 25). This information was used to create a categorical variable that indicated a person’s weight status relative to their partner (see the <italic>Data analysis</italic> section for the rationale for using categorical weight status). Specifically, partners’ relative weight status was represented with a four-level categorical variable that applied to individuals, not couples per se, although in matched-weight couples both partners received the same value. Thus, both partners in a matched overweight couple were coded OO (overweight target with an overweight partner) and both partners in a matched healthy weight couple were coded HH (healthy weight target with a healthy weight partner). In mixed-weight couples, however, one partner was coded OH (overweight target with healthy weight partner) and the other partner was coded HO (healthy weight target with an overweight partner). Thirty participants were categorized as HH (i.e., 15 matched healthy weight couples, 34.88%), 17 participants were categorized as HO (19.77%), 17 participants were categorized as OH (i.e., 17 mixed-weight couples, 19.77%), and 22 participants were categorized as OO (i.e., 11 matched overweight couples, 25.58%)</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-0265407512451199">
<title>Conflict/arguing</title>
<p>We assessed both general self-reported conflict and daily reports of arguing, each of which provides a different perspective on relationship functioning. The reports of general conflict are valuable for providing global information about participants’ overall perceptions of relational conflict, while the daily reports of arguing provide information about daily perceptions of specific conflicts with less influence of retrospective biases. General conflict was assessed using the five-item conflict subscale of the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0265407512451199">Braiker &amp; Kelley (1979</xref>) Relationship Quality Questionnaire. The five items include “How often do you and your partner argue with each other?”, “To what extent do you try to change things about your partner that bother you (e.g., behaviors, attitudes, etc.)?”, “How often do you feel angry or resentful toward your partner?”, “When you and your partner argue, how serious are the problems or arguments?”, and “To what extent do you communicate negative feelings toward your partner (e.g., anger, dissatisfaction, etc.)?”. Participants responded to the items on a scale from 0 to 8, where 0 = “not at all” and 8 = “very much.” The internal consistency for this scale is α = .79.</p>
<p>Daily arguing was assessed using the following item: “Have you had an argument or disagreement with your partner?”. Participants responded on a 0–4 scale, where 0 = “No,” 1 = “Yes, a very minor one,” 2 = “Yes, a small one,” 3 = “Yes, a moderate one,” and 4 = “Yes, a large one.” Scores on this measure were positively skewed, with participants reporting low levels of daily conflict overall (<italic>Mode </italic>= 0, <italic>M =</italic>0.3, <italic>SD </italic>= 1.0). To accommodate this non-normal distribution, we recoded arguing into a binary variable scored 0 or 1, where 1 included 1–4 on the original scale. For the analysis in which daily arguing was the outcome measure, we used the SAS GLIMMIX procedure with a binary distribution and a logit link function to appropriately model the binary outcome (see the <italic>Data analysis</italic> section for additional details).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section25-0265407512451199">
<title>Eating together</title>
<p>The frequency with which partners habitually ate together was measured in the baseline questionnaire using four items including, “How often do you and your partner eat breakfast together?”, “How often do you and your partner eat lunch together?”, “How often do you and your partner eat dinner together?”, and “How often do you and your partner eat snacks together?”. Participants responded on a scale from 1 to 3, with 1 = “rarely,” 2 = “sometimes,” and 3 = “most of the time.” The responses for these four items were summed.</p>

<title>Partner health support</title>
<p>Partner health support was defined as an individual’s perception of health-related support from his or her partner. This construct included face valid items created by the researchers, and was measured in the baseline questionnaire using three items including, “My partner is very supportive of my attempts to eat a healthy diet,” “My partner is very supportive of my attempts to get enough exercise,” and “Overall, my partner is very supportive of me in general.” Participants responded on a 1–7 scale, where 1 = “Strongly Disagree” and 7 = “Strongly Agree.” The internal consistency for this measure is α = .81.</p>

<title>Negative partner influence</title>
<p>Negative partner influence was defined as an individual’s perception of negative influence strategies used by his or her partner. This construct was measured in the baseline questionnaire and included three forms of social control found to have negative mood effects by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0265407512451199">Lewis and Rook (1999</xref>). Individuals were asked whether their partner used any of the following three strategies to influence them to lose weight: “Tried to make me feel guilty,” “Pressured me to change,” and “Ridiculed me and made me feel bad.” Participants responded on a 0–4 scale, where 0 = “Never” and 4 = “Almost every day.” The internal consistency for this measure is α = 74.</p>

<title>Data analysis</title>
<p>Conceptually, our hypotheses focus on the relative weight status of women to their male partners, with the prediction being that couples with an overweight female partner, but a healthy weight male, will experience the most conflict. Furthermore, we expected this effect to be moderated by other relationship processes, such as perceived support. To optimize power given our somewhat small sample size, we created a categorical variable to indicate a person’s weight status relative to his or her partner. As described in the <italic>Measures</italic> section, standard guidelines were used to categorize a person as healthy weight or overweight based on their BMI. We then used those categorizations to create a four-level variable that indicated whether a person was healthy weight with a healthy weight partner (HH), healthy weight with an overweight partner (HO), overweight with a healthy weight partner (OH), or overweight with an overweight partner (OO). This approach allowed us to test H2 and H3 with models that had only seven predictors (sex, relative weight status, the moderator, three two-way interactions, and one three-way interaction). Although categorizing a continuous variable is generally not recommended because it reduces statistical precision and power, we felt this was an acceptable trade-off given the problems associated with using a continuous BMI variable in this case. It should be noted that the down side of categorization is that it makes our significance tests more conservative and thereby gives us additional confidence that significant results are in fact reliable.</p>
<p>To examine the association between weight status and conflict, and whether this association was moderated by participant sex, eating together, partner health support, or negative partner influence, we tested five separate dyadic models using SAS PROC MIXED, four of which included general conflict as the outcome variable and one of which examined daily arguing as the outcome variable. Interactions were decomposed following <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0265407512451199">Aiken and West (1991</xref>). Relationship length and age were also initially included as control variables, but because they were non-significant in all of the models, we report results omitting them.</p>
<p>Model 1 predicted general conflict from the categorical weight status variable, sex, and the interaction of weight status by sex. The outcome, general conflict, was a person-level variable (i.e., it did not vary over time) and so we used a standard cross-sectional dyadic model in which partners are treated as repeated observations within the dyad and their residuals are allowed to correlate, thereby accounting for non-independence due to individuals being nested within dyads (for details, including syntax, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0265407512451199">Kenny, Kashy, &amp; Cook, 2006</xref>, p. 94). Thus, this model assesses whether a person’s report of general relationship conflict is predicted by the person’s weight status relative to their partner, the person’s sex, or the interaction of their relative weight status and their sex.</p>
<p>Model 2 predicted daily arguing from the same predictors as used in Model 1 (i.e., relative weight status, sex, and the interaction of relative weight status by sex). The outcome measure of daily arguing introduces several complexities, however, because (1) it varies over time and thus time is nested within individuals who are nested within dyads and (2) it was a binary variable. To appropriately handle these issues we (1) used a repeated measures dyadic model in which both the dyad and the individual are specified to have random intercepts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0265407512451199">Kenny et al., 2006</xref>) and (2) used the SAS GLIMMIX procedure to embed our dyadic model within a generalized linear model with a binomial distribution and a logit link that appropriately handles the non-normal distribution of daily arguing.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0265407512451199">2</xref>
</sup> Although arguing varied across days, the predictors in this model were all at the between-person level (e.g., weight status, sex) and thus are necessarily treated as fixed effects. Because Level-2 variables are only measured once for each participant, but the outcome (arguing) was measured repeatedly, this model essentially provides a very reliable estimate of the associations between the predictors and arguing. In other words, this model is similar to using a highly reliable measure of arguing aggregated over multiple observations.</p>
<p>Model 3 assessed the role of eating together as a moderator of the association between partners’ relative weight status and general conflict. This model predicted general conflict from relative weight status, sex, and eating together, as well as all two-way interactions and the three-way interaction. Because the outcome was not time-varying, we used the same cross-sectional dyadic model as Model 1. Finally, Models 4 and 5 were the same as Model 3, but with eating together replaced by partner health support (Model 4) or negative partner influence (Model 5).</p>

<title>Results</title>
<sec id="section15-0265407512451199">
<title>Descriptive statistics</title>
<p>Participants reported moderate levels of conflict (<italic>M </italic>= 3.0, <italic>SD </italic>= 1.5, range = 0–6.4) and low levels of daily arguing (<italic>M =</italic>0.3, <italic>SD </italic>= 1.0, range = 0–20). In addition, participants reported eating together fairly frequently (<italic>M </italic>= 8.1, <italic>SD </italic>= 1.6), with a range of 4–12, where a score of 4 indicates participants ate with their partners less frequently and a score of 12 indicates that participants eat with their partners more frequently. Partners also reported perceiving high levels of partner health support (<italic>M </italic>= 6.0, <italic>SD </italic>= 1.2, range = 1–7) and low levels of negative partner influence (<italic>M = </italic>.17, <italic>SD </italic>= .46, range = 0–3).</p>
<p>Correlations among male and female participants’ ratings of conflict and support were also examined. Male conflict was significantly positively associated with female conflict, <italic>r </italic>= .49, <italic>p </italic>&lt; .001, but male support was not significantly associated with female support, <italic>r </italic>= .07, <italic>ns</italic>, and male negative partner influence was not significantly associated with female negative partner influence, <italic>r </italic>= .01, <italic>ns</italic>, which is not surprising, because there is no a priori reason that both partners should perceive equal levels of partner health support or negative partner influence.</p>

<title>Hypothesis 1: Dyadic relative weight status and conflict</title>
<p>For H1, we predicted that the association between weight status and conflict would be moderated by sex, such that couples with an overweight woman and healthy weight man would report the greatest relationship conflict. We examined the association between weight status and the general measure for conflict (Model 1), as well as the daily measure of arguing (Model 2). As predicted, the association between weight status and general conflict was significantly moderated by sex, <italic>F</italic>(3, 84) = 4.97, <italic>p </italic>&lt; .01. Similarly, the association between weight status and daily arguing was also significantly moderated by sex, <italic>F</italic>(3, 821) = 8.09, <italic>p </italic>&lt; .001.</p>
<p>The contrast effects for general conflict are presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0265407512451199">Table 1</xref> (<italic>above</italic> the dashed horizontal line), and are discussed next. For women, these contrast effects indicate that overweight women (both those with overweight and healthy weight male partners) report significantly greater conflict than healthy weight women paired with healthy weight partners. For men, these contrast effects indicate that healthy weight men with overweight female partners report greater conflict than all other men. In addition, in mixed-weight couples both partners reported greater conflict if the overweight partner was the woman, compared to if it was the man (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0265407512451199">Figure 1</xref>).</p>

Specifically, partners in mixed-weight relationships reported greater general relational conflict when they reported eating together more frequently, regardless of partners’ sex (simple slopes are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0265407512451199">Figure 3</xref>).

<title>Addressing alternative explanations</title>
<sec id="section20-0265407512451199">
<title>Similarity on BMI and other variables</title>
<p>One alternative explanation for our findings is that partners with more similar BMIs are also similar in other ways, which might reduce conflict. We examined this alternative explanation by examining partners’ similarity on BMI in conjunction with partners’ similarity on other variables. As mentioned previously, this study was part of a larger study, which included other measures, such as recent weight changes, perceptions of own and partner weight status, love, self-esteem, and emotional expression. Although these variables are not the focus of the current study, we used them to contextualize our findings. Firstly, to assess the extent to which individuals with similar BMIs are also similar with regard to other traits and values, we created difference scores for BMI (e.g., Partner A BMI – Partner B BMI), conflict, support, love, self-esteem, positive emotional expression, and negative emotional expression, and then correlated the difference score for BMI with the difference scores for the rest of these variables. Results indicated that similarity in BMI was not significantly associated with similarity on conflict, support, love, self-esteem, or negative emotional expression; however, BMI similarity was significantly negatively associated with positive emotional expression, <italic>r </italic>= –.33, <italic>p </italic>&lt; .01, indicating that individuals who are more similar in BMI (i.e., matched-weight individuals) report less similarity in positive emotional expression. These results indicate that similarity on BMI is somewhat unique from similarity on several other dimensions, suggesting that the observed association between partners’ relative weight status and conflict is not easily explained as the result of similarity on these other traits and values. These results still do not indicate whether these couples are experiencing greater conflict as a function of their dissimilarity in weight or dissimilarity in valuing health, however.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section21-0265407512451199">
<title>Weight status, relationship length, and age</title>
<p>Another alternative explanation for our findings is that relationship length and age could contribute to the findings we identified. To better characterize weight status in the sample, we examined the associations between relative weight status and relationship length, age, recent weight gain (i.e., weight gain over the last six years), individuals’ perceptions that they are currently overweight, and individuals’ perceptions that their partners are currently overweight using a sequence of five separate cross-sectional dyadic models similar to Model 1 (see the <italic>Data analysis</italic> section). Results indicated that relationship length differed by weight status,<italic> F</italic>(3,13) = 6.04, <italic>p </italic>&lt; .01, with matched overweight (OO) couples reporting longer relationship length than matched healthy weight (HH) couples, <italic>t</italic>(13) = 3.92, <italic>p </italic>&lt; .01, but mixed-weight couples (OH or HO) did not differ from matched healthy weight couples, <italic>t</italic>(13) = .29, <italic>ns. </italic>Age also differed by weight status, <italic>F</italic>(3,13) = 6.23, <italic>p </italic>&lt; .01, such that matched overweight individuals reported being older than matched healthy weight individuals, <italic>t</italic>(13) = 4.24, <italic>p </italic>&lt; .01, but mixed-weight individuals did not differ from healthy weight individuals, <italic>t</italic>(13) = 1.07, <italic>ns.</italic> As mentioned in the data analysis section, both relationship length and age were included as controls in all of the models, but were non-significant. So, although they differ, relationship length and age do not drive the effects we found.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section22-0265407512451199">
<title>Weight status, weight gain, and perceptions about weight</title>
<p>Finally, weight gain and perceptions about weight were also examined as alternative explanations for the associations between mixed-weight status and conflict. Weight gain over the last six years did not significantly differ by current weight status, <italic>F</italic>(3,13) = 2.80, <italic>ns.</italic> However, individuals’ perceptions that they are currently overweight did, <italic>F</italic>(3,12) = 7.55, <italic>p </italic>&lt; .01, such that OO individuals perceived themselves as being more overweight than HH individuals, <italic>t</italic>(12) = 4.45, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001. In contrast, neither OH individuals, <italic>t</italic>(12) = 1.47, <italic>ns</italic>, nor HO individuals, <italic>t</italic>(12) = .23, <italic>ns</italic>, perceived themselves as being more overweight than HH individuals. Finally, individuals’ perceptions that their partners are currently overweight also significantly differed by weight status, <italic>F</italic>(3,13) = 4.05, <italic>p </italic>&lt; .05, such that OO individuals, <italic>t</italic>(13) = 2.61, <italic>p </italic>&lt; .05, and HO individuals, <italic>t</italic>(13) = 2.51, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05, both perceived their partners as being more overweight than HH individuals. OH did not significantly differ from HH individuals, <italic>t</italic>(13) = –.10, <italic>ns.</italic> Moreover, BMI did not significantly differ between OO individuals (<italic>M </italic>= 29.93, <italic>SD</italic> = 3.06) and OH (<italic>M</italic> = 29.99, <italic>SD </italic>= 5.00) individuals, <italic>t</italic>(16) = –.038, <italic>ns</italic>. Participant sex was included as a moderator in the last two models (individuals’ perception of being overweight and individuals’ perceptions that their partners are overweight), but was not significant in either model.</p>
<p>These results indicate that mixed-weight couples did not significantly differ from matched healthy weight couples on relationship length, age, weight gain over the last six years, or perceiving themselves as overweight; however, healthy weight individuals with overweight partners did perceive their partners to be overweight. In other words, whereas overweight individuals in mixed-weight couples did not perceive themselves to be overweight, their partners (the healthy weight individuals) did perceive them to be overweight. The analyses indicated that OO individuals did not perceive themselves to be more overweight than OH individuals; thus, it seems that there is a discrepancy between how overweight individuals in mixed-weight couples see themselves and how their partners see them, which may be an additional factor contributing to conflict in these couples.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>This research examined the association between weight status and relational conflict among couples with varying relative partner weights. We hypothesized that couples including overweight women paired with healthy weight male partners would report greater relational conflict than other gender–weight combinations, and that this association would be further moderated by frequency of eating together, partner health support, and negative partner influence. In general, we found support for our hypotheses.</p>
<p>Mixed-weight couples including an overweight woman and a healthy weight man reported the greatest general conflict and daily arguing (H1). These findings are consistent with research suggesting that mixed-weight couples experience less relationship satisfaction when the female partner has a higher BMI than the male partner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0265407512451199">Meltzer et al., 2011</xref>). Indeed, BMI is more strongly correlated with perceptions of women’s physical attractiveness than it is with perceptions of men’s physical attractiveness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0265407512451199">Swami, 2006</xref>). Further, men place a greater emphasis on their partners’ thinness than do women (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0265407512451199">Chen &amp; Brown, 2005</xref>), possibly because men perceive women’s attractiveness to be an indicator of reproductive fitness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0265407512451199">Buss &amp; Schmitt, 1993</xref>). Thus, when a healthy weight man is in a relationship with an overweight woman, his unfulfilled desire for a thin partner might contribute to increased conflict in these relationships. Similarly, these overweight women might be aware that their partner would be more attracted to them if they were thinner. These women might feel insecure and/or critical about their bodies as a result, making them less likely to be affectionate and, ultimately, resulting in lower intimacy and greater relational conflict.</p>
<p>It is also possible that higher conflict or poor quality relationships lead to greater weight gain, wherein individuals are eating more to cope with the conflict in their relationship. Women might be particularly vulnerable to this cycle of eating to cope with conflict; in fact, some research indicates that overweight women suppress emotions to please their partners, but then eat more on days when they do so (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0265407512451199">Butler et al., 2010</xref>). That said, we cannot determine the direction of the associations, given that the variables in the study were either cross-sectional or short-term daily diary entries. Future research using a longitudinal approach will be important for unpacking the potentially reciprocal associations between relationship quality and weight.</p>
<p>We also found that mixed-weight couples reported greater relational conflict when they reported eating together more frequently, regardless of whether it was the male or the female who was overweight (H2). This finding is consistent with research suggesting that partners with a healthy eating philosophy use shared mealtimes as opportunities to influence their overweight partners to eat a healthier diet (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0265407512451199">Bove et al., 2003</xref>). We did not measure the nature or content of communication during shared mealtimes; however, mixed-weight couples’ perceptions of greater conflict might stem from healthy weight partners’ attempts to encourage their overweight partners to eat healthier. In this scenario, it is possible that the source of conflict is the overweight individual’s perception that his or her healthy weight partner has more relational power than he or she does. Consequently, the overweight partner might feel insecure, judged, and angry, which could ultimately contribute to a power battle around food and eating in the relationship. This explanation is consistent with the idea that individuals who attempt to change their partner often report more negative relationship evaluations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0265407512451199">Hira &amp; Overall, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>Nevertheless, it seems as though the experience of eating with the partner may be similar among men and women, given that no sex difference emerged. Of course, such a null result could simply be due to lack of statistical power, given our somewhat small sample size, but it is also possible that eating together exacerbates issues having to do with weight differences between partners, such that it no longer matters which partner is the one with the less healthy weight. Thus, although in general mixed-weight couples report more conflict when it is the woman who is heavier, once mixed-weight couples eat together the pattern may become more symmetric, regardless of the couples’ sex–weight combination. This finding somewhat reflects the demand–withdraw literature, which suggests that men and women can be equally demanding when they want their partner to change (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0265407512451199">Heavey, Layne, &amp; Christensen, 1993</xref>); therefore, men and women might use similar communication tactics to encourage their partner to be healthier. Alternatively, it is also possible that overweight men and women might both feel insecure about eating with their healthy partners, which results in greater conflict regardless of individuals’ sex.</p>
<p>Partner health support and negative influence strategies were also examined as moderators of the association between sex, weight status, and relational conflict. Greater perceived support from the partner was associated with less relational conflict among overweight women paired with a healthy weight partner and healthy weight men (either with an overweight or healthy weight female partner; H3a). This finding is consistent with the extant support literature, which suggests that perceived partner support is associated with reduced negativity, conflict (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0265407512451199">Cramer, 2006</xref>), and strain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0265407512451199">Walen &amp; Lachman, 2000</xref>) in relationships. Perceived partner support may be especially beneficial for mixed-weight couples including an overweight woman and a healthy weight man, because these couples reported the greatest general conflict and daily arguing. If support can reduce the conflict in these couples, it suggests an important direction for intervention, both for improving relationship quality and for supporting a healthy lifestyle. Given that women’s health is positively associated with relationship quality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0265407512451199">Kiecolt-Glaser &amp; Newton, 2001</xref>), perceived support from the partner might simultaneously improve relationship quality and reduce health issues exacerbated by the stressors arising from poor relationship quality among these overweight women.</p>
<p>In contrast, negative partner influence did not moderate the association between sex, weight status, and general conflict (H3b). Given the low incidence of perceived negative strategies from the partner, it seems that our participants did not perceive their partners to be using these strategies with enough frequency to significantly exacerbate their relational conflict. Consistent with some research on positive and negative influence strategies, it is possible that the individuals in this study are choosing to use more positive strategies to encourage their partners to engage in healthier behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0265407512451199">Lewis &amp; Butterfield, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>Finally, our section addressing alternative explanations indicated that overweight individuals in mixed-weight relationships did not perceive themselves to be overweight, but their healthy weight partners did perceive them to be overweight. It is possible that this perceptual discrepancy could contribute to conflict in these relationships. We also examined whether similarity in BMI was associated with similarity in other values and traits that might influence conflict. Our results indicated that partners’ similarity in BMI was not significantly correlated with similarity in other values and traits, except for a significant, negative association with positive emotional expression. We concluded, therefore, that BMI is uniquely associated with conflict, and this association is not likely the result of similarity on other traits and values.</p>
<p>This research contributes to the literature on mixed-weight status in romantic relationships in several ways. Firstly, it extends previous findings on mixed-weight status and relationship satisfaction (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0265407512451199">Meltzer et al., 2011</xref>) to include relational conflict, thereby identifying an additional element of relationship quality that is undermined for mixed-weight couples. Although not all conflict is destructive, the conflict measure in this study includes feelings of anger and resentment, both of which are representative of fairly destructive relational conflict (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0265407512451199">Gottman &amp; Krokoff, 1989</xref>); therefore, this study contributes to the literature by highlighting the association between mixed-weight status and this specific, and possibly deleterious, element of relational quality. That is, our findings suggest that individuals in mixed-weight relationships are at greater risk for experiencing destructive relational conflict, which could be harmful to their relational and individual well-being.</p>
<p>Overweight women in relationships with healthy weight men might be at particularly high risk, as poor relationship quality can be especially deleterious to women’s physical health (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0265407512451199">Kiecolt-Glaser &amp; Newton, 2001</xref>). Overweight women might experience health issues as a function of their weight status, and when they are in a relationship with healthy weight men, the conflict they experience (i.e., poor relationship quality) might aggravate these health issues. Consequently, these women should be made aware of the risks associated with being in a relationship with a healthy weight partner, as well as with the supportive relational processes that might reduce feelings of relational conflict. The findings from this study suggest that perceived support from the partner is associated with less conflict in mixed-weight relationships and that eating together more frequently is associated with greater conflict; therefore, practitioners should inform mixed-weight couples to employ supportive weight management strategies. Using these supportive strategies might be especially helpful in situations where partners’ weight is starting to diverge and they are looking to each other for help with weight management.</p>
<p>Despite these strengths, as with any single study, the present research also has some limitations that must be taken into account. Firstly, because <italic>daily</italic> measures of eating together and support were not included in the study, we could not examine whether these relational processes moderated the association between mixed-weight status and daily arguing. In future research, we will include daily measures of each of the variables of interest in an effort to illustrate the extent to which the associations between daily variables mirror those between the cross-sectional variables. In addition, in future measures of couples eating together, it might be helpful to include eating dessert together, which could be significant, given that dessert is often high in calories, fat, and sugar, and could therefore contribute to conflict among mixed-weight couples. Further, although this research identified that frequency of eating together was associated with conflict, we did not measure the types of interactions that occur when couples eat together. Knowing more about the content of interactions during shared mealtimes would allow researchers to understand which types of interaction behaviors are more likely to lead to conflict; therefore, couples could be encouraged to engage in positive and avoid negative weight-related communication with their partners.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>Research on weight loss interventions among partners has shown mixed results. Some research indicates that participants lost the most weight if they attended treatment sessions alone instead of attending treatment groups with their husbands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0265407512451199">Black &amp; Lantz, 1984</xref>). Alternatively, other research suggests that individuals who participated in a couples’ program lost more weight (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0265407512451199">Black, Gleser, &amp; Kooyers, 1990</xref>). It is possible that relational factors, such as relative weight status and conflict, account for the differences in these interventions. The present research provides some information about the relational context in which perceived partner health support is beneficial in mixed-weight relationships, which could contribute to more successful weight loss interventions. Furthermore, the present research provides a demonstration of how couples’ joint weight status can interact with relationship processes, such as conflict and support, thereby pointing the direction for future work targeted at reducing conflict and increasing support for mixed-weight couples. It is possible, for example, that when individuals in mixed-weight relationships experience conflict, it exacerbates the stress in these relationships, thereby negatively impacting their relationship quality.</p>
<p>Future research should build upon the findings from this research to examine these types of cyclical relational processes, and how they might impact individuals’ health and well-being. Understanding which behaviors lead to conflict, and which behaviors are perceived as supportive, might be valuable in designing weight loss programs, as well as marital interventions, for couples. For example, if future research examined relational dynamics during shared meal times more carefully, it would be possible to design interventions that inform couples in general, and mixed-weight couples in particular, about how to engage in more supportive behaviors and fewer conflict-arousing behaviors when they are encouraging their partners to be healthier.</p>

<p>We initially tried a model with a random intercept for the dyad to account for average between-partner dependencies and a compound symmetric specification for the residuals to account for time-varying between-partner and within-person dependencies over time; however, the model did not converge with this level of complexity so we used the simpler random intercepts model.</p>
