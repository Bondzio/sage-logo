<p><bold>Background:</bold> The CardioFit internet-based expert system was designed to promote physical activity in patients with coronary heart disease (CHD) who were not participating in cardiac rehabilitation. Design: This randomized controlled trial compared CardioFit to usual care to assess its effects on physical activity following hospitalization for acute coronary syndromes.</p>
<p><bold>Methods:</bold> A total of 223 participants were recruited at the University of Ottawa Heart Institute or London Health Sciences Centre and randomly assigned to either CardioFit (<italic>n</italic> = 115) or usual care (<italic>n</italic> = 108). The CardioFit group received a personally tailored physical-activity plan upon discharge from the hospital and access to a secure website for activity planning and tracking. They completed five online tutorials over a 6-month period and were in email contact with an exercise specialist. Usual care consisted of physical activity guidance from an attending cardiologist. Physical activity was measured by pedometer and self-reported over a 7-day period, 6 and 12 months after randomization.</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> The CardioFit internet-based physical activity expert system significantly increased objectively measured (<italic>p</italic> = 0.023) and self-reported physical activity (<italic>p</italic> = 0.047) compared to usual care. Emotional (<italic>p</italic> = 0.038) and physical (<italic>p</italic> = 0.031) dimensions of heart disease health-related quality of life were also higher with CardioFit compared to usual care.</p>
<p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Patients with CHD using an internet-based activity prescription with online coaching were more physically active at follow up than those receiving usual care. Use of the CardioFit program could extend the reach of rehabilitation and secondary-prevention services.</p>

<p>Regular physical activity improves quality of life and reduces mortality in patients with coronary heart disease (CHD).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1741826711422988">1</xref></sup> Physical activity counselling and exercise training are core components of cardiac rehabilitation programmes;<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1741826711422988">2</xref></sup> however, only 10–30% of patients participate in such programmes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1741826711422988">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1741826711422988">4</xref></sup> Most cardiac rehabilitation programmes are unable to expand participation using traditional delivery models which emphasize supervised, facility-based programmes.</p>
<p>One way that patients with CHD might receive guidance regarding physical activity and correspond with care providers is via the internet.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1741826711422988">5</xref></sup> Internet-based physical activity interventions have been shown to be effective for improving physical activity levels in other populations;<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1741826711422988">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1741826711422988">7</xref></sup> there is, however, only one small, published pilot-study examining how patients with CHD respond to such interventions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1741826711422988">8</xref></sup> In that study, 15 patients were randomized to either an internet-based ‘virtual’ cardiac rehabilitation programme or observational control. Over a 12-week intervention period, the virtual cardiac rehabilitation programme group significantly improved their lipid profile, exercise capacity, and minutes of physical activity; the control group did not.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1741826711422988">8</xref></sup></p>
<p>We designed the CardioFit internet-based, expert programme to promote physical activity in patients with CHD who were not participating in a cardiac rehabilitation programme. In this randomized controlled trial, we investigated whether patients who used the CardioFit programme were more physically active 6 and 12 months following hospitalization for CHD than patients who received physical activity advice from their cardiologist. The present trial served as the primary validation of the CardioFit programme.</p>

<sec id="sec2-1741826711422988" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title>
<sec id="sec3-1741826711422988"><title>Setting and participants</title>
<p>From December 2004 to December 2007, potential study participants were identified by study coordinators during an index hospitalization at two tertiary-care cardiac centres in Canada (University of Ottawa Heart Institute, Ottawa; London Health Sciences Centre, London). All patients admitted for acute coronary syndromes who: underwent successful percutaneous coronary revascularization; were not planning on enrolling in cardiac rehabilitation; had internet access at home or work; and were 20−80 years of age, were candidates for inclusion. Patients were ineligible if they: underwent coronary artery bypass surgery; had an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator; had NYHA Class III or IV heart failure; did not speak and read English; or were unwilling or unable to provide signed informed consent. The protocol was approved by the institutional Research Ethics Committees and written informed consent was obtained from all participants prior to data collection.</p>
<p>The coordinator abstracted information from the patient charts regarding age, gender, cardiac history, comorbidities, and reasons for hospital admission. All participants completed a baseline questionnaire regarding their education, leisure-time physical activity,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1741826711422988">9</xref></sup> and heart disease health-related quality of life.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1741826711422988">10</xref></sup></p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec4-1741826711422988"><title>Randomization, blinding, and interventions</title>
<p>Participants were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to CardioFit or usual care using a random sequence that was computer generated by a statistical consultant in blocks of 4, 8, and 10. Sequences were generated for Ottawa and London and placed in sealed, numbered envelopes to ensure that treatment allocation was concealed until after baseline data collection. Research coordinators allocated the next available number on study entry (while the participant was still hospitalized). The research coordinator notified each participant of their allocated intervention immediately after the baseline assessment was complete. Research assistants, blinded to the participants’ treatment allocation, conducted follow-up assessments.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec5-1741826711422988"><title>Description of interventions</title>
<sec id="sec6-1741826711422988"><title>CardioFit intervention</title>
<p>Participants in the CardioFit group were visited in hospital by an exercise specialist, who presented a personally tailored physical activity plan generated by the CardioFit system, and instructions on how to access the CardioFit website. Following hospital discharge, participants were asked to log their daily activity on the CardioFit website and complete a series of five online tutorials (at weeks 2, 4, 8, 14, and 20). Each online tutorial took between 10 and 20 minutes to complete. Following each tutorial, a new physical activity plan was developed. Between tutorials, participants received emails from the exercise specialist providing motivational feedback on their progress. Participants were able to email the exercise specialist questions concerning their programme. The CardioFit website and tutorials were developed with expert advice from cardiologists, exercise specialists, and behavioural scientists; the content was designed to foster behavioural capability, self-efficacy, social support, and realistic outcome expectations. Tutorials were organized to engage self-control processes including exercise planning, goal setting, monitoring and self-regulation, and relapse prevention. A detailed graphical depiction of the intervention is provided in the supplemental data.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec7-1741826711422988"><title>Usual care intervention</title>
<p>The usual care group received physical activity guidance from their attending cardiologist and an education booklet.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="sec8-1741826711422988"><title>Outcomes and follow up</title>
<p>Physical activity levels were objectively measured via pedometer in all participants 6 and 12 months following randomization. Self-reported leisure-time physical activity and heart disease health-related quality of life were assessed in all participants at the baseline and 6- and 12-month visits.</p>
<sec id="sec9-1741826711422988"><title>Pedometer measurement of physical activity</title>
<p>The primary outcome was the average number of steps per day measured by pedometer (Yamax DIGI-WALKER, Yamasa Tokei Keiki, Tokyo, Japan) over a 7-day period. The Digi-Walker has an accuracy within 1% error at walking speeds of 80 m/min.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1741826711422988">11</xref></sup> During each follow-up visit, the research assistant measured the participant's stride length, programmed the pedometer, and provided a log book to record pedometer data each day. Each participant wore the pedometer for a 9-day period; data from the first and last day were discarded. Each participant was provided with a pre-paid envelope to return the pedometer and log book. Guidelines for patients with CHD promote ≥30 minutes of at least moderate-intensity physical activity most days of the week<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1741826711422988">12</xref></sup> in addition to usual daily activities. This equates to 8000–9000 steps per day.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1741826711422988">13</xref></sup></p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec10-1741826711422988"><title>Self-reported leisure-time physical activity</title>
<p>A modified version of the Godin Leisure-Time Exercise Questionnaire<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1741826711422988">9</xref></sup> was used to gather self-reported data concerning leisure-time physical activity. Participants were asked ‘How many days in a typical week in the past 3 months did you do moderate (e.g. fast walking, easy bicycling, easy swimming, dancing) exercise for at least 15 minutes at a time?’ and ‘On the days when you did moderate exercise, how much total time (in minutes) on average did you spend per day doing these moderate exercise(s)?’ The same two questions assessed the frequency and duration of vigorous (e.g. running, jogging) activities. The total minutes of moderate and vigorous exercise per week were calculated. The modified version of the questionnaire has been previously validated in this population by our group.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1741826711422988">14</xref></sup></p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec11-1741826711422988"><title>Heart disease health-related quality of life</title>
<p>Heart disease health-related quality of life was measured using the 27-item MacNew instrument,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1741826711422988">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1741826711422988">15</xref></sup> which measures three quality of life domains (emotional, physical, and social) as well as global quality of life. Questions were answered on a 7-point scale, where ‘1’ represents the lowest quality of life and ‘7’ the highest. The global score was obtained by calculating the average response across all questions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1741826711422988">15</xref></sup> Internal consistency and construct validity of the questionnaire have been assessed and found to be high.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1741826711422988">15</xref></sup> A 0.5-point difference has been established as the minimally important difference for the MacNew subscales and global score.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1741826711422988">10</xref></sup></p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="sec12-1741826711422988"><title>Statistical analysis</title>
<p>Baseline characteristics were compared between groups to identify any chance differences. Missing outcome values were replaced by multiple imputations after confirming that the data were missing at random. Covariates were examined to determine if they were significantly related with the outcomes. Significant covariates were then controlled for in the primary analyses. In the primary analysis, repeated measures analysis of covariance was used to compare differences in steps per day over the 7-day pedometer recording period between groups (CardioFit and usual care) over time (6 and 12 months). Similar analyses were performed for the secondary outcomes of leisure-time physical activity and heart disease health-related quality of life. Analyses were performed using SPSS version 17.0 (SPSS Inc, Chicago, Illinois).</p>
<sec id="sec13-1741826711422988"><title>Sample size</title>
<p>Sample size calculations indicated a final sample of 200 participants would give 80% power (α = 0.05; 2-tailed) to detect a difference of 1000 steps per day measured by pedometer, assuming a standard deviation of 2500 steps.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1741826711422988">16</xref></sup> Other research has shown that the odds of having metabolic syndrome are 10% lower for each additional 1000 steps per day.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1741826711422988">17</xref></sup> A pilot test showed the mean number of steps per day in 34 patients with heart disease not receiving a physical activity intervention was 6612 ± 2638 steps 6 months after hospital discharge.</p>

<p>From December 2004 to December 2007, 589 patients met study eligibility criteria (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1741826711422988">Figure 1</xref>) and 223 (38.0%) consented to participate. Among consenting participants, 115 were randomized to CardioFit and 108 to usual care. Among these, 223 completed the baseline assessment; 154 completed the 6-month assessment and 153 completed the 12-month assessment. Baseline characteristics of randomized study participants are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1741826711422988">Table 1</xref>. The mean age was 56.4 years, 84.3% were men, 14.3% were current smokers, and mean body mass index was 29.3 kg/m<sup>2</sup>. Most participants were working full time (52.9%) or part time (10.3%) outside of the home. This was the first cardiac event for 64.6% of participants; a myocardial infarction precipitated the hospital admission in 29.3% of participants. The two study groups were similar when demographic and clinical factors and pre-hospitalization levels of leisure-time physical activity were compared (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1741826711422988">Table 1</xref>).

<p>All participants (100%) assigned to CardioFit completed the in-hospital visit with the exercise specialist and received their personally tailored physical activity plan. The mean number of online tutorials completed by CardioFit participants was 2.7 of a maximum five, and 61.7% of participants completed at least three of the five tutorials (pre-specified adherence threshold). Completion rates for the tutorials at 2, 4, 8, 14, and 20 weeks were 70, 64, 56, 47, and 43%, respectively. Thirty-seven CardioFit participants emailed the exercise specialist at least once and a total of 123 emails were received during the intervention period. Of those emailing the specialist at least once, the average number of emails was 3.3 (range 1−8). Subjects raised in email correspondence included: how to exercise, 30; technical difficulties, 30; clearance to resume exercise, 23; missed tutorials or logging of physical activity, 21; symptoms, 13; and other information unrelated to physical activity, 6.</p>

<sec id="sec17-1741826711422988"><title>Effectiveness of CardioFit programme</title>
<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1741826711422988">Table 2</xref> shows the effectiveness of the CardioFit programme expressed in terms of pedometer-measured steps per day over a 7-day period as well as self-reported leisure-time physical activity at 6- and 12-month follow up. Preliminary analyses showed that age, physical activity level prior to hospitalization, first hospitalization for CHD, and being employed were significantly related to pedometer outcomes at follow up; these variables were used as covariates for subsequent analyses of pedometer data. The repeated measures analysis of covariance for pedometer-measured steps per day showed a main effect only for group. The number of steps per day was higher in the CardioFit group compared to usual care.

<p>Preliminary analyses showed that physical activity level prior to hospitalization, and first hospitalization for CHD were significantly related to self-reported physical activity at follow up; these variables were used as covariates for subsequent analyses related to self-reported activity. The repeated measures analysis of covariance for self-reported leisure-time physical activity showed a main effect only for group. Minutes of leisure physical activity were greater in the CardioFit group compared to usual care.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1741826711422988">Table 3</xref> shows the effectiveness of the CardioFit programme expressed in terms of heart disease health-related quality of life.

<p>Our results showed that the use of the CardioFit internet-based physical activity expert system significantly increased objectively measured and self-reported physical activity compared to usual care in participants with CHD. The emotional and physical dimensions of heart disease health-related quality of life, 6 and 12 months after hospitalization, were also higher with CardioFit compared to usual care. This is the first large-scale trial of an internet-based physical activity intervention for patients with CHD to be reported.</p>
<p>Across the two time points, CardioFit participants took an average of 764 more steps per day than usual care participants. This translates to an absolute difference of 12% in objectively measured physical activity. Increases in physical activity of this magnitude are clinically important because higher levels of leisure-time activity energy expenditure are associated with improvements in cardiorespiratory fitness and symptoms and less disease progression in patients with known CHD.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1741826711422988">18</xref></sup> Leisure-time physical activity levels independently predict long-term survival in men and women with chronic stable CHD.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1741826711422988">19</xref></sup> Most of the benefits of regular physical activity for CHD patients are the result of improvements in endothelial function.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1741826711422988">20</xref></sup> The results for the CardioFit intervention can also be compared to the effects of participation in cardiac rehabilitation. At the end of the intervention period, CardioFit participants recorded 7079 ± 3159 pedometer steps per day, reported 201 ± 153 minutes of moderate and vigorous leisure-time physical activity per week, and had global quality of life scores measured by the MacNew instrument of 5.8 ± 0.7 points. These values compare favourably to the 6752 ± 2659 steps per day,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1741826711422988">21</xref></sup> 191 ± 191 minutes of physical activity per week,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1741826711422988">14</xref></sup> and global quality of life scores of 5.7 ± 1.2 points<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1741826711422988">22</xref></sup> associated with participation in structured cardiac rehabilitation programmes. The effect size (i.e. the difference between experimental and control groups divided by the pooled standard deviation; 0.28 at 6 months and 0.19 at 12 months) for the CardioFit intervention for measured physical activity is similar to effect sizes reported in reviews of other internet-based physical activity interventions;<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1741826711422988">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1741826711422988">7</xref></sup> these reviews show that approximately one-half of the controlled trials of internet-based physical activity interventions have reported positive behavioural outcomes. The effect size of the CardioFit intervention on physical activity was also similar to recently reported trial of telephone-based motivational counselling aimed at participants with CHD not planning on attending cardiac rehabilitation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1741826711422988">23</xref></sup></p>
<p>Strengths of this study include the randomized design and the objective measurement of physical activity by pedometer that was corroborated by a self-report measure of physical activity. Many previous studies of internet-based interventions have relied solely on self-reported physical activity data.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1741826711422988">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1741826711422988">7</xref></sup> There were some study limitations. First, the measurement of physical activity may have increased participants’ awareness of their physical activity habits and influenced their activity participation during the measurement period. While the pedometer provided an objective measurement of each participant's physical activity level (which is superior to reliance on self-reports), it is possible that participants increased their activity only for the 9-day measurement period. We discarded activity data from the first and last day of the pedometer reporting period to mitigate this effect. Second, we observed greater attrition in this study than in previous trials measuring the effects of comprehensive cardiac rehabilitation programmes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1741826711422988">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1741826711422988">24</xref></sup> Others have also reported high attrition rates from internet-based physical activity interventions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1741826711422988">7</xref></sup> Third, our participants were highly educated (mean years of education, 14.3 years) and the sample consisted mostly of men (84.3%). This may limit the generalizability of our findings to those who are less well educated or to women. Lastly, the patients’ participation in the programme was not directly observed; therefore, exercise adherence may have been exaggerated by some participants.</p>
<p>This study has important implications for delivery of the physical activity component of cardiac rehabilitation and secondary prevention services to patients with diagnosed CHD. The reach of most current approaches to rehabilitation and secondary prevention is constrained by the cost and time required of both patients and professionals and the limited availability of programmes for those who work, live in rural areas, are homebound, or do not want or cannot afford to participate in group physical activity programmes. The CardioFit programme is available on demand and is not constrained by geographic proximity to a monitoring centre. It is an efficient way to monitor patient status, collect data, and provide tailored feedback and self-managed counselling. The CardioFit programme was found to improve not only objectively measured physical activity, but also to improve the quality of life in patients with CHD who were not planning to participate in structured cardiac rehabilitation. Future studies are required to confirm the long-term effects of this intervention and to examine effects on morbidity and mortality. There is also a need to enhance the CardioFit programme to improve engagement and retention over time. The CardioFit system may provide a cost-effective way to expand the physical activity programming reach of cardiac rehabilitation and secondary prevention services for patients who may not typically participate in these programmes.</p>
