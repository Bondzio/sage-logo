<p>The once constant of realm of teacher preparation is being challenged at a rapid pace. National discussions on teacher education revolve around who, what, where, and how questions: Who is best equipped to prepare teachers? What are the essential elements of preparation? Where should this preparation be occurring? How should preparation programs be evaluated? Questions from those engaged in the practice of teacher preparation, however, tend to tackle issues that reflect the complexity and idiosyncrasy of the task. These questions focus on the intersection of methods, practices, content, demography, and standards. Ultimately, whether from the <italic>50,000-foot</italic> view or the view from the trenches, research on teacher education serves to answer the question: “What is a high quality teacher?” The answer to this question will determine the future methods, quality, quantity, and funding of teacher preparation programs (TPPs).</p>
<p>The purpose of this column is to translate what we have found in research to the practice of preparing high-quality teachers—particularly the preparation of special educators who work with students with high-incidence disabilities. Certainly, the history of teacher preparation has not been static, yet the convergence of several factors makes many in the field feel as though we are entering a new era of teacher education. From the high-stakes evaluation of TPPs to the changing role of accreditation and certification to the emergence of alternative pathways for preparation, innovation and excellence in teacher education are being defined in new ways. This column will serve as a forum for exploring and substantiating practices that move the field forward within these new contexts.</p>
<sec id="section1-1053451212472235">
<title>Evaluation of Teacher Preparation Programs and Teachers</title>
<p>Teacher preparation programs increasingly will be held accountable for the performance of their graduates’ students (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1053451212472235">Aldeman, Carey, Dillon, Miller, &amp; Silva, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1053451212472235">Koedel, Parsons, Podgursky, &amp; Ehlert, 2012</xref>). Under the State Fiscal Stabilization Fund (SFSF) established by the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, states received more than $39 billion in federal aid. As a condition of the funding, states were required to develop or improve on longitudinal data systems with the ability to link student and teacher data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1053451212472235">Noell &amp; Kowalski, 2010</xref>). The development of the longitudinal data systems was guided, in part, by the Data Quality Campaign’s (DQC) 10 Essential Elements of Statewide Longitudinal Data Systems. The DQC, founded in 2005 as an independent, nonprofit organization, established the Essential Elements as a guide for states in an effort to reduce duplication and improve data quality and use (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1053451212472235">DQC, 2012</xref>). Element 5 of the Essential Elements is the presence of a teacher identifier and the capacity to match teachers to students within a state data system. In addition to creating systems that had the capacity to link student and teacher data, as a part of SFSF state governors also committed to (a) use longitudinal data to develop teacher impact reports, (b) provide student growth reports to teachers for the purpose of improving instruction, and (c) describe how student performance data would or would not be used in their state teacher evaluation systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1053451212472235">Noell &amp; Kowalski, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>Similarly, the federal Race to the Top (RTTT) competition (funded after the SFSF) required states to include teacher preparation accountability measures by specifically asking states to
<disp-quote>
<p>link student achievement and student growth . . . data to the students’ teachers and principals, to link this information to the in-state programs where those teachers and principals were prepared for credentialing, and to publicly report the data for each credentialing program in the state. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1053451212472235">U.S. Department of Education, 2009</xref>, p. 10)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In two rounds of funding (2010 and 2011), 11 states and the District of Columbia were awarded RTTT funding. As a result of SFSF and RTTT federal infusions of funds to states and the requirements that accompanied this funding, as of 2012, 36 states had implemented all 10 Essential Elements and 51 states had implemented at least 8 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1053451212472235">DQC, 2012</xref>). Clearly, states have made a significant investment in these data systems; future research and practice in teacher education will occur within the context of this new reality. As these broader policies are being implemented, the field can take the opportunity to advocate for the appropriate use of these new data and make inroads into how new data opportunities could allow for the improvement of TPPs.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-1053451212472235">
<title>The Evaluation of Teachers</title>
<p>Of course, at the core of TPP evaluations is the evaluation of teachers. Broad-based research has demonstrated the importance and influence of the classroom-level teacher (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1053451212472235">Goldhaber, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1053451212472235">Hanushek, 1999</xref>). In a landmark study in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1053451212472235">1998</xref>, Sanders and Horn demonstrated how the presence or absence of a high-quality teacher can have a significant impact on a student’s learning trajectory. This particular teacher-effectiveness research is based on value-added modeling (VAM). VAM takes into account students’ past scores to predict their future performance. When a student scores higher than predicted, the teacher (or school or TPP, depending on the level of analysis) is said to have “added value” to the education of that student.</p>
<p>Opportunities as well as important limitations exist in the use of VAM for the evaluation of teachers and TPPs. Opportunities for instructional change and program improvement are among the potential advantages. Yet VAM is not a panacea; limitations do exist. These include the following:</p>
<list id="list1-1053451212472235" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>Methodological concerns; for example, differences in statistical models generate different results, results on teachers who teach fewer students generate more unreliable scores</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Practical concerns; for example, not all teachers teach subjects that have a test, team teaching and coteaching models of instructional delivery confound the system, and unmeasured school or community factors may play a role</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Theoretical concerns; for example, are student achievement data the best measure of teacher quality (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1053451212472235">Floden, 2012</xref>, for a more detailed description of opportunities and limitations of VAM)?</p></list-item>
</list>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1053451212472235">Gansle, Noell, and Burns (2012)</xref>, however, point out that many challenges that exist when using VAM for the evaluation of individual teachers are mitigated when using VAM for the evaluation of TPPs. Assessment of multiple teachers across time over many schools increases the robustness of the results generated through VAM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1053451212472235">Gansle et al., 2012</xref>). This could be most beneficial for states and districts that draw from a core group of TPPs. As states move forward with TPP evaluation systems, research will begin to explore the issues raised by VAM assessments: If a TPP (or alternative pathway) consistently produces teachers who have a positive effect on student achievement, which features of the program are attributable to that outcome? Certainly, VAM necessitates the complementary qualitative analysis that would shed light on the sources of difference.</p>
<p>Finally, research on teacher evaluation is not simply limited to VAM. Other options for evaluating TPPs include (a) input (i.e., faculty qualifications and enrollment data), (b) output (i.e., teacher effectiveness, teacher practice, and surveys), and (c) process (i.e., program selectivity, content, and structure) measures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1053451212472235">National Comprehensive Center for Teacher Quality, 2012</xref>). Research on these approaches will continue to illuminate opportunities (i.e., those measures that provide sufficient detail to serve as a catalyst for specific programmatic changes) and challenges (i.e., those measures that rely too heavily on idiosyncratic data that make reliability difficult).</p>
<p>TPPs and their associated professional organizations are already taking an active role in how changes in teacher evaluation are taking place. The Council for Exceptional Children (CEC) proffered a set of recommendations on how to best evaluate the performance of special educators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1053451212472235">CEC, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1053451212472235">Shah, 2012</xref>). The recommendation from CEC for multiple indicators of performance echoes recommendations and cautions offered by those engaged in VAM research (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1053451212472235">Goldhaber, 2010</xref>). The new era of teacher education will reflect the multiple ways in which teacher quality will be measured and the responsiveness of TPPs to those evaluations.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-1053451212472235">
<title>Accreditation and Certification in Teacher Education</title>
<p>Historically, states have held TPPs accountable through approval, accreditation, and certification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1053451212472235">Coggshall, Bivona, &amp; Reschly, 2012</xref>). Yet criticisms of these processes exist, and data have been inconclusive on the ability of these systems to influence teacher quality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1053451212472235">Levine, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1053451212472235">National Research Council, 2010</xref>). The national picture of teacher preparation is that (a) teachers feel unprepared for teaching on entering the classroom and (b) the overall quality of teachers can be improved on (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1053451212472235">Coggshall et al., 2012</xref>). States and accreditation agencies have responded to these criticisms. In 2012, two accrediting agencies (National Council for the Accreditation of Teachers and Teacher Education Accreditation Council) merged to form CAEP, the Council for Accreditation of Educator Preparation. The goal of this new accrediting body is to increase quality and accountability of TPPs.</p>
<p>Amid the changing landscape of teacher accreditation and certification, new organizations have entered the fray and are beginning to influence teacher preparation as well. Nonprofit organizations such as the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1053451212472235">Behavior Analyst Certification Board (2012)</xref> are already approving board certified behavior analyst programs within TPPs across the country and providing external credentialing to graduates who meet program requirements. Similarly, the International Dyslexia Association has recently released its set of standards and is looking to offer certification based on TPPs adoption of their standards (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1053451212472235">International Dyslexia Association, 2012</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1053451212472235">
<title>Pathways for Teacher Preparation</title>
<p>The federal push for greater accountability of TPPs is also part and parcel of a move to expand the options for teacher preparation beyond colleges of education. One of the requirements of states receiving RTTT funds was to expand credentialing options. Teach for America and the New Teacher Project are frequently cited as model, alternative pathways to certification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1053451212472235">Center for American Progress, U.S. Chamber of Commerce Institute for a Competitive Workforce, &amp; Hess, 2009</xref>). Many states that received RTTT funds included specific goals for the creation of alternative routes to certification as a part of their application. Under Congress’s 2010 Continuing Resolution, teachers who are in alternative certification programs can receive the “highly qualified” status on <italic>entry</italic> into the programs, in contrast to teacher candidates from traditional TPPs who would be eligible for HQ status on <italic>completion</italic> of their program. As these new certification programs enter the discussion, the importance of CAPE and the field’s ability to find better methods of evaluation become even more important and pressing in finding better methods of evaluation.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1053451212472235">
<title>Innovations and Excellence in Research on Teacher Education</title>
<p>In addition to these external factors that are influencing the practice of teacher education, research on innovations and excellence conducted by those engaged in teacher preparation continues to expand. Beginning in 2007, the Office of Special Education programs funded more than 70 high-incidence TPPs to improve, innovate, and redesign their preparation program. Data from these programs can provide another source of evidence on effective teacher education.</p>
<p>A shift toward increasing the emphasis on clinical components of teacher preparation is occurring as well. A reinvigoration of the role of practice-focused teacher education (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1053451212472235">Ball &amp; Cohen, 1999</xref>) is reflected in political rhetoric (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1053451212472235">Aldeman et al., 2011</xref>) and in research. Data from studies that reflect excellence in teacher education come from a deep examination of how teachers are prepared. Grossman et al. (2009) discussed how research on teacher education uses the concepts of representation, decomposition, and approximation to research the practice of preparing teachers. Representations (e.g., stories, cases, videos, artifacts of teaching, and student performance), decompositions, that is, the identification of the component parts that make up the whole of teaching that allow for the development of complex practices (e.g., lesson planning, subskills on teacher observation tools), and approximations (e.g., peer teaching, model demonstration lessons, student teaching) provide a rich source of models of excellence.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1053451212472235">
<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>The 1998 Higher Education Act required states to hold TPPs accountable for the quality of teachers they produce, but similar to the 1994 reauthorization of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA), Improving America’s Schools Act, it was a law with no teeth, and programs consistently identified as “low performing” continue to prepare teachers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1053451212472235">Aldeman et al., 2011</xref>). Just as No Child Left Behind added the teeth in terms of true consequences for schools that failed to meet standards, new legislation in higher education, such as the withholding of funds for nonperforming TPPs, will bring about real consequences for higher education. Coming down the lane in teacher education will be a reauthorization of ESEA, followed by reauthorizations of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act and the Higher Education Act. These laws will invariably hold new or expanded requirements that will affect teacher education. The adoption of the Common Core State Standards (CCSS) will also bring new challenges and opportunities to the process of preparing special educators (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1053451212472235">Moats, 2012</xref>, for a discussion of the CCSS and the instruction of students with learning disabilities). Regardless of teeth or carrots, TPPs will have access to and influence on how new data and methods of accountability can be used to study, inform, advocate, and implement the coming changes. During these times of rapid change, this column will provide a venue for exploring and understanding the issues as well as providing concrete guidelines readers expect from <italic>Intervention</italic> on how to engage, align, and raise the bar for effective TPPs.</p>
