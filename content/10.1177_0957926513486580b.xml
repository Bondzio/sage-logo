<p>David Machin’s book is a multimodal semiotic analysis of various genres of pop music stemming primarily from the English-speaking world. Pop music is understood here as the music input we are exposed to in our daily lives. Throughout the whole text, music is treated as a discursive system, which is communicated multimodally through sounds, lyrics and visuals. In other words, in order to be able to analyze music, Machin argues in favor of the need to flesh out the ‘kinds of semiotic resources and patterns available for communication in the sounds, images and worlds of popular music’ (p. 3).</p>
<p>After his introductory discussion of the two main theoretical traditions on which his analysis draws, namely critical discourse analysis and multimodal semiotics, in Chapter 1 he tackles discourses of popular music. The main argument put forward is that the meaning of music does not reside in the sounds themselves but rather in the sociocultural aspects thereof, that is to say in the discourses that are relevant to these sounds. What this means is that people have different ways to think and talk about music, and these are the very ways that are the focus of this chapter. More specifically, various discourses are discussed: authenticity, namely to what extent music is produced from the soul and its performance is sincere or contrived; the correlation between music and the body–mind distinction; the motivation and level of knowledge of those who evaluate music; the issue of balancing creativity and adherence to the rules of marketing; and finally, the association of music with subcultures. The second chapter, which takes a purely multimodal semiotic analytical stance, focuses on the iconography used in record sleeves of various pop music artists. More specifically, it delves into the connotations and meaning potentials conveyed through visual designs, including poses, gaze, social distance of the artists from the audience, objects, settings and salience, as well as through different scales of visual modality through which artists convey social meanings. Building on the second chapter, in the third Machin deals with the visual composition of record sleeves by foregrounding issues related to typeface and color. He explores the dimensions along with the communicative functions of colors side by side with the social meanings and social identities that various pop music bands construct through typography. In Chapter 4, the focus shifts to the discursive analysis of lyrics. The argument put forward is that a description and interpretation of the discourses communicated through the structure of a song can be achieved by considering aspects such as and activity schemata, coupled with participants and their agency, whose understanding heavily depends on the sociopolitical context. Chapter 5 analyzes paralinguistic features of the sound with a special focus on the meanings and direction of pitch, the notes of the melody and the ways these notes construct musical phrases. Echoing the previous chapter, the main argument made is that discourses are conveyed not only through the lyrics but also through the sound thereof. Chapter 6 expands on Chapter 5 by suggesting that sound quality and rhythm realize meaning potentials precisely because, in the conscience of people, they are associated with specific sociocultural contexts, identities and styles of expression. Chapter 7 brings together the analytical toolkit, which was presented in the previous two chapters, in order to analyze and interpret the peculiar discourses associated with the genre of Britpop in the 1990s. Chapters 8 and 9 analyze music as used in films, music videos and television respectively by putting forward the idea that pitch, melody, sound quality and sound modality act synergistically to construct the action and the plot, the motifs associated with the characters, the setting(s) and continuity, namely whether the sound is realistic or not. Finally, in the conclusion we get a glimpse of the author’s self-reflections on the analysis of music as a system of multimodal semiotic resources employed to index social meanings, identities and social discourses.</p>
<p>The book is very well written and accessible to a wide audience consisting of scholars interested in music, semiotic and discourse analysis as well as lay people who are avid fans of English popular culture. The reason for this is because it analyzes in a simple yet theoretically sound way a wide range of examples ranging from widely known TV series, like <italic>Sex and the City</italic>, to video clips from eminent British bands, such as Oasis, and Hollywood films, including <italic>Cliffhanger</italic>. In addition, the use of music terminology, with which some readers may not be familiar, such as scale and pitch, is made in a transparent way, so the reader does not get overwhelmed with technical notions that might prevent them from following the analytical discussions.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, I would have welcomed a discussion of how the people who consume these products, and the discourses indicated through them, interpret the social meanings revealed through the various semiotic modalities, such as sounds, images and texts. Reception of music is a topic to which the author alludes in the conclusion, but in my opinion it is a vital component of any analysis of popular products, including music. The reason for this is because the very definition of popular music involves people’s preferences, tastes and subsequent influence on its artifacts, including those that have been discussed in the book. Perhaps through the incorporation of an analysis of comments found below YouTube videos or on popular music fans’ webpages, the artificiality of the analysis admitted by the author (p. 214) would have been minimized.</p>
<p>Despite this issue, though, the book is a very interesting and pleasant read, which will appeal to everyone interested in music and its discourses.</p>
