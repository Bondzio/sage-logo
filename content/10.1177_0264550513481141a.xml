<p>This report presents the findings from a research study into the use of polygraph testing across the East and West Midlands Probation areas. The polygraph testing was mandated as part of the 332 participants’ prison licences with the results obtained being compared with research on a comparison group of 303 other sexual offenders on licence. Amongst other things, the research aimed to identify the impact of mandatory polygraph testing on the number and nature of clinically significant disclosures (CSDs) made by offenders, offender manager supervision practices, and perceptions and behaviours among offenders and offender managers. </p>
<p>The accumulated data identified an increase in the number of CSDs made by sexual offenders subject to polygraph testing when compared to the control group. This increase was found to be independent of time spent in supervision, RM2000 risk category, offence type and experience of treatment. Interestingly, the majority of CSDs made were in the ‘change of circumstance/ risky behaviour’ category and tended to occur during pre-polygraph interviews as opposed to routine supervision. </p>
<p>With regards to offender manager decisions, a greater number of sexual offenders were recalled to custody from the polygraph group with just under one third being identified as polygraph related. Offender managers reported finding the polygraph testing useful throughout the period of its use, both for managing offenders in general and also for working with specific individuals. The positivity of offender managers was linked to the perception that the polygraph encouraged disclosure of information relating to risk and also gave them confidence in making judgements about whether offenders were sticking to their licence conditions.</p>
<p>Qualitative research conducted with offender managers from the polygraph group highlighted that all officers expressed a preference for supervision supported by polygraph testing. Perceived advantages included providing an appropriate context for discussing difficult issues, promoting offenders’ understanding of their licence conditions and providing reassurance about the veracity or otherwise of offenders’ statements. With regards to offender perceptions, the majority of offenders stated that the testing made them think more about licence conditions with nearly half identifying that the test raised their inclinations to comply. </p>
<p>Finally, the study aimed to evaluate the usefulness of polygraph testing from an economic perspective. Using the Incremental Cost-Effectiveness Ratio (ICER), it was identified that the cost of an additional CSD as a result of polygraph testing was £556. Taking into account experimental uncertainty it was estimated that the true value of the cost of an additional CSD will range from £400 to £937.50.</p>
<p>On the basis of the research summarized above, the report authors made three recommendations for any potential national roll-out of polygraph testing. First, recognising the costs incurred by the process, it was felt that any future roll-out should focus on those offenders identified as high or very high risk on the Risk Matrix 2000 scale. Second, the model of delivery should involve an initial first test on each offender with randomized follow-up testing. Third, it was identified that costs could be reduced through the provision of in-house training and testing arrangements.</p>
