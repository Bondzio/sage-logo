<abstract>
<p>In recent years, several technological advancements have changed the lives of millions throughout the globe. These include broadband Internet wireless access, advanced mobile platforms and smartphones including accurate global positioning system capabilities, and the introduction of social networks. The fusion of these technological advances led to the massive adoption of mobile platform-operated social networking applications and unleashed new real-time and on-site social information. The ability to generate content anywhere and anytime leads to a detectable projection of real-life events on geo-social networks (GSN). For example, in preparation for a rally, the geo-social activity may precede the actual event, allowing predictive capabilities. Alternatively, in a natural event such as a wildfire, early content generated in the proximity of the event may allow early identification of the event and the assessment of its physical boundaries. In this article, we propose to use the massive and rapidly accumulating information communicated within GSN to identify and track major events and present a proof of concept. We discuss means and methods to retrieve relevant information from the networks, through a set of adequate spatial, temporal, and textual filters. Our preliminary empirical results corroborate our assumptions and show that major events may have detectable “abnormal” impact on GSN activities, which allows prompt identification and real-time tracking. Our approach is expected to pave the way to the development of real-time systems and algorithms for early identification and geographical tracking of major events.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The extent of using social networks has been dramatically increased in recent years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0894439313483689">Swartz, 2011</xref>). From research focusing on a thorough survey of U.S. population, it is evident that 47% of American adults use at least one social network (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0894439313483689">Hampton, Goulet, Rainie, &amp; Purcell, 2011</xref>). Moreover, the average age of the users has shifted from 33 years in 2008 to 38 years in 2010. These data indicate a growing usage of social networks by adult and mature segments of the population. According to another research, which took place in 2011, 65% of Internet users in the United States constantly use social networks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0894439313483689">Madden &amp; Zickuhr, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>It is only natural that the information within digital social networks may be used to identify events and trends in reality. A research in epidemiology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0894439313483689">Christakis &amp; Fowler, 2010</xref>) stated that the analysis of the health condition of “central members” (members with significant influence and activity) in a social network, which are located in certain geographical areas, allows early detection of contagious outbreaks. Similarly, the information on Twitter, with respect to flu, was found to be highly correlated to the information held by the health authorities in the United Kingdom (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0894439313483689">Lampos &amp; Cristianini, 2010</xref>). Here too, the option of early detection using a social network was suggested.</p>
<p>In the field of finance, it was shown that the mood as reflected by social network messages is correlated and even predictive of large-scale financial indicators such as the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA). Specifically, the “Network mood” was said to predict the daily changes in the closing value of the DJIA with a surprising accuracy of 87.6% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0894439313483689">Bollen, Mao, &amp; Zeng, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>The importance and usefulness of social networks in disaster management was evident already in 2007, following an empirical analyses of the information exchanged between people during the great wildfire disaster in southern California (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0894439313483689">Sutton, Palen, &amp; Shklovski, 2008</xref>). Within 2 weeks, over 1,500 buildings and 500,000 acres were burned down, and a massive evacuation of the population took place. The analysis showed that social networks, although less common during that time, were the most effective tool for the real-time understanding of the situation, compared to traditional technologies (e.g., television, printed press, and Internet).</p>
<p>In the 2010 Haiti earthquake, in which over 300,000 lives were lost, social networks were first used as the main knowledge sharing mechanism of the American rescue forces and agencies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0894439313483689">Yates &amp; Paquette, 2011</xref>). Post disaster analyses show a significant decrease in the duration of the decision-making process and an improvement in decision quality based on more diverse and accurate information. Moreover, it was found that local residents and rescue forces made massive use of social media to obtain and provide all important updates based on uploading pictures, writing blogs, sending messages, and uploading videos to YouTube. Also, the massive flow of information, related to the disaster, generated in social media, led to an unprecedented collection of $8 million within 48 hrs only (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0894439313483689">Morgan, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0894439313483689">Muralidharan, Rasmussen, Patterson, &amp; Shin, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>Social networks are indeed a “natural” tool for disaster management. The Ushahidi network was developed in Kenya in 2008 following the severe violent events that took place in the country in late 2007 during the Kenya crisis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0894439313483689">British Red Cross, 2011</xref>). The network was designed for the collection of relevant information from the public (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0894439313483689">Okolloh, 2009</xref>). It was developed using open sources and allows the gathering of information related to hazards, acts of violence, and disasters. The information is obtained mostly through blogs and feeds and is posted on the website after a short manual verification process. A more recent application, Crowdmap, organizes and presents the information above in a multilayer fashion and further allows more advanced geographic personalization options for the presentation.</p>
<p>The geographical-based presentation gives such networks a significant advantage over standard social networks (e.g., Facebook) that are not optimized for major events or disasters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0894439313483689">Keay, 2010</xref>). In the 2011 tsunami disaster in Japan, social networks were employed extensively. In areas where the wire line infrastructure was damaged and out of order, cellular connectivity continued to power mobile Internet, and social networks including Facebook, Twitter, and voice over Internet protocol applications such as Skype played a major role in connecting people (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0894439313483689">Gao, Barbier, &amp; Goolsby, 2011</xref>). The widespread social networks together with their inherent broadcasting capabilities makes them a vital tool in times of disaster. Straightforward applications include informing victims on locations where food and water are supplied or where help is available and communication between victims, even through the formation of ad hoc communities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0894439313483689">Merchant, Elmer, &amp; Lurie, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0894439313483689">White, Plotnick, Kushma, &amp; Hiltz, 2009</xref>).</p>
<sec id="section2-0894439313483689">
<title>Geo-Social Networks</title>
<p>With the rapid increase in the adoption of smartphones worldwide and the abundance of broadband mobile Internet connectivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0894439313483689">comScore, 2011</xref>), it is only natural that the use of social networks based on mobile platforms also grows. A recent study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0894439313483689">comScore, 2012</xref>) indicates that 64.2 million U.S. citizens use their mobile devices for social networking, with more than half of them doing so “almost every day.” The overall number of people experiencing social networks through their phones or tablets is surging. Specifically, this indicates a 77% increase in 2011 compared to the year before.</p>
<p>Using social networks on mobile platforms is a “game changer.” Mobile social networks allow users to create data immediately and on-site rather than waiting until they arrive at their computer (e.g., their residence, Internet cafes, or workplace). Moreover, mobile platforms include technologies that allow a reasonable estimate of the platforms location (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0894439313483689">Tsou &amp; Kim, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0894439313483689">Xue, Cracknell, &amp; Guo, 2002</xref>). These technologies include identifying the serving WiFi hot spot, positioning through radio frequency range estimation respective to WiFi hot spots and cellular base stations, and obviously the most common global positioning system (GPS) which has a de facto standard in mobile platforms. The fusion of the capability to generate content anywhere, together with accurate positioning, allows to define the social media content in terms of time and space (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0894439313483689">Sui &amp; Goodchild, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>Geo-social networks (GSNs) are a new type of social network in which the geographical location and data play a dominant role. Here, connections between members are formed dynamically according to the instantaneous geographical locations. GSNs such as Foursquare, Yelp, and Gowallaare gaining evergrowing popularity. The prevailing networks such as Facebook and Twitter also include features pertaining to location. This makes them GSNs and allows members to establish connections based on instantaneous positioning.</p>
<p>Computerized maps run on mobile platforms, usually in conjunction with up-to-date information tagged to a predefined geographical area, allow groups of members to exchange geographically relevant information (e.g., concerning the quality of a restaurant in their vicinity) and even coordinate meetings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0894439313483689">Noulas &amp; Mascolo, 2010</xref>; Quercia &amp; Capra, 2009). A screen snapshot of "Find my friends'' mobile application is given in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0894439313483689">Figure 1</xref>. Note that the digital map includes accurate self-positioning and the locations of nearby members including the distance to each one of them.</p>

<title>Using GSN Data to Identify and Track Events</title>
<p>The massive and rapidly accumulating information in GSNs, may be used to identify and track major events. The rationale here is that major events may have a significant impact on the activities of social networks, which are becoming a major communication instrument between people. More specifically, this assumes that major events and disasters may be identified by detecting “abnormal surges” in GSNs dispatch activity. In “regular” social networks, this abnormal activity is associated with a finite time period (e.g., during and after a major event took place). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0894439313483689">Sakaki, Okazaki, and Matsuo (2010)</xref> suggest even the use of such information in instances of earthquakes. The geographical dimension within GSNs allows the identification and analysis of activities both in time and in space domains. Here, the “geographical location” of the content (place off “dispatch”) adds a significant and important new dimension of information, which allows for more accurate and robust identification of events.</p>
<p>Once identified, major events and disasters may be monitored and assessed using the information originating from the GSNs themselves. Here, the geographical positioning also plays a dominant role as this may allow assessing the density and “physical boundaries” of the event or disaster. Moreover, GSNs that are usually based on mobile platforms (e.g., mobile smartphones) allow the flow of accurate real-time and on site information as reported by observers who were physically present at the place and time of the events unfolding. The qualitative semantic data and information embedded in the GSN communications were quantitatively analyzed here in order to extract in real time, as much as possible, significant events and monitor them. This means that GSN communications content is to be further processed and normalized to allow these quantitative analyses. For example, an abnormal surge in terms of location and time, of content including the phrase “wildfire” may indeed indicate the start of a wildfire in that particular geographical location. Naturally, in order to detect such abnormal density, one should be equipped with the “normal” magnitude of usage of the phrase, and with means to identify and isolate (i.e., filter) content including the phrase (preferably in the right context in case of ambiguity). These “normal” thresholds will differ from network to network and country to country.</p>
<p>A system that is designed to identify and track events and disasters is envisaged here, based on a set of predefined key words that are scanned online (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0894439313483689">Whittaker, 2012</xref>). This preliminary process allows to dramatically reduce the content volume (e.g., number of messages) considered for further processing and analyses. Any practical system cannot address all of the content in a given GSN. Therefore, key word-based filtering is an essential first step in retrieving the information from the GSN servers through a search engine, like interface. It is further assumed here that each piece of content is accompanied by additional information such as time and location stamp, user information, and so on. Human language includes many ambiguities. A semantic analysis of the content may also be considered in order to rule out segments that are irrelevant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0894439313483689">Mika, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0894439313483689">Ye, Shou, Lee, Yin, &amp; Janowicz, 2011</xref>). For example, frequently quoted messages in social networks are taken from a popular song “There’s a fire burning in my heart.” These should be filtered out from the relevant content associated with the word “fire.” This semantic analysis is not necessarily an easy task. Yet, with the geographical information and statistical analyses, these issues may be solved, as proposed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0894439313483689">Xu, Bhargava, Nowak, and Zhu (2012)</xref> and by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0894439313483689">Lampos and Cristianini (2012)</xref>.</p>
<p>Different pieces of content may be associated with significantly different confidence or ranking. For example, in case of a wildfire, content generated indoors (possibly physically remote) may be given lower ranking than content generated by a member located outdoors in the proximity of the wildfire itself. This, for example, may be determined according to the availability of GPS, indicating outdoor usage and the device’s operating system, indicating whether the device is mobile. Finally, if GPS data are available, further confidence parameters may be associated with content generated at the proximity of the related event.</p>
<p>The feedback and activity stemming from specific content may also be used to enhance the ranking process. Specifically, content that creates a large volume of feedback (e.g., many retweets in Twitter or comments in Facebook) may be considered more substantial. Feedback may also allow determining whether it is coherent with the original content. For example, in the case where comments contradict a certain message, it may be associated with lower ranking and vice versa. A quick and approximate method to estimate this coherence may be based on sentiment analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0894439313483689">Pang &amp; Lee, 2008</xref>).</p>

<title>Preliminary Empirical Results and Proof of Concept</title>
<sec id="section5-0894439313483689" sec-type="methods">
<title>Method</title>
<p>In order to corroborate the assumption that events may be identified and tracked using GSNs, social network content originating in the temporal proximity of events which actually took place in the country was gathered in a “future history” approach. With this approach, the information is gathered during or immediately following the event including a short time period before the event actually occurred. By this, one may “predict” and immediately may confirm a good or decline a prediction model.</p>
<p>In many relatively small (area wise) countries, focusing on content originating in the whole country serves as a geographical filter, and turns the social networks, capable of such filtering into a coarse GSN. These can further be filtered by selecting messages only in a particular language. In Israel, both filtering schema work just fine.</p>
<p>More specifically, in this preliminary analysis, the Twitter’s application programming interface (API) was used to efficiently retrieve messages. This API allows screening communications according to geographical location, time, and key words, among other attributes.</p>
<p>The following method for the analysis was chosen: Actual significant events that took place in Israel were considered, and their relevant time line was recorded. For each event, according to its nature, a set of relevant key words and phrases in Hebrew was chosen. For example, for an earthquake event, the following key words were used: “earthquake,” “injured,” “wounded,” and “collapsed.” These key words and relevant time frame were used to retrieve Tweets from Twitter’s API.</p>
<p>The following analysis method was selected for identifying events in five principle areas of interest: natural disasters, man-made disasters, political-state, economic, or social mega events. Possible types of events were determined for each area of interest. For example, “wildfire” and “flooding” as subjects included in the “natural disasters” interest area. A list of relevant key words was established using phrases that were “logical” or “potential” for use related to the specific event type at hand.</p>
<p>When a significant event occurs, the scope of messages transmitted on the web rises significantly and the challenge is to perform a quick and reliable disclosure of the event. Using a large number of key words simultaneously causes a problem of message loading and a greater complexity when analyzing the results. Therefore, for the detection phase, a single and most appropriate key words subset was chosen for each subject. These choices were based on findings that were obtained from analyzing transmissions related to previously known significant events. Following the crystallization of a relevant set of words, an assemblage of several messages for each key word was performed. The assemblage included message documentation for 15 key words over 1 year, May 2011–April 2012.</p>
<p>According to the presented method, a calculation of the average number of messages was performed in a stable state, that is, when no significant event occurred. Based on this, the threshold values of premonition were determined for each key word. This manual decision-making process was performed separately for each event type. Although serving the issue at hand, it would be beneficial to develop a computerized procedure to analyze any key word, in the future.</p>
<p>The threshold detection value of a significant event should be determined at a lower level for a fast detection step. Nevertheless, it is important that the value be high enough in order not to cause any “false alarms.” The normal distribution function, with probability values of 2.5 standard deviations, which is 1% outside the norm, served for the threshold detection. For example, monitoring the word “fire” from May 1, 2011, to April 30, 2012, resolved with 4,306 records. This indicates an average instances value of the phrase “fire” used in “less significant” fire events, as 12 messages per day. For a quick identification of a significant event, the time interval was determined as 1 hr. The number of the resulted 12 average messages per hour was further calculated to be an average of .50 and the standard deviation 1.5 messages per hour. Thus, in this particular case and GSN, the hourly threshold detection value was set to be four messages per hour.</p>

<title>Cross Border Attacks</title>
<p>Cross border attacks took place at the Israel–Egyptian border in August 2011 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0894439313483689">Katz, 2011</xref>). On August 18, a series of attacks took place 12 km north of Eilat in the proximity of the Egyptian border. Militants opened fire on a bus traveling on Highway 12, and later fired on another bus and other vehicles killing 6 and injuring 40 others.</p>
<p>In a pursuit on both sides of the international border, seven of the militants, five Egyptian soldiers, and two Israeli soldiers were killed. Israel retaliated with air assaults on Gaza, and the Palestinians launched rockets on southern Israel in rounds that lasted several days. In this event, the key words used for this event were “missiles,” “shooting,” “casualties,” and “injured.” A count of the relevant messages screened according to these key words and originating from Israel is given in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0894439313483689">Figure 2</xref>. The figure shows an evident peak respective to the key words “casualties” and “injured” on August 18, which is the day the attack took place. The curve for the key word “missiles” exhibits a significant peak around August 21, which is in agreement with the actual rocket attacks on southern Israel. The rocket attacks are also associated with an additional peak for the key word “injured,” again in good agreement with the eventuality where 10 Israelis were injured in these rocket attacks. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0894439313483689">Figure 3</xref> shows that the count in a period that did not include events of rockets fired on Israel is modest.</p>

<title>Wildfire</title>
<p>This event of a wildfire took place on July 17, 2011, in a forest near Jerusalem. The fire spread rapidly and was considered dangerous around 16:00 hr. The first breaking news report was given in a news website at 16:10 hr. For this event, a single key word of “wildfire” was chosen. This event was reflected very well by the activity on “Twitter,” in a very timely fashion, which suggests “early warning” capabilities implied by the approach presented in this article. The first relevant message was sent at 16:03 hr, 7 min prior to the first report in the media. The message included the phrase, “Does anybody smell a wildfire?” and was created by a user affiliated with a workplace in the Jerusalem area. The count respective to the key word “wildfire” is given in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0894439313483689">Figure 4</xref>. One can note that the wildfire was put out on the same day and the relevant activity decreased accordingly to a regular level.</p>

<title>TV Show</title>
<p>
<italic>The Voice Israel</italic> is the Israeli version of an international reality show intended to discover musical talents. The contestants compete over the title “The next voice of Israel.” The show was first broadcast in Israel on January 2012. The opening show of <italic>The Voice Israel</italic> received a rating of 38.9%. Four contestants reached the final stage that took place on March 15, 2012; two male and two female singers, and the winner was chosen after each contestant performed a final song. The winner was determined by counting the votes of home viewers. Voting was enabled by sending text messages with a number representing the preferred candidate.</p>
<p>After the contestants finished performing the song, a commercial was aired and when it terminated the time window given to the public was shut down. Using Twitter, a calculation of messages scope was performed during this event, up to about 5 min before declaring the winner. The messages gathering included the names of the four contestants. Data as described in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0894439313483689">Figure 6</xref> show a significant advantage to the contestant (Katelin) over the other three. Indeed, this contestant (Katelin) was declared “Israel’s next talent.”</p>

<title>Social Justice Protests</title>
<p>The event here is associated with a major social justice protests that took place in Israel in the summer of 2011. These protests, including messages sent within Facebook, were triggered by the increasing cost of living affecting the middle class in the country (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0894439313483689">Lior &amp; Yagna, 2011</xref>). Within this high-profile protest, a series of demonstrations attracting hundreds of thousands of protesters took place within a 2 months’ time period. One of the most interesting questions, which was asked on real time, was whether the protest was gaining or losing momentum.</p>
<p>A significant demonstration, dubbed as the “March of the Million” by its organizers, took place on the Saturday night of September 3, 2011, eventually attracted some 400,000 protesters. Motivated by confrontations with the police, the organizers called for a second massive demonstration which they promised would be the largest demonstration yet.</p>
<p>In order to “predict” whether this indeed would be a larger demonstration, a single key word “demonstration” was chosen. The count of relevant messages in the temporal proximity of both events is given in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0894439313483689">Figure 7</xref>. This figure clearly indicates that the activities prior to the second demonstration were lower than those prior to the first event. As a result, it was estimated in “real time” and beforehand (while it still could be of help to all parties) that the coming second demonstration would attract fewer participants. Eventually, this was indeed the case and much less protesters took part in it (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0894439313483689">Hartman, 2011</xref>). This event is considered by many a turning point that marks the decay of the social justice protest as a whole. Note that here, in contrast with other events considered, this event was intentionally organized and orchestrated by a group of people. Thus, analyses of GSN activities and content may offer a type of “prediction” respective to future actual events.</p>

<title>Discussion and Conclusions</title>
<p>This article advocates the use of massive and rapidly accumulating information embedded within GSN communications to identify and track major events. The key concept here is that due to the wide and evergrowing spread of GSNs, major events have a significant and noticeable impact on GSNs resulting in detectable abnormal geo-social activities. These abnormal activities may be detected in real time and tracked through quantitative analyses of geo-social content based on relevant key words, temporal and spatial filtering. This concept is corroborated by the preliminary empirical results presented. The empirical results that correspond to actual events show that (a) major event indeed result in abnormal surges of social networks activity that is detectable through key word filtering; (b) the identification may be prompt and achieved in real time; and (c) when considering man-made events (e.g., rallies), a certain prediction capability is also evident.</p>
<p>Filtering irrelevant messages is a complex issue. A scan of the messages downloaded was performed, extracting messages that were irrelevant to the issue. Most certainly, a correct choice of key words expressing great use of the same word in texts sent at the start point of a certain event could significantly decrease the scope of irrelevant data gathered. Understanding content through semantic models could improve the speed of understanding the event and decrease false alarms, but this issue was not addressed in this article. Furthermore, when collecting messages related to various events we faced a problem of texts having a sentiment that was the opposite of the one that we were looking for. For example, concerning the TV show event, a message appeared that contained the content “Katelin is screaming!” There is no doubt that such a statement was written by a user who did not support this contestant in winning the show. Nevertheless, of the 845 messages concerning <italic>The Voice TV Show</italic> event that were gathered over the final week, only 11 messages negatively addressed a certain contestant. This value is less than 2% of all the messages gathered on the subject.</p>
<p>Another area expressed in the data but was not yet fully treated here is how to determine parameters for identifying the scope of the event and its impact on the public and environment. Examples presented in this article show that there is a value to the number of messages received. This value should be translated into estimating the scope of the event. For example, do a 100-message per hour, containing the word “fire,” indicate the possibility of the existence of a large fire with a wide impact? Similarly, how does the calculation of the messages’ arrival pace indicate the type of event and the creation process of the event?</p>
<p>Nevertheless, it seems that the additional geographical information within GSNs, driven mostly by the adoption of social networks applications on smartphones and mobile platforms featuring broadband Internet access and GPS positioning, may play a very significant role in the detection and tracking of major events. However, major questions need to be answered in order to pave the way to practical implementation of detection and tracking systems. These questions include the selection of the most adequate GSNs for this application; practical means to retrieve the real-time information from the GSN databases and servers; the definition of static or dynamic sets of relevant key words; and algorithmic implications. These important issues are addressed within an ongoing research, key word selection and analyses being the first.</p>
