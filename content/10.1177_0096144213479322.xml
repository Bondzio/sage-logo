<p>This article explores the role normative sexuality played in housing policies in the San Francisco Bay Area after World War II. Beginning in the 1940s, policymakers made it easier for married Americans to acquire mortgages and excluded most people who deviated from sexual norms from the suburban housing market. Their efforts encouraged Americans to wed and pulled many middle-class married couples out of urban centers like San Francisco. During the 1960s, city leaders used federal funds to displace unmarried residents and to make urban areas competitive with the suburbs. Redevelopment, however, never reversed suburban growth, and the uneven nature of this process created two significant outcomes. First, suburbanization concentrated large numbers of unmarried people, including many gay men and lesbians, in places like San Francisco and facilitated the sexual revolution. Second, metropolitan expansion reinforced the notion that heterosexual norms were nearly universal by creating almost exclusive pockets of married people in the newest suburbs.</p>

<p>When he looked out from his new home in Sunnyvale, California, in the early 1960s, Baby Boomer David Beers saw a wide community of families that seemed just like his own. “Everyone was arriving with a sense of forward momentum,” he recalled in his memoir. “Everyone was taking courage from the sight of another orange moving van pulling in next door, a family just like us unloading pole lamps and cribs and Formica tables like our own.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0096144213479322">1</xref></sup> Like millions of other Americans in the postwar era, Beers and his parents marveled at what they saw as the domestic possibilities of the postwar suburbs, and they relished the opportunity to live among neighbors they deemed like themselves. A similar story, however, unfolded just to the north in San Francisco. Just like the Beers family, tens of thousands of gay men, lesbians, heterosexual singles, sex workers and other residents living outside of heterosexual marriage found common connections with one another near the urban core of the rapidly expanding metropolis. For many married residents and business leaders in San Francisco, the Bay Area’s shifting sexual demographics augured an economic and moral disaster, and they pressured the mayor to transform the “sleazier” parts of the city through policing and urban renewal. “Let’s face it,” complained a realtor in the <italic>San Francisco Examiner</italic>: “We are already at the stage when most people don’t think San Francisco is a good place to bring up a family.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0096144213479322">2</xref></sup></p>
<p>After World War II, places like Sunnyvale and San Francisco sat on different ends of two of the most important sexual migrations in American history, and in both cases, the state played a powerful role in their transformation. Beginning in the 1930s, mortgage policies gave preferential treatment to married borrowers and encouraged the outward migration of tens of millions of married couples like Beers’s parents. Across the country, realtors, local governments, and developers responded to the state’s support for married homebuyers and the long postwar baby boom by marketing entire communities specifically to married couples and their children. At the same time, however, tens of thousands of unmarried migrants, including many gay men and lesbians, remade older cities like San Francisco. Their arrival in the nation’s cities paralleled the steady concentration of many poor residents and people of color in urban centers, and it provoked a massive police crackdown and waves of urban renewal from panicked political leaders. By the mid-1960s, residents and business people in places like Sunnyvale prided themselves on providing wholesome environments for white married couples and their children, while elites in San Francisco and cities across the country demolished old and racially marked neighborhoods in an attempt to make themselves more competitive with the suburbs. Taken together, federal and local policymakers crafted a set of incentives that rewarded Americans for marrying and penalized them for engaging in nonmarital relationships. In the process, the postwar state guided waves of migrations both out to newer suburbs and into older cities.</p>
<p>In the past twenty years, urban historians have thoroughly explored the role the state played in promoting an American-style “apartheid” in residential areas after World War II, and they have cogently argued that beginning in the 1940s many white homeowners persistently associated racial integration with declining schools and plummeting property values.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0096144213479322">3</xref></sup> Historians, however, have only begun to explore the role normative sexuality played in postwar metropolitan development. Although scholars have chronicled the growth of gay, lesbian, bisexual, and transgender communities across the country, almost all studies of sex and cities have focused on groups of Americans who deviated from social norms.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0096144213479322">4</xref></sup></p>
<p>An analysis of government policies, however, not only reveals parallel racial and sexual hierarchies in the postwar housing market but also that mass suburbanization helped create new sexual communities across the entire metropolis. By encouraging normative sexuality through mortgage regulation and by spurring the outward migration of married couples, the state facilitated the meeting of different groups of people in areas defined by marital status. This process never operated with the rigidity of racial segregation, since gay residents have always lived in the suburbs and many married residents continued to live in urban areas. Yet by the mid-1960s, the newest suburbs and older cities boasted unprecedented concentrations of residents divided by marital status and newly built institutions like bars or churches that catered to different sexual communities. People living in these cities or suburbs, gay and straight, exercised varying degrees of agency in the creation of personal relationships and communities. They did so, however, in a metropolitan region increasingly structured by an expanding state. While residents may have possessed the freedom to choose their associations, postwar policies played an important role in determining where they could live and what kinds of people they would meet once they moved there.</p>
<p>Few places dramatized this process more than the San Francisco Bay Area. For decades, scholars and journalists have marveled at the seeming sexual exceptionality of San Francisco, with one historian calling it the “unquestioned gay capital of the United States.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0096144213479322">5</xref></sup> Yet the Bay Area, like metropolises across the country, also witnessed dramatic suburbanization after World War II, and the growth of queer communities near the urban core mirrored similar processes in cities across the country. The second largest metropolitan area in the nation’s most populous state, the San Francisco region encompassed a wide array of sexual communities divided by race, class, and space. As in other parts of the country, the federal intervention in the postwar housing market spurred the outward migration of middle-class, white, straight families, and inadvertently facilitated the meeting of queer communities in older urban areas. By the 1960s, an unprecedented ratio of married people with children lived in the newer parts of Santa Clara County, including Sunnyvale, while San Francisco witnessed the growth of gay and lesbian communities, a heterosexual singles culture, and other sexual groups excluded from the postwar suburbs. City officials dealt with the transformation with a combination of heightened policing and urban renewal in an attempt to make San Francisco more attractive to the married, white, middle-class couples who increasingly settled in places like Santa Clara County.</p>
<p>Of course, their efforts never eradicated the expanding unmarried and gay communities near downtown. Nor did they completely eliminate queer behavior in the suburbs. Viewed together, however, postwar housing policies ultimately created a social and spatial closet around normative heterosexuality. If public officials never created entirely homogenous communities, they nevertheless erected powerful incentives for Americans to publicly adhere to marital heterosexuality. Police raids on gay bars represented key examples of this disciplinary process, yet housing policies, including mortgage insurance, zoning, and redevelopment, also offered authorities powerful tools for the regulation of sexuality that were truly metropolitan in scope. Because this process unfolded unevenly, some places offered greater opportunities for the expression of transgressive sexual desires. Federally funded urban redevelopment projects failed to reverse the shifts set in motion by federally subsidized suburban growth, and by the mid-1960s, the sexual revolution that transformed the ways in which most Americans understood marriage broke out in places like San Francisco. Meanwhile, the steady concentration of married couples in newer suburbs ultimately reinforced the norms promoted by the state. This distillation process, alongside school-based programs on sex and family life education, would ensure that young residents like David Beers would rarely encounter visible alternatives to marital heterosexuality. Even as the sexual revolution rippled out of cities like San Francisco, therefore, the metropolitan dimensions of the closet ensured that marriage and homeownership remained social norms for most of the nation’s middle class well into the twenty-first century.</p>
<sec id="section1-0096144213479322">
<title>Housing and the Straight State</title>
<p>World War II represented a crucial watershed in both the state’s regulation of the housing market and sexual norms. Beginning in the 1940s, Congress expanded New Deal housing programs that subsidized housing construction and made it easier for many Americans to acquire home loans. At the same time, federal, state, and local governments heightened their surveillance of gay men and lesbians and created stiff penalties for multiple kinds of nonmarital sexual conduct. These two trends buttressed one another, as state subsidies for housing construction also carried incentives and penalties for different kinds of sexual conduct. Federal actions made the postwar housing boom possible, but they also shaped the sexual character of new communities in two important ways. First, they set the terms on which different kinds of people could attain low-interest loans, largely limiting mortgages to white, married men. Second, they offered guidelines about the kinds of institutions builders could include in new developments, encouraging construction that would appeal to straight families. Together, these policies promoted a sexual theory of property that valued married consumers, penalized Americans that deviated from marital heterosexuality, and conferred worth on neighborhoods that accommodated the needs of parents with children.</p>
<p>Suburbs, of course, predated the Second World War, and married couples had purchased their own homes long before the 1940s.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0096144213479322">6</xref></sup> Yet the long postwar wedding and baby boom prompted a dramatic expansion of the state’s involvement in the national housing market. Beginning in the 1940s, heterosexual sex literally drove demand for new housing. For almost two decades, Americans married in greater numbers, wed at younger ages, and had more children than at any other point in the twentieth century. In the first ten years after World War II, more than seventeen million Americans married, and in that same period the nation’s collective birth rate similarly soared. Approximately four million children were born every year between 1946 and 1964. The wedding and baby booms changed every state in the nation, yet California underwent a particularly significant transformation. One out of ten Americans who married in the decade after World War II lived in the Golden State, and between 1945 and 1950 California averaged almost 92,000 weddings per year.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0096144213479322">7</xref></sup></p>
<p>The upsurge in marriages and births sparked residential shortages in older cities like San Francisco. Although the overwhelming majority of newlyweds in the late 1940s sought places of their own, sixteen years of economic depression and war had considerably slowed the construction of new housing. As millions of married couples entered the rental and real estate markets, they faced a shortage of available places to live. In 1946, <italic>Fortune</italic> magazine estimated that the national demand for residences had jumped by about 20 percent, and that, “most of the people now looking for housing are recently married couples who were living in their parents’ homes before the war.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-0096144213479322">8</xref></sup> That year, the federal government estimated that the country needed to produce nearly 4.4 million new homes in metropolitan areas in order to ease the crunch.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-0096144213479322">9</xref></sup> Magazines from the era frequently related anecdotes illustrating the crisis: newlyweds awkwardly doubled up with their friends, living with their parents, or even sleeping in converted attics or doghouses. In 1948, <italic>Time</italic> lamented: “In no large U.S. city had the postwar dream of one home to one family been achieved.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-0096144213479322">10</xref></sup></p>
<p>Federal authorities responded to this crisis by expanding New Deal–era programs designed to create housing programs and employment. Through agencies such as the Home Owners Loan Corporation (HOLC), Federal Housing Administration (FHA), and Veterans’ Administration (VA), in particular, the national government stimulated residential construction with generous insurance programs that reimbursed lenders for defaulted mortgages. Federal authorities in the postwar period enabled banks and other lenders to ask for smaller down payments and to lower interest rates.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-0096144213479322">11</xref></sup> These programs proved enormously successful, and they significantly reshaped metropolitan regions across the country. Between 1944 and 1972, the percentage of Americans who owned homes jumped by almost 20 percent.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-0096144213479322">12</xref></sup> In California, the FHA or VA insured 50 percent of all new homes built between 1944 and 1966, and in the Bay Area, the government insured roughly 65 percent of all new homes built in the late 1940s.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-0096144213479322">13</xref></sup> The wide availability of credit produced waves of residential construction across the country. Nationwide, one out of four houses standing in 1960 was built in the 1950s, and, in that same year in the Bay Area, 61 percent of all single-family homes were erected after 1940.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn14-0096144213479322">14</xref></sup> One San Francisco developer told <italic>Time</italic>: “If it weren’t for the Government, the boom would end overnight.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn15-0096144213479322">15</xref></sup></p>
<p>Federal authorities designed these mortgage policies primarily to stimulate home construction and to end the Depression. They, nevertheless, specifically extended the state’s ability to promote normative relationships and to penalize so-called deviant ones. The expansion of government insurance programs did more than innocently help straight families in need; they also offered a new regulatory system through which the government policed sexuality. The postwar suburban housing boom overlapped with a national concern about traditional sexual and gender roles and a countrywide crackdown on Americans who deviated from heterosexual norms. In her 2009 study of federal policies, historian Margot Canaday argues that the 1940s represented a watershed moment in which the national government singled out homosexuals as a category of people not deserving of full rights and entitlements.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn16-0096144213479322">16</xref></sup> Fueled, in part, by Cold War concerns about sexual and gender norms, states like California stiffened the penalties for sodomy and heightened police surveillance of citizens suspected of homosexuality.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn17-0096144213479322">17</xref></sup></p>
<p>The national government’s housing insurance programs reinforced these trends, extending the state’s ability to police deviant behaviors and inscribing sexual norms into the real estate market (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0096144213479322">Figure 1</xref>). In exchange for reimbursing lenders for the losses they incurred from defaulted loans, federal authorities required lenders to adhere to standards meant to exclude risky borrowers and eliminate poorly developed properties from the market. After World War II, FHA guidelines pushed lenders to consider the “character” of borrowers before issuing new mortgages, and they specifically underscored the value of marriage in assessments about a would-be homeowner’s reliability. The 1952 FHA <italic>Underwriting Manual</italic>, a resource also used by the VA, advised banks and developers: “The mortgagor who is married and has a family generally evidences more stability than a mortgagor who is single because, among other things, he has responsibilities holding him to his obligations.” This recommendation reinforced the government agency’s warnings against offering mortgages to people unrelated by marriage or blood, since “The probabilities of dissatisfaction . . . between members of the partnership are strong and may seriously affect the desire for continuing ownership on the part of any one of the principals.” Even married couples warranted a level of scrutiny from FHA-insured lenders, since “it has been demonstrated that inharmonious domestic relationships are an important cause of foreclosure.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn18-0096144213479322">18</xref></sup></p>

</fig>
<p>The FHA not only privileged married borrowers, they also actively sought to exclude Americans who deviated from heterosexual norms. As states like California criminalized many queer sex acts, they also exempted growing portions of the population from building equity and access to the postwar housing market. FHA guidelines prohibited lenders from offering mortgages to all people with “illegal connections,” and criminal activity of any kind disqualified borrowers from insured loans. Crucially, these included arrests for sex-related offenses like “lewd vagrancy” and military discharges. In 1944, Congress made all of the servicemen expelled from the armed forces for homosexual conduct ineligible for the generous housing and educational benefits of the G.I. Bill. According to one estimate, this exclusion penalized approximately nine thousand veterans discharged for homosexuality during World War II alone.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn19-0096144213479322">19</xref></sup></p>
<p>Numerous scholars have illuminated the ways in which these government policies reinforced racial and gender restrictions on lending. FHA and VA programs largely excluded most people of color and women from the postwar housing markets.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn20-0096144213479322">20</xref></sup> The racist and sexist elements of these policies, however, not only created parallel forms of discrimination, they also reinforced the incentives for Americans to enter certain kinds of sexual relationships but not others. California, for example, prohibited inter-racial marriages until 1948, and other states barred them until the Supreme Court invalidated miscegenation laws in 1967. By explicitly offering married couples low-interest loans, the federal government implicitly encouraged whites to wed other whites. Moreover, by channeling resources specifically to married men, the state induced women to enter into relationships as junior economic partners with their spouses. As married couples sought the boons of homeownership, the state also encouraged them to distribute labor within their relationships along gendered lines.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn21-0096144213479322">21</xref></sup></p>
<p>FHA guidelines further helped standardize the belief that racial segregation itself strengthened families. Mid-century representatives of the real estate industry frequently told homebuyers that neighborhoods with communities of people homogenous by race, class, and marital status offered ideal places to raise children. The National Association of Home Builders led by Bay Area developer David Bohannon, explicitly rejected calls for racial integration in 1950, and told its members that a consumer “will want to raise his family in an area where there is evidence of a social environment compatible with his own background.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn22-0096144213479322">22</xref></sup> The United States Savings and Loan League similarly advised would-be homebuyers in 1959: “Most home-owning neighborhoods are comprised of people of similar social, economic, and educational backgrounds. The similarity of interests usually means a minimum of friction and a maximum of opportunity for developing lasting and enjoyable friendships, not only for parents, but for their children as well.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn23-0096144213479322">23</xref></sup> The FHA’s guidelines reinforced the belief that racial and class homogeneity reduced social conflict and, therefore, encouraged strong families. In 1952, the agency told its assessors: “Neighborhoods constituted of families that are congenial . . . generally exhibit strong appeal and stability.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn24-0096144213479322">24</xref></sup></p>
<p>The state’s regulation of sexual norms also included guidelines that governed the shape of homes and neighborhoods. In addition to determining who could enter the real estate market, government policies ensured that new construction would appeal to married consumers. No structure, for example, symbolized straight family life and the suburbs more than the detached “single-family home,” and its near ubiquity in new developments largely stemmed from the recommendations of public health authorities and standards set by the FHA. During the 1930s and 1940s, the American Public Health Association (APHA) published guidelines for government officials and private builders, and it termed one- and two-family homes the “preferable type for families with growing children.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn25-0096144213479322">25</xref></sup> Moreover, the FHA encouraged lenders to take into account the nonmonetary interests of homebuyers, and since it called buying a home for a family “one of the primary prerequisites of life,” the agency counseled banks to favorably rate consumers who planned to occupy their own houses.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn26-0096144213479322">26</xref></sup> Although both the FHA and VA offered insurance policies for multifamily dwellings, they consistently favored detached, single-family homes. Between 1941 and 1950, the number of FHA-insured single-family homes exceeded multifamily units by at least four to one, and during the 1950s, that ratio climbed to seven to one.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn27-0096144213479322">27</xref></sup></p>
<p>Federal officials similarly assessed individual property relative to the surrounding neighborhood, and their mortgage policies favored areas with amenities they deemed beneficial to married couples with children. The FHA argued that “real estate values are largely determined by neighborhood character,” and the agency encouraged the construction of institutions that it believed fostered strong marriages and healthy families.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn28-0096144213479322">28</xref></sup> In a pamphlet for would-be homeowners, the government agency advised consumers that their houses “should be situated not too far from schools, churches, parks, and playgrounds. These mean better living for the entire family and contribute to the value of your home.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn29-0096144213479322">29</xref></sup> The FHA further told lenders that schools, churches, and parks buoyed property values, declaring: “Centrally located schools produce a favorable impression of community stability and demonstrate sound neighborhood growth.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn30-0096144213479322">30</xref></sup> The National Association of Home Builders told its members that churches “can help stabilize neighborhood desirability and value,” and that the “presence of elementary schools is the greatest drawing card in new residential development, for it is the family with children . . . which forms a substantial part of the home-owning market.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn31-0096144213479322">31</xref></sup></p>
<p>Similar to its guidelines governing individual mortgages, FHA rules related to neighborhoods reinforced both racial segregation and sexual homogeneity. During the 1930s and 1940s, the APHA spoke out against the growing trend toward social and building uniformity in new developments, and it encouraged developers to make neighborhoods with many different kinds of dwellings to meet the needs of married couples with children, single adults, and older “empty-nesters.” The group understood that family sizes waxed and waned, and it valued the ability of parents to live near their children as they aged. In 1938, the APHA claimed: “The continuance of the family in the community of its choice will be greatly fostered by the provision in every housing project of living units sufficiently varied in size to provide accommodations during the whole cycle of family development.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn32-0096144213479322">32</xref></sup> Although the group explicitly spoke about “families,” its plan also would have fostered class heterogeneity in new communities. Mixtures of large and small housing would have allowed for residents with low and high incomes to live alongside one another.</p>
<p>FHA regulators, however, undermined this ideal by requiring all new developments to be homogenous by building type and by encouraging the production of owner-occupied, single-family homes. The agency declared: “Homogenous development of properties in a neighborhood tends to reduce mortgage risk. Areas which contain structures of about the same age, price range, and offering similar accommodations usually are better mortgage lending areas than those having a variety of types and age groups.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn33-0096144213479322">33</xref></sup> By eliminating the possibility of residential areas with a mixture of apartments, duplexes, and single-family homes, FHA regulators not only discouraged unmarried people, including widows or young single people, from living near their families, they also made it more difficult for low-income residents, particularly renters, to find affordable homes in new developments.</p>
<p>Together, policies governing the character of loan applicants and property types gave couples who adhered to straight norms enormous advantages in the real estate market and made it easier for them to build long-term equity through their homes. Yet the consequences of these rules would prove even more pernicious over time. Of course, federal guidelines never completely barred people who had engaged in nonnormative sex from the postwar housing market. Even the most stringent of surveillance systems could never completely uncover behaviors and desires experienced in private. One of the most significant and harmful outcomes of these policies, therefore, lay in their requirement for secrecy. In addition to privileging people who publicly participated in normative relationships, the postwar state made the concealment of illicit sexuality a prerequisite for homeownership. Since homes represented the largest commodity most Americans would buy in their lifetimes, federal mortgage policies created powerful incentives to conform to behavioral norms. Throughout the postwar period, gay men, lesbians, and others who engaged in queer sex bought homes in the postwar suburbs. But their ability to do so frequently hinged on their ability to conceal their relationships, and desires, in a social “closet” reinforced by state policy.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn34-0096144213479322">34</xref></sup></p>
<p>The state’s intervention in the housing market, therefore, channeled material resources to people who engaged in normative relationships, policed the behaviors of Americans who deviated from those norms, and encouraged the construction of new, spatially specific communities for married couples with children. Over the long postwar period, these trends would revolutionize both local housing markets and urban form, and since federal policies favored new construction over the rehabilitation of old buildings, suburban areas, like Santa Clara County would witness the most dramatic consequences of that transformation. Even as the federal government structured the building and selling of homes, local actors strategized about how to capitalize off the marriage and baby booms.</p>

<title>Building Cities and Families in the Bay Area Suburbs</title>
<p>Postwar suburbanization brought together a coalition of private business interests and public officials, and all of the members of this “pro-growth” alliance sought to build communities composed primarily of married white couples and their children. Their desire to do so stemmed, in part, from the demand created by the Baby Boom and the federal guidelines that empowered married buyers in the real estate market. Yet they also did so based on their own understandings of the market potential of “family friendly” communities. Developers sought consumers who would buy larger homes; realtors sought residents who would boost the value of neighboring properties; local chambers of commerce sought to create cities attractive to outside investors; and city officials sought citizens that would pay taxes and use a minimal amount of services. Combined, their efforts helped concentrate straight families in new residential areas and helped mass produce a new physical landscape that specifically addressed the concerns of parents with young children. After the federal government, this coalition of business leaders and local city officials played the biggest role in determining the shape and character of the postwar suburbs, and their efforts to market new communities for young heterosexual couples with children helped propel the outward migration of married people to the suburbs.</p>
<p>Representatives of the real estate industry rarely remarked upon the federal guidelines that excluded queer consumers and privileged straight ones, yet they followed national and metropolitan demographics very closely. Builders, banks, and realtors not only hoped to profit off a solution to the housing shortage, they also hoped that population growth could indefinitely ensure economic growth. Developers, in particular, understood that newlyweds not only sought houses for themselves and places in which to start families. Thomas S. Holden, president of the F. W. Dodge Corporation, wrote in <italic>Architectural Digest</italic> in 1952: “Babies do not immediately require new houses. But, as they grow a little older and acquire brothers and sisters, their parents are very likely to build on additions or even move into bigger houses.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn35-0096144213479322">35</xref></sup> Just a few years later, analysts at the Kiplinger Washington Letter predicted a national “big building boom” through the end of the decade thanks to the “present births and marriages.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn36-0096144213479322">36</xref></sup></p>
<p>The wedding and baby booms, along with federal mortgage policies that empowered married couples, encouraged Bay Area realtors and developers to construct properties that would specifically appeal to newlyweds and young families. In their efforts to sell new homes, realtors and developers equated homeownership with long-lasting marriages and healthy children. In the early 1950s, Palo Alto–based builder Joseph Eichler won two consecutive awards from <italic>Parents</italic>’ magazine for developing “family friendly” designs with flexible floor plans.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn37-0096144213479322">37</xref></sup> When <italic>Sunset</italic> magazine featured a “family house” built by John Matthias in Los Altos, California, in 1956, the periodical spoke to potential buyers with an aerial view of the building with the words “parents,” “son,” and “daughter” superimposed over different rooms.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn38-0096144213479322">38</xref></sup> The builders of “Tropicana Village,” a subdivision on San Jose’s eastside, similarly promised consumers houses specifically designed “with family living in mind.” These homes created by Branden Enterprises included large master bedrooms with “spacious Mr. and Mrs. Wardrobe closets,” and adjoining “living” and “family” rooms so that parents and children could relax in proximity to one another. Just as importantly, the developer assured consumers that Tropicana Village’s good schools, proximity to commercial developments, and recreational facilities made it “a wonderful place to raise a family.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn39-0096144213479322">39</xref></sup></p>
<p>After the federal government, local policymakers played the largest role in determining the shape and character of their communities. Zoning, in particular, acted as an important tool for limiting the types of structures in new developments. Throughout San Mateo and Santa Clara counties, officials restricted the overwhelming majority of new residential construction to detached, single-family homes. In 1957, for example, Santa Clara County planners zoned 70 percent of all new residential development for the construction of single-family homes. Over one-third of all “multiple unit” construction in the county that year took place in San Jose alone, an older city that already had a relatively high concentration of apartment complexes. Some municipalities, including Cupertino, Los Altos, Los Altos Hills, and Saratoga, did not allow for the building of apartment complexes at all, restricting new construction exclusively to single-family homes.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn40-0096144213479322">40</xref></sup> When cities did allow for multiunit construction, they invariably placed it alongside major highways, industrial areas, or other nuisances in order to shield nearby single-family homes from unwanted noise or pollution.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn41-0096144213479322">41</xref></sup></p>
<p>These actions not only reinforced guidelines set by the FHA, they also allowed city authorities to attract “stable” residents who they believed would pay taxes and which would not use many city services. Restrictive zoning practices both kept out unwanted categories of people, such as the poor or “single” people, and attracted residents that local elites found desirable. At a “Panorama of Progress” in 1956, the Sunnyvale Chamber of Commerce explicitly equated marriage, children, and stability: “More families mean more children,” the businessmen declared. “Well aware that the future of our nation and our community rests in building solid citizenship, Sunnyvale placed an emphasis on family life. . . . No matter how large this city becomes, it is understood that the basic social unit is the family and Sunnyvale’s guiding hand must aid and protect it.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn42-0096144213479322">42</xref></sup></p>
<p>This desire to attract “desirable” residents transformed the physical shape of the postwar suburbs. City planners in places like Santa Clara County overwhelmingly understood residential areas as “family friendly” spaces, and they labored to design them in a manner that would distinguish them from the allegedly hazardous layouts of older urban centers. Authorities in suburban Sunnyvale, for example, defined their neighborhoods as “the environment in which children are reared.” Just next door, planners in the sprawling city of San Jose envisioned new residential areas filled with families built around a commuting, breadwinning patriarch, calling neighborhoods “The World of the Mother and the Child.” Conscious of the large number of married couples with children looking to buy new homes, suburban officials created physical spaces that spoke directly to the needs of young parents. For example, planners scaled neighborhoods primarily around the relationship between homes and schools. They envisioned elementary schools as the “nuclei” of all residential areas, and they worked to ensure that no student lived more than a mile from his or her classroom. At the same time, they used busy roads as the outer boundaries of neighborhoods to ensure that most speeding motorists steered clear of streets with children. Within each residential area, they prohibited commercial development that might attract traffic, and they encouraged schools, churches, and playgrounds to cluster near one another to save parking space.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn43-0096144213479322">43</xref></sup></p>
<p>If postwar conceptions of residential value demanded the clustering of homes, schools, and churches, they also required the exclusion of institutions that parents might deem detrimental to children. Although FHA guidelines made no mention of them, public health officials encouraged local authorities to police so-called “moral hazards,” such as alcohol-selling businesses, dance halls, or gambling establishments. In 1948, for example, the APHA called for the elimination of bars and nightclubs from residential areas since they might “exert a socially undesirable influence on the residents, especially on children.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn44-0096144213479322">44</xref></sup> The California judiciary repeatedly upheld the rights of suburbs to use their zoning “police power” to protect the “welfare” and “morals” of their communities. In 1956, for instance, the state Court of Appeals allowed the Bay Area suburb of Los Gatos to use its housing ordinance to deny a restaurant the right to sell liquor in an area of single-family homes. The judges in the case based their decision on the notion that the sale of hard alcohol gave businesses more of “the characteristics of a night club . . . than a quiet family eating place,” and therefore cities could restrict them to protect the surrounding community.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn45-0096144213479322">45</xref></sup></p>
<p>Throughout the 1950s and early 1960s, local officials in the Bay Area suburbs repeatedly excluded businesses that they believed might make their community unattractive to married couples with children. The Santa Clara City Council, for example, asked its police chief to investigate the “character and reputation” of all applicants for bars, billiards halls, or card rooms. In 1960, community groups and private developers asked the San Jose City Council to allow more construction in the city’s aging downtown because one of its parks had “become a gathering place for homosexuals.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn46-0096144213479322">46</xref></sup> Two years later, when a businessman sought to build a new bar in Mountain View in which patrons could call one another on telephones at every table, the local planning commission called the plan “detrimental to the morals of the community.” The city specifically amended its zoning law to forbid telephones in bars after a neighboring businessman alleged that the proposal would create a “pick up place” for “queers and prostitutes”.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn47-0096144213479322">47</xref></sup></p>
<p>Restrictions put in place by planning commissions complemented the enforcement of sexual norms by local police. While zoning restrictions could limit the types of businesses available in municipalities, they could not always determine the ways in which residents used them. Gay men and lesbians living in the Bay Area suburbs frequently found places to meet one another in spite of official surveillance. Although suburban boosters promoted their hometowns as ideal places for “families,” local police occasionally staged mass arrests that hinted at a queer subculture that existed largely unnoticed by most of the inhabitants of postwar Santa Clara County. In 1955 and 1959, for example, Palo Alto Police arrested dozens of men in the city’s commuter rail station for allegedly seeking gay sex.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn48-0096144213479322">48</xref></sup> Just five months after the Mountain View Planning Commission rejected the “telephone bar” as a possible “pick up” spot for prostitutes and homosexuals, police in nearby Menlo Park raided a tavern called “The Carriage” and arrested five male patrons for “lewd conduct.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn49-0096144213479322">49</xref></sup></p>
<p>These cases reveal both the limited ability of policy makers to completely enforce social norms and the heavy burdens faced by residents who deviated from those standards. Despite zoning restrictions and police surveillance, people who engaged in various kinds of transgressive sexuality found others like themselves and forged relationships with one another in the postwar suburbs. The arrests in the newspaper undoubtedly hint at an unknowable number of examples of same-sex relationships that took place away from official scrutiny. Yet they also underscore the burden faced by residents who engaged in sexual conduct that violated social norms. The mere possibility of arrest and public shame created a chronic need for secrecy and deception. Newspaper coverage of the train station arrests in Palo Alto, for example, publicized the names of the men involved, revealing that many of them lived in single-family homes in the surrounding subdivisions. Although the articles never mention the names of a spouse, the location of their residences strongly suggests some of these men were married and, if the allegations were true, were seeking same-sex extramarital affairs.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn50-0096144213479322">50</xref></sup> Arrests or public denunciations broadcast to the entire population that certain behaviors were forbidden and, in some cases, pressured residents to create rigid distinctions between “public” conduct and “private,” frequently illicit, sexuality.</p>
<p>These social pressures stemmed, in part, from the ways in which private developers and public officials in the San Francisco Bay Area had worked together to build and market new communities designed to attract straight families. In many ways, their efforts reinforced many of the guidelines set by the federal government. Yet suburbanization did not play out entirely as a top–down initiative enacted by policy makers in Washington. Instead, the standards enforced by the FHA and VA pulled together a coalition of local actors to create new residential areas in the suburbs. City officials, land developers, chambers of commerce, and realtors all acted out of their own self-interest in a market structured by federal authorities. Their efforts transformed the demand produced by the wedding and baby booms into profits of various kinds, and helped to foster new spatial relationships between heterosexual families and the (sub)urban environment. On one hand, they concentrated homes, schools, and churches together between commercial development and heavily trafficked arteries. On the other hand, they set strict limits on businesses, particularly bars, liquor stores, dance halls, and billiards clubs, that might threaten the upbringing of nearby young people.</p>

<title>Urban Crisis and Redevelopment</title>
<p>Suburban growth created a sexual and racial spatial mismatch between the urban core and the metropolitan periphery. In the two decades after World War II, growing numbers of single residents, gay men, lesbians, most people of color and other groups of people left out of the suburban housing market made their homes in older cities. Their increasing visibility in places like San Francisco sparked anxiety among many political elites, business leaders, and urban voters. During the late 1940s and 1950s, federal urban renewal programs offered city leaders tools to rebuild areas they deemed “blighted,” and similar to FHA-insured mortgages, the national government created incentives to preserve neighborhoods with married couples and to demolish those inhabited largely by “single” residents. Like local policy makers in Santa Clara County, urban elites in San Francisco had their own motives for wanting to remake the city. Downtown businessmen worried that tourists and convention-goers would not visit; realtors expressed concern that married couples would no longer buy homes near the urban core; and political leaders felt anxiety about what they saw as an unstable group of unmarried, poor inhabitants living near downtown. In a process that paralleled efforts made by suburban elites, city leaders hoped to use federally sponsored urban renewal to expel residents they deemed undesirable and to attract married people back to the metropolitan center.</p>
<p>Numerous scholars have chronicled the remarkable growth of San Francisco’s gay, lesbian, transgender, and heterosexual bohemian communities after World War II.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn51-0096144213479322">51</xref></sup> Historian Josh Sides, for example, argues that in the mid- to late twentieth century, “Sex radicals . . . foisted their vision of a sexually liberated, creatively driven, and highly tolerant vision onto San Francisco.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn52-0096144213479322">52</xref></sup> Tens of thousands of people who lived outside of marriage, including large numbers of queer people, migrated to the city in the 1950s and 1960s, creating new communities, businesses, and politics. Although San Francisco had exceptionally large gay and lesbian communities, its history mirrored trends apparent in urban centers across the country. By the mid-1960s, cities of varying sizes and shape had growing populations of people living outside of marriage, and the national press frequently commented on the sexual transformation of urban centers. A 1964 article in <italic>Life</italic>, for example, noted: “Especially in cities, homosexuals are discarding their furtive ways and openly admitting, even flaunting, their deviation.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn53-0096144213479322">53</xref></sup></p>
<p>Yet the in-migration of large numbers of “single” residents and people of color in urban centers also reflected a state-structured housing market that privileged married, white consumers and encouraged their outward migration to the suburbs. By the early 1960s, suburbanization had dramatically changed the sexual geographies of metropolitan areas across the country, and statistics gathered by the state hinted at the scope of that transformation. After World War II, government officials defined “family” as people related to one another by marriage, blood, or adoption. In 1952, the Housing and Home Finance Agency concluded that nearly 10 percent of Americans who bought a home last year were “newly formed families” and noted that 17 percent of them listed a desire to “make a home for a family” as their primary motivation for entering the real estate market.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn54-0096144213479322">54</xref></sup> During the 1950s and 1960s, census takers tracked marriage and homeownership separately, but when they first studied the relationship between the two variables in the early 1970s, they clearly saw a relationship between marital status and residency. “Husband-wife households,” they declared, “were much more common among owners than among renters. About 75 percent of all owner-occupied units were occupied by husbands with wife present.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn55-0096144213479322">55</xref></sup></p>
<p>In the Bay Area, census takers found that the suburban boom encouraged the outward migration of white, middle-class married residents from older urban centers like San Francisco and Oakland. Between 1950 and 1960, the percentage of married people living in Santa Clara County increased by 20 percent, while the number of “single” people in San Francisco doubled. These shifts were even more apparent at the local level. More than 98 percent of the married couples in suburban Palo Alto, Santa Clara, and Sunnyvale in 1960, for example, had their own “households.” Despite the presence of several colleges and universities in the area, between 65 and 70 percent of all homes in those cities were “owner occupied.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn56-0096144213479322">56</xref></sup> Even more dramatically, portions of the South Bay suburbs were inhabited almost exclusively by married people with children. At least forty-seven census tracts in Santa Clara County had populations in which less than 5 percent of the residents lived with people they were not related to by blood, marriage, or adoption (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0096144213479322">Table 1</xref>). Nine of those tracts had ratios of “unrelated” inhabitants of less than 1 percent. One census tract on San Jose’s west side had almost 7,600 residents, but only 36 of them lived with people that were not their parents, spouses, or children (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0096144213479322">Table 2</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn57-0096144213479322">57</xref></sup></p>

<p>By contrast, census tracts near the San Francisco waterfront and Telegraph Hill were almost entirely populated by unmarried adults and were near the largest concentration of gay bars in the city.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn58-0096144213479322">58</xref></sup> Postwar metropolitan development did not completely evacuate married people with children from cities, but it did create a dramatic gap between areas near downtown and the surrounding suburbs. In the South of Market neighborhood of San Francisco, for example, only 20 percent of inhabitants were married, and the area included large numbers of transient men who lived in residential hotels. North Beach and Telegraph Hill, just north of downtown, emerged as residential areas populated by a mixture of dockworkers, middle-class professionals, groups of bohemians like the Beats, and many gay men and lesbians. In the census tracts in those neighborhoods, almost half of all residents lived with people unrelated to them by marriage, blood, or adoption (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0096144213479322">Figure 2</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn59-0096144213479322">59</xref></sup></p>

</fig>
<p>The presence of these communities near the urban core prompted the growth of businesses that attracted consumers from across the metropolis. San Francisco boasted a high concentration of bars, restaurants, and cafes, and the consumers who patronized those businesses did not necessarily live in the city. One gay San Franciscan, for example, recalled seeing a mixture of “working class dykes” and suburban “Peninsula type lesbians” in the Telegraph Hill bars in the 1950s.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn60-0096144213479322">60</xref></sup> The city, therefore, not only had a higher share of the metropolis’s unmarried residents, the concentration of those inhabitants helped produce businesses that served the needs of people in San Francisco and its environs.</p>
<p>Federal policies played an important role in this sifting process, and as cities across the country competed with the suburbs for population and economic resources, the national government offered them new tools to modernize their housing. In the postwar period, Congress offered to compensate older urban areas two-thirds of the costs of buying, demolishing, and rebuilding “blighted” property. Similar to FHA and VA mortgage policies, redevelopment financing issued by the Housing and Home Finance Agency (HHFA) encouraged cities to construct housing for married couples and to displace “single” residents. Federal and local officials in the period defined “family” in terms similar to the census as people related to one another by “blood, marriage, or adoption,” and amended versions of the 1949 Housing Act required cities contemplating neighborhood demolition to devise a “workable plan” to use redevelopment funds to a “suitable environment for adequate family life.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn61-0096144213479322">61</xref></sup></p>
<p>When cities forced married residents or parents to relocate, federal guidelines required local agencies to provide a flat payment to ease moving costs. In cases involving unmarried people without children, by contrast, policymakers mandated no similar form of compensation. According to the Urban Renewal Administration, the national government “encouraged” cities to “increase their relocation services to include single persons,” yet only “family relocation assistance—since it is required by Federal law—must be provided in every locality.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn62-0096144213479322">62</xref></sup> In 1954, the HHFA issued a report on “family relocation” that similarly declared that when it came to displacing people connected by blood, marriage, or adoption, Congress had “defined a specific local responsibility,” but that there was “no obligation” for cities to extend relocation services to “individual householders.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn63-0096144213479322">63</xref></sup></p>
<p>Federal support for urban renewal came at a time when San Francisco’s political and economic leadership worried considerably about the costs of metropolitan competition. During the 1950s, the mayor and his allies conceded the lion’s share of the region’s shipping industry to Oakland, and they opted to remake the city’s downtown and adjacent waterfront as a unified financial and tourist center. Business elites, particularly from the large department stores around Union Square, worried that San Francisco’s changing “character” would make it an undesirable place for middle-class consumers to shop. A report issued by businesses in support of redevelopment concluded that the city needed to “clean up” the area south of Market Street: “Some attention must be given to the commuters who use Third St to get to the [train] depot. Why should they walk past a continuous line of saloons, dilapidated hotels, and marginal stores to be panhandled and accosted by prostitutes?”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn64-0096144213479322">64</xref></sup> A wholesaler similarly told city officials his reasons for refusing to invest in San Francisco: “We originally thought [the South of Market] area good for warehousing and display, but this Skid Row is not good for either. The riff-raff winos and bums make the entire area undesirable.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn65-0096144213479322">65</xref></sup></p>
<p>Elite concerns about flagging business investment overlapped with growing concern among voters about the sexual characteristics of the city’s new residents. As places like San Francisco attracted growing numbers of inhabitants shut out of the suburban housing market, including most people of color, gay men, lesbians, and other “single” people, many city residents worried about the moral and sexual degeneration of their neighborhoods. In 1954, <italic>The San Francisco Examiner</italic> published an editorial condemning the “increase in homosexuals” in the city’s parks, streets, and bars, and its editors declared: “Now we need action. Enough eye shutting.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn66-0096144213479322">66</xref></sup> During the 1959 mayoral election, the <italic>San Francisco Progress</italic> decried what it called the moral degeneration of San Francisco and blamed the incumbent, George Christopher, for allowing the city to become “the national headquarters for sex deviates in the United States.” Comparing San Francisco unfavorably to the surrounding suburbs, the newspaper declared: “The number of sex deviates in this city has soared by the thousands . . . while other communities in this area have virtually eliminated them.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn67-0096144213479322">67</xref></sup></p>
<p>Even more significantly, a federally financed study of urban redevelopment issued a strong warning to Mayor Christopher that the city’s economic well-being depended on its ability to attract married, middle-class families back to the urban core. Private consultant Arthur D. Little, Inc. cautioned: “The family, felt by most to be the cornerstone of society is leaving San Francisco to be replaced by unrelated individuals—the widow or widower, the bachelor (temporary as well as perennial), the working girl.” This shift represented a serious crisis for the city, since “in contrast to the families they replace, the newcomers are more likely to rent than buy [a home]; less able to have a permanent interest in the maintenance of the City’s values . . . and generally of lower incomes.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn68-0096144213479322">68</xref></sup></p>
<p>Mayor Christopher responded to the crisis with a police offensive to drive many different kinds of “sexual deviates” from the city and by using federal urban renewal funds to make San Francisco more competitive with the suburbs. Public authorities in both older urban areas and newer suburbs worried about sexual deviancy, but the sifting processes of metropolitan development made queer communities much more of a concern to city officials. In 1956, Christopher had campaigned on a promise to “clean up” San Francisco’s vice trade, and like urban mayors across the country, he pushed law enforcement authorities to target multiple forms of erotic commerce, particularly gay bars. During his mayoralty, city police worked closely with the state Department of Alcoholic Beverage Control to limit the number of liquor licenses available in certain vice districts and to conduct periodic sweeps of gay bars. In the largest raid of the era, the police arrested 103 patrons at the Tay-Bush Inn near the financial district in 1961.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn69-0096144213479322">69</xref></sup> Christopher also authorized the creation of a plainclothes police unit to monitor public spaces for potential criminals, including residents who violated sexual and gender norms. The so-called “S Squad” patrolled the city’s streets and parks looking to break up cruising areas used by gay men, and in 1959 they arrested three female college students for wearing slacks in a bar.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn70-0096144213479322">70</xref></sup></p>
<p>At the same time, the Christopher administration and the San Francisco Redevelopment Agency (SFRA) used federal grants and loans to expand the Central Business District, to clear away “slums,” and to build housing attractive to middle-class, white married couples. All of these projects disproportionately pushed out residents of color and unmarried inhabitants from their homes. In the early 1960s, the SFRA built its “Golden Gateway” redevelopment project near the financial district at the end of Market Street, and it displaced approximately two hundred “single” residents but only removed a dozen “families.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn71-0096144213479322">71</xref></sup> A few years later, the agency expanded the Central Business District south of Market Street, and in 1961 the SFRA reported that it needed to move 2,200 “single” people and 245 “families” to complete the project.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn72-0096144213479322">72</xref></sup> A study conducted by the redevelopment authority a few years later concluded that 90 percent of the residents in the area were unmarried. Although the survey determined that most of the neighborhood’s inhabitants were white, the section marked for demolition included a majority of the district’s residents of color.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn73-0096144213479322">73</xref></sup></p>
<p>The redevelopment agency commissioned private builders to construct commercial high-rises along the waterfront and South of Market, yet this process also affected neighborhoods beyond the spaces where officials actually tore down structures. City planners used downtown expansion as an opportunity to remake adjacent areas that they deemed unsavory. In 1959, the <italic>San Francisco Examiner</italic> declared that the “fabulous Barbary Coast” had given “way to redevelopment,” as furniture and fabric stores replaced the strip of saloons and brothels that had once resided just north of the Central Business District.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn74-0096144213479322">74</xref></sup> City officials similarly tried to raise property assessments on Telegraph Hill by strictly enforcing fire and health codes. Even as the police raided neighborhood bars for allowing “sex deviates” to gather, inspectors forced landlords to renovate their properties. In the late 1950s, the redevelopment agency threatened to build modern apartment towers on the hill, spurring residents to restore old buildings in order to avoid demolition. Mayor Christopher told a local newspaper that he saw the neighborhood as “some of the choicest residential property we have going to waste.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn75-0096144213479322">75</xref></sup></p>
<p>Even as the SFRA tore down the tenements and residential hotels that housed thousands of residents who lived outside of traditional marriage and encouraged the gentrification of older neighborhoods, the agency attempted to build suburban-style homes in the city. Diamond Heights, a hilly area west of downtown, offered some of the only undeveloped land left in San Francisco in the postwar period, and the Christopher administration and SFRA hoped to build a neighborhood there that would make the city more competitive with the booming towns of Santa Clara County. As early as 1950, the Redevelopment Agency predicted that new homes “would mean that more people who work in San Francisco could live here too, instead of in one of the mushrooming suburbs.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn76-0096144213479322">76</xref></sup> Although the hilly terrain and citywide land shortage might have encouraged the construction of apartment buildings, the SFRA slated almost half of the available space for single-family homes.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn77-0096144213479322">77</xref></sup> The agency further sold plots in Diamond Heights to three churches at a low, fixed price thanks to the “unique spiritual and social values” that religious groups offered neighborhoods (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0096144213479322">Figure 3</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn78-0096144213479322">78</xref></sup></p>

<p>Viewed in a metropolitan context, these redevelopment projects and the police crackdown appear as yet another layer in a larger state-sponsored social “closet” that rewarded marital heterosexuality and penalized other sexual relationships. Government subsidies for married homeownership in the suburbs triggered a chain reaction that culminated with mass arrests at places like the Tay-Bush Inn and the demolition of neighborhoods like the South of Market area. The upsurge in policing and redevelopment adversely affected gay men and lesbians, and large numbers of people living outside of marriage, particularly the poor, unmarried men who primarily lived in the city’s residential hotels.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn79-0096144213479322">79</xref></sup> The history of redevelopment in San Francisco further demonstrates that urban elites worked to attract desirable residents even as they excluded and uprooted others. The SFRA and Christopher administration built neighborhoods like Diamond Heights at the same time that they demolished older residential districts near downtown, and although relatively small, it served as an important symbol of what they hoped San Francisco would look like in a newly suburbanized metropolis.</p>
<p>By the mid-1960s, however, their efforts had clearly failed. No local effort, even federally subsidized urban renewal, could reverse the process set in motion by suburban growth. Instead of supplanting queer communities, redevelopment projects merely pushed them from one part of San Francisco to another. Middle-class and wealthier gay men and lesbians, including many business owners, largely resisted redevelopment and policing by moving to new places in the city.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn80-0096144213479322">80</xref></sup> In the early 1960s, federal officials required the SFRA to build more affordable housing in Diamond Heights for some of the poorer residents displaced by redevelopment projects in other parts of the city. At the same time, several neighborhoods west of downtown faced rental shortages as many of their former residents migrated out to the suburbs. As urban renewal projects remade the waterfront, growing numbers of middle-class gay men gravitated to what would later become the Castro District, and hundreds of members of the fledgling “hippie” counterculture made their homes in the Haight-Ashbury neighborhood. Meanwhile, poorer residents displaced by urban renewal increasingly concentrated in the few remaining residential hotels in the Tenderloin, the city’s most visible vice district.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn81-0096144213479322">81</xref></sup></p>
<p>Urban redevelopment in San Francisco, as in cities across the country, therefore, failed to attract many residents like the Beers family back to the urban core. Yet if policy makers fell short in their bid to remake older cities in a suburban mold, their efforts nonetheless reinforced the social “closet” built around normative sexuality. Lesbians, gay men, and other Americans who lived outside of marriage not only lost the opportunity for homeownership, many of them also faced housing penalties within urban areas, as wrecking balls pushed them from one place to another. While police raids, perhaps, offered the most visible example of a public crackdown on queer residents, urban renewal represented a far more comprehensive instance of the state’s disciplinary powers. Reinforcing the city’s efforts to clamp down on gay bars, redevelopment drew funding from the federal government as well as local resources. It demonstrated not only concern about neighborhoods populated largely by unmarried people, but also a strong desire to build new ones on suburban terms.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>The postwar histories of suburbanization and urban renewal not only reveal government support for marriage but also the ways in which policymakers’ reinforcement of sexual norms remade cities and suburbs. National and local authorities crafted policies that rewarded Americans for adherence to heterosexual norms like marriage and penalized people who deviated from them. These officials may not have always designed initiatives like mortgage insurance with the intention of inflicting harm on queer people, yet those policies frequently created and magnified sexual inequalities. In almost every case, the histories of suburbanization and urban renewal demonstrate a consensus among policy makers and the housing industry on the value of heterosexual norms. From the 1940s to the 1960s, public agencies and private business shared a common faith in the reliability of married people as mortgagors, consumers, neighbors, and citizens, and this belief system united political leaders across the metropolitan divide. Suburbanization and urban renewal, in spite of their differences, shared a common origin in market theories that prized people who conformed to sexual norms, particularly marriage.</p>
<p>An examination of postwar housing policies, therefore, demonstrates the state’s ability to promote specific attitudes about sex. Yet it also reveals that the enforcement of the “closet” differed across metropolitan space. City and suburban officials may have shared a common desire for middle-class, white, married residents, but the scope of suburbanization meant that the state could not evenly police the behaviors of people across the metropolis. As cities like San Francisco lost residents to the suburbs, they steadily housed growing numbers of people excluded from the postwar real estate market. Cities have never represented self-evidently tolerant places, yet in the two decades after World War II large numbers of lesbians, gay men, bohemian heterosexuals, and other people who lived outside of marriage created new urban communities and politics that challenged some of the most repressive public policies. In spite of police harassment and redevelopment, these groups possessed a limited ability to share their sexuality with others or to visit queer businesses that many of their suburban counterparts lacked altogether. These urban communities that came together in the 1950s expanded and played a crucial role in the sexual revolution of the 1960s.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn82-0096144213479322">82</xref></sup></p>
<p>At the same time, however, suburbanization created new communities primarily composed of people who, at least publicly, adhered to sexual norms. In new fast-growing regions like Santa Clara County, the state-supported reordering of metropolitan space reinforced the closet embedded in postwar housing policies. The sheer concentration of married adults living in the postwar suburbs frequently meant that most residents living there would rarely encounter adults living outside of marriage or publicly deviating from heterosexual norms. In spite of the presence of gay men and lesbians, the day-to-day encounters of many new suburbanites reinforced the belief that if marital heterosexuality was not completely universal, then it was at least a pervasive norm. By looking at the history of sexuality and housing policies, therefore, scholars can both see the important role the state played in promoting marriage and the ways in which that support created different sexual communities across the metropolis.</p>

The 1949 Housing Act, amended through 1956, actually named both “individuals” and “families” as the intended beneficiaries of relocation aid. For unknown reasons, the Urban Renewal Administration did not interpret the law to include families. This discrepancy lasted at least until 1964. As late as 1963, the Urban Renewal Administration published a “fact sheet” on redevelopment that declared: “The local public agency is required to offer families displaced from an urban renewal project area decent, safe, and sanitary housing at prices and rents within their means.” A year later, the agency added the word “individuals” to its description of relocation assistance.
