<abstract>
<p>Assistive technology use in secondary school and postschool has been shown to improve the educational attainment and life outcomes of students with high-incidence disabilities. This study used data from the National Longitudinal Transition Study–2—collected in the early to mid-2000s—to explore the relationship between receipt of assistive technology in school and postschool outcomes. Few students in this study reported receiving assistive technology in high school (7.8%) and fewer still after high school (1.1%). In general, students with high-incidence disabilities who reported receiving assistive technology in school had more positive postschool outcomes in terms of a paid job, wages, and participation in postsecondary education. Yet assistive technology receipt was not a statistically significant factor in the logistic regression model for any dependent variable (i.e., postschool outcome). Although positive implications for receipt of assistive technology in school were suggested, receipt was not a predictor for positive postschool outcomes.</p>

<p>Assistive technology, defined as “any item, piece of equipment, or product system, whether acquired commercially off the shelf, modified, or customized, that is used to increase, maintain, or improve the functional capabilities of a child with a disability,” is a related service to be considered for students with disabilities as part of their individualized education program (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0741932511401037">Individuals with Disabilities Education Improvement Act [IDEIA], 2004</xref>, Section 300.5). Although assistive technology has a relatively long history (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0741932511401037">Blackhurst, 2005</xref>), considerations for students with high-incidence disabilities are relatively recent (i.e., following the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0741932511401037">IDEA 1997</xref> reauthorization; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0741932511401037">Edyburn, 2000</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0741932511401037">2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0741932511401037">Quinn et al., 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Assistive technology improves the school and life functioning of individuals with disabilities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0741932511401037">Edyburn, Higgins, &amp; Boone, 2005</xref>). Yet less is known regarding assistive technology for students with high-incidence disabilities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0741932511401037">Edyburn, 2000</xref>). Assistive technology for this population of students remains essential, despite the initial conception of assistive technology as being for students with more severe disabilities and the relatively recent mandate to consider assistive technology for <italic>all</italic> students (i.e., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0741932511401037">IDEA, 1997</xref>; also see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0741932511401037">Edyburn, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0741932511401037">Lahm, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0741932511401037">Quinn et al., 2009</xref>). Assistive technology for students with high-incidence disabilities is often viewed as a cognitive prosthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0741932511401037">Cavalier, Ferretti, &amp; Okolo, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0741932511401037">Edyburn, 2006</xref>), a means to correct or compensate for a disability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0741932511401037">Lewis, 1993</xref>). Although augmenting a student’s cognitive abilities is considered an appropriate role for assistive technology for students with high-incidence disabilities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0741932511401037">Edyburn, 2000</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0741932511401037">2006</xref>), some scholars perceive assistive technology to be a crutch and feel that students using the tool are not expected to learn certain skills (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0741932511401037">Rapp, 2005</xref>). This perspective devalues assistive technology for students with high-incidence disabilities and what these students can do with appropriate tools (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0741932511401037">Rapp, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>Within the literature on assistive technology for students with high-incidence disabilities, limited attention is focused on secondary education and beyond (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0741932511401037">Alper &amp; Raharinirina, 2006</xref>). In a study of individuals with disabilities who had graduated from a 2- or 4-year postsecondary institution, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0741932511401037">Sharpe, Johnson, Izzo, and Murray (2005)</xref> found few expensive assistive technologies devices reported being used at either the secondary or postsecondary levels. In this same study, students reported using assistive technology more at the postsecondary level, and the majority indicated they learned to use the tools at this level. Of the assistive technology reported being used in postsecondary education, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0741932511401037">Stodden, Conway, and Chang (2003)</xref> indicated the majority fell within the low-tech distinction (i.e., non–computer based).</p>
<p>The lack of attention regarding assistive technology at the secondary level and postschool is disconcerting given the poor postschool outcomes typically plaguing students with disabilities, especially when compared to peers without disabilities: low participation in postsecondary education, high rates of unemployment, and lower rates of independent living (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0741932511401037">Edgar &amp; Polloway, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0741932511401037">Raskind &amp; Higgins, 1998</xref>). In 2003, data from the National Longitudinal Transition Study–2 (NLTS2) indicated 70.4% of students with disabilities were employed at some point after high school, although only 48.9% were currently employed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0741932511401037">Wagner, Newman, Cameto, &amp; Levine, 2005</xref>). In a more recent survey of 1,888 students with disabilities (87% of whom had high-incidence disabilities) one year out of high school, 67% reported they were working, 60% of these full-time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0741932511401037">Curtis, Rabren, &amp; Reilly, 2009</xref>). From the NLTS2, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0741932511401037">Garza (2005)</xref> found 4.4% of students with disabilities solely attended a postsecondary institution, although an additional 20.7% attended a postsecondary institution and were subsequently employed. With respect to independent living, the NLTS2 study reported about 15% of former special education students were living independently 2 years postschool (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0741932511401037">Wagner, Newman, et al., 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>However, assistive technology may be able to improve students’ poor postschool outcomes and their preparation for life after high school. Researchers and policy makers have begun to focus on this issue and call for increased attention toward assistive technology, secondary education, transition, and postsecondary opportunities for students with disabilities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0741932511401037">Mull &amp; Sitlington, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0741932511401037">Nochajski, Oddo, &amp; Beaver, 1999</xref>). For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0741932511401037">Raskind and Higgins (1998)</xref> found promising results for students with learning disabilities using assistive technology in postsecondary educational settings (e.g., lower attrition rates, increased GPA). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0741932511401037">Langton and Ramseur (2001)</xref> suggested assistive technology can assist with “successful employment outcomes” (p. 36), and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0741932511401037">Curtis et al. (2009)</xref> noted benefits of assistive technology for postschool success, with technology serving as a source of support (e.g., PDAs, tape recorders).</p>

<title>National Longitudinal Transition Study–2</title>
<p>The NLTS2 was a comprehensive 10-year project involving multiple means of data collection. The NLTS2 collected data on the experiences—in school and postschool—of a national sample of students with disabilities who were between the ages of 13 and 16 in 2000 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0741932511401037">SRI International, n.d</xref>.). The study involved interviews with and/or surveys of participating students, their parents, their teachers, and other school personnel and addressed a range of topics (e.g., coursework, risk behaviors, services, employment, independent living). In particular, the NLTS2 involved five waves of data gathered through (a) parent and/or youth surveys (i.e., telephone interviews or paper-based mailed questionnaires), (b) direct assessments of students, (c) teacher survey, (d) school program survey, (e) school information survey, and (f) student transcripts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0741932511401037">SRI International, 2000b</xref>). The NLTS2 documented the characteristics of students served in secondary programs, their families, and their school programs and services. It also chronicled students’ postschool outcomes in multiple domains (e.g., employment, postsecondary education and training, independent living; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0741932511401037">Blackorby, Cameto, McCracken, &amp; Valdes, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>For this study, we conducted a secondary analysis of data collected as part of the NLTS2 to answer research questions regarding assistive technology use among students with high-incidence disabilities in both secondary education and postsecondary education. We addressed the following research questions: (a) To what extent are students with high-incidence disabilities receiving assistive technology in their secondary education programs? (b) To what extent are students with high-incidence disabilities receiving assistive technology postschool? (c) What is the relationship between receipt of assistive technology in school and receipt of assistive technology after school? and (d) What is the association between receipt of assistive technology in school and postschool outcomes?</p>

<title>Method</title>
<p>Although we discuss information regarding the participants and procedures used for this study and general information regarding the NLTS2, we invite the reader to refer to reports and information on the NLTS2 website (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.nlts2.org">http://www.nlts2.org</ext-link>) and other published articles (viz., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0741932511401037">Wagner, Kutash, Duchnowski, &amp; Epstein, 2005</xref>) for additional information specific to the NLTS2 project. Data for this analysis were drawn from the <italic>Parent/Youth Survey</italic> and <italic>Student’s School Program Survey</italic>. The <italic>Parent/Youth Survey</italic> was a 60-minute phone interview, or if this was not possible, a mail survey was completed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0741932511401037">SRI International, 2000b</xref>). The survey was given at every wave and focused on youth characteristics, household characteristics, nonschool factors, family involvement, academic and school experiences, personal and social issues, employment, citizenship, health, satisfactions, and behaviors. In this analysis we included data from Waves 1 (2000–2001), 2 (2002–2003), and 3 (2004–2005). The <italic>Student’s School Program Survey</italic> was a mail survey sent to the teacher most familiar with a student’s overall school program and focused on the school program, transition, special education services, state and district assessments, accommodations, provision of supports, performance, and parental involvement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0741932511401037">SRI International, 2000b</xref>). For this study, we focused on items from the two surveys that addressed our research questions.</p>
<p>We acknowledge the NLTS2 was not explicitly designed to answer questions regarding assistive technology. Yet a need exists to gather national perspectives regarding the receipt of assistive technology devices or services by students with disabilities and the potential impact of assistive technology. In the phone interview for the <italic>Parent/Youth Survey</italic>, from which questions regarding assistive technology were drawn for the analysis, the question was posed if assistive technology devices or services had been received, and only two examples were given—tape recorder and reading machine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0741932511401037">SRI International, 2000b</xref>). For mail surveys, six assistive technology devices were given, and responders were asked to indicate if any of the following had been received when others did not get to use one: large print, Braille, or large screen; books on tape; computer or spell checker; computer software; adapted computer hardware; and calculator (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0741932511401037">SRI International, 2000b</xref>).</p>
<sec id="section3-0741932511401037">
<title>Participants</title>
<p>Participants in this study were drawn from the NLTS2 database. This project was based on three waves of data and focused on students who were in and out of school during the three waves. This study focused on students with high-incidence disabilities, operationally defined for this study as students identified as having learning disabilities (LD), emotional and behavioral disorders (EBD), mild intellectual disabilities (MID), or attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) as their primary disability by their schools. In other words, we took disability classification from the <italic>Student’s School Program Survey</italic> and specifically from the variable in the survey representing the student’s primary disability. We used the data on students with these disability categories who were in school in Wave 1 but out of school in Wave 2 and students in school in Wave 2 but out of school in Wave 3. Finally, we included only students who responded about receiving assistive technology in school and out of school (i.e., responded yes or no); students for whom this question was not asked or an answer not provided were excluded. All results and demographic information reported were weighted using the weights in the NLTS2 database to represent the number of students nationwide who met the criteria for participation (for additional information relative to weighting the data, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0741932511401037">Javitz &amp; Wagner, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0741932511401037">Wagner, Kutash, et al., 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>The NLTS2 used a two-stage sampling procedure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0741932511401037">SRI International, 2000a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0741932511401037">Wagner, Kutash, et al., 2005</xref>). First, from each stratum created to account for geographic region, student enrollment, and wealth of local educational agencies (LEAs) or the community, LEA- and state-supported schools were randomly selected to participate. Second, students receiving special education services within the selected LEAs and special schools were randomly selected to participate. However, the students were selected to ensure a 3.6% standard error in the disability categories with the highest frequency of students (i.e., LD, EBD, intellectual disabilities, speech and language impairments, other health impairments, and hearing impairments; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0741932511401037">SRI International, 2000a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0741932511401037">Wagner, Kutash, et al., 2005</xref>). The sampling of students was also weighted toward older students (i.e., those aged 16) at the start of Wave 1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0741932511401037">SRI International, 2000a</xref>). Using weights, the actual participants of the NLTS2 study represented a total of 19,899,621 students receiving special education services from the 12,435 LEAs that participated in the NLTS2 study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0741932511401037">SRI International, 2000a</xref>). The response rates for the <italic>Parent/Youth Survey</italic> for Waves 1, 2, and 3 were 82.1%, 61.1%, and 50.4%, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0741932511401037">SRI International, n.d</xref>.). The response rate for the school surveys was between 36.0% and 57.0% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0741932511401037">Blackorby et al., 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>The weighted number of students with high-incidence disabilities (i.e., LD, EBD, MID, and ADHD) who were in school in Wave 1 of the NLTS2 and out of school in Wave 2 or in school in Wave 2 and out in Wave 3 and responded (yes or no) to the question about receiving assistive technology in school and out was 305,131. Of these, 75.8% reported a primary disability of LD, 10.1% EBD, 8.2% MID, and 5.9% ADHD. The students were predominantly male (71.4%) and Caucasian (61.6%). Almost one fifth of the students were Black (18.4%), 16.8% were Hispanic, and 3.2% were other ethnicities. At the time of their postschool interview (i.e., Wave 2 or Wave 3), the majority of youth were 19 to 20 years old (49.6%), followed by 18 years of age (36.3%), and then younger than 18 years old (14.1%). The majority of respondents indicated they graduated from school (81.1%). The next most frequently indicated reason why students were no longer in school was they had dropped out or stopped going (15.1%). The most frequently identified parental income was more than $50,000 (43.3%), followed by less than or equal to $25,000 (32.4%) and then between $25,001 and $50,000 (24.3%).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0741932511401037">
<title>Procedure</title>
<p>To answer our research questions, we extracted relevant variables across waves from databases provided by the NLTS2. Specifically, we pulled data from Waves 1, 2, and 3 of the <italic>Parent/Youth Survey</italic> and Waves 1 and 2 from the <italic>School Program Survey</italic>. We focused on variables representing responses to questions that directly asked about assistive technology (e.g., use of assistive technology in school in past 12 months, use of assistive technology currently, in need of assistive technology) as well as variables pertaining to postschool outcomes (e.g., working full-time or part-time, living independently, and hourly wage; see the appendix, available online at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://rse.sagepub.com/supplemental">http://rse.sagepub.com/supplemental</ext-link>, for a chart documenting the variable name, the variable name in the original NLTS2 database, and a brief description of the variable). We also used demographic variables, such as ethnicity, gender, and family income, to provide a description of our participants.</p>
<p>Although we used some of the original NLTS2 variables in our analysis, we also recoded some categorical variables by merging categories. The variable regarding independent or dependent living (i.e., np<italic>X</italic>A6a_01 to 16) included 16 separate categories (e.g., living on his or her own, living with a spouse or roommate, living in a college house or dormitory, and homeless). We condensed the categories into three: independent living (i.e., on his or her own, with a roommate or spouse, in a college dormitory, and in military housing), dependent living (i.e., with his or her parents, with another relative, in a group home or assisted living center, and in a correctional facility or youth detention center), and other (i.e., other and homeless, transient, or living in a car). Another manipulated variable was the one that addressed why the student was no longer in secondary school (np<italic>X</italic>D1K), which consisted of seven separate categories (i.e., graduated, dropped out or stopped going, received certificate, older than the age limit, suspended, expelled, other). Specifically, this variable was used in two ways: exploring all the reasons why a student was no longer in school and representing those who graduated from those who did not (i.e., a new dummy variable representing graduated as 1 and not graduated as 0).</p>
<p>Similar procedures were used with the wage variable (np<italic>X</italic>HourlyWage). First, because each wave coded wage ranges differently (i.e., one wave broke wages down into categories ranging from $5.15 to $7.01 or more and another wave ranged from $5.15 to $10.00 or more), the variables were recoded for consistency across each wave. Second, as the analysis called for separating the students who did and did not make minimum wage, a new variable was created to reflect if a student did or did not make minimum wage (i.e., minimum wage at the time of all data collected used in the analysis was $5.15). Students who indicated they made at or above minimum wage were coded as 1, with the remaining students coded as 0.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0741932511401037">
<title>Data Analysis</title>
<p>To answer research questions a and b, we conducted descriptive analyses. Frequency distributions were created for all our variables of interest (i.e., assistive technology receipt, postschool outcomes, demographic information), and results were summarized for all students with high-incidence disabilities (i.e., the disability category aggregated together) as well as for the four specific disability categories separately. Furthermore, frequency distributions were calculated, contingent on students responding yes or no to receiving assistive technology in school for all students with high-incidence disabilities as well as for each disability category.</p>
<p>Pearson’s chi-square tests of association were conducted using Minitab to answer research question c. To answer research question d, a significance test provided with the NLTS2 data was conducted to determine differences in frequencies (for more information regarding this test, refer to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0741932511401037">Institute of Education Sciences, n.d</xref>.; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0741932511401037">Newman, Wagner, Cameto, &amp; Knokey, 2009</xref>). Specially, we conducted this test to analyze the differences in frequencies for postschool outcomes dependent on receiving assistive technology in school (i.e., yes or no) for all students with high-incidence disabilities and for each of the four disabilities categories. Postschool outcomes in the significant test were graduation rates, independent living, postsecondary school attendance, paid job, full-time work, and earning above minimum wage and were all recorded as binary variables; we used an alpha of .05 to judge statistical significance.</p>
<p>Finally, a logistic regression analysis was conducted for each of the six main binary dependent variables of interest (i.e., graduation, independent living, postsecondary school attendance, paid job, full-time work, and earning less than minimum wage) to predict the probability of a desired postschool outcome given receipt of assistive technology in school along with other demographic characteristics of the students. Before proceeding with the logistic regression analyses, Pearson’s chi-square tests of association were completed to determine the independence between the dependent variables. Some significant associations were found between dependent variables, which was not surprising because of the large sample size using the weighted data. Because the magnitude of associations was small, we decided to conduct a univariate logistic regression analysis for each dependent variable. Two independent variables of interest included in the univariate logistic regression analyses were disability (LD, EBD, MID, ADHD) and assistive technology receipt in school. Student characteristics (i.e., gender, ethnicity, and family income) were considered to be included in a logistic regression model as potential covariates if they showed significant associations with postschool outcomes. The preliminary analyses indicated gender and ethnicity were not related to the dependent variables and thus were not included in the further analyses. Subsequent logistic regression analyses included family income (less than $25,000, $25,000–$50,000, and more than $50,000) as a covariate only if the key independent variables showed an adequate model fit to predict a binary postschool outcome.</p>
<p>As noted earlier, all descriptive and inferential analyses were conducted with weights. In particular, the descriptive and logistic analyses were conducted with the IBM SPSS Complex Samples module to apply sample weights so that estimates represented population characteristics, and standard error estimates are adjusted for the sampling design used by the NLTS2.</p>

<title>Receipt of Assistive Technology</title>
<p>Approximately 7.8% (<italic>n</italic> = 23,642) of the students with high-incidence disabilities who responded to the question about assistive technology indicated that when they were in school they received assistive technology within the previous 12 months of completing the survey. (Note that receiving assistive technology was asked of students only in reference to the previous 12 months and currently, which were exactly the same in terms of responses for all individuals. Throughout the article we refer to the response to the question as receiving assistive technology in school.) Of those who reported receiving assistive technology in secondary school, 39.7% indicated it was supplied by the school district (3.1% of the total population in this analysis), and no one reported being on a wait list for assistive technology. In terms of postschool, only 1.1% indicated receiving assistive technology (just more than 1.0% of all students with high-incidence disabilities who responded positively to questions pertaining to assistive technology, <italic>n</italic> = 3,456). Only 0.5% reported they were currently receiving assistive technology after high school. Zero responses occurred for the questions of if the student or the family paid for assistive technology postschool and if the student was on a wait list for assistive technology. However, 1.5% of respondents to the question indicated assistive technology was needed postschool. No statistically significant association existed between reported assistive technology received in school and reported assistive technology received postschool (<italic>p</italic> &gt; .05).</p>
<p>The majority of students who reported receiving assistive technology in school were students with LD (66.2% of responses to the question). Students with ADHD were next (31.2%), followed by students with MID (2.5%) and then students with EBD (0.1%). However, in examining reported receipt of assistive technology within each disability category, 6.8% of students with LD in the analysis reported receiving assistive technology, followed by 2.4% of students with MID and 0.1% with EBD; 40.9% of students with ADHD in the analysis reported receiving assistive technology. Of those students who responded to the question regarding assistive technology postschool, the majority receiving this service were students with MID (65.8%), followed by students with EBD (21.4%) and then students with LD (12.9%). No student with ADHD reported receiving assistive technology postschool. In terms of receipt of assistive technology within disability categories, 9.1% of all students with MID reported so postschool, followed by 2.4% of students with EBD, and then 0.2% of students with LD.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-0741932511401037">
<title>Postschool Outcomes</title>
<p>All students who responded to the questions regarding receiving assistive technology in school and postschool also responded to the questions regarding the reason they were out of school (i.e., graduated, dropped out), their current living situation (i.e., with parents, on own), and if they had attended any postsecondary education after school. However, only 91.4% of the individuals in this analysis responded if they had a paid job, 75.7% regarding full- or part-time work and 68.0% regarding hourly wage.</p>
<p>The majority of students in each disability category reported graduating from high school (refer to <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0741932511401037">Table 1</xref> for postschool outcome frequencies). Furthermore, the majority of students in each disability category indicated they were living dependently after school. This was operationally defined as any response other than (a) living on own, (b) living with a spouse or roommate, or (c) residing at a military base or postsecondary institution. Fewer than 50% of students with LD, EBD, and MID reported attending any postsecondary educational institution (i.e., vocational or technical school, community college or 2-year university, or 4-year university) since leaving high school, whereas 70.3% of students with ADHD reported attendance (refer to <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0741932511401037">Table 1</xref>). Students with EBD had the lowest frequency of postsecondary educational involvement of the four disability categories with 23.8%. When asked specifically if currently attending a postsecondary institution, fewer than 40% of respondents in each disability category indicated such involvement (LD—32.7%, EBD—13.6%, MID—24.0%, ADHD—36.9%).</p>

<p>Of those who responded to working at a paid job since leaving school, the majority of students with LD (55.9%) and ADHD (89.2%) indicated yes, as compared to 39.3% of students with EBD and 29.7% of students with MID. A higher frequency of students with ADHD, EBD, and MID reported working part-time; the majority of students with LD reported working full-time (56.8%), defined as more than 35 hours per week. The majority of students in all four disability categories indicated receiving above the minimum hourly wage, which at the time of data collection was $5.15 (refer to <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0741932511401037">Table 1</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-0741932511401037">
<title>Assistive Technology and Postschool Outcomes</title>
<p>Almost all of those who responded positively to receiving assistive technology in school graduated (99.8%, <italic>SE</italic> = 0.1), resulting in a statistically significant difference in frequency from those who did not receive assistive technology in school (79.6%, <italic>SE</italic> = 3.4; <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001). The differences in frequencies were statistically significant for all disability categories except ADHD (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .001; see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0741932511401037">Table 1</xref>). No individual who reported receiving assistive technology in school (<italic>n</italic> = 23,642; 7.8% of total sample size of 305,131) indicated he or she lived independently postschool. The frequency for living independently of those reporting receiving assistive technology in school (0.0%) was significantly different from that for individuals who did not receive assistive technology in school (25.0%, <italic>SE</italic> = 4.2; <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001). For all the disability categories except ADHD, the differences in independent living rates were also statistically significant (refer to <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0741932511401037">Table 1</xref>).</p>
<p>A large proportional difference in the frequency for attending a postsecondary institution since high school was observed between those receiving assistive technology and those who did not (80.9%, <italic>SE</italic> = 11.0 vs. 40.1%, <italic>SE</italic> = 4.3, respectively), and the difference was statistically significant (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .001). The statistically significant differences occurred for all disability categories except ADHD. More than 80% (84.6%, <italic>SE</italic> = 10.0) of all students with high-incidence disabilities in this analysis who responded yes to receiving assistive technology in school indicated having a paid job postschool, as compared to 50.8% (<italic>SE</italic> = 4.6) who indicated not receiving assistive technology in school. The difference in frequencies was statistically significant (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .01). For all disability categories except LD, the differences in frequencies were also statistically significant.</p>
<p>There was no overall difference in terms of students with high-incidence disabilities earning less than minimum wage with respect to receiving or not receiving assistive technology in school (9.4%, <italic>SE</italic> = 3.0 vs. 33.9%, <italic>SE</italic> = 17.6, respectively). The only disability for which there was a statistically significant difference in frequencies regarding earning less than the minimum wage was students with MID (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .05). Note that the significance test for the category of EBD could not be conducted as no student in this disability category who used assistive technology in school responded to this question. Slightly more than 50% (54.6%, <italic>SE</italic> = 6.8) of students who did not receive assistive technology in school reported working full-time postschool, as compared to 26.4% (<italic>SE</italic> = 13.6) of those who received assistive technology in school. However, the difference in frequency was not statistically significant. No differences in frequencies were statistically significant for the disability categories, aside from MID (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .001). Again, the test could not be performed on the category of EBD as those who received assistive technology in school gave no responses to this question.</p>
<p>Finally, initial logistic regression analysis for each dependent variable indicated the two independent variables of interest (receipt of assistive technology in school and high-incidence disability category) were helpful to predict only two dependent variables: paid job and postsecondary attendance. The results of logistic regression analyses for these two dependent variables are summarized in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0741932511401037">Table 2</xref>. The receipt of assistive technology and high-incidence disability category were not statistically related to the rest of the dependent variables. However, when the analysis included family income as a covariate, the only statistically significant factor was family income for postsecondary attendance. This means the rate for attending postsecondary education was not predictable from either the student’s history of receiving assistive technology in school or the student’s disability category. The rate of postsecondary attendance tended to be higher for students who came from a family with a high income (<italic>e</italic><sup><italic>B</italic></sup> = 2.37, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01). Yet the effect was small, indicating that other factors not investigated in the study may affect students’ decisions for postsecondary attendance. Similarly, when income was included in the model as a covariate, the only statistically significant factor for paid job was high-incidence disability category. The estimated exponentiated coefficient for LD was 0.306 (<italic>p</italic> = .04), indicating the likelihood of having a paid job for students with LD was lower than the likelihood for students with ADHD. In other words, the chance of having a paid job for students with ADHD was about 3.3 times (i.e., the inverse of 0.306) higher than for students with LD. Likewise, students with ADHD were more likely to have a paid job than students with EBD (6.1 times) and students with MID (7.0 times). This result for a paid job, controlling for receipt of assistive technology and family income with the logistic regression analysis, is consistent with the descriptive results in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0741932511401037">Table 1</xref>.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>This secondary analysis of the NLTS2 data sought to understand the receipt of assistive technology device or service in and out of school by students with high-incidence disabilities and the relationship between receiving assistive technology in school and postschool outcomes. In response to the four research questions, the secondary analysis indicated (a) little assistive technology reported being received at the end of secondary education by students with high-incidence disabilities (i.e., 7.8%), (b) little assistive technology reported being received postschool by students with high-incidence disabilities (i.e., 1.1%), (c) no relationship between receiving assistive technology in school and receiving assistive technology postschool for students with high-incidence disabilities, and (d) little relationship between postschool outcomes and receipt of assistive technology in school by students with high-incidence disabilities.</p>
<sec id="section11-0741932511401037">
<title>Receiving Assistive Technology</title>
<p>Although the NLTS2 asked about receiving assistive technology only in the past 12 months, the low frequency is perplexing if not surprising (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0741932511401037">Edyburn, 2000</xref>). Assistive technology devices are considered tools to assist students with disabilities to overcome or bypass their disability to participate or achieve in academic and functional areas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0741932511401037">Edyburn et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0741932511401037">Okolo, 2008</xref>). Assistive technology is often touted as effective for supporting students with disabilities, including high-incidence disabilities, yet fewer than 10% of the students in this analysis reported receiving it in school. This stands in contrast to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0741932511401037">Golden’s (1999)</xref> estimation of the percentage of students in each disability category who would benefit from assistive technology (i.e., 25%–35% for students with LD, 25%–35% for students with cognitive disabilities, 10%–25% for students with EBD; no percentage was given for students with ADHD, but 25%–35% was estimated for students with other health impairments).</p>
<p>Although the exact reasons for the low reported assistive technology receipt in school are not known and could not be determined in this analysis, one reason may be limitations associated with the manner in which assistive technology was defined within the NLTS2. As previously indicated, the NLTS2 was not originally designed to focus on assistive technology, although assistive technology devices and services should be a critical consideration in secondary education and postsecondary experiences of students with disabilities. Hence, the results warrant examination in light of what assistive technology is. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0741932511401037">Edyburn (2006)</xref> questioned what is and is not assistive technology given the rather vague federal definition (i.e., the reference to anything). This is particularly relevant to the survey questions used to understand students’ receipt of assistive technology; the phrasing of the question may have narrowed the definition of assistive technology devices for the interviewee. It is unclear if the question and given examples (e.g., tape recorder and a reading machine in the phone interview; large print, Braille, or large screen, books on tape, computer or spell checker, computer software, adapted computer hardware, or calculator in the mail survey) helped or misled individuals in their response, as some may have responded <italic>no</italic> just because they did not hear or see their specific tool or tools (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0741932511401037">SRI International, 2000b</xref>). Given the more high-tech examples, students may have received low-tech assistive technology, but perhaps they or their parents did not consider this assistive technology, as technology is often equated with computers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0741932511401037">Edyburn, 2000</xref>). Furthermore, the questions from both surveys failed to truly address assistive technology services, defined by the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0741932511401037">Technology-Related Assistance for Individuals with Disabilities Act of 1988</xref> as “any service that directly assists an individual in the selection, acquisition, or use of an assistive technology device.” Assistive technology services are a necessary component to selecting and implementing devices and are often overlooked, especially for students with more high-incidence disabilities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0741932511401037">Parette, Peterson-Karlan, &amp; Wojcik, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>The low rate of reported assistive technology reception postschool can also be a call for concern (i.e., 1.1%). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0741932511401037">Yeager, Kaye, Reed, and Doe (2006)</xref> found individuals with disabilities reported assistive technology as one of the most essential factors for their successful employment, providing employment opportunities otherwise not be possible. Researchers have also found a connection between receiving assistive technology and attending and successfully completing postsecondary education (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0741932511401037">Stodden, Roberts, Picklesimer, Jackson, &amp; Chang, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0741932511401037">Stodden, Whelley, Chang, &amp; Harding, 2001</xref>). In fact, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0741932511401037">Lamb (2007)</xref> stated, “The need for assistive technology is often pivotal to the success of students with disabilities in postsecondary settings” (p. 7). The lower reported receipt of assistive technology postschool as compared to in school is contradictory to the conclusion of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0741932511401037">Stumbo, Martin, and Hedrick (2009)</xref>: “Assistive technology is more prevalent in postsecondary than secondary schools” (p. 103). However, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0741932511401037">Christ and Stodden (2005)</xref> noted offerings of assistive technology differed across postsecondary education institutions, and our analysis lumped the different types together. Furthermore, Christ and Stodden found assistive technology support increased at postsecondary institutions over time; hence, perhaps the low reported use by the students in this analysis reflects this trend, and time is needed to see increased access.</p>

<title>Assistive Technology and Postschool Outcomes</title>
<p>Despite mixed results, there are <italic>potential</italic> positive implications for receiving assistive technology in school with regard to postschool outcomes, although additional research is needed. Students with high-incidence disabilities who received assistive technology in school had higher graduation rates, had higher rates of paid jobs, were less likely to be earning less than the minimum wage, and were more likely to have attended a postsecondary educational institution. Yet no student who received assistive technology in school was living independently, and fewer were working full-time. Higher attendance at postsecondary education may also explain the lower rates of independent living and full-time employment. It is important to consider these issues in light of mitigating factors, such as the demographic variable of family income (or socioeconomic status [SES]) and the relationship between students’ SES and access to better postschool outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0741932511401037">Wagner, Newman, et al., 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>The results of additional inferential analyses with Pearson’s chi-square test and logistic regression to examine the relationships between receiving assistive technology in school and postschool outcomes were not statistically significant; hence, no relationship was found between these two issues for students with high-incidence disabilities. Although the reasons for differential results in terms of postschool outcomes and receipt of assistive technology along disability lines is unknown, one hypothesis relates to actual differences among disability characteristics. For example, perhaps the need of and the types of assistive technology provided for students with LD and ADHD in school differed qualitatively and quantitatively from those of students with EBD and MID. Given data limitations, this hypothesis was not testable.</p>

<title>Implications for Practice</title>
<p>This secondary analysis regarding students with high-incidence disabilities, assistive technology, and postschool outcomes holds implications for practice. For one, it suggests educational institutions (i.e., K–12 schools and higher education) as well as other organizations (i.e., vocational rehabilitation) may need to do better at making assistive technology devices and services available to students with high-incidence disabilities in school and postschool, and students and parents need to be more proactive in (a) advocating for their use of assistive technology and/or (b) using assistive technology if it is offered and/or provided. Access to assistive technology is important for all students with disabilities, and it can provide students access and opportunity as well as compensate for challenges in school and postschool faced as a result of their disability. Previous research indicated the positive potential of assistive technology in terms of postschool outcomes for students with disabilities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0741932511401037">Edyburn, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0741932511401037">Edyburn et al., 2005</xref>). Although in this particular analysis assistive technology did not predict students experiencing greater success after school, the reasons for the results were discussed (i.e., the manner in which assistive technology was operationally defined by the NLTS2 and the potential for confounding factors, such as income). Providing students with assistive technology is still important, and assistive technology provides benefits, even if not ones captured by postschool success.</p>

<title>Limitations and Future Directions</title>
<p>One limitation is that this study is a secondary data analysis, and hence it is subject to the limitations of the original data collection as well as the lack of control over questions and design. Both youth and parents were asked to respond to survey items (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0741932511401037">SRI International, 2000b</xref>). Related, initial contact for the surveys was via a phone interview; however, when not possible, a paper survey was mailed. The paper survey and the phone interview survey were not identical, as previously discussed. This limitation is minimized as only 1.2% of respondents completed the mail survey in school and only 4.2% when responding out of school. Although the definition of assistive technology in the NLTS2—in and of itself as well as the different connotations between the two forms—came into question, the database allows the field to see a national perspective of assistive technology use—as (unfortunately) commonly defined in a limited sense—for students with high-incidence disabilities and enables initial understanding of the relationship between receipt of assistive technology and postschool outcomes. Despite limitations, the study pushes the conversation on assistive technology and for increasing funding for quality research.</p>
<p>Another limitation involved postschool outcomes being limited to 1 or 2 years out of school (i.e., immediate outcomes). The results may have been different had the data set included students who were 3, 4, or 5 years out of school (i.e., more long-term outcomes). Also, all data collected are based on self-reports, and self-reported data always have the potential for biases. Finally, there are missing data. Although the analysis was limited to students with high-incidence disabilities who responded to both questions regarding assistive technology in school and postschool, not all students responded to the outcome questions (i.e., less than minimum wage, full-time work). Furthermore, skip logic was imposed on all the surveys, so not all respondents were asked every question, respondents could elect not to answer a question, and attrition occurred across waves (i.e., lower response rates in Waves 2 and 3; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0741932511401037">SRI International, n.d</xref>.)</p>
<p>Additional research is needed to better understand students with high-incidence disabilities receiving assistive technology in and out of school as well as the relationship between receiving assistive technology and postschool outcomes. In this study, we explored the national trend in this relationship with NLTS2 data. However, our investigation is exploratory in nature using a simple model to analyze secondary data; additional confirmatory studies are needed with additional variables to capture the complex nature of the relationship. For example, data analyses should be conducted to examine more long-term outcomes. Future researchers should investigate the differences in self-reported assistive technology reception in school and postschool across the different disability categories. For example, is the type of assistive technology provided to students with LD qualitatively and quantitatively different than that for students with EBD or MID? Or is the type for students with MID who receive it in school different from those who receive it postschool? Research is needed in which assistive technology is clearly operationally defined and the ability to compare low-tech to moderate-tech to high-tech tools exists. Finally, as evident from the limitations of using the NLTS2 to explore issues of assistive technology and outcomes but without other options as to a national sample of secondary students with disabilities, a national effort is needed to collect data regarding the provision, use, and outcomes of assistive technology. Assistive technology tools are necessary; research efforts are needed to more fully and systematically evaluate the tools—in terms of both school success and postschool outcomes.</p>
