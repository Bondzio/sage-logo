<abstract>
<p>Water injection in twin-screw compressors was examined in order to develop effective humidification and cooling schemes for fuel cell stacks as well as cooling for compressors. The temperature and the relative humidity of the air at suction and exhaust of the compressor were monitored under constant pressure and water injection rate and at variable compressor operating speeds. The experimental results showed that the relative humidity of the outlet air was increased by the water injection. The injection tends to have more effect on humidity at low operating speeds/mass flow rates. Further humidification can be achieved at higher speeds as a higher evaporation rate becomes available. It was also found that the rate of power produced by the fuel cell stack was higher than the rate used to run the compressor for the same amount of air supplied. The efficiency of the balance of plant was, therefore, higher when more air is delivered to the stack. However, this increase in the air supply needs additional subsystems for further humidification/cooling of the balance-of-plant system.</p>

<sec id="sec1-0954406212438323" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title>
<p>Hydrogen fuel cells tend to be the long-term solution to tackle the current environmental threats and future fuel sustainability. They are clean, quite and highly efficient energy sources with great design flexibility and fuel reliability. They encompass a broad spectrum of applications ranging from low-power electronic devices, such as mobile phones and laptops, to medium- and high-power systems, including automotive and power generation plants. Despite these attractive advantages, fuel cells still suffer from high cost and the absence of hydrogen infrastructure. These two obstacles are considered to be the major challenge for their market penetration and success. Great efforts were made in recent years to improve the current design of fuel cell systems, particularly in terms of cost and volumetric efficiency durability, and also to promote the transition to an established hydrogen economy.</p>
<p>In order to perform the electrochemical reaction of fuel cells, both hydrogen fuel and air/oxygen have to be supplied to the anode and cathode sides of the stack, respectively. A typical hydrogen supply system comprises high-pressure storage tank, pumps, regulators and, in some designs, injectors. The design of air system is often more complex. Additional air supply and conditioning subsystems are needed to deliver ambient air to the stack as well as maintain the humidity and temperature of the inlet air at a desirable level for an optimum fuel cell operation. For example, humidifiers are usually introduced to fuel cell systems after compressor stage in order to improve the relative humidity (RH) and temperature before entering the stack. These two parameters influence the polarisation behaviour and water management of the cell. Increasing the humidity of air improves significantly the electrode reaction and conductivity of the membrane<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0954406212438323">1</xref></sup> and affects the water flooding phenomenon of the cell.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0954406212438323">2</xref></sup> Similarly, the increase in temperature causes reduction in the internal resistance as well as electrochemical activation loss of the cell.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0954406212438323">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>There are different approaches to humidify the reactant air. Humidification can be made internally or externally to fuel cell stacks. Internal humidification could be rather difficult since it adds complexity to the stack design and may cause instability to the water management of the cell. In contrast, external humidification offers more flexibility and better use at high temperatures.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0954406212438323">4</xref></sup> In the external humidification scheme, two methods are commonly used to humidify the air. These two methods are known as (a) bubble humidification and (b) direct steam injection. Bubble humidification, where the air is finely bubbled through the heated water column, is characterised by its simplicity, bulkiness and the ability to control RH,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0954406212438323">5</xref></sup> whereas direct steam injection is compact and more complex in design.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0954406212438323">6</xref></sup> The choice of one method over the other is determined by the type of application used for, particularly in terms of space availability and the gain in stack power by implementing that method. For example, in automotive applications, where fuel cell stacks have a high power capacity, direct steam injection is preferred. The power consumed to humidify the air is still relatively low compared to the gain in the overall stack power.</p>
<p>Another method to humidify the air is by direct water injection. As the name suggests, water is injected directly into the air stream in the form of micro-droplets or mist. Although this method may not provide a high level of humidity as steam-based humidification, e.g. bubble type or steam injection, it eliminates the need for a heater in the design. The heat produced by the air-supply system can be harnessed and used to evaporate part of the injected water to raise the humidity of the air. In this way, the humidification system becomes more compact with minimum energy requirements.</p>
<p>Previous studies investigated a number of issues concerning compressor designs and systems integration in order to develop advanced air management system for fuel cell stacks. The experimental work in Zhao et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0954406212438323">7</xref></sup> showed that using different materials for the scroll part in scroll compressors does not affect the air delivery trend but is a benefit. It rather results in lowering the compressor power consumption due to minimum friction coefficient. The influence of inlet swirl-generator device’s (SGD) blade position on the compressor performance was examined in Galindo et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0954406212438323">8</xref></sup> to provide a better understanding of the SGD impact on the turbocharger behaviour. The interaction of air supply with the fuel cell stack was addressed in Philipps et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0954406212438323">9</xref></sup> and Gruber et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0954406212438323">10</xref></sup> The simulations in Gruber et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0954406212438323">10</xref></sup> were carried out, using model predictive control technique, to control the oxygen excess ratio; whereas, the experimental results in Philipps et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0954406212438323">9</xref></sup> highlighted the importance of power-dependent modulation of pressure and airflow in the system as it affects the stack efficiency and dynamic response directly. In Tirnovan et al.,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0954406212438323">11</xref></sup> numerical hybrid model was developed to describe the characteristics of turbo-compressors used in fuel cell applications<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0954406212438323">12</xref></sup> focused on modelling static and dynamic operations of all components of a fuel cell system to develop an off-design model of centrifugal compressors and understand the dynamic behaviour of a fuel cell system. Whereas Bao et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0954406212438323">13</xref></sup> used a steady-state analytical model to optimise the design of the fuel cell system, quoting a 3% increase in system efficiency by introducing serial booster and expander to the screw compressor. The idea of injecting water during the air compression stage was proposed in. Zhao et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0954406212438323">14</xref></sup> and Li et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0954406212438323">15</xref></sup> The injected water in Zhao et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0954406212438323">14</xref></sup> was used as lubricant and coolant for scroll-type compressor. The rate of injection was found to be proportional to the isothermal efficiency of the compressor and directly affecting the air discharge temperature. In Li et al.,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0954406212438323">15</xref></sup> a thermodynamic model was developed to investigate the water injection process in twin-screw compressors. The effects of internal leakage and air–water heat transfer were validated against experimental data.</p>
<p>The amount of air entering the stack is directly proportional to the power produced by the individual cells as described in <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="disp-formula1-0954406212438323">equation (1)</xref><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0954406212438323">16</xref></sup>

where <italic>λ</italic> is stoichiometry, <italic>P</italic> the cell power (watt) and <italic>V</italic><sub>c</sub> the cell voltage (V).</p>
<p>In practice, the stoichiometric inlet flow is often made higher than the flow required by the reaction rate in order to remove excessive water from the cathode channels and avoid flooding phenomenon. Number of air-supply systems, including fans, blower and compressors, are used for different fuel cell stack designs. Each system is selected to match particular stack requirements with minimum power consumption in order to keep the overall system efficiency, or so-called balance of plant (BOP), optimum. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0954406212438323">Figure 1</xref> shows a range of air systems that are used in different fuel cell applications. The air mass flow rate is calculated from equation (1), assuming <italic>λ</italic> = 2 and <italic>V</italic><sub>c</sub> = 0.6 V as typical cell values.
<fig id="fig1-0954406212438323" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p>Air-supply systems for different fuel cell applications.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0954406212438323-fig1.tif"/>
</fig></p>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0954406212438323">Figure 1</xref> indicates that for a low fuel cell power range, fans and blowers are more suitable than compressors, since they supply enough air to the stack while being compact and require less power to operate. The use of compressors becomes feasible in high-power applications, particularly for larger systems that require substantial amount of air at high pressures. Large-scale power applications, such as energy generation or combined heat and power generation are, therefore, more appropriate. Although these compressors, such as twin-screw type, are noisy and often require large electric motor to drive them, they have a number of advantages in fuel cells. Their high operating pressure and temperature can be harnessed to inject and evaporate liquid water to increase the RH level of the air entering the fuel cell stack without the need for humidifier, water pump, evaporator and other subcomponents. This improves the efficiency of the BOP system.</p>
<p>In the intermediate power region, fans and blowers struggle to supply sufficient air to the stack at reasonable operating pressures, whereas compressors become inefficient at low mass flow rates due to considerable internal losses.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0954406212438323">17</xref></sup> Low-pressure compressors, such as turbo-machinery and miniature twin-screw types, are therefore expected to play a dominant role in that region.</p>
<p>In large air systems, the temperature of the outlet air usually exceeds the operating limit of the fuel cell stack (&gt;120°C). Therefore, it needs to be conditioned before entering the stack. This is in order to achieve a desirable level of humidity and temperature for optimum fuel cell performance.</p>
<p>In this study, water injection in twin-screw compressors will be examined. The injection is driven by the pressure difference between the injection point and compressor outlet pressure. This set-up which eliminates the need for water injection subsystem, such as water pump, has the advantage of reducing the complexity of BOP and its energy requirements. In addition, this design uses water as a lubricant instead of oil, which improves the adiabatic efficiency of the compressor due to its higher density and specific heat in comparison to oil. Humidity and temperature measurements were carried under various air flow rates (e.g. air supply) to cover a wide range of fuel cell applications. The experimental results were used to estimate the power of fuel cell and compressor as a combined system to evaluate the overall BOP performance. These results provide better understanding of the humidification and cooling mechanisms and an insight into the design aspects for successful fuel cell–compressor integration.</p>

<p>Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0954406212438323">2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0954406212438323">3</xref> show schematics and photograph of the experimental set-up which consists of the compressor, electric motor, water reservoir, water injector and water separator. The compressor is an oil-injected, twin-screw type with rotor diameter and length of 149.6 mm and 231.9 mm, respectively. Oil was replaced with liquid water for lubrication purpose. The compressor operates between 3 and 15 bar of outlet pressure, providing airflow of 2.4–3 m<sup>3</sup>/h. The rotor profile, which is the ‘N’ type, is designed by City University London. This is based on a rack configuration but with modifications to the basic shape so that the best features of the basic rack are retained while most of the disadvantages are eliminated. The design thereby confers a number of advantages, including greater flow area, stronger gate rotor lobes, reduced leakage and lower internal friction than those of alternative types of profile. More details about the design can be found in Stosic et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0954406212438323">17</xref></sup> The compressor is driven by a three-phase alternating current motor. The motor operates with a variable speed in the range 296–2960 r/min at a maximum rated power of 75 kW.

<p>The water used for the injection is stored in a 0.05 m<sup>3</sup> reservoir. The stored water is pressurised by the system operating pressure and forced to travel to the injector nozzle. The nozzle is positioned in the middle section of the compressor chamber with an opening diameter of 5 mm facing the female rotor, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0954406212438323">Figure 3</xref>. When the water enters the compression chamber, majority travels to the rotors, forming sealant film between the blades. The remaining of the water passes to the suction and discharge bearings for lubrication. Two-stage water separator from Precision Pneumatics Ltd (Air receiver Atlas Copco) is installed closer to the water reservoir to prevent the liquid water carried by the air stream, e.g. from the discharge section, accessing the water reservoir for accurate measurements of the RH at the end of air line (area labelled 5). The connection between the air flow line and water reservoir was kept in order to use the system pressure for injection.</p>
<p>Measurements of the air temperature and pressure are carried out at different locations in the system. The ambient (1) and suction (2) pressures were measured using pressure transducers Druck PDCR model 110/W (3) over an operating range 0–3.5 bar. For the discharge pressure (4) and the fluid pressure immediately before of the orifice plate (5), a PDCR model 922 was used with the operating range 0–15 bar. The transducers have uncertainty of ±0.1% of full range of the output (FRO). The sensor has maximum sampling rate and working pressure of 12 kHz and 34 bar, respectively. It operates at a temperature range of −18°C to 93°C with an uncertainty of ±0.5% FRO. A differential pressure transducer, type PDCR 2120, was used to measure the pressure drop through the orifice plate (5). It operates at a maximum pressure of 0.35 bar with an uncertainty of ±0.1% FRO.</p>
<p>K type NiCr–NiAl – B thermocouples are used to measure the air temperatures at ambient (1), suction (2), discharge (4) and in front of the orifice plate (5). It is also used to measure the water temperature at the outlet of the water reservoir (8) before entering the compression chamber. The measurement range of the thermocouples is 0–300°C with an uncertainty of ±1% FRO. An optical frequency speed meter is used to measure the compressor rotational speed (6) where it is transferred to a data logger for analysis. An IML-TRP 500 torque meter transducer was used to measure the compressor driving torque (7). This covered a range 0–500 Nm with an uncertainty of ±0.1% FRO, and the maximum shaft speed is 6000 r/min. The RH and the temperature of the outlet air at the exhaust are measured using Thermo Hygrometer from TRACE (Part no. 323i, ±5%). An opening from the discharge air stream (9) is made to the atmosphere to allow these measurements at ambient condition. All measurements were saved in workstation for further analysis.</p>

<p>The discharge pressure of the system was kept at 5 bar while varying the rotor speed from 1500 to 3000 r/min. At each operating speed (e.g. 1500, 1750, 2000, 2250, 2500, 2750 and 3000 r/min), the temperature and RH of the inlet and outlet air of the compressor were measured. The amount of water consumption during testing was approximately 0.08 min<sup>−1</sup> at steady operation of pressure of 5 bar. The water reservoir needed to be filled frequently after each testing phase.</p>
<sec id="sec4-0954406212438323"><title>Effect on air flow condition</title>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0954406212438323">Figure 4</xref> shows the change of air temperature at the suction/inlet (<italic>T</italic><sub>in</sub>) and exhaust/outlet (<italic>T</italic><sub>out</sub>) of the compressor under various operating speeds and air mass flow rates. Both temperature values increase with increasing the speed and similarly with the air mass flow. The increase of the inlet air temperature was affected by the additional heat generated during the mechanical work of the compressor. The more the work exerted by the compressor for higher speeds, the more the heat dissipated to the atmosphere, which increases the temperature of the surrounding air at suction. It can be seen from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0954406212438323">Figure 4</xref> that the increase in temperature of the inlet air was greater at low/medium speed range than at higher speeds. For example, temperature rose by ∼9°C when rotor speed increased from 1500 to 2500 r/min, whereas only by ∼2°C from 2500 to 3000 r/min. The increase of the inlet air temperature (11°C) was much smaller than the change of the outlet air (25°C). The temperature of the outlet air was increased due to the reduction in the water/air ratio, e.g. increase in air flow at higher speeds while the amount of water injection remains the same, which minimises the cooling effect of the injected water. The total change in the outlet temperature was 25°C as the speed increased from 1500 to 3000 r/min.
<fig id="fig4-0954406212438323" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><p>Effect of compressor speed/air flow rate onto the temperature of the inlet and outlet air.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0954406212438323-fig4.tif"/>
</fig></p>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0954406212438323">Figure 5</xref> shows the effect of compressor speed and air mass flow rate on the RH of the inlet and outlet air, RH<sub>in</sub> and RH<sub>out(inj)</sub>, respectively. It can be seen from the figure that both humidity values reduce with increasing the speed and air mass flow. This decrease was attributed to the increase in the inlet and outlet air temperatures, as previously found in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0954406212438323">Figure 4</xref>. As the temperature increases, the saturation pressure of the water (<italic>P</italic><sub>sat</sub>) increases. The RH, which is the ratio of water partial pressure (<italic>P</italic><sub>w</sub>) over the saturation pressure (<italic>P</italic><sub>sat</sub>), will consequently be reduced for higher temperatures. The reduction appears to be larger at lower speeds and relatively smaller at higher speeds. This trend is dominated by the exponential relationship between temperature and water saturation pressure. It can also be seen from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0954406212438323">Figure 5</xref> that the RH of the outlet air is higher than the inlet one for speed and air mass flow values below 2300 r/min and 68 g/s, respectively. Although the temperature of the outlet air was found higher than the inlet, which one may expect as its RH will have a lower value, the effect of water injection was evident in raising the RH of the outlet air. Above these values (2300 r/min/64 g/s), RH<sub>out(inj)</sub> becomes lower than RH<sub>in</sub>. The amount of injected water was not enough to compensate for the continuous increase of temperature. Therefore, for high operating speeds, more water injection is needed to prevent dry air supply to fuel cell stacks.
<fig id="fig5-0954406212438323" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><p>Effect of compressor speed/air flow rate onto the RH of the inlet and outlet air. RH: relative humidity.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0954406212438323-fig5.tif"/>
</fig></p>
<p>The contribution of water injection to the change of the outlet air humidity can be quantified. Using the measured temperature values of <italic>T</italic><sub>out</sub>, <italic>P</italic><sub>sat</sub> will be known. In addition, since the measurements were carried under the ambient <italic>P</italic><sub>w</sub>, RH can be calculated. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0954406212438323">Figure 5</xref> shows, in dotted line, the calculated RH for the outlet air, RH<sub>out(no inj)</sub>, during the case when no water injection is taking place. This figure demonstrates clearly the impact of water injection in raising the outlet air humidity under different speed/air mass flow conditions.</p>
<p>The rate of water evaporation and the change in RH of the outlet air (ΔRH<sub>out</sub>), e.g. with and without injection, are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0954406212438323">Figure 6</xref>. The evaporation rate was increased by almost three times, from 20 to 62 g/min, as the operating speed increased from 1500 to 3000 r/min. The rate was slightly affected by increasing the temperature and largely by the increase of air mass flow rate. Meanwhile, the decrease in ΔRH<sub>out</sub> was mainly dominated by the increase in temperature.

As shown from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0954406212438323">Figure 7</xref>, <italic>P</italic><sub>comp</sub> increases steadily with an average of 1 kW for 4 g/s of air mass flow rate to reach a maximum value of 25 kW at speed and air mass flow of 3000 r/min and 94 g/s, respectively. The figure also shows the amount of power that would have been produced by the fuel cell for a given mass of supplied air. This power value (<italic>P</italic><sub>FC</sub>) was calculated from equation (1). The BOP power (<italic>P</italic><sub>BOP</sub>) represents the excess in fuel cell power which can be used to run other components in the system, e.g. other than the compressor. The value of <italic>P</italic><sub>BOP</sub> was calculated by subtracting <italic>P</italic><sub>comp</sub> from <italic>P</italic><sub>FC</sub>.
<fig id="fig7-0954406212438323" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><p>Compressor and fuel cell estimated power at different operating speeds and air mass flow rates.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0954406212438323-fig7.tif"/>
</fig></p>
<p>It appears from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0954406212438323">Figure 7</xref> that the more the air mass flow provided to the fuel cell stack, the more the surplus power of <italic>P</italic><sub>BOP</sub>. At air mass flow rate of 94 g/s, <italic>P</italic><sub>BOP</sub> reaches a value of 58 kW. However, this large amount of air supply needs conditioning before entering the fuel cell stack. The temperature and humidity of the inlet air must be kept at the right level to prevent the fuel cell membrane from flooding or drying, which results in considerable degradation in the cell performance. It was found from previous measurements of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0954406212438323">Figure 4</xref> that the RH of the compressor outlet air (or similarly the fuel cell inlet air) is inversely proportional to the air mass flow rate. This decrease will surely affect the estimated <italic>P</italic><sub>FC</sub>. Furthermore, this low RH (&lt;36% RH as achieved based on <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0954406212438323">Figure 5</xref>) will cause a drying effect to the membrane and hence a reduction in its protonic conductivity. However, it is difficult to predict such drop in performance as it varies with the chemical, mechanical and electrical design of the cell as well as depending on whether additional humidification techniques were implemented.</p>

<p>The injection of liquid water in twin-screw compressors was investigated. The temperature and RH of the air at suction and exhaust of the compressor were monitored under fixed pressure and water injection rate and at variable operating speeds.</p>
<p>The measurements show that both inlet and outlet temperatures are proportional to the operating speed and air mass flow rate. The increase in the inlet temperature was the result of increasing the compressor mechanical work that generates additional heat to the surrounding atmosphere at suction. Meanwhile, the increase in the outlet temperature was due to the drop in water/air ratio which minimises the cooling of the injected water at higher speeds.</p>
<p>The temperature was found to be the main contributor to the change in RH of the air. The humidity of the inlet and outlet air was reduced exponentially with increasing the speed and air mass flow rate, a trend determined by the relationship of temperature and water partial pressure.</p>
<p>The impact of water injection in raising the RH of the outlet air was evident. The injection tends to affect the humidity more at low operating speeds (∼13% RH increase) and its effect becomes gradually less at higher speeds (∼5% RH increase). Although at high speeds air humidity was minimum, mainly because of the reduction in water/air ratio under fixed injection, more humidification can be achieved as higher evaporation rate becomes available.</p>
<p>The rate of power produced by the fuel cell stack was higher than the rate used to run the compressor for the same amount of air supplied. The efficiency of BOP was, therefore, higher when more air is delivered to the stack. However, this increase in the air supply needs additional subsystems for further humidification/cooling of the BOP system.</p>
