Abstract
There is a growing phenomenon
of evangelical NGOs engaging in ecotourism businesses. Preliminary research
and case studies show that there is a diversity of approaches and methods
among them, including seeing ecotourism as a method to alleviate local poverty,
care for the environment and stand in solidarity with indigenous cultures.
Based on this research, a theological framework is proposed to help organizations
engaged in community-based ecotourism think through their endeavors in this
field.

Introduction
In a global marketplace of business, industry and commerce, tourism has distin-
guished itself as its largest industry. As a sector of the global economy,
tourism provides both goods and services to persons or groups wishing to undertake
travel for leisure or educational purposes. It employs `some 220 million people
and generates over 10 per cent of the world's GDP' (World Travel and Tourism
Council, 2006), is the leading growth sector of the global economy and driving
economic growth in many countries (US Agency for International Development
119
Table
1: Selected Subsectors of the Global Tourism Industry
[USAID],
2005),1 and is considered to have `a growth potential is unrivalled' (Tourism
Industry Association of New Zealand, 2006). As summarized by the United Nations
World Tourism Organization (2006), `The substantial growth of tourism activity
clearly marks tourism as one of the most remarkable economic and social phenomena
of the past century'. As a complex business sector, tourism contains many
subsectors (see Table 1). The fastest growing subsector of this behemoth industry
is ecotourism. This subsec- tor of tourism is extremely popular, more so among
European tourists than North American tourists. The International Ecotourism
Society (2006: 1) defines ecot- ourism as `responsible travel to natural areas
that conserves the environment and improves the well-being of local people.
Perhaps the reason for the global popular- ity of ecotourism is its unique
combination of ethics with the goods and services of tourism. Ecotourism provides
the consumer with leisure activities in a sensitive and ethical framework
that uniquely addresses three key principles held dear by many consumers:
environmental care, poverty alleviation and cultural solidarity. Given that
ecotourism, as other industries and business as a whole, is so tied into development,
it should not come as a surprise that there are evangelical develop- ment
NGOs involved in this endeavor, motivated by theological frameworks engage
ecotourism as a method to alleviate local poverty, to care for the environment
and to stand in solidarity with indigenous cultures. In fact, evangelical
ecotourism can be seen as a subset of the growing `business as mission' movement,
even though there has been no attempt to analyze it as such. This article,
drawing on survey research data and site visits, describes and analyzes this
growing phenomenon of evangelical ecotourism businesses and proposes a theological
framework to help those evangeli- cal organizations and groups engaged in
community-based ecotourism, a specialized subsector of ecotourism, think through
their endeavors in this field. It does so by beginning with a brief analysis
of the different types of tourism and a description of the results of the
survey research carried out on evangelical organiza- tions involved in community-based
ecotourism, focusing on four case studies coming
120
out
of that research. It then details the proposed theological framework for evangeli-
cal action in this field, and concludes with suggesting some ways that the
theological framework can, and should, inform the praxis of evangelical efforts
in ecotourism. Poverty, Tourism, and the Specialized Subsector of Community-Based
Ecotourism As stated, the global industry of tourism is a complex business
sector that con- tains many subsectors. Table 1 sets out these subsectors,
and their own specialized divisions. These subsectors all have one thing in
common: while tourism gener- ally caters to the needs of the wealthy, it often
takes place in proximity to or even within a context of poverty. The relationship
between tourism and poverty is a complicated one. As is well known, poverty
remains a global nemesis. Despite small, but hopeful indicators of decreases
in rates (World Bank, 2008), poverty remains endemic. The World Bank states
that 20 percent of the world's popula- tion continues to live on less than
US$1 per day. In short, the ancient, yet modern, challenge of poverty demands
new and creative approaches to its alleviation and to the generation of income
for local communities. Tourism has been pointed to as one of these new and
creative solutions to poverty at the macro and micro level. However, in many
cases tourism flourishes precisely because local poverty allows for `reasonable'
prices for wealthy tourists based on low wages and overall costs, and feeds
into the (un)intentional attempts at economic development and poverty alleviation
that are often simply inductions into a globalized monoculture based on materialism
and consumption. Such monolithic acculturation is inherently demeaning and
dangerous to ethnic groups that have survived for mil- lennia, but which,
at present, are pressed from every side by the modern mono-world. While globalization
appears unavoidable for humankind, there is a need for alterna- tives for
minority, indigenous cultures who would reject their forced role in a global
mono-world. Such alternatives must be culturally sensitive, affirming of indigenous
uniqueness and preserving of human dignity, even as they afford the opportunity
of open dialogues and sharing of the deeper issues of spirituality and quality
of life. What better alternative than one that provides income generation
and thus economic devel- opment by intentionally emphasizing the richness
and dignity of the culture itself? This article posits that community-based
ecotourism, a specialized subsector of ecotourism, may be such an alternative.
Ecotourism services are often pro- vided in communities that are economically
stressed, where the local providers can scarcely dream of the wealth owned
by the tourist visitors to their villages. Community-based ecotourism is an
income-generating venture in which the local community is the central stakeholder
and beneficiary. The community takes own- ership of the project and receives
direct economic benefit from the venture. While there may be a partnership
with an outside group or business, all parties honor the involvement and ownership
of the local community. Certainly, secular NGOs have embraced community-based
ecotourism as a dynamic, hopeful strategy. What is less known is that community-based
ecotourism has also captured the imagination and energies of some in the evangelical
development community, and has the potential to grow into a much larger movement
in the future. Evangelical Involvement in Ecotourism: Survey Results and Overview
of Selected Projects2 In 2008, as part of the ongoing research project on
ecotourism directed by Rev. Stan LeQuire at Eastern University's School of
Leadership and Development (SLD),
121
a preliminary
survey was conducted to discover ecotourism business ventures operated by
evangelical NGOs. Due to the breadth and complexity of the evangeli- cal community,
this survey can only be seen as a preliminary investigation. We sent out a
total of approximately 24,900 announcements of our research plans and surveys
in either electronic or print media, including email broad- cast surveys and
magazine articles.3 The survey announced Eastern University's research into
the evangelical engagement of ecotourism and requested basic infor- mation
on ecotourism ventures operated by NGOs. Taking the survey results and combining
them with ecotourism ventures already known to Eastern University,4 we identified
16 evangelical community-based ecotourism businesses. While the survey revealed
only this small number of evangelical NGOs in the field of community-based
ecotourism, we may have missed some and hope to continue to refine our data
on this sector even as we encourage evangelical NGOs to engage community-based
ecotourism to an even larger degree in the coming years. In the process of
gathering information for this research project, several site vis- its were
also conducted from 2003 up to the present. A variety of interviews with NGO
and missions leaders reveal openness of the programmatic staff to ecotour-
ism possibilities.5 Most were favorably inclined to learn more about ecotourism
and to explore ventures in this sector. The dynamics of income generation
and combined with local resources in various countries implied that ecotourism
could be a viable, programmatic option for these NGOs. In addition, the global
market for ecotourism and interest in this venture seems to be growing. For
example, in 2006 a visit was made to a local university in Nicaragua that
operates a thriving undergraduate program in ecotourism. During the visit,
some 250 students majoring in ecotourism were conducting an ecotour- ism fair
in which they enthusiastically promoted ecotourism ventures and pos- sibilities
from each region in their beautiful country. Four of the 16 ventures identified
by our preliminary research are briefly described. In addition, two further
business are described which are provide positive examples, even if their
business models do not quite fit the research defi- nition of community-based
ecotourism. The purpose of these descriptions is to simply illustrate evangelical
engagement of community-based ecotourism, and to provide a jumping off point
for further research. MOPAWI, Honduras Moskitia Pawisa Apiska (MOPAWI) is
an evangelical indigenous NGO that works in the La Mosquitia region of Honduras,
Central America. This isolated area contains villages of a variety of indigenous
peoples: Mosquitia, Pech, Garifuna, Tawahka, and Ladino. The region is also
blessed with the Western Hemisphere's largest track of untouched rainforest
north of the Amazon. MOPAWI helps protect the 815,000 hectare Río Plátano
Biosphere Reserve, which comprises a large por- tion of the rainforest. As
a development organization, MOPAWI operates many projects, such as substance
abuse education, youth programs, and a vibrant com- munity-based ecotourism
project which is located within the biosphere reserve. The Ecotourism Committee
of Las Marías, one of the principal villages within the reserve, organizes
most of the ecotourist visits to the reserve. Local villagers offer food,
lodging and tours on a rotational basis as organized by the local committee.
In addition, the committee trains villagers to serve as certified tour guides
who are knowledgeable in the local flora and fauna. Due to MOPAWI's impressive
efforts and results, this community-based eco- tourism venture has garnered
extensive, international attention. Conservation
122
organizations
and many researchers have partnered with and studied MOPAWI. Furthermore,
a wide variety of different NGOs cooperate to promote the role of ecotourism
in the Río Plátano Biosphere Reserve. These include RARE Conservation, La
Ruta Moskitia, MOPAWI itself and even the United Nations. Proyecto Aldea Global,
Honduras Proyecto Aldea Global (PAG), an evangelical nongovernmental organization,
operates a variety of significant projects in Honduras, including ones dealing
with sustainable agriculture and water resource management. In addition, PAG
co-manages the Cerro Azul Meambar National Park (PANACAM) in a Honduran cloud
forest,6 and within this Park it operates a thriving community-based ecot-
ourism business. Two key components of its ecotourism outreach include a restau-
rant and nature interpretation center, La Naturaleza Visitor Center, on the
shores of Yojoa Lake and an ecotourism lodge and environmental education center
in the village of Los Pinos. PAG uses paid and volunteer staff from local
indigenous Lenca villages to carry out its ministries of creation care and
poverty alleviation. Annual visitors number in the thousands and are mostly
Hondurans who take advantage of the glorious scenery and the lodging facilities
for retreats and vaca- tions. The government of Honduras has awarded PAG with
national honors for its outstanding ecotourism ventures. Bushara Island Camp,
Uganda Bushara Island Camp is located on the shores of Lake Bunyonyi, in the
Kabale dis- trict of Uganda. The project started through a partnership with
Anglican Church of Uganda, Diocese of Kigezi, the Africa Community Technical
Service (ACTS), and the Lake Bunyonyi community. The camp offers guests a
variety of lodging options from pitching one's own tent to fully furnished
rooms. An on-site restau- rant serves delicious meals. The Camp takes advantage
of its beautiful setting and the richness of local life with natural and cultural
tours. All profits from the Camp go to local community projects including
agro-forestry, small livestock distribu- tion, orphan care, HIV/AIDS education,
and other income generation projects. Pacaya Tours, Nicaragua This is one
of the simplest ecotourism projects discovered by our research. Pacaya Tours
consists of a hiking trail around a scenic lake 35 kilometers south of Managua,
the capital of Nicaragua. This tourism business is operated by a local community
development organization and supported by World Vision Nicaragua. The hikes
provide scenic views of lake, tropical forest, and smoldering volcanoes. This
ecotourism business, along with its restaurant services and souvenir sales,
generates income for the local Nicaraguans. Two Additional Businesses In addition,
there are several, stellar ecotourism projects operated by evangelical NGOs
or business persons, but which do not technically meet the research defi-
nition of community-based ecotourism. Two such businesses, Latigo Ranch and
Kuzuko Lodge, are now described. Latigo Ranch, USA Award-winning Latigo Ranch
is a `dude ranch' that fits the North American tra- dition, but not the stereotype.
Complete with horses and wranglers (`cowboys'), a holiday at the ranch is
like a trip back in time. Nestled up against the Arapaho
123
National
Forest, this five-star resort boasts spectacular scenery, comfortable mountain
cabins with a pot-bellied wood stoves, `nouvelle ranch cuisine', and delightful
staff including knowledgeable (and patient) wranglers. While some may think
that horses and their care are antithetical to a healthy environment, Latigo
Ranch operates out of an exemplary environmental ethic. The staff maintains
proactive relationships with the United States Forest Service and models creation
care techniques. For example, Latigo has pioneered a new method of corralling
horses during overnight camping trips with his guests. Previously, the standard
was the use of a high line tether or remuda line. Latigo uses portable, bat-
tery-operated electric fencing and a new corral site with each trip. Then,
as camp is broken the wranglers spread the horse waste so that it does not
collect in unsightly piles or release concentrated toxins. Corralling thus
reduces impact on fragile alpine ecosystems and eliminates siltation along
stream beds. After initial skepticism, the Forest Service gave up tethering
and now prefers Latigo's method of overnight cor- ralling. The Latigo staff
keep abreast of the latest ecological principles in horse care, forest management
and pasture care. They believe that horse touring combined with a strong ethic
of creation care is better than some of the more modern forms of recreational
touring, such as mountain biking (LeQuire, 2007). Kuzuko, South Africa Kuzuko
Lodge is located on a hilltop overlooking an extremely remote, but beau- tiful,
corner of South Africa. Lodging and facilities are on a par with any five-star
resort and includes 24 bungalows, a restaurant, pool, spa and complete confer-
ence facilities. Besides comfort and rest, other activities include game drives,
hik- ing to view ancient bushman cave paintings and bird-watching. The 14,500
hec- tares administered by Kuzuko are a private concession within the Addo
Elephant National Park. Through a unique partnership with the South African
national park system, Kuzuko is reintroducing native fauna and rehabilitating
the unique regional flora. Archbishop Emeritus and Nobel Peace Prize winner
Desmond Tutu officially opened Kuzuko on 3 November 2008. In his remarks,
he expressed gratitude for Kuzuko's vision of alleviating poverty in the Eastern
Cape province and said: `Thank you for believing in our people and contributing
towards their upliftment. This country is a scintillating success waiting
to happen and projects like this one ensure that our people have the opportunity
to realize their potential' (Legacy Hotels and Resorts International, 2008).
Kuzuko was founded by a consortium of Christian business persons and venture
capitalists dedicated to social transforma- tion in the Eastern Cape province,
where unemployment and HIV/AIDS rates are unusually high. The goal is to operate
a tourism business that is both ecologically sustainable and involved in the
local community through a variety of outreach programs .7 Another unique partnership
links Kuzuko with Umziwethu, a South African development organization, which
provides job training and placement for South Africans from disadvantaged
backgrounds. Kuzuko has hired chefs, waiters and trained field guides from
Umziwethu. A Proposed Theological Framework The research undertaken reveals
an initial picture of what evangelical NGOs are doing in the area of community-based
ecotourism. Additional research needs to be undertaken as to why they are
engaging such a unique business venture and how they are doing it. Are they
engaging in it because of its increasing global
124
popularity?
Is it because their faith and theology compel them to engage such a potentially
holistic option? Are they integrating a holistic gospel message into their
efforts, including sharing the message of salvation? These and other ques-
tions mirror, not surprisingly, the questions that are also asked of the business
as mission movement, of which evangelical ecotourism can be seen as a very
intrigu- ing, and informative, subset. This article proposes a preliminary
theological framework for evangelical involvement in community-based ecotourism
as a jumping off point for further research and dialogue about praxis with
evangelical NGOs who currently engage community-based ecotourism. In addition,
such a framework could go a long way in supporting new endeavors in community-based
ecotourism. This theological framework posits that community-based ecotourism
is a dynamic venture where creation, culture and economic betterment meet.
It takes these three concepts as its starting points and suggests that these
three components are best addressed within a narrative, missiological theology.
It is to that narrative that we first turn. A Comprehensive Narrative Missiological
Theology The narrative theological framework presupposes that a divine metanarrative,
God's story, is operative in creation and in culture. Briefly stated, this
metanarrative begins with the `genesis' of creation and culture and concludes
with its redemp- tion and thus fulfillment in a `new heaven and a new earth'.
Creation and culture are major players or actors in this metanarrative. Unfortunately,
creation and culture are often seen as minor sideshows, inferior subplots,
or simply props by humankind, another major actor in this metanarrative. Narrative
theology can encourage a re-evaluation of all actors in God's story. Narrative
theology thrives in context and will ask questions of its context. South African
theologian Ernst Conradie frames the major, contextual questions as `“Who
is God?” … “What is God doing today?” [and] “What
is God doing in our own lives and the life of this (extended) family, this
community, this congre- gation, this country and this bioregion?”' (Conradie,
2005). Conradie's questions are similar to those someone would ask of a novel
or movie. What is happening in this story? Narrative theology engages reflection
on these kinds of questions. As stated, narrative theology describes creation
and culture as major players or actors in the divine metanarrative. Creation
and culture are also key components of community-based ecotourism. Humans
can interact with culture and creation within the context of community-based
ecotourism. This subsector of tourism is a promising vehicle for participating
in the acts of God within specific contexts of culture and creation. For the
evangelical development worker, narrative theology helps ask significant questions,
such as, `What is God doing in our rainforest or desert and how can we participate
in these acts? If God has created human cul- tures, how does our unique culture
fit in with God's metanarrative?'. Such ques- tions provide vital reflection
and motivation to sustain a vibrant outreach in the area of community-based
ecotourism. Theology of Creation Any group that establishes and operates a
community-based ecotourism venture, engages creation and attempts to care
for creation in a unique way. Some values or beliefs will be operative in
the business. These might be ethical or environmen- tal or a combination of
both. What about evangelical NGOs? Does a theology of creation inform their
business venture? While it is unknown now whether or not
125
such
groups make use of a theology of creation, such a theology is vital in and
what follows we briefly introduce the lines it might follow. Creation is the
beginning and foundational act in God's metanarrative. Created reality is
the framework or the physical stage for all our development activities. Creation's
capacity to provide us with sustenance testifies to God's goodness and majesty.
The created world is the recipient of God's redemptive acts, and the witness
in God's judgment of the human response to this world. Of course, on a practical
level, any ecotourism venture will not succeed without creation. The most
significant part of creation is the imago Dei, the human creature. Out of
a robust theology of creation arises the understanding that humans have the
privilege of participating in the care of creation.8 Currently, one of the
more popular ways of engaging creation in this `care-ful' way is through ecotourism.
Community-based ecotourism models a hopeful approach to interacting with creation.
The vision here is for evangelical operators of an ecotourism venture to embrace
their locale as a gift and trust from the Creator. They would understand the
privi- lege of welcoming visitors as a calling to help the visitors enjoy
what God has made and learn of God's ways in creation. Community owners of
the venture would express their theology of creation in large and small actions – from land preservation and stewardship all the way to the disposal of trash
from guest rooms. While many of the customers of the ecotourism business may
not express interest in the theological underpinnings, at least the staff
would own and act on their beliefs. The leaders of the ecotourism project
would assure that all staff per- sons are trained to understand a vital theology
of creation, as well as a theology of culture, which is our next topic. Theology
of Culture For good or for ill, humans engage culture (and creation) constantly.
A theology of culture is closely related to a theology of creation, because
humans engage creation using their culture. Within the biblical creation narrative
comes a crucial scene: the creation of humans and their call to respond to
creation in cultural ways. Scholars often refer to this establishment of culture
as the `cultural man- date'. While a theology of creation provides a framework
for relating to all created reality, a theology of culture addresses issues
that are uniquely anthropocentric. Beyond the origin and establishment of
culture is the role of human cultures in the narrative and activity of God's
redemption. A theology of culture holds that all human cultures will be redeemed
and exist throughout eternity. Such an exalted role for human cultures implies
two things. First, that the loss of cultures, especially the vast wealth of
indigenous cultures, is not written into God's metan- arrative, and is therefore
evil. Thus, if globalization contributes to the extinction of human cultures,
then globalization must be confronted by the people of God. Second, missional
groups must understand that a part of the missio Dei is at least the protection
of human culture, if not preservation of all that is good within human culture.
It is at this point that human and indigenous rights can enter the discussion.
The redemption of human cultures can be supported in the present by human
and indigenous rights advocacy, and it can easily be seen as integral to missional
commitment in that such advocacy is supported by an understanding of God's
metanarrative. In a context where community-based ecotourism is engaged out
of a missional commitment, it is important that the stakeholders think theologically
about cul- ture. They will need to reflect on the value and worth of their
culture and their reasons for sharing their culture with their customers.
Hopefully, in their theology
126
they
will find a rich resource and anchor for the cultural aspects of their ecotour-
ism business. Ancient scriptural teachings on the value, worth and dignity
of human culture are compelling, yet largely ignored or misunderstood. In
short, Revelation 7:9 envisions all cultures as redeemed by God and gathered
in praise around his throne for eternity. It is therefore incumbent that Christians
among all people should be intentional and dedicated to the preservation of
all that is good within their culture and in the plethora of global cultures.
Due to their zeal and the global reach of their work, evangelicals are positioned
to make a great contribution to cultural solidarity. It would appear that
communi- ty-based ecotourism is a timely idea that could provide an incentive
and a matrix for evangelical action on behalf of indigenous cultures. Before
this can happen, evangelicals must either develop a theology of creation and
culture or at least popularize and disseminate one that already exists.9 Unfortunately
however, evangelical missional groups have often been criticized as insensitive
to the value and worth of the planet's indigenous cultures.1 0 On a more practical
level, while natural beauty is a key component of a success- ful ecotourism
business, the same is true of cultural beauty. Local cultures and eco- tourism
make easy and welcome partners. It is common for ecotourism business ventures
to incorporate cultural elements into the business model. Cuisine for the
tourists and activities for their leisure are often centered upon the host
culture and shared with pride and enthusiasm. In summary, when an evangelical
NGO engages ecotourism, will the cultur- al components and activities of their
business be supported by their theology? Do evangelical entrepreneurs respond
theologically to these and other culturally- related issues? Do their staff
and does the community understand theological ram- ifications of their business
venture? These are questions that a theological frame- work for evangelical
ecotourism should encourage the NGOs to reflect upon. Theology of Poverty
Practitioners of development must reflect theologically on poverty, as they
do on all dynamics within God's story. Poverty is closely related to creation
and culture, because it is a condition that results from a relational pattern
of humans with creation and culture. This relational pattern or approach is
based on power and its manipulation.1 1 When humans misuse power to respond
to creation, domination can result. When humans misuse power to relate to
other cultures, the result is the domination of powerful cultures over less-powerful
cultures, as well as racism, and poverty. Any theology of poverty must address
issues of power. Dealing with issues of power is vital to participating with
God in mission. Those who possess power face serious challenges that could
easily compromise the mission and must take seri- ously that observation that
`authentic development [can] not take place without the transfer of power'
(Bosch, 1991: 357).1 2 Power relates integrally to communi- ty-based ecotourism.
Community-based ecotourism allows for the empowerment of communities, if not
the transfer of power itself. As community developers and leaders begin to
consider community-based ecotourism, the community takes stock of its natural
and cultural assets, as well as its need for income diversifica- tion. Then,
the community decides to establish an ecotourism venture as a pos- sible response
to these local dynamics and realities. Ecotourism is a viable and attractive
response that carries the potential to keep resources and power within the
local communities. The community discovers its wealth and the capital of the
community and locale and takes ownership of it.

Potential
for Theological Discourse and Praxis Community-based ecotourism provides a
fertile context for dialogue and practice around key theological and missiological
concepts. What follows are some brief comments about how community-based ecotourism
can contribute to theological discussions and the effective practice of theology.
Despite the fact that environmental issues garner global concern, evangelicals
lag behind in environmental engagement and remediation. Nonetheless, issues
of creation's care are being rediscovered by the evangelical community. In
part, the rediscovery can is documented by the theological surveys of Dyrness
(1997) and Bouma-Prediger (2001). This renewed interest in theologies of creation
has even generated a few popular titles.1 3 However, the development of evangelical,
theological reflection and praxis in this area needs to continue. Ecotourism
has the potential to take theology beyond the printed page and into an outdoor
labora- tory. It takes little imagination to see that ecotourism has great
pedagogical and economic benefits. In an ecotourism context, tourists/customers
can learn how local Christians think theologically about their land and their
culture. Community-based ecotourism can serve as an outpost of hope in a world
thirsty for economic, environmental, and spiritual options. Ecotourism combines
environmental sustainability, income generation and solidarity with indigenous
cultures to yield a rich, viable option for community development. The participa-
tion of missional groups in ecotourism can further promote these benefits
while adding a deeper theological and spiritual meaning. For example, through
ecotour- ism Christians could provide witness to the eschatological hope for
the redemp- tion of both creation and human culture, sharing the truth about
the saving power of Christ as part and parcel of the process. Ecotourism,
in summary, can point the world to the `new heaven and new earth' and begin
the celebration of all peoples, tribes and nations around the throne (Revelations
7:9, 21:1). With respect to cultural dynamics, many missional groups continue
to struggle with the anthropological reality of human culture, and the theological
concepts, such as the goodness of culture and the `cultural mandate'. Far
too often, missional groups relate to culture as an impediment rather than
an opportunity or as a curse rather than a God-given blessing. Community-based
ecotourism has the potential to show missional groups the power and beauty
of human culture. In fact, ecotour- ism interfaces seamlessly with cultural
solidarity, if not even cultural preservation. Finally, community-based ecotourism
has the potential to provide additional reflection on theology as it leads
to action. For too long, mission endeavors have been practiced as an invasive
procedure from a culture of power or dominant culture into a supposedly weaker
culture. Unfortunately, these traditional models of mission have ignored the
fact that these so-called `weaker cultures' have much to offer, and the so-called
dominant cultures have much to learn. Ecotourism is a promising matrix where
`missions in reverse' could take place. In this refreshing paradigm, mission
groups enter local communities with respect and humility. They leave having
learned from indigenous cultures. In this way, intercultural dialogue and
`intercultural learning' (Shenk, 2003) are encouraged, even in a relaxed and
informal way. Such learning and dialogue are vitally needed in today's world.
Conclusion In creation and in culture, God is daily accomplishing mighty acts.
Using a theo- logical framework, human interaction with creation and culture
is best viewed as
128
a partnership
with God in the world. Thus, groups engaging community-based ecotourism as
missional commitment can ask, as Verstraelen does, what is God doing in creation
and in human culture? What is the nature of `the dynamic rela- tionship between
God and the world [where] God sends himself, his Son and his church?' (Verstraelen,
1995: 4). These narrative-type questions demonstrate the many linkages between
narrative theologies of poverty, creation, and cul- ture. Indeed, community-based
ecotourism provides a rich and rewarding matrix for theology, mission, and
development. Community-based ecotourism makes our theologizing and our development
ministries a compelling and captivating enterprise. Community-based ecotourism,
when engaged by evangelical NGOs, should be carried out in a way that is prophetic
and redemptive, and thereby `mir- rors' God back to his created world.1 4
Community-based ecotourism can be seen as an authentically human endeavor,
as a signpost of what God can accomplish redemptively through the people of
God who are active in creation and culture. In fact, ecotourism operated out
of a rich theology has the potential to give public if not prophetic witness
to the living God.

Notes
1 The economic downturn of
late 2008 will probably change tourism's status as a growing industry.
2 The authors welcome contact
from readers who are interested in information to supplement these business
profiles.
3 Organizations and publications
include, among others, Spirit magazine, Creation Care magazine,
and mailing lists from the Association of Evangelical Relief and Development
and the Micah Network.
4 Besides the survey, a
variety of other methodological strategies have been undertaken to discover
and research evangelical involvement in community-based ecotourism. These
efforts include a variety of site visits and personal interviews. It is beyond
the scope of this introductory article to describe this research. Please
contact the authors for further information.
5 These interviews were
with various country leaders for World Vision in Latin America as well as
board members of MINAP, Misión Integral Nativa del Perú. MINAP is an indigenously
created and operated missional organization tasked with reaching their indigenous
compatriots. This research trip was funded by Geneva Global, Inc., a philanthropic
foundation. A 2004 report, Opportunities in Amazonia, was written by
LeQuire for the foundation.
6 Co-management is a common
paradigm for the operation of governmental resources. In countries where
the government lacks the resources for effective management, officials often
enter into partnership arrangements with NGOs. The implication is that around
the world secular and evangelical NGOs play a critical role in the management
and operations.
7 However, unlike community-based
ecotourism, the ownership of Kuzuko is outside the local community.
8 Of course, a complete
theology of creation cannot be articulated within such a brief article. However,
many resources are available, such as Houston (1995).
9 Some such theologies
and/or popularizations do exist. See for example Dyrness (1997) and Adeney
(1995).
10 Some scholars, such
as Benthall (1995) and Van der Geest (1990), go further and state that evangelicals
are anthropologically oppressive and imperialistic. See, however, the issue
of Missiology (24(2) April 1996), entitled `Missionaries, anthropologists
&amp; human rights', for a wider discussion of this issue.
11 Christian (1999: 210)
masterfully analyses the dynamics of poverty and powerlessness and provides
effective, practical ideas for a `kingdom-based response to powerlessness'.
In so doing, his book is an invaluable text for developing a theology of poverty.
12 Both quotes by Bosch
in this section are taken from Christian (1999).
13 A few recommended titles
include the following: Jones (2003), Robinson and Chatraw (2003), and Van
Dyke et al. (1996).
14 This concept is drawn
from Botman's (2001) imitatio Dei, which means doing the works of
God as God would do them. It is living in this world in a way that `imitates'
God, as it were.</meta-value>
