<title>Objective</title>
<p>Functional endoscopic sinus surgery (FESS) provides symptomatic relief of sinus disease in patients with cystic fibrosis (CF), but it is unclear whether it has beneficial effects on lung disease in this population.

<sec id="section6-0194599812444247">
<title>Results</title>
<p>The rate of decline in forced expiratory volume in 1 second and forced vital capacity was not significantly different in the 12 months before and after FESS. Functional endoscopic sinus surgery did not reduce days hospitalized or days on intravenous antibiotics for a respiratory exacerbation in the pre- vs postoperative period. Limiting the analysis to the 30 surgeries that were performed in patients with concomitant respiratory symptoms (ie, excluding the 15 surgeries performed for sinus symptoms alone) did not significantly alter the results. Covariates of importance in CF, including CFTR genotype, gender, or microbiology, did not affect the study results.</p>

<sec id="section7-0194599812444247">
<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>These results did not demonstrate an effect of FESS on progression of lung disease in patients with CF, but further research is needed because low statistical power has made some of the negative findings inconclusive.</p>

<body>
<p>The majority of cystic fibrosis (CF) morbidity and mortality is due to pulmonary manifestations of the disease, and aggressive management of respiratory disease remains the cornerstone of CF care.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0194599812444247">1</xref></sup> However, there is increasing recognition that optimal treatment of nonpulmonary aspects of CF, such as nutrition and diabetes, are closely linked to improving respiratory outcomes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0194599812444247">2</xref></sup> There is longstanding interest in the relationship between CF-related sinusitis and lung disease. Nearly all patients with CF have radiographic evidence of pansinusitis,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0194599812444247">3</xref></sup> and multiple studies indicate surgical intervention combined with medical management improves sinus symptoms.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0194599812444247">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0194599812444247">5</xref></sup> Whether sinus surgery might also have a salutary effect on the respiratory status of individuals with CF is less clear. Although not definitively proven, chronic purulent upper respiratory drainage potentially adds to the burden of lower respiratory secretions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0194599812444247">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0194599812444247">7</xref></sup> Furthermore, the improvement seen in asthma control with treatment of concomitant rhinosinusits offers an attractive analogy.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0194599812444247">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0194599812444247">9</xref></sup></p>
<p>In 1990, Umetsu and colleagues<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0194599812444247">10</xref></sup> reported that a combination of sinus surgery and postsurgical topical antibiotic instillation decreased the frequency of respiratory exacerbations over the ensuing 6 months in 4 adult patients with CF with severe lung disease. Subsequent case series of endoscopic surgery to improve the course of CF lung disease have produced mixed results. However, these studies are limited by their small sample size, short duration of follow-up, and variable study end points.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0194599812444247">11</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0194599812444247"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0194599812444247"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0194599812444247">14</xref></sup> A small retrospective series found improved spirometry 3 months following surgery but included only 8 patients.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0194599812444247">11</xref></sup> In contrast, 3 somewhat larger case series that included 14, 66, and 17 patients found no improvement in 6-month postoperative pulmonary function tests.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0194599812444247">12</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0194599812444247"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0194599812444247">14</xref></sup> Furthermore, even fewer studies have assessed the effect of surgical management of CF-sinusitis on respiratory exacerbations. Shatz<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0194599812444247">15</xref></sup> found a more aggressive surgical approach improved lung function and exacerbation rate compared with functional endoscopic sinus surgery (FESS) alone in a select group of 15 children unresponsive to prior endoscopic surgeries. In a larger study, Rosbe and coworkers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0194599812444247">13</xref></sup> found endoscopic surgery may have reduced days hospitalized in the 6-month postoperative period.</p>
<p>The current study provides a more detailed exploration of respiratory outcomes following FESS in adult patients with CF, including the rate of decline in pulmonary function tests, intravenous antibiotic use, and days hospitalized for respiratory exacerbations. Furthermore, the study looks for predictors of a respiratory response to FESS, including whether the decision to perform surgery was driven by sinus symptoms alone or concomitant respiratory symptoms. Portions of these results were previously reported in abstract form.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0194599812444247">16</xref></sup></p>

<title>Participants</title>
<p>The study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of the University of Minnesota. We conducted a retrospective chart review of all adult patients with CF receiving routine care at the Minnesota CF Center who underwent FESS in the 10-year time period between June 1995 and June 2005. All patients followed at this center gave informed consent, permitting their records to be reviewed for research purposes. Inclusion criteria for entry into the study included confirmed diagnosis of CF based on sweat test or CFTR mutational analysis and age older than 18 years at the time of surgery. Exclusion criteria included death within 12 months of FESS (2 patients who underwent 2 surgeries), lung transplantation prior to or within 6 months of FESS (1 patient who underwent 2 surgeries), and fewer than 3 documented spirometry tests in the 12-month period prior to or following FESS (8 patients who underwent 14 surgeries). For patients who underwent multiple FESS procedures, the surgery was excluded from the analysis if it occurred within 6 months of the prior procedure. Six-month, but not 12-month, data were included in the analysis if repeat FESS was performed between 6 and 12 months of the initial FESS.</p>

<sec id="section10-0194599812444247">
<title>Measures</title>
<p>Data were abstracted from medical records as well as the Minnesota CF Database,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0194599812444247">17</xref></sup> a repository of longitudinal clinical information of patients with CF followed at the center. Patients with CF are routinely evaluated every 3 months or sooner when indicated. This evaluation includes spirometric testing, anthropometric measurements, respiratory cultures, and physical examination. Results of all spirometry tests were included in the analysis. Spirometry was performed according to American Thoracic Society/European Respiratory Society standards.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0194599812444247">18</xref></sup> Patients at this center routinely receive intravenous (IV) antibiotics in the immediate preoperative period and for 1 to 2 weeks following FESS. Therefore, antibiotics given during the 3 days preceding and 14 days following surgery were excluded. Antibiotic use was not protocolized. In general, we used 2 antibiotics to cover <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> and 1 antibiotic for <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> regardless of whether it was cultured from sputum or sinuses. Days spent in the hospital for reasons other than complications of CF respiratory disease were excluded, including the 3 days preceding and following FESS. Patients at our center routinely complete a questionnaire at each clinic visit that includes self-rated general condition using a 5-point scale (1 = <italic>excellent</italic>, 2 = <italic>good</italic>, 3 = <italic>fair</italic>, 4 = <italic>poor</italic>, 5 = <italic>sick</italic>). These ratings were included in the analysis.</p>
<sec id="section11-0194599812444247">
<title>Statistical Analysis</title>
<p>Information on demographic data, pulmonary function test results (forced expiratory volume in 1 second [FEV<sub>1</sub>] and forced vital capacity [FVC]), nutritional status by body mass index (BMI), respiratory secretion culture results, dates of hospital admissions, and date of FESS were retrieved from the database. Pulmonary function test results were expressed as a percentage of the predicted norm for both FEV<sub>1</sub> and FVC.</p>
<p>The FEV<sub>1</sub> and FVC values were averaged over the 6 months pre- and postsurgery and also averaged over 12 months pre- and postsurgery, so that comparisons between the pre- and post-FESS period could be performed. The mean change in the FEV<sub>1</sub> and FVC raw values for the pre- and post-FESS periods was calculated, including 95% confidence intervals. To assess for any effects on the rate of decline in pulmonary function, the information was entered with the date on which the individual patient underwent FESS as time 0 so that every individual data point could be identified as having occurred before or after the intervention. To estimate the 1-year rate of decline in FEV<sub>1</sub> and FVC, a mixed linear regression model was generated so that within- and between-subject variances could be properly accounted. The models generated included a spline function that allowed testing for a change in rate of decline between the periods before and after FESS.</p>
<p>To account for the possible interactive effects on the trends seen between time and gender, we introduced CFTR genotype (2 copies of ΔF508, 1 copy of ΔF508, or no ΔF508 copies), age group, prednisone use, lung disease severity by FEV<sub>1</sub> at the time of surgery, nutritional status at the time of surgery, and sputum microbiology (<italic>Pseudomonas</italic> positive or negative) into the models generated to test for differences between the slopes of their categories. Age was entered as a categorical variable with 2 age groups defined (18-30 years and &gt;30 years). The level of FEV<sub>1</sub> was also entered as a categorical variable with 3 groups defined according to the percentage predicted FEV<sub>1</sub> (&lt;40%, 40%-75%, and &gt;75%).</p>
<p>The other outcome measures of interest (days on antibiotics, courses of antibiotics, hospital admissions, hospital days, prednisone use, patient-reported general condition rating) had markedly nonnormal distributions and were compared with pre- to post-FESS using a Wilcoxon matched-pairs signed-rank test. All statistical analyses were performed with the SAS for Windows statistical package (Version 9.1.3; SAS Institute, Cary, North Carolina). An α error level of 5% was used as the cutoff for statistical significance.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>A total of 32 patients met inclusion criteria, 10 (31%) of whom underwent more than 1 FESS procedure. A total of 45 surgeries were included in the analysis. Bleeding complicated 3 of the procedures, but operative courses were otherwise uneventful, and perioperative mortality was 0%. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0194599812444247"><bold>Table 1</bold></xref> summarizes patients’ baseline demographics at the time of surgery. Functional endoscopic sinus surgery typically combines a variety of sinus procedures into a single operation. The 45 surgeries in the study included 38 maxillary antrostomies, 33 ethmoidectomies, 18 frontal sinusotomies, 18 sphenoidotomies, 17 intranasal antrostomies, 1 polypectomy, and 13 other procedures. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0194599812444247"><bold>Figure 1</bold></xref> summarizes the percentage of sinus surgeries that included each of these procedures. The indication for surgery was sinus and respiratory symptoms in 67% of the patients, sinus symptoms only in 29%, and unknown in 4%. Patients were reevaluated in the otolaryngology clinic a median of 3.0 times during the 12-month postoperative period (range, 0-18).</p>

<p>The number and duration of hospital admissions for respiratory exacerbations did not differ between the 6- and 12-month pre- vs postoperative periods (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0194599812444247"><bold>Table 2</bold></xref>). The mean pre- and postoperative FEV<sub>1</sub> and FVC were nearly identical for the 6- and 12-month comparisons, and the rate of decline in FEV<sub>1</sub> and FVC also was not significantly altered by FESS. These trends were not modified by covariates felt to be of importance. As expected, there were significant effects in the rates of decline for FEV<sub>1</sub> and FVC by disease severity and nutritional status, but these were not modified by FESS. Thus, no specific subpopulation seemed to benefit in terms of their trends in pulmonary function by the procedure. Furthermore, there were no significant changes in the reported prednisone use and general condition scores in the postoperative period.</p>
<p>Limiting the analysis to the 30 surgeries that were performed on patients with concomitant respiratory symptoms (ie, excluding the 15 surgeries performed for sinus symptoms alone) did not significantly alter the results (data not shown). There was a small, but statistically significant, decline in the mean 12-month pre- vs postoperative FEV<sub>1</sub> and FVC (.08 L, <italic>P</italic> = .005, and .05 L, <italic>P</italic> = .03, respectively). However, there were no significant differences in the rate of decline in FEV<sub>1</sub> or FVC.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Although considered a valuable option for controlling CF-related sinus disease, the role of endoscopic sinus surgery in mitigating lung disease is unclear.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0194599812444247">10</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0194599812444247">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0194599812444247">19</xref></sup> The current analysis suggests FESS does not improve the respiratory status of adult patients with CF. Specifically, the rate of decline in pulmonary function tests was not significantly altered and, based on days hospitalized and antibiotic days, FESS did not reduce the rate of respiratory exacerbations. To our knowledge, this is the largest study to date examining the relationship between FESS and the longitudinal trends in respiratory status of an exclusively adult CF population. The study is also noteworthy for being more comprehensive than its predecessors. It provides a detailed assessment of multiple clinically relevant outcomes and includes a separate analysis that excluded patients with isolated sinus symptoms.</p>
<p>Similar to previous investigators, we did not find improved postoperative spirometry.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0194599812444247">12</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0194599812444247"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0194599812444247">14</xref></sup> The majority of these studies included predominantly younger subjects with mild lung disease, which may have limited their ability to detect improved respiratory status.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0194599812444247">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0194599812444247">13</xref></sup> An important limitation is that none of the aforementioned studies assessed whether surgery influenced the rate of decline in pulmonary function tests. Because CF lung disease is typically characterized by overall gradual decline in pulmonary function tests, use of discrete pulmonary function test results as study end points may have limited the ability of previous investigators to detect a benefit from endoscopic sinus surgery.</p>
<p>In many respects, the current study was better equipped to identify an improvement in lung function following endoscopic surgery than the preceding investigations. The number of surgeries was relatively large, patients had significant baseline lung disease (mean FEV<sub>1</sub> 62% of predicted), and the rate of decline in pulmonary function was analyzed rather than using isolated spirometry results. We also performed a secondary analysis that eliminated patients without respiratory symptoms and still did not find benefit. Although the smaller study by Halvorson and colleagues<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0194599812444247">11</xref></sup> found improved lung function following surgery, the bulk of the published experience now suggests FESS typically does not alter the rate of decline in FEV<sub>1</sub> and FVC in the CF population. Unlike previous smaller studies,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0194599812444247">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0194599812444247">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0194599812444247">15</xref></sup> we found FESS did not affect the rate of respiratory exacerbations. However, even with 45 surgeries included in the analysis, the study is potentially underpowered to detect important clinical differences. For instance, our study had an 80% power to detect a 1-year change in FEV<sub>1</sub> of 250 mL. A new study would require 350 subjects for the −0.09-L FEV<sub>1</sub> drop observed in our study to reach statistical significance. This suggests the effect of FESS on lung function, if it exists, is likely to be small.</p>
<p>Our study has other limitations that may have affected our ability to detect positive and negative effects of FESS on patients’ respiratory status. First, the study lacked a control group. It is possible that patients in the current study would have experienced more exacerbations or steeper decline in lung function compared with a control group. Like all of the aforementioned studies, the results of the current study are derived from a single center’s experience, and the effect of FESS on respiratory status would be best assessed in a large, multicenter, randomized study. Furthermore, our results are not necessarily applicable to children.</p>
<p>In addition, postoperative management is likely pivotal in determining the outcomes of FESS. Patients in the current study were seen in our center’s otolaryngology clinic a median of 3 times in the 12 months following surgery, but details of postoperative care were neither assessed nor protocolized. Hence, it is possible that use of a standardized, multifaceted postoperative regimen may yield different results. Differences in the surgical approach could also be playing a role. However, FESS was performed by experienced surgeons in a center with a high volume of CF care, entailed standard surgical interventions, and had a low complication rate. The study by Shatz<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0194599812444247">15</xref></sup> was in a select population with refractory sinusitis and entailed an alternative surgical approach and hence is not comparable to the current investigation. Institutional variation in the threshold for instituting intravenous antibiotics, systemic corticosteroids, or hospital admission could also contribute to differences in outcomes. The study’s retrospective nature also precluded an accurate assessment of oral and inhaled antibiotic use for respiratory exacerbations. Last, it is possible that more rigorous patient selection could identify a subset of patients more likely to garner respiratory benefits from FESS. For instance, radiographic imaging prior to FESS might identify a subgroup of patients more likely to have an improved respiratory course following surgery. The paucity of patients with improved respiratory status in our study precluded identification of predictors of positive outcomes.</p>
<p>Functional endoscopic sinus surgery remains a valuable means of alleviating pain and recurrent sinus infection in patients with CF. However, in this study, FESS did not alter the rate of decline in lung function or respiratory exacerbation rate, as measured by days hospitalized and IV antibiotic use, in an adult CF population. Further studies are needed to define predictors of respiratory benefit and to optimize postoperative management. These results did not demonstrate an effect of FESS on progression of lung disease in patients with CF, but further research is needed because low statistical power has made some of our negative findings inconclusive.</p>
