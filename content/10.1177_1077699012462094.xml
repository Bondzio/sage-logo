<p>When I attended grad school years ago, Professor Steve Chaffee used to offer the following advice to anyone seeking a preview of what a book or manuscript had to offer: “check the bibliography first. …” Upon inspection, the bibliography of <italic>War Images</italic> begins with Aristophanes and ends with Wittgenstein—the first hint that this is not your typical book about photography and photojournalism.</p>
<p>Raphael Sassower is a professor of philosophy at the University of Colorado, Colorado Springs, where Louis Cicotello is emeritus professor of visual arts. Their professed hope for this book is that readers will become more “critically engaged in reading war images,” and that this engagement will provide them with the tools to argue for or against wars.</p>
<p>I found this book to be a dense and challenging intellectual experience, and marginally useful as a pragmatic source of tools to argue for or against wars. In the first chapter, the authors explicate a “highly theoretical discussion” of modernism and postmodernism aesthetics. They move on to the “predicament” of comparing war images through a modernist prism versus a postmodernist prism. They wrap up this theoretical discussion with the realities of image censorship and manipulation in the time of war and close with a warning to readers of war images: given this potential for image manipulation and misuse, we need to be more critical in our aesthetic engagement with war images.</p>
<p>The next chapter includes thirty-two war images grouped by eight war conflicts, dating from the 1800s to the present, followed by “representational analyses and a historical annotation” while comparing postmodernist versus modernist readings of each image. The authors’ intent is for readers to come up with their own interpretations and go beyond those offered in the book. I enjoyed this chapter’s look back at these images, but wanted more discussion of the journalistic context and role of the war images. The images also suffer from low-quality B&amp;W reproduction of the original paintings, photographs, and posters. The authors also perpetuate here the myth that Rosenthal’s photo of the American flag being raised on Iwo Jima in World War II was staged.</p>
<p>I found the next chapter on “Recapturing Reality” a timely though still largely an intellectual read with its good discussion of the “visual battle” for the approval or disapproval of war policies in the public mind. The authors follow this with a wide-ranging discussion of the use of fabricated images as a means of legitimizing war to the general public and a review of the pedagogy of critical aesthetic engagement with photos.</p>
<p>The last chapter’s set of recommendations about the need to critically examine war images would be most interesting to undergraduate journalism and photojournalism students, military personnel, and the public at large. In fact, I would recommend reading this chapter first.</p>
<p>Since this book was published, there has been a lively current debate over the news media’s use of war images provided by so-called “citizen journalists” from Egypt, Syria, and elsewhere in the world. I suspect the authors would now like to expand their short concluding discussion of the need to critically examine war images found in social media to war images in the news media. In fact, that sounds like a good topic for a dissertation or book all in itself.</p>
