<abstract>
<p>Post-war, German generations continue to foster an elaboration of guilt and shame. One seminar approaches this difficult subject through a process of mourning, separation from parental position, and transgenerational elaboration of previously uncontained emotions (or what has been called coping with ‘the past in the present’) (Sandler, 1987). This may be described as an encounter between ‘me’, the ego-syntonic aspects of the Self, and the inexcusable, bad and thus hitherto ‘not-me’. Without such an encounter, all relationships and identification with this dark side are projected away into the monster Nazi identity, causing an impossible split in the German psychic reality.</p>
<p>Indirectly ‘working’<sup>1</sup> in the presence of an Israeli Jewish conductor, seems conducive to elaborating some of the shame, guilt and identification with both German and Israeli elders. The elaboration of difficult emotions through the relationships and dreams within the group proves to be an instrument with great potential for mutual growth.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>After all these years of participation in our seminar, I wish to say that finally I feel able to go and visit Israel. We talked in the past about that possibility, and I was quite reluctant. Now I am ready, M. said.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>He was a Scandinavian, participating in a twice-yearly workshop. I felt that a bell was tolling; but why and for whom?</p>
<p>His statement was an indirect outcome of exposure to me, rather than a direct elaboration of emotional contents. Meeting twice a year in a group led by an Israeli had indirectly resulted in some ability to widen the spectrum of an encounter with the ‘not me’.</p>
<p>I am Jewish, and I work in Haifa. Over the years I have often found that my presence ‘facilitates’ coping with dystonic or split off sides of one’s Self. When leading dream seminars (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0533316412440088">Friedman, 2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0533316412440088">2008</xref>), large groups or study days on relation disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0533316412440088">Friedman, 2007</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0533316412440088">2</xref></sup>, participants allow themselves to be conducted through their internal theatres, letting their uncontained sides appear on stage along with the more harmonious and ‘known’ aspects of their Self. Instead of splitting and projecting the different and threatening feelings, meeting and engaging in containment promotes the indirect elaboration of feelings and relations that would otherwise not be possible. Dreamtelling in particular seems conducive to making the process of meeting the ‘alien’ side of one’s Self possible, perhaps because it resembles a meeting with a different Other in daytime reality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0533316412440088">Friedman 2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0533316412440088">2007</xref>).</p>
<p>Not surprisingly, in dreaming, two of our central, personal and interpersonal processing mechanisms, splitting and projecting, are used to distance ourselves from the bad and ugly, both in ourselves and in those close to us. These are the dreamers’ coping strategies with excessively threatening and exciting emotions: by separating ego-syntonic (‘me’) from the dystonic (‘not-me’) contents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0533316412440088">Fairbairn, 1963</xref>). As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0533316412440088">Freud (1900)</xref> explains, dreams both repress and express the ‘not-me’. Thus, the ‘dream-space’, similarly to processes in the transitional group-space, stages complex and hidden encounters with projected and separated-off aspects of one’s Self. Investigating hidden meetings can be an important therapeutic endeavour, which may be additionally fascinating by using the similarity between the group and the dream as a meeting space with the ‘not-me’.</p>
<p>The dreaming/dreamtelling paradigm also teaches us something about the process in which we contain the ‘not-me’. While dreaming provides us with a perspective on how the dreamer’s personal process of elaboration looks<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0533316412440088">3</xref></sup>, dreamtelling transcends the ‘internal’ elaboration by using the interpersonal space in order to continue elaboration. Telling a dream fulfils at least three functions: first, retrieving <italic>information</italic> about the dreamer’s unconscious coping mechanisms and contents; second, helping the audience both digest and use difficult and sometimes destructive emotions that <italic>form</italic> the dreamer’s (or the group’s) psychic structure; finally, sending important interpersonal messages to significant others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0533316412440088">Friedman, 2008</xref>) in order to <italic>transform</italic> the relationships with them. These three functions of dreamtelling: the informative, the formative and the transformative of relationships can be considered as prototype for dialogue with the ‘not me’. Dreams teach us that we must listen and understand, acknowledge and help to articulate through dialogue in meeting the Other. Dreamtelling shows how a relationship can help to contain and elaborate the excessively threatening and exciting material, thereby transforming the relationship. Well-handled dreamtelling facilitates the meeting with the ‘not-me’, whether in Finland, Germany, in Copenhagen or Rome or in a group in Melbourne.</p>

<title>Germans Meet the ‘Me’ and the ‘Not-Me’</title>
<p>During the last decades, millions all over the world have been trying to ‘work-through’ the mega-traumas of World War II. Germans engage in this process by confronting their guilt and shame and by expressing a wish for reparation. But we may learn from dream work that there are insurmountable difficulties to ‘dream’, or to work-through a nightmare by oneself. More often than not, traumas and their consequences are impossible to contain in isolation. In order to elaborate nightmarish emotions and to cope with unbearable feelings, an exchange with external ‘partners’ who have more distanced, elaborated or simply different positions is usually necessary.</p>
<p>This seems equally true for the processing of internal positions in other national conflicts, such as the Israeli/Palestinian one. Hate, guilt, depression, impotence and over-identification are only some of the emotions in which individual limited elaboration has to be complemented by dialogue with others. While we may often feel like eagles, in the face of powerful hate and other emotions, we are actually more like little chicks who need one another’s digestive apparatus to absorb excessively difficult affects.</p>
<p>During a particular seminar in Germany, powerful emotions related to this process were invested in a monologue, which seemed to be a disguised effort to have dialogue with me. ‘Monologue can be understood as a soliloquy; dialogue as the resolution of opposites or the search for intimacy; and discourse as the work of a chorus’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0533316412440088">Schlapobersky, 1993</xref>). A male, German participant, somewhat embarrassed, started to tell me a Jewish joke that had often been told by his father, whom he described as ‘rather anti-Semitic’. Interestingly, he had told me this same joke in a seminar in which we had both participated some years before.</p>
<p>This repetitious joke-telling suggested he felt frustrated that the latent message in the joke had not led to more than his own monologue previously. I also considered this joke-telling a new attempt for an interpersonal elaboration of some emotional difficulty, or what I have called a ‘request for containment’ through dreamtelling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0533316412440088">Friedman 2002b</xref>). It was a brave attempt to re-open a dialogue. With whom did he want this dialogue three years later? Was it with me or with the others in the group? In spite of the group’s embarrassment and discomfort, the process and content of joke-telling, together with the corresponding resonance revealed a whole world of unspoken and hitherto unspeakable emotional relationships between Germans and Jews. It had to be contained in order to dialogue in ‘the group’s presence’.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0533316412440088">
<title>A Joke and the Encounter with the ‘Not-Me’</title>
<p>Again a joke was told about the eternal Jewish ambivalence towards their homeland:
<disp-quote>
<p>Sarah and Moshe are on the ship approaching the Holy Land. Just before the Haifa harbour, Moshe says: ‘look . . . it took us two thousand years to return,’ and Sarah says: ‘two thousand years . . . so why the hurry to get here?’</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The group responded to the joke with silence. It was probably seen as inappropriate for a variety of reasons: telling his anti-Semitic father’s joke added embarrassment to the already awkward situation in which gentile jokes, in the presence of an Israeli, over Jewish ambivalence towards Israel. But on a deeper level, it could be understood that this joke, like all jokes, while being unconsciously understood as an elaboration of difficult situations, tried to contain the uncontainable: a German joking on the Jewish need for the land of their ancestors—a need born out of the threat and the extermination of Jews in Europe—by Germans. Could there be a better example of black humour?</p>
<p>For me there was yet another hidden side to this encounter, though unspoken and maybe even unspeakable: the question of the joker’s and his generation’s identification with their parent’s position. Sarah’s tiny but definitely anti-Israeli or anti-Jewish remark was the punch line. While there must be dozens of similar Jewish jokes, this one, now, pointed to the question of the joker’s relation to the anti-Semitic father, hinting of a prohibited identification with the former Nazi-generation. Was he testing the quality of our relationship, perhaps using Joke (Dream) telling as a mechanism to transform our relationship to one of more ‘allowing’ positions? I concluded that the ability to tell a Jew this kind of a joke was being used paradoxically as the ‘ultimate evidence’ that taboos on anti-Semitic identification had been overcome. There was the possibility now of a ‘new beginning’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0533316412440088">Balint, 1952</xref>), in which a dialogue on equal or open terms could be established.</p>
<p>Can we and should we try to achieve reconciliation, and what is the proper pace of such a difficult endeavour in the German–Jewish dialogue? Personally, I believe that the courage to enter this dialogue between two people who have been through hell is highly important, though extremely difficult. The main reason for this is that the enmity is so extreme that it seems impossible to bridge it. A communicative, constructive encounter between ‘me’ and ‘not-me’, between Germans and Jews, must cope with hostility, resentment and hidden trans-generational identifications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0533316412440088">Volkan, 2009</xref>). The Palestinian/Jewish conflict is minor compared to the Jewish/German one in every dimension.</p>
<p>The emotional movement in the group was ignited by the telling of the joke. It connected both process and content. It reflected the work of a whole day, in which the group unconsciously struggled with the ‘hot’ issue of working through German/Jewish identification and vulnerabilities. Sarah’s remark crowned members’ ambivalent wishes to both detach and connect, disguise and reveal feelings about the cruel past in the manifest content. But in hindsight the group was not yet ready to verbalize their feelings . . . thus the participants’ reaction was silence, isolating the joke-teller, without daring to meet this taboo and enter into an open discourse on the unspeakable.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0533316412440088">
<title>Working through the German Horror</title>
<p>The workshop had started with some of the participants addressing one of the unspoken, but difficult aspects of the German horror: the hardship experienced by children of the German new settlers who fled after World War II to West Germany from Silesia (and other parts). Participants talked about encountering different dialects and their own different dialects, which disclosed their differences from the people in the West, revealing from where they had come, and opened their dark war history. They explained how they felt threatened by an ongoing exclusion. These memories evoked the recollections of older participants. They recalled traumatic bombings and fear in the last years of the war. The atmosphere became heavy, which I understood to be a reflection of the overwhelming weight of unspoken contents. The difficulty seemed to be their fear of talking about their parent’s suffering, from then until the present. For millions of Germans, it had been impossible to grieve over the many family members, friends and soldiers who did not return from the war.</p>
<p>At this point I asked myself if my presence was facilitating this disclosure or making it more difficult. Only later did the full complexity of the unconscious discourse become clear. Meanwhile, a participant offered another glimpse into their combatant fathers’ longing for the solidarity they had felt as soldiers during the war. I sensed this spoke not only to my Jewish side, but to my past as a soldier. References to hardship suffered by their families during the emotionally significant, terrible years after the war seemed to affect the relationship between the German co-conductor and myself. Though I had never told my family’s story, the traumatic quality of some of our earlier experiences seemed to connect us. Sharing the post-War effort to overcome them seemed to further link me with the group. The large subgroup that had grown up in this defeated and guilt-ridden Germany had reacted to it with a ‘visible’ depression, a strong wish for acknowledgment and, again, a hidden request for containment of their traumatic experiences.</p>
<p>In groups all members participate in emotional moments.</p>
<p>I, as the conductor, felt the heaviness too, as did my German co-conductor. We each were deeply moved and felt both needy and privileged that we had each other. A containing quality of our relationship resulted in my remembering dreams, which followed in the night.</p>
<p>An ‘elaborative partner’ that is unconsciously felt as a potential help to work through emotional difficulties usually heightens the probability of remembering dreams and dreamtelling.</p>
<p>After having thought about the dream and discussed it with my co-conductor, we considered sharing it with the group the next morning. It was only after we both had the feeling that we were not sharing the dream as a request for the group’s containment that I told the dream.</p>
<p>The reason is a belief that dreaming’s additional function is the working-through of emotional hardship—that belongs to the whole group. Moreover, dreamtelling may move the audience towards a wished-for dialogue.</p>
<p>So, after the usual morning round, which gathers up the participants’ thoughts, feelings and dreams, I shared my dream with the group:
<disp-quote>
<p>I am going with one of my grandsons and my best friend for a walk in the mountains. It is clear to me in the dream that my friend comes in order to help me to feel better. My grandson looks like a combined version of both of my grandsons. We manage to have a wonderful hike in an Alpine mountain site. Then at least two of the men participating in the group are talking to me not only as a father, but as a Jewish father . . .</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Sharing the dream produced a strong resonance in the group. The latent process behind dreamtelling activated two interpersonal functions. It both reflected a request for containment of insufficiently elaborated emotional difficulties, and a push to change the relationship with the audience (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0533316412440088">Friedman, 2008</xref>). My best friend was ‘invited’ into my dream probably as a defence against Germans and my closeness to them. It felt as though it represented the general difficulty in containing the suffering in the room, and the hidden load of intense emotions invoked in me by the participants’ identification with their German parents. To counter my heaviness I went out and did something basic, like hiking (moving away?), putting distance between myself and the intense efforts to work-through the many difficult issues aroused in the group. However, reflecting our shared local ambivalence, we hiked towards the German/Austrian Alps, the very space that was so traumatic.</p>
<p>Dreamtelling communicates and links between interacting unconscious minds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0533316412440088">Freud, 1900</xref>). The dream’s messages fall on the group’s unconscious spaces like seeds on soil, sprouting eventually into shoots. Analysing resonance and projective identification is a very powerful way to understand the gist of hidden communication. It leads to deeper understanding of the role of containment in relationships, and the complexity of coping with emotional difficulties. Where there are relationships, there is containment and then there will be dreamtelling. Without containment, dreams will not be told and actual sharing of difficult issues will be avoided. A container for hard feelings must be built with awareness and purpose. Containing does not happen by itself.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0533316412440088">
<title>Needing Parents</title>
<p>Then the emotional movement in the group became coloured by absent fathers, physically or emotionally crippled during and after the war. Male war survivors in Germany, often themselves post-traumatic, proved unable to emotionally care for their families. This created a big hole in the souls of their children.</p>
<p>Because early patterns get re-enacted in the here-and-now of the group, we co-conductors occasionally feel strong parental projections onto them. During these moments, the same questions in different forms seem to pop up simultaneously in my own and in the group’s mind. Am I made from the same stuff as their fathers? Am I as feeble and hurt as their fathers, or am I able to keep the participants inside my mind as a ‘good-enough father’? How am I different to their fathers, who were coping with the aftermath of unspeakable traumas?</p>
<p>Many in the group had parented their own parents, especially their fathers. Could my dreamtelling be understood as a re-enactment of their ‘parental-child’ relationship with a containment-needy father or mother?</p>
<p>My past as an Israeli soldier, a kind of a taboo subject in this group, further complicated the situation. No one in Germany had ever actually addressed my military past, but I became confident that in addition to their projections, they sensed and ‘knew’ my personal history. It seems more than possible that through the interaction with me, including their projections, they were coping indirectly with their parent’s and former generation’s aggression and cruelty.</p>
<p>Again, I find that being ‘in the presence’ of a significant ‘Other’, when consciously and unconsciously exposed to emotional childhood memories, contributes indirectly to the elaboration of difficulties and almost untouchable affective contents. In this case it became clearer from the resonance and associations in the group that without indirectly working through the intense affects, it would have been impossible to elaborate ‘stuck’ positions.</p>
<p>In the depths of trauma, there can be no elaboration without the help of a ‘partner’ who is able to promote reciprocal containment. These thoughts result in further questions: Can a former enemy be a partner in a conflict dialogue? Is a successful partnership a matter of maturity? Is it necessary to have suffered intensely or to have failed significantly for interactions to result in better containment and resolution of conflict?</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0533316412440088">
<title>The Context of a Dream—and two Scripts</title>
<p>The next morning another significant dream gave further evidence to the effective containment process that we were engaging in. A female participant, who had already been present in one of the former workshops, told another dream. The context of this dream was her family’s history, which seemed to reflect the essence of German/Jewish history in modern times. This dream was told in the context of the group matrix (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0533316412440088">Foulkes, 1948</xref>), which generated two conflicting scripts that had to be held side by side in order to be contained.</p>
<sec id="section7-0533316412440088">
<title>The German Member’s Script</title>
<p>Her family struggled with guilt and shame about their roles in World War II. Her father was as liberal and anti-Nazi as possible, given the fascist intimidation of those years. But the family moved into an (empty) flat, full of invaluable Jewish books, belonging to the former Jewish inhabitants, who had just been taken by the Gestapo to concentration camps. The father, an orphan, was loyal to his foster Jewish family and through his own liberal stance, tried to save as much Jewish heritage as possible. After World War II her parents divorced. Her mother, who had been openly anti-Semitic, re-married someone who was much more in line with her political views. The father continued his efforts to preserve the Jewish heritage by compiling a vast number of highly valuable Jewish books in his antiquarian. After his death, he donated his entire library to the State of Israel. Selected parts of his donation were accepted and are now part of a special library in his name, established in Tel Aviv.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-0533316412440088">
<title>My Script</title>
<p>Unsurprisingly, my Israeli/Jewish narrative was different to the Jewish neighbours’ fate, which was sealed by the German member’s mother’s possible denunciation. Her father’s acceptance of the decision to move to the neighbouring, abandoned apartment resulted in a rift in the parent’s relationship. Their new apartment was not only bigger; it also hid a real treasure: thousands of very expensive, antique books, most of them in Hebrew. Her father could not bear his feelings of guilt, which were amplified by the fact that he had been brought up by a Jewish family. Looking after the many Jewish books in the appropriated house, his attraction to the heritage of the ‘other’ and the symbolic meaning of his possession only made his increased guilt unbearable. He and his wife ultimately divorced. The Jewish antique library became not only a constant reminder of what had been destroyed by Nazi Germany, but also of what political and emotional splits had done to the family. After the post-war revelations of the atrocities done to the Jews, guilt and shame became central for her father, culminating in a desire to offer reparation. This guilt, and a wish for reparation, split the whole family. In the dreamer’s script her father did whatever he could to counter the destruction of Jewish culture. The context of my script was the family’s conflict and my association to the Biblical saying, ‘Hast thou killed, and also taken possession?’ (Kings I, 21: 19).</p>
<p>In my script, the split between the parents re-enacted itself ‘inter-generationally’, resulting in a deep rift between the dreamer’s sisters. In the end, a certain ‘justice’ was achieved, when many of the precious antique books from the private home were donated to the Israel National Library.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-0533316412440088">
<title>Do the Narratives Meet?</title>
<p>This restorative act seemed to make a meeting of the two scripts possible. In the context of these two unarticulated scripts, the participant’s dream was told to the group:
<disp-quote>
<p>I was standing in the Library where the donation had been given, in Tel Aviv (where she actually had never been). I was holding a nylon bag, which contained a very old edition of one of Nietzsche’s books, which was to be delivered to the Library.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>From the group’s resonance to the dream, it became clear that the dreamer’s effort to work through the different stages of her past could be considered a journey. She had gone from feeling like the little child who witnessed her parent’s rift to the young woman who engaged in the on-going conflict between the siblings. Later, the journey approached a resolution, when the books were moved from a disputed space (in my script, the appropriated house) to a library in Israel, where they would find their true ‘home’.</p>
<p>The scripts had found a place in which to meet. The dreamer ‘chose’ to identify with her father (rather than with her mother). I chose to emphasize the emotional transition from the place of crime to the place of redemption, from the hidden guilt and unconscious splitting, to an open attempt to cope with the conflict. More important than the contents of the dream (Nietzsche, the plastic bag, Tel Aviv, etc.) was the emotional movement achieved through dreamtelling as a further attempt to cope with the splitting projections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0533316412440088">Ogden, 1979</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0533316412440088">Rafaelsen, 1996</xref>). The dream was dreamt for us all, including me.</p>
<p>After World War II, a role-reversal occurred between the former scapegoats, i.e. the Jews, Gypsies, Slavic people, etc., and the Germans. The latter, had been found guilty and became demonized, victims of ‘the big revenge’.</p>
<p>This process of rejection, or at the very least exclusion, continues until the present: children of the Nazis have the difficult task of working through the guilt and shame of their parent’s generation. To again quote the Biblical saying I cited at the outset of this article, ‘The fathers have eaten a sour grape, and the children’s teeth are set on edge’ (Jeremiah, 31, 28).</p>
<p>My script met the German script, and had to cope with a myriad of identifications. As the seminar progressed, the fact that Nietzsche’s book was chosen to be brought to Israel, again, clearly signified hidden identification issues with the parents.</p>
<p>It exemplifies transgenerational transmission of trauma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0533316412440088">Volkan, 2009</xref>) and teaches us that a generation of perpetrators may not only pass on a split of guilt and shame to their own children but also engender deep, often hidden, identification.</p>
<p>Containing a former generation’s deeds and dealing with shame and the impossibility of identifying with parents are painful processes, replete with narcissistic injury. It has robbed Germans of a more or less coherent identity (Mitscherlich, 1964). Choosing to bring Nietzsche’s books ‘in a plastic bag’ may have several meanings. One of them, I thought, was to express ambivalence towards the Jewishness her father had advocated. On the other hand, the cheap plastic bag devaluated the books. Nonetheless, the use of the bag to return the books to their natural home reflected her identification with her father’s position.</p>
<p>But why dreaming of Nietzsche’s books and not an old Talmud or Bible? Why produce a dream with a philosopher who was partly adopted by World War II Nazi Germany? Here again, our scripts diverge. But, at this point, no one addressed the obvious ramifications, which could have become part of the dialogue. No one was ready to think the unthinkable. In fact both the dreamer and me responded with great hurt to the gap between scripts. Nonetheless, we started a dialogue, which facilitated a discussion of these charged issues.</p>
<p>I would like to add two last points about guilt and working through transgenerational traumas. Whenever there is a blurring of lines between feeling guilty and actually being guilty, denial and avoidance step in as a way to avoid feeling guilty. This is probably one of the most difficult aspects of depression. ‘Autochthonic’ identifications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0533316412440088">Grotstein, 1997</xref>) appear as feelings of guilt about the suffering of someone close to the dreamer. In the group they probably are the legacy of introjective identification with the guilt of the prior generation, which may be an extremely intense process. Meetings between Germans and Jews are often infused with the hope of getting absolution and exemption for the ‘guilty’ party.</p>
<p>Because of my own family history I often think about another specific aspect of the process of working-through: The parents of the present generation of Germans not only wished to exterminate some Jews (or other nationalities and ‘races’), committing some of the worst crimes possible, but actually wanted to exterminate entire peoples. My mother, in 1942 a German Jewish 18-year old youngster facing great danger, tried to flee Nazi Germany to South America through Spain. She kept appearing in my thoughts in this session. Every effort she made to embark was deterred by Gestapo officers, who tried to stop each escaping Jew and send them to extermination. Exclusion of Jews and other ‘inferior’ minorities was not enough. Their goal was extermination and annihilation, like the admonition to annihilate a whole people, who had betrayed the Israelites in the desert: ‘Remember what Amalek did to you . . .’ (Deuteronomy 25: 17–19). How can such a position be worked through?</p>
<p>In this regard I sometimes feel my mere personal presence means for the German participants that ‘We’ (our Nazi forefathers) did not succeed in carrying out the terrible plan. Thus, in spite of the guilt my presence arouses, it also relieves some of the guilt. It transforms ‘being guilty’ to ‘feeling guilty’, which may be less confusing and less destructive. Meeting me seems to serve as unconscious proof that the perpetrators had not destroyed everything: an emotional conclusion that they may be incapable of arriving at alone.</p>
<p>This is connected to the difference between elaborating an emotional difficulty from a certain relational distance, or in meeting the difficulties more directly. I think of it as similar to the workings of projection as opposed to projective identification. While projection does not actually touch the object of hate or disdain, close individuals or groups can truly be transformed and reciprocally influenced by projective identification. The split-off shame and guilt of parents shape the unconscious of their children through projective identification. It may be impossible to contain the feelings of the children without a suitable elaborative partnership with a third party (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0533316412440088">Friedman 2002a</xref>). The journey towards dealing with the uncontainable, from denial and repression, to recognition and ultimately to transformation into what is possible is exemplified in the dream’s final resolution, the scene of the plastic bag being brought to Tel Aviv. There has been a trans-personal meeting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0533316412440088">Foulkes, 1948</xref>), an inter-subjective encounter, in which the German dreamteller has met an Israeli dreamer who, ironically, is the group member that may be best able to contain her feelings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0533316412440088">Grotstein, 1979</xref>).</p>
<p>At this point in the group’s process a male participant shares a memory, stimulating many associations. In his divided family, his uncle, who plays a rather central role in the family is ‘preaching’ to him about something that should be done. Typical for the uncle’s generation a double-standard perspective splits this relative into two opposing parts. On one level, he is a very righteous person, teaching others and preaching self-improvement.</p>
<p>However, during the war he was a high officer. Where? The group’s participant hesitates as to whether it was in the Wehrmacht, or . . . ? The uncle never talked about what he did during the war, thus imbibing his life’s narrative with a strong ingredient of suspicion.</p>
<p>The obsessive wish to know in spite of fearing both the reality and the denial may become almost like a perversion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0533316412440088">McDougall, 1995</xref>). It is the power of the group and the encounter with the Other, this time the Jewish Israeli, that makes it possible to transform the ‘unthought known’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0533316412440088">Bollas, 1987</xref>) into conscious mental pain which can be elaborated.</p>
<p>As the member’s scripts start to meet, a shift is felt in the workshop’s matrix. The pauses are shorter now, and it seems easier to bear the opened traumas when experiences are shared. We yearn for moments like this, in which the process allows elaborating partners to succeed in processing difficulties—the same difficulties which were formerly processed in isolation, and unsatisfactorily.</p>

<title>Counter-transference, and Meeting My ‘Other’</title>
<p>My feelings at the end of the second day were a combination of heaviness and a great closeness to the group. The issue of the need to survive versus the desire to annihilate ‘all ones enemies’ emerged again. My awareness of these associations and identifications helped me to understand the unconscious inner state of a certain part of the group. We had all met in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0533316412440088">Bion’s O (1970)</xref>, the ultimate truth. In the cross point of violent annihilation associations I had encountered the ‘Other in ourselves’. The encounter between guilt-ridden children of the perpetrators of an inconceivable crime and a representative of the victims of these crimes brought me to an inner encounter between our/my own violence and their sufferings. Touching these emotions in the presence of the Other, helped indirectly to establish the possibility of a mutual, elaborative partnership (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0533316412440088">Bion’s, 1962</xref>), the implications of which went further than the seminar’s original intent, the working on professional issues.</p>
<p>The losses suffered by Germans during World War II, the bombing of cities and their post-war culpability, and the ensuing guilt made it nearly impossible for me to be aware of my own grievance, hurt and humiliation, let alone express these feelings. The shadow of our parent’s feelings of hatred towards the Nazis had been re-cast towards the present Germany. My insight at this point was that perhaps only a normal and creative relationship, in which both sides could dialogue about our emotional positions, and be inter-culturally engaged, could promote viable and proper containment.</p>
<p>In contrast to Nazi perpetrators, who seem shameless and devoid of any conscience, many of their children have shown repentance and attempt to work-through their guilt. But, more than half a century after the war, this seems not to have achieved sufficient acknowledgement nor absolution.</p>
<p>My encounter with this German group helped me to understand the value of replacing revenge with dialogue: guilt, phobia and conflicting transgenerational scripts, which Germans have inherited together their parents’ split. This dialogue makes it possible to meet the former victims’ children who also inherited their parents’ hate, and are their representatives in ‘the big revenge’. This is a possibility in many areas in the world, such as South Africa, Ireland, Israel/Palestine, Turkey and Kurds—places where reconciliation is an existential concept.</p>

<sec id="section11-0533316412440088">
<title>Relationship Disorders and Scapegoating</title>
<p>The essence of the ‘scapegoating position’ is that rejection occurs because of a failure to contain aggression in the group. There is also strong pressure towards social compliance and an overwhelming need to belong. Projections may be of secondary importance to a marked drop in feelings of guilt and shame. Over-identification with one’s community becomes stronger than a humane moral code and compassionate behaviour. Scapegoating is a position in which a group member is consciously or unconsciously wished to ‘disappear’. An unempathetic position may occur among the most normal children and adults, when they find themselves in conditions of excessive violence and wish to eliminate the ‘deservingly hated’ object emerge.</p>
<p>This particular kind of mutual relationship can be considered pathological when the scapegoat reacts to rejection with an intense need for inclusion. He is willing to do nearly anything to avoid being banned. This behaviour only reinforces the group’s determination to boycott. Aggression of this sort seems to be one of the most interesting of social paradoxes. When this kind of relationship develops into a fixed pattern, it can be defined as ‘rejection disorder’, one of four relation disorders which conceptualize pathology as interpersonal rather than individual (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0533316412440088">Friedman, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>I must admit that rejection, that is, an aggressive movement to eject a member from the group’s space, was a real possibility in the group. The role-reversal between former Jewish scapegoats and the contemporary German, had suddenly become an issue almost forcing one German member out as a scapegoat.</p>
<p>Can a society raised under destructive scapegoating positions feel secure when some of its significant members are excluded? In the cases I present here, working with Germans indirectly facilitates the juxtaposition of conflicting scripts, i.e. meeting the ‘not me’ without rejecting. This is a painful process. But, while at the outset the group experience this encounter as difficult and oppressive, it ultimately becomes (mutually) fruitful.</p>
<p>Inability to mourn and work through one’s own past depletes psychic resources and may hinder growth. Learning alone from experience is probably more difficult than being able to go through the process of working ‘through the Other’. ‘Re-dreaming’ their trauma, Germans might become more comfortable with their potential new identities. While elaborating the unthinkable, they can come to terms with significant parts of their shame, guilt and suffering.</p>
<p>In the dream cited above, bringing books of the dreamteller’s father to the Tel Aviv library seems to have been a decisive step in re-owning the past through a narrative that puts together an authentic identification. The dreamer insisted on the joining of two conflicting scripts. Acknowledging the differences of the scripts in the group was a first step towards the elaboration of basic feelings formerly denied, and therefore not properly coped with. The (good) ‘me’ and the (bad) ‘not-me’ had never joined together. Similarly, more than one of the Germans said that they had never dared to get close to a Jew. Another member’s feelings of guilt made it impossible for her to visit Israel. One participant told the group that only after her daughter had visited Israel could she visit the country, which had always so attracted and intrigued her. The real-live presence of an Israeli/Jewish conductor may have helped to preserve an inner ‘good father’ or ‘good mother’. The contact with me, as representing survived aspects of the scapegoated object helped put guilt into perspective.</p>
<p>Indirect elaboration of unconsciously communicated, trans-generational trauma seems to be possible and can alleviate unspoken and unspeakable suffering. In the end, we may one day meet in ‘Jerusalem’.</p>

<p>The process of dreaming is not necessarily an exclusively personal one. In spite of being considered autonomic, very often dreamers dream some difficult content in order to help a close person to work through his difficulties. Thus, dreaming is also about introjecting difficult emotional contents and only later using projective mechanisms.</p>
