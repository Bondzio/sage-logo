<abstract>
<p>In this article we investigate the effects of parental, individual and partner characteristics on the starting of a sport. Employing event history models we analyze 72,491 person-years of 2276 individuals from the Family Survey Dutch Population 1998 and 2003. Our results show that growing up in a family in which sport is common increases the likelihood of starting a sport. We further conclude that parents from the higher social classes more often stimulate their children to start participating in a high status sport. Our results also indicate that a respondent’s educational attainment is positively related to enrollment in sports. The importance of a spouse is particularly demonstrated, as a sport-playing partner expresses a positive influence on a respondent’s sport participation. Moreover, in starting a sport it is more favorable not having a partner, even than having a non-sporting spouse.</p>

<title>1. Introduction</title>
<p>Sport holds a significant role in society, and it fulfils several functions. Because of the impact of sport in society, today many studies concentrate on the <italic>consequences</italic> of sports for individuals and society (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1012690211432212">Coalter, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1012690211432212">Putnam, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1012690211432212">Vermeulen and Verweel, 2009</xref>). Various functions of sport have been recognized, ranging from health improvement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1012690211432212">Bailey, 2006</xref>), the growth of social networks and social capital (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1012690211432212">Putnam, 1995</xref>), and its large economic impact. Given the mostly advantageous consequences attached to sport it seems extremely important to study what makes people start participating in sport (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1012690211432212">Hoekman et al., 2011</xref>). Although several studies have eloquently demonstrated the interesting and varying significance of sports participation, research on the <italic>determinants</italic> of enrollment in sports up until now is relatively scarce (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1012690211432212">Scheerder et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1012690211432212">van Bottenburg et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1012690211432212">Van Tuyckom and Scheerder, 2010</xref>). To shed more light on the issue of why some people start sport and others do not, we here intend to look closer at the factors that determine the starting of a sport career.</p>
<p>Our study holds several innovative elements. First, we advance upon earlier studies by a theoretical focus on ‘relevant others’ accompanying a person, thereby paying explicit attention to the role of social networks. More specifically, we address the importance of parents and partners in starting a sport. Accordingly, we acknowledge that the decision to enroll in sport activities is not merely an individual act, but that it is influenced by the social surrounding of a person. First, it seems likely that sport participation of children is related to the general (sport) climate in the parental home. Parents, as initial and strongest agents of socialization, will probably have a strong influence on the sport activities of their children (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1012690211432212">Green et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1012690211432212">Roberts and Brodie, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1012690211432212">Scheerder et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1012690211432212">Seefeldt et al., 2002</xref>). Next, a spouse may be considered as a meaningful social actor in the decision to start a leisure activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1012690211432212">Kalmijn and Bernasco, 2001</xref>). Previous research toward such partner effects in sports, however, is rather ambiguous. For instance, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1012690211432212">Kraaykamp (1996)</xref> in the Netherlands found no partner effects for sports participation. Contradictorily, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1012690211432212">Scheerder et al. (2006)</xref> found a strong relationship between sport activities of the spouse, and a respondent’s involvement in sports.</p>
<p>Second, in this study explicit attention will be paid to enrollment in high status sports. Previous research by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1012690211432212">Scheerder et al. (2005)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1012690211432212">Van Tuyckom and Scheerder (2010)</xref> eloquently described that sport participation is related to aspects of status maintenance and status approval. In particular, the work of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1012690211432212">Bourdieu (1991)</xref> highlights that people from higher classes may use their enrollment in highbrow sports to show a certain status position to the outside world. Sport participation then is employed to draw boundaries between people from different social classes. In this article we address the issue of status and sport by an explicit focus on the enrollment in high status sport activities (as compared to general sports). We analyze whether parental and individual socio-economic background aspects elevate a person’s chances of beginning a high status sport.</p>
<p>Third, a life-course approach is executed that provides insight in whether or not factors determining the start of a sport vary over a person’s life. A major drawback of previous research on sports participation is that it mostly is based on cross-sectional data (see for an exception, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1012690211432212">Lunn, 2010</xref>). With this kind of data there is no way to deal with issues of causality. For instance, it cannot be made clear whether a sporting partner stimulates the sport participation of a respondent, or that it is the other way around. An adjacent point is that participation in sport is intrinsically dynamic; one starts and stops with a sport during one’s life. Measuring at one moment in time (as in cross-sectional research) therefore might unjustly draw conclusions on starting a sport, whereas it is only possible to deal with ‘being’ a sportsperson or not. Further, it is obvious that all kinds of personal characteristics, such as partner status, educational level, and occupational position vary over a person’s life course. Research therefore should ideally address this dynamic nature of people’s lives in explaining sports participation (at various ages).</p>
<p>In this article we apply a life-course approach to analyze starting a sport, and to deal with the many different transitions in life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1012690211432212">Lunn, 2010</xref>). We, here, not only focus on individual transitions, but we take the life-course transitions of partners into account as well. Moreover, we distinguish between starting a sport in general, and starting a high status sport. We address the following research question. <italic>To what extent is the decision to start (high status) sport participation affected by parental resources, individual life-course transitions, and life-course transitions of a partner?</italic></p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-1012690211432212">
<title>2. Theoretical background and hypotheses</title>
<p>The theoretical notions we employ to explain the chance of starting a sport largely relate to a person’s life course. Next to individual features, we will explicitly focus on aspects of an individual’s close social network. Potential influences of parental socialization characteristics will be addressed, and also the role of a (possible) partner will be considered.</p>
<sec id="section3-1012690211432212">
<title>2.1. Parental characteristics</title>
<p>Parents may be seen as the most important socializing agents from a person’s social environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1012690211432212">Bandura and Walters, 1963</xref>). Through socialization children acquire the attitudes and behaviors considered desirable or appropriate by their parents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1012690211432212">Miller and Glass, 1989</xref>). It is likely that this process of parental socialization by instruction and imitation also functions for sport participation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1012690211432212">Brown et al., 1989</xref>). In families where parents themselves are active sportsmen more ‘love of sports’ is exhibited, and sport participation will be a family norm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1012690211432212">Green et al., 2005</xref>). Growing up in such a family probably will lead to an internalization of this norm. Earlier research indeed showed a positive relation between parental sports participation and an individual’s sports participation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1012690211432212">Breedveld, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1012690211432212">Lunn, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1012690211432212">Scheerder et al., 2006</xref>). As a result we expect that: <italic>parents who participated in sports increase a person’s chance of starting sport participation</italic>.</p>
<p>Socialization may also be considered as a transfer of (cultural) resources from parents on to their children (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1012690211432212">Bourdieu, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1012690211432212">Kraaykamp and Van Eijck, 2010</xref>). In cultural reproduction theory it is argued that high status parents intend to pass on their status to the next generation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1012690211432212">Bourdieu, 1991</xref>). These parents therefore socialize their children with highbrow cultural assets that are helpful in the higher social strata. This process of status transfer may also be applicable in the field of sports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1012690211432212">Scheerder et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1012690211432212">Stempel, 2005</xref>). People from the higher classes then enroll in sports to draw boundaries between them and people from the lower classes; sport functions as cultural capital. This leads us to expect that: <italic>the higher the parental socio-economic status the higher a person’s chance of starting sport participation</italic>. This transfer of a cultural status might especially be found in the starting of a high status sport. High status sports may be defined as sport activities that hold high esteem or prestige in society, for example, golf, tennis, or cricket, compared to more popular sports like football, swimming, or badminton (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1012690211432212">Scheerder et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1012690211432212">Stempel, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1012690211432212">Van Bottenburg, 2001</xref>). Therefore a more specific hypothesis reads: <italic>a high parental socio-economic status increases a person’s chance of starting participation in a high status sport, compared to starting participation of a general sport</italic>.</p>
<p>When it comes to the transfer of resources or family norms in single-parent families, parental involvement and availability of time might be lower than in a two-parent family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1012690211432212">Sandberg and Hofferth, 2001</xref>). In this respect, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1012690211432212">McLanahan and Sandefur (1994)</xref> demonstrated that obviously one parent has less time and less authority than two parents, who can share responsibilities and cooperate with each other. Weaker parental involvement allocated to children growing up in single-parent families might also affect their sport participation. We hypothesize that: <italic>parents who divorced during a person’s youth decrease the chance of starting sport participation</italic>.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1012690211432212">
<title>2.2. Individual life-course aspects</title>
<p>Several individual determinants may affect either positively or negatively the decision to start a sport (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1012690211432212">Breedveld, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1012690211432212">van Bottenburg et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1012690211432212">Van Tuyckom and Scheerder, 2010</xref>). In our study, all individual resources are measured over a person’s entire life course thereby allowing us to test expectations in a dynamic design.</p>
<p>Abundant availability of time is often mentioned as an important factor in explaining participation in sports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1012690211432212">Breedveld, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1012690211432212">Schor, 1991</xref>). Obviously restrictions of time reduce the opportunities for leisure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1012690211432212">Gershuny, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1012690211432212">Kraaykamp et al., 2009</xref>). The availability of free leisure time is, among other things, determined by circumstances that may vary over the life course. Two important determinants of a person’s leisure time budget are the hours a person spends on employment and study, and the presence of children that need caring at home. First, working and studying requires time, and this means that it likely lowers the chance of starting a sport. We expect that: <italic>more hours spent on education and work decreases a person’s chance of starting sport participation</italic>. Note, however, that although the unemployed have more leisure time, previous research did not show that they are more active (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1012690211432212">Breedveld, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1012690211432212">Glyptis, 1989</xref>). Second, the presence of children, that need love and consideration, can be regarded as an additional restriction for participation in sports. As time for child-minding, caring and household chores may not easily be substituted, it obviously limits a person’s available time for leisure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1012690211432212">Sandberg and Hofferth, 2001</xref>). We thus argue that: <italic>young children at home decrease a person’s chance of starting sport participation</italic>.</p>
<p>Next, sport requires money. The opportunities for sports participation evidently may decline because of a shortage of financial resources that makes sport participation a costly activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1012690211432212">Wilson, 2002</xref>). It is clear that sport costs money, for equipment, fees, socializing and traveling. Subsequently, a lack of money in a household will reduce the opportunities for sport participation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1012690211432212">Breedveld, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1012690211432212">Wilson, 2002</xref>). Socio-economic status is a high-quality time-varying indicator of a household’s financial position in life-course analysis. Our expectation thus reads: <italic>a high socio-economic status increases a person’s chance of starting sport participation</italic>. Next to a pure restrictive effect of low financial opportunities, it might be that people from the higher income groups are more inclined to demonstrate their advanced financial position through participation in highbrow sport (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1012690211432212">Bourdieu, 1991</xref>). In particular, participation in sports that hold high esteem provides them with the opportunity to express a high status, meet people in high status networks, and to distinguish oneself from non-elite groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1012690211432212">Scheerder et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1012690211432212">Stemple, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1012690211432212">Van Tuyckom and Scheerder, 2010</xref>). It therefore is expected that: <italic>a high socio-economic status increases a person’s chance of starting participation in a high status sport compared to starting participation in a general sport</italic>.</p>
<p>Finally, various studies showed that the higher educated participate more often in sports than low educated people (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1012690211432212">Scheerder et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1012690211432212">Wilson, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1012690211432212">Yang et al., 1999</xref>). The higher educated may be characterized by their high cultural competency, their ability to perform multiple tasks and their knowledge of the health promoting effects of leisure activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1012690211432212">Kraaykamp et al., 2009</xref>). Higher-grade professionals therefore have more qualities to evaluate the positive effects of being active in sports. We therefore hypothesize that: <italic>a high educational level increases a person’s chance of starting sport participation</italic>. Next to a general influence of education on starting a sport, educational attainment might also affect participating in high status sports. Social groups are defined and communicated to the outside world through commonly shared norms and practices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1012690211432212">Kraaykamp et al., 2007</xref>). As the higher educated belong to the higher social strata in society it is likely that they will perform high status sports more often. It gives them the opportunity to exemplify their status position and demonstrate their competence in a social surrounding of equals. So, we presume that: <italic>a high educational level increases a person’s chance of starting participation in a high status sport compared to starting participation in a general sport</italic>.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1012690211432212">
<title>2.3. A partner’s life-course features</title>
<p>From a social network perspective it may be expected that relevant others affect a person’s sports behavior. A spouse generally is considered to be the most significant other in one’s social environment. Therefore we focus on partner effects in studying sport participation. In our study, all partner characteristics vary over a person’s life course and thus are included as time-dependent aspects.</p>
<p>So far, most studies that explore sports participation have employed individual characteristics thereby neglecting the social embeddedness of individuals. It may, however, be stated that for many people a spouse is the most central and meaningful person in one’s network (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1012690211432212">Kalmijn and Bernasco, 2001</xref>). For media and cultural participation several studies showed that the effects of partner characteristics are substantial (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1012690211432212">Kraaykamp et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1012690211432212">Upright, 2004</xref>). Also, in sports participation a person’s spouse may be seen as either a restriction or an incentive. A partner may encourage and support doing sport, but may also hinder sport, or make it less attractive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1012690211432212">Brown et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1012690211432212">Seefeldt et al., 2002</xref>). From all partner characteristics a partner’s own sport participation is probably most influential. We therefore expect that: <italic>a partner who participates in sport increases a person’s chance of starting sport participation</italic>.</p>
<p>As was the case with individual restrictions of time, a partner’s time pressure may affect leisure participation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1012690211432212">Kraaykamp et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1012690211432212">Schor, 1991</xref>). For all people in a household, a spouse’s hours spent on employment and work may be considered as a restriction. For instance, a partner who works 60 hours a week implies that household chores and child care obligations have to be fulfilled by others in the family. Undoubtedly, this affects a person’s available time for sports participation, but it also lowers the likelihood to play sport together with his/her partner. It is expected that: <italic>a partner who spends more hours on education and work decreases a person’s chance of starting sport participation</italic>.</p>
<p>Finally, we expect a partner’s educational attainment to affect a person’s sports participation. First, we presume that a highly educated partner will positively influence general sports participation. A partner’s general knowledge on sports and information on the health related effects of being an active sportsman might play a role here. Past research has convincingly demonstrated that spousal education affects leisure participation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1012690211432212">Kalmijn and Bernasco, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1012690211432212">Kraaykamp et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1012690211432212">Upright, 2004</xref>). Our hypothesis states that <italic>a high educated partner increases a person’s chance of starting sport participation</italic>. Second, a culturally competent spouse is likely to introduce a person to elite activities. In doing so, higher educated partners might contribute to their spouses’ socialization in highbrow preferences. Next, a partner’s educational level is thought to represent the social level of a person’s network. As status claims are always established and confirmed through social interaction, participation in a high status sport for people with a highly educated spouse is most likely. Both arguments accentuate the expectation that: <italic>a high educational level of a partner increases a person’s chance of starting participation in a high status sport compared to starting participation in a general sport</italic>.</p>

<title>3. Data and methods</title>
<sec id="section7-1012690211432212">
<title>3.1. Data and research strategy</title>
<p>We test our hypotheses on starting a sport with the Family Surveys of the Dutch Population of 1998 and 2003 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1012690211432212">de Graaf et al., 1998</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1012690211432212">2003</xref>). Both (comparable) datasets refer to respondents that were randomly selected from the Dutch population between 18 and 70 years of age. Primary respondents (2365 individuals) and their partners participated through face-to-face computer-assisted interviews and a written questionnaire. For each respondent in the Family Survey of the Dutch Population 1998/2003 the interviews registered several important aspects of the life course, such as complete educational and occupational careers and complete family records using retrospective questioning. In the Family Survey of the Dutch Population 1998/2003 a person’s complete sport history is also registered (age of start, type of sport and intensity). Such information for a high-quality nationally representative sample is unique and it makes it possible to relate the exact timing of the start of a sport to other relevant characteristics of a person’s life course. The formulation of all questions and the surveys’ format is comparable for the 1998 and 2003 waves. Because both partners are interviewed with exactly the same questionnaires it is possible to examine partner effects in an accurate and careful way. In 1998 the fieldwork resulted in interviews in 1148 households (net response rate of 47.3%) and in 2003 the fieldwork resulted in 1217 successfully completed interviews (net response rate of 52.6%).</p>
<p>To test our expectations we use discrete time models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1012690211432212">Allison, 1984</xref>). With this event history technique we are able to find a better understanding of the effects of several life-course transitions on the starting of a sport. A major advantage of event history analysis is that the timing and occurrence of events is accurately dealt with. We constructed a person-period file in which every record holds information on a person for a particular year, that is, employment, schooling, partner status, children and sports activity. Also, relevant information provided by a respondent’s spouse is included. A person enters the risk set at the age of 12 years. A person is removed from the risk set at the age 65 years (right censoring). We studied: 1) the starting of sport participation (3199 events), and 2) the starting of participation in an elite sport (507 events). A person remains at risk of starting a sport, also when a previous start is observed. So, we allowed respondents to start a second or third sport.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1012690211432212">1</xref></sup> Our risk set consists of all person-year combinations of all respondents: 72,491 person-years with complete information on 2276 respondents. On average a respondent is at risk for 32 years (72,491/2276 = 31.8) indicating a mean age of 43.8 years.</p>

<title>3.2. Measurements</title>
<p>To measure starting a sport career all respondents were asked whether they had ever participated in sports in their lives. Of all respondents 17.2 percent had never participated in sports, 31.4 percent had played sport once, and 51.4 percent had been active in sports in the last 12 months. For each sport a respondent ever performed, the year of starting was asked. In a year in which a respondent started sport participation our dependent variable is 1 (3.199 events) and in all other years, 0. To examine participation in an elite sport, we labeled golf, hockey, skiing/cross-country skiing, tennis, sailing/surfing, fencing and cricket as high status sports (for details, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1012690211432212">Scheerder et al., 2002</xref>). In a year in which a respondent started a high status sport, our dependent variable is 2 (507 events); in years a respondent started a non-high status (general) sport the score is 1, and not starting a sport results in 0.</p>
<p>Event history analysis refers to the risk of an event to occur, and this often is presented as a hazard rate. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1012690211432212">Figure 1</xref> we present hazard rates for the chance of starting a sport in general and for the chance of beginning an elite sport. This counts for all ages between 12 and 65 years of age regardless of any previous start. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1012690211432212">Figure 1</xref> indicates that younger people have a higher likelihood of starting a sport; at age 12 some 11.4 percent of all respondents started a sport and at age 18 this declined to 4.6 percent. Between the ages of 18 and 40 years this percentage fluctuates around 4.5 percent. After the age of 40 it decreases towards 2.0 percent. For starting a high status sport a more or less identical pattern is found, albeit with lower percentages.</p>

<p>Information on <italic>parental sports participation</italic> was only available for the 1998 survey and it concerns parental sport participation at a respondent’s age of 15 years.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1012690211432212">2</xref></sup> Four categories are distinguished: 1) parents did not do sport, 2) only father did sport, 3) only mother did sport, and 4) both parents did sport. <italic>Parental socio-economic status</italic> is measured through a recoding of parental occupation at age 15 of the respondent into ISEI-scores ranging from 16 to 90 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1012690211432212">Ganzeboom et al., 1992</xref>). We took the maximum of both parents, which obviously refers to fathers most. <italic>Parental divorce</italic> indicates whether or not parents were divorced in a year (0 = not divorced, 1 = divorced). This variable only is taken into account for person-years between the ages of 12 and 20. Of all respondents, 8.4 percent experienced a parental divorce, and this refers to 1.106 person-year combinations (1.5%).</p>
<p>All respondents’ characteristics vary over the years. An individual’s <italic>hours spent on work and/or study</italic> is measured with (0) non-working, referring to less than 12 hours per week, (1) part-time, referring to 12 till 35 hours per week, and (2) full-time, referring to more than 35 hours of work or study per week. We also constructed the dynamic variable <italic>number of children living at home</italic> (under the age of 18 years) signifying the additional time pressures of family obligations. A variable <italic>residential move</italic> was constructed that indicated whether in a year a respondent has moved to another city or village (0/1). We also coded the next year as 1, because a residential move might be effective for more than a year. The FSDP holds no dynamic information on the incomes of both respondents and their partners. <italic>Socio-economic status</italic>, however, may be considered as an appropriate indication of a person’s financial position (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1012690211432212">Ganzeboom et al., 1992</xref>). The maxim of ISEI-scores of both the respondent and his/her partner in a person-year is used as an indication of a household financial situation ranging from 16 to 90. <italic>Educational attainment</italic> is coded per person-year into four categories: 1) primary education, 2) lower secondary education, 3) higher secondary education and 4) tertiary education. In years a person was not enrolled in school the highest level of a person’s completed education is assigned.</p>
<p>In the FSDP data there are 1772 respondents (78%) with a <italic>partner</italic> at the moment of the interview. Information on this partner is included in the person period file as from the year a respondent reports to have had a relationship (39,457 person-year combinations). In each year a person reported to have no partner, this respondent scores 0 (= no partner) on all partner aspects. A <italic>partner’s sport participation</italic> is categorized in two categories: a 1) partner does not do sport and a 2) partner does sports. A <italic>partner’s hours spent on work and/or study</italic> is measured with 1) non-working, 2) part-time and 3) full-time, resembling the categorization for respondents. Also a <italic>partner’s educational attainment</italic> is measured in the same manner as for respondents.</p>
<p>As controls we measure gender as <italic>female</italic> (1) and male (0), and <italic>age</italic> as a continuous feature ranging from 12 till 65 years of age. We take survey <italic>wave</italic> into account with (0) 1998, and (1) 2003. As we employ person-year information for respondents, it is possible to investigate whether the chance to start a sport increased over time. Therefore, <italic>year of measurement</italic> is measured between 1926 and 2003. This variable indicates whether starting a sport career has become more common in recent years. A description of all variables is displayed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1012690211432212">Table 1</xref>.</p>

Model 1 includes the controls, while in Model 2 parental and individual features are included. In Model 3, we introduce the partner characteristics. Finally, in Model 4 parental sports participation is incorporated. Because information on parental sport participation is only available for the 1998 FSDP-wave, the number of person-year combinations in Model 4 decreases from 72,491 to 34,217.

<p>Model 1 shows no significant differences between men and women in the chance of starting a sport. As expected, older respondents have a much lower chance of starting a sport than young respondents (b = −.047); growing older by 10 years decreases the likelihood of starting a sport by 60 percent. Respondents interviewed in 2003 have a 39 percent smaller chance of beginning a sport compared to respondents interviewed in 1998. This difference is probably due to the fact that in the 2003 wave a maximum of four starts could be mentioned and in 1998 this was six (see also note 1). Finally, year of measurement shows a significant positive effect (b = .032), indicating that starting sport became more popular over the years. Each decade in the previous century the probability of starting a sport increased by 38 percent (exp(10*.032)).</p>
<p>In Model 2 individual and parental effects are included. First, it is shown that experiencing a parental divorce does not influence one’s sport career. However, it is shown that children with parents from the higher social strata more often start a sport (b = .006). Apparently, some financial and social restrictions from a child’s background affect his/her leisure behavior. Second, of the time-varying individual features, time restrictions and educational attainment seem particularly relevant. Our results clearly show that the odds of starting participation in sport increase with education. For instance, the tertiary educated have a 48 percent higher probability of starting a sport compared to the primary educated. It is remarkable that a substantial cleavage is observed between those with primary and lower secondary education and those with higher secondary and tertiary degrees. When controlled for education, there are no additional remaining effects of a household’s socio-economic status. We do find considerable effects of the time devoted to work and study. Compared to part-time workers, full-time workers are much less eager to start a sport (b = −.163). As was indicated in previous research, our results confirmed that non-working people have a much lower likelihood of starting a sport (b = −.664). Whether this relates to actual financial restrictions, or to a more general feeling of apathy, remains to be seen. Our analyses display that family obligations do not restrict a person’s participation in sport, as we find no significant effect of the number of children in a household.</p>
<p>Model 3 includes partner characteristics. Having a partner seems to seriously reduce the chance of starting a sport, by 64 percent (b = .493). For people with a partner, a partner who does sport certainly enhances the probability of starting a sport (b = .618). Surprisingly, both being single and having a sport-loving partner are equally important in explaining participation in sport. Having a non-sport-playing partner is most unfavorable. With regard to a partner’s hours spent on work and study, it is found that only a non-working partner is unfavorable for the starting of a sport. Having a non-working partner reduces the probability of starting a sport by 26 percent (b = −.232). Surprisingly, a partner’s educational level is most important in explaining sports participation. In particular, a primary educated partner seriously lowers the likelihood of starting a sport. Moving to another city is only significant in Model 3. Residential mobility slightly increases the chance of starting sport participation (b = .095).</p>
<p>Additional analyses that include parental sport participation in a respondent’s youth are presented in Model 4. All other effects are hardly influenced by this inclusion, which underscores the robustness of our models, and the independency of the parental sport participation effects. Model 4 clearly displays intergenerational transmission of sport preferences. Having had a sporting parent raises the probability of starting a sport by around 35 percent.</p>

<title>4.2. Starting a high status sport</title>
<p>A multinomial regression analysis has been performed to explain starting sports’ participation in a high status sport. We compare starting a high status sport with starting a general sport (reference) and with not starting a sport at all, in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1012690211432212">Table 3</xref>. We include all aspects as in Model 4 of <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1012690211432212">Table 2</xref>, which means that we restrict the analyses to the 1998 survey only. Analyses without the parental sports participation aspects (including the 2003 wave) did not lead to substantially different results. The effects in the third column of <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1012690211432212">Table 3</xref>, referring to the contrast starting a general sport versus not starting a sport, closely resemble the effects of Model 4 in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1012690211432212">Table 2</xref>. We therefore focused on the contrast of high status versus general sports participation in the discussion of results.</p>

<p>In <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1012690211432212">Table 3</xref> some remarkable results appeared. First, it seems that older people prefer to start high status sports more than younger people (b = .022). Every 10 years of age increases the likelihood by 25 percent of starting a high status sport judged against starting a general sport. It further shows that over the years the probability of starting a high status sport (compared to a general sport) decreased. Whether this indicates a growing democratization of high status sports, however, is an issue for future research.</p>
<p>Parents seem rather influential when it comes to starting a highbrow sport. This might be explained by the fact that in adolescence parents, to a large extent, decide on which sport children enroll in. In particular, fathers who take part in sport do affect the chance of starting a high status sport – the likelihood is enhanced by 40 percent (b = .338). As might be expected, parental socio-economic status is of importance in explaining starting a high status sport (b = .018). People from high status families have a higher probability of starting a highbrow sport compared to starting a general sport. None of the other effects are significant, which obviously is partly due to power problems (only 507 events). The effects are, however, in the expected direction. People enrolled in higher education, working full-time and with a sporting partner have higher odds of starting a high status sport.</p>

<title>5. Conclusion and discussion</title>
<p>In this article we analyzed the effects of individual, parental and partner characteristics on the starting of a sport career. We not only studied sports participation in general, but also distinguished between enrollment in high status sports and general sports. Unique to our design is that we used nationally representative retrospective information on a respondent’s sport, employment and working career, and also on the subsequent careers of his/her partner.</p>
<p>Our analyses give rise to three main conclusions. First, we conclude that parents play a meaningful role in the decision to start a sport. Parents who were active sportsmen or women themselves obviously stimulate their children in their sport career. Moreover, through our life-course approach we demonstrated that this parental example is not only effective in one’s childhood but over a person’s whole life. Intergenerational transmission of sport preferences is life-long. It is further confirmed that the socio-economic status of the parental home enhances the chance of starting a sport. This effect, however, is most profound when it comes to starting a high status sport. Noticeably, parents from the higher social strata stimulate their children to enroll in highbrow sport activities. Whether this socialization is effective in terms of the construction of high status friendship networks or in terms of the showing-off of a high social status position might be interesting topics for future research.</p>
<p>Second, our results indicate that of the individual features, mainly education and time pressure are of importance. The higher educated more often start a sport career, and also are more involved in high status sports. This could be because of more knowledge on lifestyle behaviors directed at health and personal development, but it also could be related to the status associated with healthy leisure habits. Individual time pressure seems important too. In particular, individuals who work or go to school part-time express a higher likelihood of starting a sport. A puzzling result in this respect is the lower probability of the non-employed of starting participation in sport. As our results account for possible effects of age, education and parental selection, future studies might focus on the exact reasons why the non-employed refrain from becoming active in sports.</p>
<p>Third, our results demonstrated unmistakably that it is important to study partner effects when looking at sports participation. We found large positive influences of a partner on the decision to start a sport, when he or she is active in sports. This implies that a non-participating partner works out negatively. Next to one’s own educational attainment, also a partner’s educational level affects the decision to start a sport; people with a higher educated spouse more often begin a sport career. Most importantly, this study confirms that a ‘significant other’ is highly relevant in the decision to take part in a leisure activity such as sports participation.</p>
<p>Certainly our study has some drawbacks. First, the FSDP-surveys do not contain dynamic information on parental sport participation and on parental occupational status. The absence of dynamic parent information, however, only is expected to result in an underestimation of parental influences, implying that parents might be even more important than shown in this study. Second, in our study on the starting of a high status sport is an omission that we did not use information on the content (type of sport) of parental sport behaviors. This could have made it possible to look at direct intergenerational transmission of sport tastes. Third, we lack information on a person’s health situation. Clearly, sports participation may be limited because of physical restrictions, chronic illnesses or sports injuries. We were not able to include such information, but logically future studies may want to investigate this aspect more thoroughly.</p>
<p>Our study enhances knowledge on the mechanisms of why people start participating in sports. Because we applied a life course approach we were able to examine how certain life events are important with regard to enrollment in sport participation. Most important is that significant others, parents and partners play a decisive role in this decision. Therefore, governmental policies directed at a stimulation of sports participation might want to take notice of this, and be aware that starting sport is a decision taken in accordance with other family members.</p>

<p>Respondents were not allowed to report on an unlimited number of sports. The maximum was six in 1998 and four in 2003. This implies that there is no risk of starting a new sport at this maximum.</p>

<fn fn-type="other" id="fn2-1012690211432212">
<label>2.</label>
<p>It is therefore only possible for the 1998 data to examine the influences of parental sport participation.</p>
