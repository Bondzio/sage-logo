<abstract>
<p>This article introduces a perspective on the health of women with low levels of education in terms of organisation of their everyday life. The aim is to demonstrate the ways in which the women’s concept of health is contingent on the conditions encountered in everyday life. A qualitative study based on interviews with the women forms the basis for the discussion. The analysis shows that the women find it difficult to adopt the official discourse on health and its foundation in a biomedical tradition. The article argues that it is necessary to move away from the educational approach focusing on risk and lifestyle with the goal of regulating individual behaviour. Instead, an approach is suggested which can provide the women with the opportunity to gain control of the everyday health determinants which are normally beyond their immediate reach. This is based on the argument that it is necessary to work with a health promotion and education strategy capable of operating within the various interactive patterns between ‘environment’ and ‘individual’ which form the foundation for health.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Social inequality in health is related to individuals’ position in the social hierarchy: a lower position implies worse health (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1757975913486681">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1757975913486681">2</xref>). It is inequality in the social determinants of health that is responsible for the social inequality in health that is found within and between the European countries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1757975913486681">1</xref>). The social determinants of health include level of education, working conditions, position in status hierarchies at the workplace, levels and distribution of income, residential area and housing environment, and social background (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1757975913486681">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1757975913486681"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1757975913486681"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1757975913486681">4</xref>). A low socioeconomic position is also linked to poor health behaviour (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1757975913486681">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1757975913486681"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1757975913486681"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1757975913486681">8</xref>). But, as stated by the World Health Organization (WHO) some 20 years ago in the Ottawa Charter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1757975913486681">9</xref>), health promotion goes far beyond an individual healthy lifestyle; it is also necessary to address the social determinants of health.</p>
<p>On this background, and building on previous findings of, for example, Balshem (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1757975913486681">10</xref>), pointing to the importance of understanding everyday belief systems of health among working-class residents when working with health promotion, this article discusses the relevance of employing theories of everyday life as a frame of reference when attempting to understand health concepts of certain target groups and the implications for health promotion that is sensitive to life as it is lived. The basis for the discussion is a study of everyday lives and health perspectives of women with a low level of education who are employed in unskilled jobs. The aim of the study is to illuminate the possibilities for health promotion interventions that take these women’s voices, as well as their living conditions, seriously into account. Health is understood in the article as the competence to act to change determinants of health in everyday life in terms of social, political and psychological dimensions.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-1757975913486681">
<title>Theoretical framework</title>
<p>Kickbusch (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1757975913486681">11</xref>) among others has underlined that most decisions concerning health are made in social contexts within everyday life environments. Therefore, in order to promote health, a connection needs to be made between health and life as it is lived in its entirety. Researching everyday life is a matter of making explicit regularities and conditions of life and different ways of dealing with them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1757975913486681">12</xref>).</p>
<p>This view emanates from the theory of everyday life developed by the social phenomenologist Alfred Schutz (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1757975913486681">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1757975913486681">14</xref>). Schutz was interested in how general principles are established within the sphere of everyday life that influence the ways in which individuals find their bearings within the world. According to Schutz, everyday life is a ‘natural position’, which provides the individual with a reference system for interpreting experience. Individuals interpret events by employing their previous experience – what Schutz refers to as the <italic>stock of knowledge at hand</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1757975913486681">14</xref>).</p>
<p>As a rule, in Schutz’s theory of everyday life, all facts are viewed as realities that have been selected by the individual’s particular conscious activities. In this sense, as Schutz puts it, ‘strictly speaking, no such thing exists as pure and simple facts’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1757975913486681">14</xref>). This view is shared by Berger and Luckmann (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1757975913486681">15</xref>), who point out that society presents itself subjectively to individuals on the basis of the reality within which they happen to find themselves. Schutz describes how individuals are first and foremost interested in the aspects of the everyday life-world that are within their reach, that is, the phenomena that they know from experience they can influence. Schutz calls this space available to the individual ‘the manipulatory sphere’ or ‘the work-world’, which the individuals experience as their core reality or as ‘the world within reach’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1757975913486681">14</xref>).</p>
<p>Within the framework of this theoretical perspective, the article will discuss what constitutes knowledge about health and what is real in the women’s day-to-day, non-theorised everyday lives. This theoretical standpoint emphasises that our individual knowledge of the world stems from our particular perspective and from our experiences of the world. As such, health only exists in relation to a subject who acknowledges its existence, and it can thereby assume vastly different forms and expressions, entirely dependent on the particular subject at the centre of any interpretation of a concept of health. Findings and discussions will also draw on theoretical literature dealing with blue-collar workers and health in relation to the worksite as findings show how the workplace setting is crucial in relation to understanding how the health of the women can be improved.</p>

<sec id="section3-1757975913486681" sec-type="methods">
<title>Methodological approach</title>
<p>The research design is founded on a qualitative methodology. As suggested by Simpson and Freeman (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1757975913486681">16</xref>), it is necessary to adopt a qualitative approach in order to understand the hidden meaning of health from the perspective of a specific target group. With the task of seeking an understanding of central phenomena and lived experiences within the women’s everyday lives, it is natural to work with qualitative research methods as the underlying values of these methods involve a pursuit of depth and authenticity in the empirical material (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1757975913486681">17</xref>).</p>
<p>McBride and McBride (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1757975913486681">18</xref>) emphasise that it is women’s <italic>lived</italic> experiences that can serve as the basis for health initiatives that can improve their health. It is widely accepted that the in-depth qualitative interview is a method well-suited to collecting people’s experiences with various phenomena within their everyday lives (17,19,20). Van Manen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1757975913486681">20</xref>) suggests that the point of a phenomenological study is to gain insight into, or ‘borrow’, other people’s experiences. The ambition with the study has been to understand how health as a phenomenon figures in their everyday lives, and how health manifests itself as <italic>‘</italic>it is’ and with the ‘meaning’ it holds for the women in their own perspective.</p>
<p>The data generation method was in-depth semi-structured individual interviews. The questions were focused on biographical data, family background, everyday life as it is lived by the women (family life/work/leisure time), narratives of health and quality of life, and actions related to health and quality of life (Table 1). During the interviews it was important to listen to the rationales of choice regarding all types of decisions in everyday life. Two rounds of interviews were conducted with seven women living in the areas of Vordingborg and Nykøbing Falster (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1757975913486681">21</xref>). The women were selected through the trade union 3F, which organises blue-collar workers, and of which all the participants in the study are members.</p>
<p>Each of the women was interviewed two or three times. The first interview focused on the ways in which the women live their lives on a day-to-day basis. The second interview aimed to delve deeper into how everyday life impacts the women’s views of health and health-related behaviour. The two main rounds of interviews were conducted as individual face-to-face interviews while a third follow-up interview was conducted by telephone, only if it was determined on the basis of the preliminary analyses that additional data were needed. The face-to-face interviews were conducted in the interviewee’s home and lasted between one and a half and two and half hours. All the interviews were recorded and transcribed in full.</p>

<title>Findings and discussion</title>
<sec id="section5-1757975913486681">
<title>Conceptualisation of health</title>
<p>On a general level, the women share a particular understanding of what health is. When answering the question ‘what is health?’ they reproduce the prevalent official health advice regarding diet, smoking, alcohol and exercise. Nevertheless, by probing deeper into their accounts, it becomes clear that this bio-medical interpretation of health is more or less entirely removed from their lives and reference frames.</p>
<p>The women broaden the narrow official under-standing of health to include categories of meaning that make sense in their everyday lives. As the excerpts from the interviews below demonstrate, they talk about health in terms of: ‘giving my daughter a good tickle’; ‘a varied diet/a non-uniform lifestyle’; ‘being happy in everyday life’; ‘doing something you enjoy’; ‘eating/drinking something you like’ and ‘being challenged in the course of daily life’.</p>
<p>The accounts above suggest that the women share an understanding of health being closely related to ‘the good life’ and a sense of well-being.</p>
<p>Schutz (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1757975913486681">14</xref>) claims that all action is based on available knowledge, which relies on experiences with previous actions resembling those under consideration. Along these lines, several of the women refer to previous experiences when speaking about future actions within the area of health. As the interview excerpts below demonstrate, they, for example, dismiss the idea of quitting smoking with reference to their experience. The account below is illustrative: the interviewee’s experience stems from a friend who stopped both smoking and drinking and became ‘incredibly boring’ to spend time with.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>She (the friend) has quit smoking and drinking. She isn’t as free as she used to be, she has become stiffer. She doesn’t live the good life anymore, if you ask me. She’ll drink a beer or two and then she’ll stop. She worries about her reputation, and that’s up to her. But she’s become a bit duller. Without a few pints, you aren’t as free … she misses out on the sense of togetherness too. (Bridget, 54 years old, factory worker)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>This passage underlines how health is interpreted in relation to an understanding of the quality of life in which social interaction ranks more highly than lifestyle-oriented behaviour. As a result, the women question healthy behaviour such as giving up smoking and alcohol. As one of the other interviewees states:
<disp-quote>
<p>I cut down on these things (cigarettes) once. I think I put on four or five kilos. But what is more unhealthy, I thought – being fat or smoking? (Hannah, 48 years old, cleaner)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In this instance, weight concerns were a decisive factor in Hannah’s decision to begin smoking again. The effort required to stop smoking and the temporary barriers that she experienced during the transition phase, when new habits or preferences had to be incorporated into her lifestyle, were experienced as too great for her to remain tobacco free.</p>
<p>For some of the women, smoking proved to be a way of compensating for a dull and inane work life, as shown in the accounts below:
<disp-quote>
<p>Smoking is my security blanket … a security blanket is one of those … for example, when I head over to work, when I arrive, then it’s a consolation. Then I deserve a ciggie. It’s something to look forward to and helps me carry on working. That’s just the way I feel. (Hannah, 48 years old, cleaner)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The account points to the importance of smoking in everyday life. The cigarettes have the status of an aid in life. Life is experienced as meaningless and overwhelming without the support the cigarettes provide.</p>
<p>Further, the findings show that even when the women would like to quit smoking, the circumstances of their lives do not make it easy. The excerpt below is illustrative of this point:
<disp-quote>
<p>I’m quite a heavy smoker and I’m in a period right now where I smoke twice as much as normal. I think it’s related to all that trouble at work. I’d really like to quit, but I’m the kind of person who … I don’t have the willpower and backbone. I’d like to start a programme to kick the habit, but where am I going to find the time? (Laura, 40 years old, cleaner)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Evidently, the interview accounts demonstrate that health, for these women, is tied to the quality of life and being able to live the good life. In addition, the accounts indicate that even though the women may want to adopt a healthier lifestyle, it is not easy for them to do so because of their life situations and their work conditions. In a study of blue-collar workers and tobacco use, Sorensen <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1757975913486681">22</xref>) show that larger structural forces shape the social context of people’s lives, including an array of social-contextual factors such as lack of social support, living in unsafe neighbourhoods and having unmet needs for food and medical care, all of which have profound negative effects on health.</p>
<p>However, the findings also show that the women make room in their everyday lives for health in the official understanding when confronted with a specific health problem. An external event, such as serious illness, can result in a theme that had previously appeared meaningless and irrelevant gaining significance. The interview excerpt below is illustrative of this point:
<disp-quote>
<p>Of course, if I get diabetes or something then I’ll accept all the good advice there is. If I can get better – sure. But as long as I’m in good health, I want to be able to make my own mind up about how I want to live. (Melanie, 38 years old, factory worker)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The account above shows that a decision to adopt a healthy lifestyle would not be based on a rational choice as long as there are no serious health problems. Health would constitute a governing mechanism in everyday life only if a problem has become manifest.</p>
<p>The dominant subjective experience among the women is that they are already fit and healthy. Except for one, all of the women are of the opinion that they are in good health, and according to their way of thinking, this means that they must be living healthily enough. When the women do not feel that they have any health problems, it becomes difficult to address the issue of healthy living. Lifestyle-oriented health information is at present not even potentially relevant to these women. As yet, there exists no horizon for them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1757975913486681">13</xref>) that would give relevance to such information.</p>
<p>Even in the case of illness, a healthy lifestyle does not easily become a priority. The women share an understanding of disease as something preordained. This is in line with the findings of a study of working-class people who refused to change their lifestyles, claiming that fate would dictate whether or not they would be stricken by disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1757975913486681">10</xref>). Likewise the excerpt below shows how a person may have already been ‘picked out’, so there is no point changing one’s lifestyle:
<disp-quote>
<p>Because what I say is, if you’re supposed to get it, cancer and the like, then you’ll get it, and you can say and do whatever you like – you’ve been picked out right from the beginning, no matter how healthily you’ve lived your life and all that jazz. (Bridget, 54 years old, factory worker)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The women express a disillusionment with health as it is described in the official discourses. One possible explanation for this is that their everyday experiences tell them that people get sick despite a healthy lifestyle. The women seem to have constructed a defence mechanism that enables them to continue going about their (unhealthy) everyday lives unheeded. With a reference to Giddens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1757975913486681">23</xref>), it could be argued that such a mechanism can constitute a protective shell that shields against, or even blocks out, potential incidents that might result in a sense of being overwhelmed if the women were forced to think these things through thoroughly. In other words, the coping mechanism enables the women to put in brackets any events that might otherwise threaten their everyday practices, which are constrained by the difficult living conditions.</p>
<p>Evidently, the women’s practices and generation of meaning concerning health are dominated by everyday discourses in the sense that concrete, explicit knowledge about risks is repressed, or functions only to a lesser extent as a relevant governing mechanism in their everyday lives. Contrary to the expectation based on Giddens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1757975913486681">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1757975913486681">24</xref>) and other sociologists’ suggestion that within modernity, most people trust in science and the abstract systems most of the time, the women in the study voice considerable mistrust towards the hegemony of experts. This mistrust goes hand in hand with the women’s preferences for a ‘good life’ as a governing mechanism within their everyday lives. Together, these two factors form part of the explanation for their rejection of the official bio-medical discourse on health and related lifestyle advice.</p>
<p>The interview excerpt below further exemplifies this point:
<disp-quote>
<p>They [the experts] say that you should eat loads of this. Then they all of a sudden say that it probably isn’t such a good idea after all, there are things in it that can cause cancer. Fair enough, but now you’ve been stuffing yourself full of it for a whole year. I don’t give it the time of day. There’s always someone saying one thing and some other people saying something else. So I do whatever I feel like. (Bridget, 54 years old, factory worker)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>When health guidelines are frequently revised, rephrased or withdrawn, it provides a breeding ground for radical doubt and unease among the women. The women, rightly, question the available knowledge about health as it continuously proves subject to change.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1757975913486681">
<title>Health and everyday life</title>
<p>All the women in the study are wage earners and their lives revolve around socially determined time: clock time. The interviewees are employed in different types of positions and work at different times of the day. Some work in three-shift rotations, some work weekdays 8 a.m. – 4 p.m., while others occasionally work on weekends. For all of them, work forms an integral part of the conditions of their everyday lives, and the norms of simultaneity of wage labour synchronise the various rhythms of the days and the weeks. In everyday life theory, this is described as the ‘fundamental order’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1757975913486681">12</xref>).</p>
<p>The findings show that the women distinguish between being ‘off work’ and being ‘at work’. These two zones of everyday life seem to be clearly segregated. When they go home after work they are off duty and do not spare a thought for their jobs until the next time they clock in.</p>
<p>The following interview account provides an example of how the women regard work and leisure as two separate phenomena:
<disp-quote>
<p>Even if I’m sick and tired of something at work, it doesn’t affect me. When I leave there, they [problems at work] are left on the shelf. (Hannah, 48 years old, cleaner)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The account emphasises not only the segregation of work time and off-work time, but point to a habit of leaving problems behind when they switch between the two spheres.</p>
<p>Wage labour determines the length of the working day in terms of time, but also the quantity of private time. The interviews demonstrate how clock time sets boundaries for the interviewees’ leisure activities. A theme emerges from the interviews concerning the ways in which wage labour limits the women’s opportunities to look after their physical health. This is illustrated in the following example:
<disp-quote>
<p>I would like to do a sport …, but I don’t have the time. My work hours mean that it’s impossible. (Laura, 40 years old, cleaner)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Exercise is an area of health that this woman would like to do something about in her everyday life. During the interviews she recounts how she has worked as a cleaner most of her adult life, which has worn her down physically. She states that she suffers from a bad back and aches and pains in her right arm due to many years spent working with a mop. She assumes that regular exercise and sports activities could help relieve some of this discomfort. Paradoxically, it is her job that is both the cause of her pain and what shapes conditions within her everyday life that prevent her from using her leisure time to maintain a strong and healthy physique.</p>
<p>There are other examples in the accounts that illustrate how working conditions influence the possibilities of taking care of one’s health:
<disp-quote>
<p>I don’t get all the meals I ought to because it’s tricky getting things to add up when you’re working three-shift rotations. I can see it affects my weight in periods where I eat six meals a day. It strengthens your metabolism so you don’t get so hungry that you stuff yourself. (Anna, 40 years old, factory worker)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The above example indicates how external circum-stances shape the conditions within everyday life that hinder the consumption of regular meals, which, in turn, has a negative impact on this woman’s health. This particular interviewee battles to lose weight and knows from experience that it is precisely regular mealtimes that are important for a high metabolism, a prerequisite for weight loss. She concedes, however, that it is impossible to eat regularly with a working life characterised by changing working hours. Another theme concerning health that emerges from the interviews is constraints in everyday life that hamper personal development through participation in evening classes and other cultural arrangements as well as the cultivation of normal social relations with friends and acquaintances, which, in the women’s own perspectives, are all associated with health as a ‘good life’.</p>
<p>The interview extract below exemplifies the ways in which working life contributes to constraints on what can be done in leisure time:
<disp-quote>
<p>I used to get out more, I’d go to the theatre and to a bit of jazz. But now when it gets to Friday and there are jazz concerts in town … yeah well, I haven’t been for three years. I feel burnt out … when I finally get off work, then I want to relax at home. When I browse in those evening class catalogues, there’s loads of interesting things on offer. But I know that when that Wednesday evening comes around, and I know that I won’t get to bed before 10, then I’m tired before I even leave the house. Because I have to get up so early (3:45)… it doesn’t add up. (Hannah, 48 years old, cleaner)</p>

<p>The interview extract underlines how working life as an external structure places internal constraints that heavily influence the conditions of the women’s everyday lives. These constraints have consequences in terms of what activities are possible and within reach in their leisure time. The women would like to practise a sport, eat regular meals, cultivate social relationships, and take advantage of cultural attractions. In their everyday lives, however, their personal experience is that there is no room to pursue these dreams and impulses. This has consequences for the women’s general health and sense of well-being.</p>

<title>Work lives</title>
<p>Several of the women suffer from high levels of psychological stress due to factors such as time constraints, a high work rate, conflicts with colleagues, conflicts with management, and a lack of influence on their own work.</p>
<p>In the interviews, they describe a working life paved with disappointments, being passed over, lack of influence on how the job is organised, and meaninglessness. For some of the interviewed women, just making it to the end of the working day is an everyday battle, and what remains of the day when work is finished has nothing to offer, as all they have to look forward to is an evening meal before hurrying to bed so that they can be vaguely prepared for the gruelling work that awaits them on the following day.</p>
<p>Some of the women manage to find a balance at their workplace between high levels of demands and influence on their own work that can have positive health effects. This is in accordance with Karasek and Theorell’s Demand/Control Model, in which workload defined as high job demands combined with low job influence may be experienced as job strain for the workers. People with high job demands and low job control may have increased risk of mental job strain (fatigue, depression, burn-out symptoms). Jobs with both high demands and high control are stimulating and without the negative psychological health risks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1757975913486681">25</xref>). An example of this is evident in the account below. Challenges are key in this account – there have to be challenges in life for living to be enjoyable.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>I see every day at work as a challenge … even though I’ve been there for nine years, I can still get an assignment that I’ve never had before. I think that’s nice. It’s so varied what we do. When I get a completely new assignment, I scratch my head a bit and then you run around finding out who’s tried doing it before (laughs). And then we help each other. (Melanie, 38 years old, factory worker).</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>This particular woman has high demands at work (she continuously gets new assignments) but she also has high job control and high social support in solving new assignments. This leads to high job satisfaction and a positive feeling of being challenged in her work.</p>
<p>Some of the women regard each day at work as a new and exciting challenge, while others see problems rather than challenges and have the sense of having no influence on their working conditions and the content of their jobs. What is characteristic of this latter group is that they feel stuck in their jobs and are either unwilling or unable to see how negative workplace conditions could be improved. With reference to the Demand/Control Model, the findings of the study indicate that blue-collar work does not per se mean jobs with high demands and low control leading to bad health. A majority of the women participating in this study primarily consider their free time to be the ‘good life’ and many of them consider their working lives to be exhausting both physically and mentally. Their jobs thereby rob them of the energy needed to participate in organised sports and cultural activities or to involve themselves in the social activities they would otherwise like to in their free time.</p>
<p>In relation to health promotion for the women, the study shows that an untapped potential exists in working with the health determinants that are linked to the working life, not least those deter-minants that involve the target group’s psychosocial well-being at the workplace. A number of studies have shown that psychological strains such as fatigue, burnout, anxiety and depression occur when psychological demands are high and the worker’s decision latitude is low (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1757975913486681">26</xref>). In this way the health of the women can be improved by a process at the workplace giving the women increased influence on decisions related to their jobs. Involving employees in workplace decisions is seen as a contribution to good health and is linked to job satisfaction and job control. This is because the participation of employees in changing the determinants of health at the workplace increases the potential of the changes being tailored to the values and needs of the employees (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1757975913486681">26</xref>). Thus, a participatory approach, emphasising the building of democratic control over work, is of importance to health (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1757975913486681">26</xref>).</p>

<title>Conclusions and implications</title>
<p>This article has discussed a research study that explores unskilled women’s understandings of the concept of health in terms of the organisation of everyday life. The findings show that health cannot exclusively be regarded as an active and rational lifestyle choice. The analysis of the women’s everyday lives draws attention to the multi-layered nature of the women’s views on health. In line with Bernstein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1757975913486681">27</xref>), it could be argued that the study demonstrates that health is characterised by horizontal discourses in which everyday experiences of what influences the good life help set the boundaries for what can be considered healthy. What makes sense, or ‘works’ in women’s everyday lives, counts as relevant knowledge and constitutes their health-related action repertoires.</p>
<p>Further, the study shows that the women place health in opposition to the good life. The women reject the officially prescribed conceptions of and advice in relation to health as irreconcilable with the manner in which they wish to live their lives. Health knowledge is an issue relevant for health promotion. Nevertheless, from the women’s perspective, a life that revolves around a healthy lifestyle as defined within the official discourse is not worth the effort. Understanding this precondition for health promotion related to the women, the study shows, that the women at least on the surface are able to reproduce the official health advice and that they as such do recognise the difference between a healthy and an unhealthy lifestyle. In terms of health promotion the study recommends following pathways other than giving health information to the women.</p>
<p>The study suggests that the success of health promotion interventions can be influenced by seriously taking into account the women’s views and addressing health determinants within the women’s everyday lives. The everyday lives of this target group are filled with constraints that prevent them from living the full and satisfying life they desire. Also, these same constraints make it more difficult for them to make choices and implement decisions for a healthier lifestyle.</p>
<p>The study has demonstrated how circumstances and conditions within the women’s everyday lives, including their work conditions, influence their views on health and the extent to which there is even room for health considerations within their lives. The study has also demonstrated that some of the women lack self-confidence when it comes to changing their lifestyles from a health perspective or changing some of the conditions at work that exhaust them and prevent them from adopting a healthier lifestyle. The findings indicate that the conditions of their working lives have a critical influence on the women’s general energy reserves in their everyday lives.</p>
<p>The settings perspective in health promotion operates with a broad and holistic approach where ‘the system’ and ‘the environment’ are considered significant and complex phenomena of vital importance when it comes to health and health-promoting activities. Settings-based health promotion goes beyond the level of the individual and seeks to create conditions within the setting that might enable the members to promote their own health. On this basis, the settings perspective can be considered a theoretical or paradigmatic shift, from considering health in terms of individualised health problems and emphasising risk factors to a view of the system and the environment as complex phenomena of significance to individuals’ health (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1757975913486681">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1757975913486681">29</xref>).</p>
<p>In this sense, the study supports the case for taking a settings approach to health promotion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1757975913486681">28</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1757975913486681"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1757975913486681">30</xref>) and focusing on the workplace – including a strategy aimed at employee participation. In addition, the study points to the need to combine the settings approach with involving the target groups’ own perceptions of a ‘good life’ and ‘good health’, which emerge from the totality of their everyday lives.</p>
<p>In advocating workplace health promotion in relation to blue-collar female workers, it is important to aim for ‘promoting workplace determinants’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1757975913486681">26</xref>) as this framework integrates aspects of organisational changes, the participation of employees and health promotion approaches, rather than solely aiming for workplace health promotion related to healthier habits (smoking, weight control, setting up fitness facilities).</p>
