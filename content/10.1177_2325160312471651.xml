<speaker>Q</speaker>
<p>Why did you decide to become a lifestyle coach, and how does that intersect with your role as a diabetes educator?</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>A</speaker>
<p>I worked in clinical medicine for 19 years as a certified diabetes educator and then switched my focus to prevention. I’m currently the wellness coordinator for the City of Santa Fe and have been in this position for over 4 years. I have always felt that the only way to make an impact, not just in prediabetes, but in diabetes care in general, is with lifestyle programs where more time could be spent with people who knew they needed to work on changing their lifestyles but just needed some help putting those behaviors into practice. It’s easy to prescribe things that people need to do. It’s a lot harder for people to do it. I felt that in clinical practice we’re really not able to provide the support and education that can be provided in a grassroots approach such as the National Diabetes Prevention Program.</p>
<p>When I knew that the New Mexico Diabetes and Prevention Program was addressing this as one of their grassroots programs, I lobbied for them to do this with the City of Santa Fe. City leadership felt that this was of value to our employees and that’s why I decided to become a lifestyle coach.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Q</speaker>
<p>Are you doing the coaching yourself, or do you have a partner or team you work with?</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>A</speaker>
<p>The State of New Mexico has established and designed the Diabetes Prevention Program to have two lifestyle coaches partner up. However, the lead lifestyle coach must be a registered dietitian, certified diabetes educator, or nurse who has a lot of training with diabetes. For my program, I’m the lead person in terms of the program administration, data management, and class planning. My partner brings in the activity and fitness parts of the program.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Q</speaker>
<p>What is your biggest challenge?</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>A</speaker>
<p>I think the biggest challenge is helping people figure out how to build in the practices they learned and to sustain these changes once they complete the program. This is especially important when various life challenges come up. These practices need to be integrated to such a degree that they are just a daily default for these participants.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Q</speaker>
<p>Do you have any issues with retaining your program participants?</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>A</speaker>
<p>In my group, I have had very good attendance. I think part of it is that I am very persistent in following up with people. I essentially set the expectation that if they miss a meeting they must schedule a make-up meeting with me. I will call the participants and work with them until we find a way to do that. I will use more directive language such as, “When are we going to do your make-up this week?” I try to use language that assumes success. I think that sets the stage.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Q</speaker>
<p>How is your program financed?</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>A</speaker>
<p>The Diabetes Prevention and Control Program (DPCP), which is in the New Mexico Department of Health, applied for some of the grants provided through the CDC to pilot these programs and get them started. The fiscal agent is New Mexico State University. DPCP then has interested groups in the state apply. DPCP uses the funding to provide support for pilots to get started and to pay for materials and some of the extra time that people need to provide programs.</p>

<p>“If you’re going to start it, you have to start it with the idea that you are going to sustain the program. The commitment needs to be there.”</p>

<speech>
<speaker>Q</speaker>
<p>What advice do you have for diabetes education programs that are interested in participating in the National Diabetes Prevention Program?</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>A</speaker>
<p>If you’re going to start it, you have to start it with the idea that you are going to sustain the program. The commitment needs to be there. This program requires a lot of support and maintenance. That ongoing support is what will really help people make major lifestyle changes. It is an eye opener to participants when they start tracking their food and activity minutes and start learning how to improve them.</p>
<p>The second thing is that I think you must have one person experienced enough to provide appropriate oversight and who has professional experience in diabetes and prediabetes to provide support in coaching. Many issues come up in these groups and if someone doesn’t have that level of professional training they are not going to know how to respond to it.</p>
<p>Lifestyle coaches have to be extremely patient and persistent with the participants. They are not patients. It is not a clinical program. Major lifestyle changes take time, and persistent and patient coaches can make all the difference in participant success. This is a learning curve that is very difficult. It’s a big change. I am convinced that this is what people need to really lose the weight and minimize their risks of diabetes. ■</p>
