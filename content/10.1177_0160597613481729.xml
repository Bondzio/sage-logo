<p>A Cup of Tea</p>
<p>Nan-in, a Japanese master during the Meiji era (1868–1912), received a university professor who came to inquire about Zen. Nan-in served tea. He poured his visitor's cup full, and then kept on pouring. The professor watched the overflow until he could no longer restrain himself. “It is overfull. No more will go in!"</p>
<p>“Like this cup,” Nan-in said, “you are full of your own opinions and speculations. How can I show you Zen unless you first empty your cup?”</p>

<p>One of the most enjoyable aspects of working as editors of <italic>Humanity and Society</italic> is the range of ideas submitted as well as the receptivity of Association for Humanist Sociology(AHS) members to new ideas in sociology. While many academics, like the university professor who came to Nan-in to inquire about Zen, tend to approach their disciplines with unspoken limits, we have found in those who work with the journal a community of open-minded thinkers interested in and excited about exploring new ideas.</p>
<p>With that, we are delighted to bring to you Richard Eckert and Amy Rowley’s article on “AUDISM: A Theory and Practice of Audiocentric Privilege.” As the authors point out, scholarly articles rarely mention audism privilege based on hearing and speaking. Eckert and Rowley offer a comprehensive examination of the subject for humanist sociologists to consider as we seek to reduce social injustices; expose students to cultures different from their own; develop inclusive curriculum; create intergroup dialogues that discuss audism and bridge not for profit, public, and academic settings; and engage in social action that contributes to reducing audism.</p>
<p>In “Understanding the Transnational Diffusion of Social Movements: An Analysis of the U.S. Solidarity Economy Network and Transition US,” Noha Shawki adds to the social movement literature through raising and exploring such questions as:</p>
<list list-type="simple">
<list-item>
<p>How do social movements in one country or region of the world diffuse to another country or region?</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>How do social movement participants learn about other movements and ideas in faraway countries and mobilize around these same ideas?</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>What are the channels and mechanisms of diffusion?</p>
</list-item>
</list>
<p>In a section we call “Sociology in Action,” Roger Guy provides a unique lens into the workings and failings of advocacy planning in “We Shall Not Be Moved: Hank Williams Village and the Legacy of Advocacy Planning.” By tracing progressive planning as exemplified in Hank Williams Village, a plan to prevent the displacement of low-income southern whites in a Chicago neighborhood in the 1960s, Guy examines the legacy of advocacy planning and the potential for community-based planning today.</p>
<p>Our reviews in this issue also broadly venture into novel territory. Tim Maher reviews Tom Wooten’s <italic>We Shall Not Be Moved: Rebuilding Home in the Wake of Katrina.</italic>
</p>
<p>
<italic>Tom Wooten</italic>, a chronicle of the rebuilding of both home and community in post-Katrina New Orleans. While issues of race and the criminal justice system have long been covered within sociology, David Embrick’s reminds us in his review of<italic> The New Jim Crow</italic> by Michelle Alexander that accessibility of scholarship is essential if we want our work to reach beyond the discipline. <italic>Humanity and Society</italic> multimedia editor Pamela Quiroz provides sociological insight into the new and ever-evolving world of online dating through her review. Looking to the past for new interpretations, Barbarda Fedders reviews Dan Rather’s documentary, <italic>Adopted or Abducted</italic>, which explores the institutional and cultural forces that created high rates of adoption during the “Baby Scoop Era.” The collision of celebrity, body, and narrative is the subject of Rebecca Tiger’s reappraisal of Perez Hilton (not to be confused with Paris Hilton). We end with a thoughtful humanist take on anonymity, crime, and reckoning by Bill Meacham.</p>
<p>
<italic>Humanity and Society</italic> might be a small “cup of tea” compared to other more mainstream sociology journals. Yet, as the authors here demonstrate, we are “steeped” in a commitment to sociology in action. As we enter our last year as editors of <italic>Humanity and Society</italic>, we hope to continue fostering the type of new ideas that will keep humanist scholarship “flowing” in unique ways.</p>
