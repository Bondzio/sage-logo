<abstract>
<p>This article explores the significance of feminism in transnational activism around LGBTQ protest events, namely equality marches and associated festivals in Kraków, Poznań and Warsaw in Poland. The arguments advanced in this article are based on a multi-method qualitative research project focusing on transnational cooperation in the planning and realization of LGBTQ protest events in Poland, conducted in the years 2008–2009. The authors highlight the decisively coalitional nature of the activist networks around LGBTQ politics in some of the locations studied. They argue that feminists are core actors in these ‘networked solidarities’ around the oppression and marginalization of lesbian, gay, bisexual, queer and transgender people both in local and transnational contexts. Solidarity is a concept used by many research participants to account for their political actions and to rationalize intra- and intergroup dynamics shaped by complex webs of differences. The authors draw on postcolonial feminist discussions on the limits and potentialities of politics of solidarity as a ‘politics of location’ to account for tensions which some activists reported regarding their experience of ‘coalition work’. Some of these tensions related to gender politics and gender relations, always articulated in the conjunction of wider webs of power relations.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>In this article we discuss the significance of feminism in transnational activism around recent LGBTQ protest events, namely equality marches and the associated festivals in Kraków, Poznań and Warsaw in Poland. Drawing on qualitative research of transnational activist networks involved in the organization of these events, the article highlights the significance of feminist actors in local and transnational initiatives in LGBTQ politics. Our primary concern is with the ‘transnationalization of solidarities’. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1350506812466610">Dufour et al. (2010</xref>: 3), ‘transnationalization is . . . a process of stretching and contracting the scope of collective action and the result of complex interactions between actors’ strategies and their institutional and movement environments’. We use the term ‘transnational’ rather than ‘global’ since it highlights the significance of the nation-state or national ideologies in the social struggles we studied. We prefer it over ‘international’, since many activists were mobile across national borders and orientated themselves to multiple locations in different states. Transnational activism is usually understood to consist in activist networks, social movements, civil society organizations or individuals operating across national borders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1350506812466610">Tarrow, 2005</xref>). Adopting a transnationalization perspective allows us to go beyond a descriptive documentation to explore the shifting nature of strategy formulation and coalition building in the nexus of specific localities and the transnational sphere. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1350506812466610">Masson (2010</xref>: 37) calls for research into transnational activism which explores the ‘variations in the spatialities of transnational organizing, the multiscalar character of movement action, the twin roles of scale and place in transnational mobilization, and how both scale and place play out in the constitution of transnational framings’. The transnationalization of the LGBTQ protest events in Kraków, Poznań and Warsaw depends on the ‘stretching’ of the scope of collective action. This involves scale shifting, changes in discursive registers and strategy (re)formulations in the attempt to shape ‘transnational network solidarities’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1350506812466610">Gould, 2007</xref>). Political solidarities are concerned with social change and tend to be born out of a commitment to joint struggles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1350506812466610">Scholz, 2007</xref>). They depend on ‘mutuality, accountability, recognition of common interests as the basis for relationships among diverse communities’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1350506812466610">Mohanty, 2003</xref>: 7). We share this understanding of solidarity as intergroup coalition work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1350506812466610">Binnie and Klesse, 2011</xref>). The term LGBTQ signifies a coalitional practice between different collectivities of actors (Lesbian-Gay-Bisexual-Transgender-Queer). The term is controversial because it insinuates a quasi-natural confluence of interests around certain gender and/or sexual subjectivities. Despite some concerns we use it for pragmatic reasons. The LGBT version of the abbreviation has been used in Poland since 1990s. The concept queer is less common (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1350506812466610">Mizielińska, 2011</xref>), but has been claimed as stimulus or identity by many activists in our study. We include it in our generic references to local and transnational politics, but drop it wherever the practice of certain organizations does not warrant its usage. Many feminist groups have supported LGBTQ struggles, even if their constituencies are predominantly or exclusively heterosexual (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1350506812466610">Graff, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1350506812466610">Gruszczyńska, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1350506812466610">O’Dwyer, 2010</xref>). The transnationalization of Polish LGBTQ politics advances the manifestation of complex and multilayered solidarities. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1350506812466610">Alexander and Mohanty (1997)</xref> argue that transnational solidarities are only possible, if activists reflect on postcolonial power relations. Taking our lead from this insight, we consider differential positionalities regarding gender, sexuality, age, class, nationality and geopolitical location (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1350506812466610">Grewal and Kaplan, 1994</xref>). This renders critical (among others) the political, economic and symbolic power relations between a (Western) ‘core’ European Union (EU) and the new member states in Central and Eastern Europe (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1350506812466610">Boatcă et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1350506812466610">Kuus, 2004</xref>). We have to be wary of quasi-evolutionist narratives which characterize sexual politics in Central and Eastern Europe as being backward and lagging behind the standards of equality realized in the West (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1350506812466610">Mizielińska, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1350506812466610">Mizielińska and Kulpa, 2011</xref>). They sustain a representation of the exceptional nature of homophobia in Poland (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1350506812466610">Kulpa, 2009</xref>; cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1350506812466610">Haritaworn, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1350506812466610">Puar, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>In the first section of the article we describe our methodology. We then sketch the process of transnationalization of LGBTQ politics in Poland in the light of EU accession and an increasing polarization of Polish society around LGBT visibility. The following section provides a place-sensitive discussion of the transnationalization of coalition work around LGBTQ politics in the face of the controversies around the Equality marches and parades since 2004. We then highlight the salience of feminist activism in these networked solidarities. After a discussion of tensions in coalition politics with a particular focus on gender divisions, we conclude by highlighting the relevance of positionality, place and scale for the understanding of transnational solidarities in LGBTQ politics.</p>

<title>The study</title>
<p>This study was conceived at the moment of heightened public awareness in Western European countries of the violent oppression of LGBTQ activism in Poland. The conflicts around demonstrations with a strong LGBTQ focus in the cities of Warsaw, Kraków and Poznań in the years 2004 and 2005 were widely reported in the international media (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1350506812466610">Ferens, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1350506812466610">Gruszczyńska, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1350506812466610">Törnquist-Plewa and Malmgren, 2007</xref>). The attempts at banning these marches, the attacks by far-right counter-demonstrators, and the excessively homophobic rhetoric of the Polish government under the presidency of Lech Kaczyński (Law and Justice Party) since 2005, caused first and foremost a crisis in Poland and subsequently significant concern across the EU. Poland had just joined the EU and LGBTQ groups across Europe, inclusive of transnational campaigning organizations such as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1350506812466610">ILGA Europe (2001</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1350506812466610">2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1350506812466610">2006</xref>), started to campaign around developments in Central and Eastern Europe. We sought to examine this activism in terms of transnational ‘solidarity’ by analysing solidarity discourses and the political economy against the backdrop of which they were enacted.</p>
<p>We followed a qualitative mixed-method approach. We participated in the Equality marches and cultural festivals in Warsaw and Poznań in 2008, the Kraków Culture for Tolerance Festival in 2008 and 2009, the Kraków Queer-in-May event in 2009, as well as the Kraków March for Tolerance in 2008 and 2009. We took part in the 2007 Get Bent Festival and the 2008 Queer Up North event (both in Manchester), as well as the 2009 Pink Saturday Event in The Hague. We also participated in international networking events of Dutch COC local organizations in The Hague and Arnhem in 2009. We conducted documentary research on Polish LGBTQ politics in IHLIA (the International Gay and Lesbian Information Centre and Archive) in Amsterdam. We interviewed 35 activists in Poland, Germany, the Netherlands, Belgium and the United Kingdom. Most interviews were conducted in English language, some in Dutch or German. We spoke to a wide range of activists from diverse backgrounds affiliated with different types of organizations, such as professional LGBTQ campaigning or lobbying groups, trade unions and queer anarchist groups. Some participants did not affiliate themselves with any group or did not want to lay claim to the term ‘activist’.</p>

<title>The transnationalization of LGBTQ struggles in Poland</title>
<p>Polish LGBTQ politics gained momentum in the early 2000s. Informal social organization among gay men and lesbians started in the 1980s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1350506812466610">Szulc, 2011</xref>). But it was not until the fall of communism in Poland, that many organizations were formed. Most activists favoured strategies of support work and feared that public political activism could trigger a backlash (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1350506812466610">Gruszczyńska, 2009</xref>). Things started to change in the early 2000s. The first march with a LGBTQ focus, the Warsaw Equality Parade, took place in 2001 organized by the Polish branch of the International Lesbian and Gay Cultural Network (ILGCN). Activists in other cities, too, started to organize demonstrations, such as the March for Tolerance in Kraków and the March for Equality in Poznań in 2004. The early 2000s also witnessed the emergence of a public debate on the legislation for same-sex relationships (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1350506812466610">Szulc, 2011</xref>). In 2003, CPH (Campaign Against Homophobia) organized a visibility campaign called ‘Let them See Us’, which displayed posters of same-sex couples holding hands in galleries and on public bill boards (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1350506812466610">Gruszczyńska, 2009</xref>). According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1350506812466610">Weseli (2009)</xref>, organizations such as the Association of Lambda Groups and CPH represented a predominantly gay male agenda, even if Lambda had a few lesbian subsections, such as Lesbian Lambda in Kraków (from 1990) and Lambda Bilitis in Warsaw (from 1992). Many lesbians shared a sense of invisibility until the early, if not mid-2000s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1350506812466610">Lizurej, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1350506812466610">Mizielińska, 2001</xref>), when <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://Lesbijka.org">Lesbijka.org</ext-link>, Konsola Women Association and Lambda Warsaw set up empowerment projects and the Lesbian Coalition (LBT) emerged. Queer and anarcha-feminist organizing gained momentum in the late 2000s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1350506812466610">Weseli, 2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1350506812466610">2010</xref>). Bisexuality has remained contentious in the larger framework of ‘LGBT’ politics. The same is the case with regard to transgender, even if the formation of Trans-Fuzja in 2007 has created more visibility for trans politics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1350506812466610">Mizielińska and Kulpa, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>Many see 2004 as ‘turning point’ in Polish LGBTQ politics, a radicalizing moment resulting from an escalation of public homophobia in the face of anxieties linked to EU accession (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1350506812466610">Gruszczyńska, 2009</xref>; Törnquist and Malmgren, 2007). EU accession also reinforced the transnationalization of Polish LGBTQ politics. LGBTQ activists sought to intensify their European connections in order to ‘pressure the state from outside’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1350506812466610">Chetaille, 2011</xref>: 129). LGBT organizations from abroad had used pre-accession negotiations to pressure Central and Eastern European governments to comply with what they considered to be European human rights standards (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1350506812466610">Beger, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1350506812466610">O’Dwyer, 2010</xref>). Feminist transnational cooperations evolved around similar premises in the pre-accession years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1350506812466610">Regulska and Grabowska, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1350506812466610">Roth, 2008</xref>). Nationalist and Euro-sceptical parties and movements rejected these demands as an act of authoritarian imposition. LGBT rights became an icon in the conflicts around national identity and sovereignty with regard to the EU (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1350506812466610">Chetaille, 2011</xref>) in a similar way as it had happened with the question of abortion rights years earlier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1350506812466610">Graff, 2003</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1350506812466610">2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1350506812466610">Zaborowska and Pas, 2011</xref>). This set the scene for fierce battles around LGBT rights, in the course of which LGBTQ activists engaged in complex, multilayered and multiscalar solidarities involving local, regional, national and transnational ties. Masson cautions not to forget that transnational networks and collective action are always ‘embedded both in space and in the lives of emplaced persons’ (Flusty, quoted in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1350506812466610">Masson, 2010</xref>: 39). Following this lead, we highlight the significance of place and location of solidarity formations in Polish LGBTQ politics in the following section.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1350506812466610">
<title>Solidarity as multilayered and multiscalar coalition politics</title>
<p>In 2004 and 2005, the Warsaw March for Equality was banned by the city authorities under the leadership of the Mayor of Warsaw Lech Kaczyński. In June 2005, several thousand activists marched in defiance of the ban. Kaczyński did permit a counter-demonstration, a so-called ‘Parade of Normality’ organized by the ultra-right All-Polish Youth. In 2004, the first March for Tolerance in Kraków was subject to a violent counter-demonstration. The annual march has since remained a prominent focus of far-right attacks and for national debate about LGBTQ politics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1350506812466610">Törnquist-Plewa and Malmgren, 2007</xref>). On 15 November 2005, 68 people, mostly gay rights activists, were arrested on an Equality march in Poznań which had been banned by Mayor Ryszard Gobelny (a ban later declared illegal by regional authorities). The 2005 march and subsequent marches in Poznań, too, were attacked by right-wing and fundamentalist opponents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1350506812466610">Ferens, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1350506812466610">Warkocki, 2006</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1350506812466610">Gruszczyńska (2009</xref>: 316) places these marches in a genealogy with global Stonewall or Pride parades. She suggests that while Pride events in most Western countries have undergone increasing depoliticization, this is in marked contrast to Central and Eastern Europe where ‘the annual Pride events have become a litmus test for the strength of the local LGBT &amp; communities world-wide as well as for the degree of the tolerance of the societies they take place in’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1350506812466610">2009</xref>: 316). Controversies around Pride demonstrations in Central and Eastern European countries have become subject to debate and mobilization, which goes far beyond the national contexts in which they take place (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1350506812466610">ILGA Europe, 2006</xref>). At the same time, distinctive features of the marches in Warsaw, Poznań and Kraków risk getting lost, if they are subsumed to a genealogy of Stonewall and Pride demonstrations. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1350506812466610">Gruszczyńska (2009</xref>: 330fn) herself acknowledges that only the Warsaw organizers call their event Pride (Warsaw Pride or Equality Pride), whereas other cities use the more assertive term ‘marches’ and refer to the concepts ‘tolerance’ or ‘equality’, rather than specific sexuality or gender categories, such as L-G-B-T-Q which have been taken up in various combinations by organizers of Pride events across the globe. Yet according to Gruszczyńska, the differences between these events are primarily nominal. This does not match our observation. Activists in Kraków and Poznań emphasized that their references to tolerance or equality were not accidental and meant to highlight that these demonstrations did not only address ‘LGBTQ’ issues. The Days of Equality and Tolerance and the March for Equality in Poznań are good examples for an explicitly coalitional approach. The core organizers are women with experience in various political struggles, including feminism, lesbian politics and environmental activism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1350506812466610">Gruszczyńska, 2007</xref>). Preparatory committee structures are reconstituted on an annual basis, paired with attempts to mobilize widely. Aśka believes that this distinguishes the Poznań protest from the ones in Warsaw and Kraków:
<disp-quote>
<p>It’s not like one organization does all these things, but we have some kind of committee, but it’s very open and so we do some announcements in internet, in magazines … and we invite all of the other organizations. &amp; In Warsaw for example it’s like, it’s parades. These are strictly, like, gay, lesbian, all that stuff. &amp; Poznań is equality and solidarity, equality and tolerance march and the idea was that, you know, it is against all kinds of discrimination. So we have some people who are deaf, for example who co-organize this and also people who are focused on, like, women’s rights and all that stuff. So that’s the difference, because in Kraków I think it’s the same exact … mostly LGBT.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The organizers aim to involve people who grapple with discrimination on the basis of their sexuality, gender, ethnicity, class position, religion, worldview or political orientation, disability, age or body size. Solidarity is an important concept for them:</p>
<speech>
<speaker>Christian:</speaker>
<p>Do you think that the work you’re doing, you know, organizing this demonstration and this week, do you think that solidarity is &amp; a value which is important in that? &amp;</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Aśka:</speaker>
<p>Yeah. I think, yeah it has a lot to do with solidarity. It stems from this idea that all the discriminated groups are, you know, some kind of minority and the mechanisms of discrimination are the same, so, you know, every group alone could be, you know, fighting discrimination, but if we join in this solidarity, okay solidarity between those groups, you can go do something more.</p>
</speech>
<p>Aśka describes the protest events in Kraków as ‘mostly LGBT’. Yet organizers of the Festival for Tolerance and the March for Tolerance in Kraków, too, mentioned their endeavour to create broad coalitions for the organization of the march (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1350506812466610">Lukawska, 2007</xref>). In Poznań and Kraków, the ‘gay’ or ‘LGBTQ’ elements never exhaustingly defined the agenda of these demonstrations, nor did they sufficiently characterize the constituencies of supporters. Slogans promoting tolerance and equality sustain a larger vision of social justice and democracy and lend themselves for the conceptualization of solidarity as intergroup coalition politics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1350506812466610">Binnie and Klesse, 2011</xref>). For instance, Pawel talks of a ‘new Polish solidarity’, which involves coalitions of feminists, lesbians, gay men, bisexuals, left-wing groups, including anti-globalization actors and anarchists, democratic activists, artists and curators, progressive academics and sometimes workers, too.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>They [i.e. the marches] gathered people from many left-wing groups &amp; left-wing straight men, or anarchists &amp;, intellectual activists … young people mostly, but not only, or people who are against the Church, against Catholicism in Poland. &amp; But the critics of the parade and people who attack the parade, they see only the gay ingredient, and they attack the parade because of the gay ingredient. So I think this is the solidarity, the new solidarity, which gathered in Poland around the far right and this could happen only because of the parade’s repression; only because the far-right became so powerful in Poland in the beginning of the twenty-first century &amp; that you have this new solidarity where the gays, the feminists, the left-wing intellectuals and activists … and even the workers sometimes work together against the far-right politics in Poland.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>By using the term ‘new Polish solidarity’ Pawel represents solidarity relations within a national imaginary: oppressed or concerned Polish citizens act together to defend democracy against the onslaught of the far-right. The usage of the adjective ‘new’ evokes the memory of previous solidarity politics. In the Polish national imaginary solidarity rhetoric is tied up with the struggles of Solidarność, the most influential anti-communist workers’ movement throughout the 1980s. In her study of the Poznań marches, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1350506812466610">Gruszczyńska (2009)</xref> identifies a common strategy among pro-LGBTQ activists to legitimize their cause by placing it in a lineage with the pro-democracy struggles of Solidarność. The decisions of the organizers of the 2008 march to assemble at the monument to the victims of the June 1956 workers’ uprising inscribes the protest in the historical memory of resistance against oppression in the communist period. At the same time, the organizers also enact transnational solidarity discourses by suggesting that the march was ‘also a form of protest against the banned marches in Moscow, Minsk, Vilnius’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1350506812466610">1</xref></sup> This statement constitutes a specific space of solidarity within the Central and Eastern European region. Since 2006 the organizers have aimed to let their protest coincide with the International Day for Tolerance which has been institutionalized by the United Nations as an annual event to be commemorated on 16 November. This affiliation constitutes a further scale by locating the local struggle it in the context of an institutionalized global human rights campaign. Poznań activists thus take a multiscalar approach and deploy multiple framings of solidarity politics.</p>

<title>Feminism, coalition politics and LGBTQ struggles</title>
<p>A range of authors highlight the centrality of feminists in coalitional LGBTQ politics in Poland. The explosion of feminist and LGBTQ activism in Poland happened at the same time. According to Graff, ‘The first public appearance of a rainbow coalition occurred at a feminist demonstration in Warsaw on 8 March 2000’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1350506812466610">2003</xref>: 103). Umińska considers it to be a duty of feminists to ally themselves with LGBTQ struggles: ‘as long as homophobia endangers Polish democracy, we are all gays and lesbians and should march in the streets with them’ (Umińska, quoted in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1350506812466610">Zaborowska and Pas, 2011</xref>: 25). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1350506812466610">O’Dwyer (2010</xref>: 241) reports that both Domenika Ferens and Agnieszka Graff suggested in interviews for his study ‘that the strongest link with an outside group has been with the Polish feminist movement’. Coalitions were formed at a range of levels. Lukawska stresses the significance of gender studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1350506812466610">Mrozik, 2010</xref>). For our respondent Tomek, the ‘alliance of feminism and early gay movement’ manifested itself mainly around two projects: first, the queer studies conferences which were held in Poland between 2000 and 2004 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1350506812466610">Sikora et al., 2008</xref>) and second, the marches and parades in the mid- and late 2000s. Feminists were prominent in the organization of the conferences and they addressed the problem of heterosexism at their own annual demonstrations (where they were also joined by supportive men) and then later the marches with a more explicit sexuality focus. Tomek refers to the politics of Kazimiera Szczuka, an iconic figure in Polish feminist politics, to illustrate his argument:
<disp-quote>
<p>So Kazimiera Szczuka who was the most visible and vocal feminist of Poland often joined these conferences, whereas we joined her feminist manifestation. It &amp; it is called, Manifa in Warsaw, the demonstration of the 8th of March which is the main event in the activist calendar in Poland. I think that Gay Pride came on later. Her Manifa gained huge support, popular support, and was also quite present in the media. &amp; Now the 8th March in Poland is regarded as a communist, discredited day because it was celebrated under communism &amp; so all the far-right or even the mainstream of Poland is very much against this festival of feminism, whereas Kazimiera Szczuka wanted to revive it and to revive it with a bit of fun, play, art, carnival and it’s an amazing event where political issues [are addressed],<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1350506812466610">2</xref></sup> but there is also a kind of participatory and jubilant spirit, making fun of the government and it’s really, kind of, on the one hand it’s hated and reviled and on the other it became quite popular with the residents of Warsaw. So Gay Pride owes some of its success or a lot of it to Kazimiera Szczuka, to her Manifa.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Tomek suggests that the Manify (feminist protest events called Manifestations which oppose discrimination against women in Poland and the world) set the scene for the emergence of Gay Pride. This narrative presents a genealogy of the Equality and Tolerance marches and parades quite different from the one presented by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1350506812466610">Gruszczyńska (2009)</xref>. Tomek highlights cross-movement fertilization and solidarity in the context of a local protest culture, rather than inspiration by a global LGBT movement. He explains the solidarity between feminism and LGBTQ politics by their shared marginality with regard to the political mainstream and their abject position in the discourse of extreme nationalism. Similar reasons are offered in the literature (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1350506812466610">Zaborowska and Pas, 2011</xref>). Other authors explain the affinity between feminist and LGBTQ politics through an analysis of respective social movement trajectories. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1350506812466610">Graff (2003)</xref> believes that feminist movements in Western countries (as for example in the USA) evolved along certain stages. In the early stages, feminists asserted stable collective identities, a strategy which often involved tensions between heterosexual and lesbian feminists. Only later feminists started to embrace queer feminist agendas which were more attuned to diversity as a constitutive feature of feminist politics. In contradistinction contemporary Polish feminism is marked by a complex layering of temporalities: ‘Polish feminism did not go through a homophobic stage: it joined a rainbow coalition without ever considering identity politics’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1350506812466610">Graff, 2003</xref>: 103). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1350506812466610">Mizielińska and Kulpa (2011)</xref> make a similar claim about the temporality of Polish LGBTQ politics. What appears as ‘sequential’ developments in Western European and Northern American LGBTQ politics emerges as ‘coincidental’ in the sudden articulation of such politics in Poland. According to Mizielińska and Kulpa, neither Polish feminism nor Polish LGBTQ politics can be represented through Western narratives on social movement temporalities. Both feminist and LGBTQ politics developed rapidly in the postsocialist period in close intellectual exchange with other parts of the world. This led to a mixture of ideologies, politics, themes, tactics and aesthetics – which enabled close coalitions in the specific conjuncture of the mid-2000s. Many women activists in our study claimed strong feminist identities as part of their complex and multiple identifications. For many, it was their feminist activism which led them to affiliate themselves with LGBTQ struggles at certain points in their political biographies. For example, Ola highlights her feminist beliefs as a major reason for getting involved in the organization of the Poznań March and Festival for Equality. Aśka, who interpreted for Ola, when we interviewed them both in 2008, summarized her position as follows:
<disp-quote>
<p>She’s saying that, first of all, she’s a feminist and the most important thing for her was women’s rights. She says that the other thing was, okay she is heterosexual, but she has met some homosexuals and bisexuals and, in her opinion, she felt that it’s not okay that those people don’t have more rights in Poznań, so that was her main motivation. And I can add that, okay, when I came to Poznań I started to be involved in [the] women’s association &amp; and I met some people who were organizing the first march and … okay, I am a lesbian, so it was very clear for me that I had to be involved in this march.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Feminist values and an identity-led lesbian rights struggle converge in Aśka’s explanation of her major motivations to join the committee. Whether the confluence of feminist and LGBTQ politics is understood as an act of solidarity or two aspects of an integrated (identity-political) strategy depends on the subjectivity of individual activists.</p>

<title>Transnational feminism and LGBTQ struggles in Poland</title>
<p>The event-based solidarities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1350506812466610">Tarrow, 2005</xref>) we studied had a profoundly transnational dimension. Already local networks reflected transnational experiences. The network of activists involved in organizing the Festival and March for Tolerance in Kraków, for example, contained a significant number of non-Polish nationals, some of them feminists, who worked or studied in the city during their activism for these events. Groups in other countries who supported the events often had Polish people as active members. There is no clear boundary which separates the local from the transnational or global (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1350506812466610">Stewart et al., 2011</xref>). Other organizations, groups and individuals supported the marches and festivals from abroad. These included transnational LGBT lobbying or campaigning groups, such as ILGA (International Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Trans and Intersex Association), ILGCN (International Lesbian and Gay Cultural Network) and IGLYO (International Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender and Queer Youth and Student Organization), various national LGBT organizations within Europe, local LGBTQ groupings and networks, political parties, local governments and trade unions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1350506812466610">Binnie and Klesse, 2010</xref>). Acts of support included donations and fundraising, the participation of delegations in marches or festival activities, the sharing of skills or resources, artistic contributions (e.g. displays, screenings or performances), etc. Activists in Warsaw, Kraków and Poznań cooperated with various kinds of actors, organizations and institutions from abroad. Feminist organizations from abroad, too, participated in networked solidarities. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1350506812466610">Lukawska (2007)</xref> points out that the Kraków Festival for Tolerance would not have been possible without any donations from abroad:
<disp-quote>
<p>We didn’t have any support from like Polish, from the City of Kraków or some Polish national institutions, but we had huge support from abroad and especially from Western countries, which is very good and which enabled us to have the festival.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Among the funding institutions and organizations are also feminist organizations. Bettina explained to us that the Network of East-West Women gave financial support to the Festival for Tolerance over a period of several years and later also the Queer-in-May Festival. The Network of East-West Women was set up at a feminist meeting in Dubrovnik in June 1991 with the purpose of developing feminist strategies in postcommunist societies. It is now engaged in a range of multiscalar regional and transnational projects. In 1994 the network launched NEWW-ON-Line, the first women’s electronic network in Central and Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union. In the same year, feminist legal scholars formed the NEWW East-East Legal Coalition to help coordinating political and legal strategies, advocacy and education (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1350506812466610">Jaffe Robbins, n.d</xref>.). The Network of East-West Women now maintains chapters in Washington, Moscow and Warsaw. A smaller and less formally organized group, the Paris-based ‘queer’ (or fag-dyke-trans) feminist Pink Panthers raised money and sent a delegation to the Kraków festival in 2005. Agnès, a French feminist who was at the time resident in Kraków and co-organizer of the festival, was responsible for the communication with the Pink Panthers. She describes them as group, who ‘are very much into feminists – poetic and materialist feminism, French materialist feminism and a very deep critique of heterosexuality against capitalism and trying to link all the struggles with race and class’. Transnational feminist activism forms one particular modality of political cooperation in the larger coalitional project around LGBTQ politics which has gained momentum in Poland since the early and mid-2000s.</p>

<title>Coalition work, gender troubles and other tensions</title>
<p>Coalition politics involves the construction of networks and development of activism across different social, cultural, ideological, economic and geopolitical positions. The experience of conflicts around power and difference are often central to coalition work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1350506812466610">Reagon, 1998</xref>). Both transnational feminist politics and transnational LGBTQ politics have been profoundly unsettled by conflicts along these lines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1350506812466610">Alexander, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1350506812466610">Mohanty, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1350506812466610">Puar, 2007</xref>). Successful coalition work, it has been argued, depends on a critical ‘politics of location’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1350506812466610">Grewal, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1350506812466610">Kaplan, 1994</xref>). Such critical practice is dependent on a sound understanding of the positioning of social actors in the complex web of social divisions (such as race, class, gender, sexuality, age, disability) and the acknowledgement of shifting and multiple identifications and affiliations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1350506812466610">Anthias, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1350506812466610">Yuval-Davis, 1999</xref>). In this section, we examine the tensions within the politics of solidarity.</p>
<p>Mixed-gender forms of organizing have been subject to repeated debate and conflict both in feminism and LGBTQ politics in many countries. Some of our informants argued that it was sometimes difficult to convince feminist groups to support mixed-gender events. Ida related the following story during her talk on the Get Bent Festival in Manchester (April 2007):
<disp-quote>
<p>So, for example, during the first festival, there was a feminist organization called eFKa, &amp; it means like ‘women’s foundation’, and we were talking to them about having some events at their place &amp; and the lady was like, ‘Well you know, I mean, is there anything about girls really, because about those gay guys, I don’t give a damn. I mean I wouldn’t let them in’ [laughter] So yeah.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Bettina remembers similar conflicts during the first years of her feminist and queer activism in Kraków:
<disp-quote>
<p>I really don’t know if I can generalize. I know that in Germany there was nothing like as many conflicts as in Kraków, between the different LGBT organizations [and] that the lesbians didn’t want to cooperate with, the gays … and so on and so on.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>However, in her experience the networking among feminist and LGBTQ organizations had significantly improved on both the local and national levels during the year 2008.</p>
<p>Gender conflicts can become particularly pernicious, when they intersect with other differences, such as for example age and nationality. When we asked Bettina how she interpreted the difficulties which during one festival emerged between the organizers in Kraków and members of a delegation from Germany, she refers to a mix of personal, cultural and generational factors. The power relations around gender reinforced the problematic dynamic fed by these various differences.</p>
<speech>
<speaker>Christian:</speaker>
<p>Would you say the cooperation turned difficult because of primarily personal, emotional or political issues &amp; or a mixture of it?</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Bettina:</speaker>
<p>&amp; I think it’s more about personal &amp; I think it was just misunderstandings because of culture and because of generation, because the activists who came, they were all, like 50 years old. They were all like twice the age of the average Polish activist’s age &amp; and they were also sometimes, like &amp; because our activists are almost all women &amp; and it was a little, sometimes, strange. It was like the 50-year-old German gays come and tell the young, Polish lesbian feminist women what to do.</p>
</speech>
<p>Bettina refers to cultural, national, age and gender differences to explain the conflict. German activists may be more accustomed to a culture of debate in which different positions are named as such and controversially argued about. Yet if such speaking positions are inhabited with an authoritative habitus by older men in interaction with younger women, the issue can get quite problematic. Moreover, national differences can accentuate age and gender differences: ‘old German gays come and tell the young, Polish lesbian feminist women what to do’. In the light of the history of German–Polish relations (and in particular the invasion, occupation and Nazi terror during the Second World War) nationality carries critical weight in this interaction. Moreover, activists from abroad who support local initiatives are perceived to be more detached from local dynamics as Bettina explains:
<disp-quote>
<p>And the other problems are that people from outside are coming and telling us in Kraków, from the inside, what we should do &amp; like this perspective as an expert, like ‘we have already the LGBT movement 30 years and we know what is the right way’.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Supporters from abroad are here described as ‘outsiders’ who instead of being modest and prepared to learn, assume to be in the know and paternalistically instruct local activists (the ‘insiders’, who are much more familiar with the situation) what to do. It is interesting that Bettina, who is herself German (and shares nationality with this particular group of activists), identifies herself as an insider due to long-term residence and experience of local politics. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1350506812466610">Mizielińska and Kulpa’s (2011)</xref> analysis of how the narration of movement temporalities construct hierarchies between Western Europe and Central and Eastern Europe (for example, around the theme of ‘backwardness’) is helpful to understand the complex power relations negotiated in this interaction.</p>
<p>The organization of transnational protests involving numerous groups and organizations depends on effective communication and the ability to agree on basic premises and strategies. Some Polish research participants cautiously suggested that activists from abroad at times lacked a succinct understanding of the situation in a certain locality at a particular moment in time. This involved concerns regarding the ‘translatability’ of analyses and strategies from one context to another. The confused dynamics around the planned participation of the Pink Panthers at the 2005 Festival for Tolerance in Kraków is a good example. Because the Pink Panthers had engaged together with another radical feminist group in a controversial protest for LGBT and abortion rights inside Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris, some activists in Poland became worried that the Pink Panthers may plan a similar action in Kraków, where, as they feared, such forms of protest could trigger a harsh backlash, in particular because the city was in a state of intense mourning after the death of the Pope. Activists in Kraków felt panic that the situation could get out of control, which led to a temporary breakdown of communication. Bettina remembers:
<disp-quote>
<p>Before the Festival the Pink Panthers in Paris, in their own community made a controversial action … they went into a Catholic Church in Paris with some banners against the Pope, or with some banners about abortion. … It was a quite radical action, but in their cultural context, which they know, but the Polish media somehow got to know about this action and were writing about the action in Paris and were saying ‘Those people are coming to Kraków for the Festival and they will come and attack the Catholic Churches in Kraków’ and so on and the Kraków activists somehow got panicked that they will come and do something bad, but they reacted quite strange, because they just stopped answering the emails from the Pink Panthers.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Agnès, too, recalls strong reservations among activists in Poland which let them take an ambiguous position:
<disp-quote>
<p>But, yes, there was a problem. So their arguments were mostly, ‘We don’t know what they’re going to do. They’re not from here. They’re very radical. They’re very anti-church, and we don’t want to be anti-church.’</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Agnès felt that these fears were not warranted.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>And from what I could see, exchanging emails with them, I really could see that they were very respectful and that they were asking a lot, ‘What do you want us to do? &amp; Should we prepare something? &amp; If yes, what would be the most interesting for you?’ &amp; They were very much asking about everything.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Some of our respondents speculated that the indecisive and badly timed communication on parts of the Kraków team made the Pink Panthers feel unwelcome, which could explain their withdrawal from future participation as an organized group. The episode demonstrates that trust and communication is central for transnational cooperation. Language skills are without question of central importance, too. If more activists of the respective networks could have communicated among each other without needing mediation of people in command of both languages, the process may have led to a better mutual understanding. It appears as if the Kraków team perceived the participation of the Pink Panthers to pose a certain risk which could discredit their protest in the eyes of the wider public. The construction of the Paris activists as blasphemous trouble makers in the Polish media reinforced these anxieties in a situation in which religious and nationalistic feelings were most intense.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>In the 2000s, LGBTQ politics in Poland gained momentum as part of a wider coalitional movement around human rights, the freedom of expression and participatory citizenship. There has been a particularly strong transnational mobilization around LGBTQ politics since 2004, when public articulations of homophobia escalated and the question of ‘homosexual rights’ started to play an ever more important role in debates about national identity, values and sovereignty. EU accession triggered anxieties regarding social and cultural change. National and transnational LGBT organizations and European institutions demanded the respect of LGBT rights as a reflection of a European standard of democracy. Homosexuality and Europe were closely interconnected in the propaganda of Euro-sceptical nationalist politicians and the Christian Right (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1350506812466610">Graff, 2010</xref>). When attempts by LGBTQ groups to gain visibility by the means of alliance-based public demonstrations were attacked, this gave rise to a broad solidarity movement involving feminists, left-wing or progressive movements, organizations and parties, Jewish community groups, disabled people, artists, workers and transnational actors. As part of this process Polish LGBTQ activists have built multilayered solidarity relations. Feminists have been core actors in this coalitional politics – both in the local and the transnational context. The close cooperation between the feminist and LGBTQ movements was further enhanced by a coincidence of a mobilizing momentum and the shared abject position of feminists and LGBTQ activists in dominant Catholic and nationalist ideologies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1350506812466610">Zaborowska and Pas, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1350506812466610">Mizielińska, 2001</xref>). Feminist activism was also central to the formation of transnational LGBTQ solidarities. Women activists who attended events and demonstrations in Poland frequently stressed their primary feminist identification. Feminist groups and organizations were among the core transnational partners of the local organizing groups we studied. The solidarity discourses deployed by local activists referred to multiple registers of scale. Activists did refer to various (sometimes more, sometimes less clearly defined spaces) – including the local (e.g. Poznań), national (e.g. Poland), regional (e.g. Central and Eastern Europe or Western Europe), supranational (EU) or global (e.g. UN). Work from within postcolonial studies has argued that a critical reflection on differential access to resources, privileges and authoritative speaking positions is a precondition for successful solidarity politics. Because solidarity needs to bridge unequal territories of power, the everyday experiences of activism are rarely free from tensions. In this article we have shown how social locations regarding gender, age and nationality may be implicated in problems in coalition work. The cultural mythologies of superiority/inferiority and progress/backwardness bound up with West–East dichotomies are core to a transnationalization dynamic fuelled by the effects of EU accession. Practices of transnational solidarity – feminist and/or LGBTQ – are built in this ambivalence: they point towards new forms of sociality which transcend the limitations of nationalist political frameworks, but at the same time they are shaped by social divisions.</p>
