<abstract>
<p>The aim of this prospective study is to establish whether ductoplasty is necessary to repair the Wharton’s duct after a combined endoscopic and external approach to remove large submandibular gland stones or if simple suturing of the oral floor mucosa after stent placement may be sufficient to achieve proper duct healing. Ten patients were enrolled. Ductoplasty was performed in 6 cases, whereas in 4 cases, only the mucosa of the oral floor was sutured. The stent was removed about 3 weeks after surgery. Sialoliths were completely removed in all cases. During follow-up, patient symptom evaluation, ultrasound, and physical examination showed no signs of recurrence or complications. In our limited experience, ductoplasty after the combined approach was not necessary. After stent placement, the mere suture of the oral mucosa overlying the damaged ductal wall allowed a correct recanalization of the ductal lumen as commonly observed after careful ductoplasty.</p>

<p>After the introduction of the sialoendoscopic technique, most salivary stones can be retrieved through an endoscopic approach.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0194599813477839">1</xref></sup> When stones are too large, a combined endoscopic and external approach may be required.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0194599813477839">2</xref></sup> With regard to the submandibular gland, once the stone has been removed and a sialostent has been positioned, microsurgical sutures of the duct (ductoplasty) are generally considered necessary to avoid salivary stenosis and fistula.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0194599813477839">3</xref></sup> The aim of this prospective study was to assess whether ductoplasty can be considered an unnecessary step in this surgical technique and, therefore, simple suturing of the oral floor after stent placement may be sufficient to achieve duct recanalization.</p>

<title>Materials and Methods</title>
<p>From April 2009 to May 2011, 10 consecutive patients with large submandibular gland calculi were observed at the ENT University Unit of the “A. Fiorini” Hospital, “Sapienza” University of Rome. Approval for this study was obtained by the institutional review board of the university department. The inclusion criteria were as follows: large submandibular gland calculi with a diameter of at least 8 mm at ultrasound (US) assessment, placed in the distal part of the Wharton’s duct or in the hilum of the gland.</p>
<p>Sialendoscopy is performed using a 0.8-mm or 1.1-mm sialendoscope (all-in-one Erlangen-type; Karl Storz, Tuttlingen, Germany), until the sialolith is reached (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0194599813477839"><bold>Figure 1A</bold></xref>). The size and location of the incision of the mouth floor mucosa are marked using the guide of the endoscopic light and by finger palpation. The Wharton’s duct is isolated from the surrounding tissue and mainly from the lingual nerve. The site of duct incision is located by the endoscope light visible through the ductal wall. Once the stone is removed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0194599813477839"><bold>Figure 1B</bold></xref>), a sialostent (polyurethane drain [Balton, Warsaw, Poland] or Venflon tube [Artsana, Grandate, Italy]) is positioned in both parts of the duct for approximately 3 weeks after surgery.</p>

</fig>
<p>We divided our patients in 2 groups. In group A patients, ductoplasty was not performed and only the mucosa of the mouth floor was sutured over the approximated ductal flaps, whereas group B underwent ductoplasty using 5-0 or 4-0 Vicryl. An alternate assignment of patients to the 2 groups was carried out: the first patient satisfying inclusion criteria who underwent our observation was assigned to group A, the second one was assigned to Group B, and so on until the 10th patient. Our fifth and last patient assigned to group A rejected the possibility of not performing the ductoplasty after informing him about the risks associated with surgery. He was then enrolled in group B. At follow-up visits, the clinical outcomes were evaluated according to the patients’ symptoms and physical examination. Ultrasound imaging was performed in all patients about 6 months after surgery. The average follow-up period was 16.3 months (range, 10-23 months). A diagnostic sialendoscopy would have been performed in patients with a suspected ductal stenosis or recurrence of stones.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>Calculi were removed in all cases. They were removed by the submandibular hilum in 8 patients and from the third proximal tract of the duct in 2. The mean diameter of the removed calculus was about 1.4 cm (range, 0.8-2 cm; average size: group A, 1.32 cm; group B, 1.45 cm), substantially confirming the evidence reported by preoperative US examinations. Although the small number of our cases does not allow performance of a significant statistical analysis, there are no clear differences between the 2 groups considering variables such as age of patients, size, or location of stones (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0194599813477839"><bold>Table 1</bold></xref>). No major complications occurred. During follow-up, all 10 patients were symptom free and no recurrences were reported. Ultrasound evaluation showed no signs of stones and no alteration of the glandular parenchyma in comparison with preoperative ultrasounds in patients of both groups. No long-term complications were recorded.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Although suture of the Wharton’s duct at the end of combined sialolithectomy is generally recommended,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0194599813477839">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0194599813477839">4</xref></sup> to the best of our knowledge, this is the first study that tries to determine whether ductoplasty is a necessary surgical step. Results of our experience, although limited and preliminary, suggest that the microsurgical suture of the ductal wall may not be essential either to achieve regular healing of the duct or to avoid stenosis and salivary fistula.</p>
<p>The suture of the flaps of the Wharton’s duct after stone removal and sialostent placement is generally considered a useful procedure in avoiding saliva secretion through the surgical wound after ductotomy and in facilitating duct healing. The constant secretion of saliva, especially during meals, counteracts the healing process. Our experience suggests that positioning of the sialostent alone in the lumen of the duct allows saliva to flow through the lumen of the stent from the gland to the oral floor. In this way, contact of saliva with the surgical wound is avoided until healing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0194599813477839"><bold>Figure 2</bold></xref>).</p>

<graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0194599813477839-fig2.tif"/>
</fig>
<p>We agree with authors who stress the importance of placing an intraluminal stent to avoid postoperative stenosis or adhesions and to allow residual fragments of calculi to be washed out by saliva.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0194599813477839">5</xref></sup> However, in scientific literature, there is no evidence that a suture of the duct is necessary to avoid these complications.</p>
<p>Although promising preliminary results assessed the feasibility in obtaining ductal recanalization without performing accurate ductoplasty, further studies are necessary to confirm whether ductoplasty can be avoided to prevent stenosis or salivary fistula after removal of large submandibular stones through the combined approach.</p>
