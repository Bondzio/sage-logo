Obesity prevalence is high among both Canadian and Greenland Inuit preschoolers, with children living in the city of Nuuk exhibiting lower obesity prevalence than children living in either Nunavut or Nunavik, Canada or Greenland’s towns and villages. Varying obesity prevalence may reflect varying degrees of food security in remote locations as well as the influence of stature and sitting height which have not been well studied in young Inuit children.</bold></p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The present study reports finding from anthropometric assessment of Inuit preschoolers living in Canada and Greenland. Past studies have documented secular trends in height accompanying modernization in this population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1403494812462495">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1403494812462495"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1403494812462495">3</xref>]. More recently, studies provide evidence for increasing rates of obesity among Inuit children [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1403494812462495">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1403494812462495"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1403494812462495">6</xref>]. However, there is little published growth data on preschool-age Inuit children and little is known of the biological effects of recent health transitions in this vulnerable age group.</p>
<p>The present study undertakes a comparison of stature and obesity measures among Canadian and Greenland Inuit children using available cross-sectional data. The purpose of the study is to describe the pattern of growth in preschool-age Inuit children and assess whether it is characteristic of previously reported secular trends in body size. An additional goal is the identification of unhealthy growth patterns such height stunting and obesity in a population experiencing a health transition.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-1403494812462495" sec-type="methods">
<title>Methods</title>
<p>There are four components to the dataset examined in this study, two from Canada and two from Greenland. The Nunavut Inuit Child Health Survey is a comprehensive survey of the health and nutrition of Inuit children living in 16 communities in Nunavut, Canada. The Nunavut sample includes 376 preschoolers aged 3–5 years (177 males and 199 females) born 2002–05 who were measured in 2007–08. The Environmental Contaminants and Child Development Study investigates the neurodevelopmental effects of exposure to polychlorinated biphenyls in Inuit infants from three communities in Nunavik, the Arctic region of the province of Quebec, Canada. The Nunavik sample includes 87 children (40 males and 47 females) born 1994–96 and measured in 2000–01. Two groups of children were selected from the Greenlandic Research Database (GRD). The first is a group of 86 children (45 males and 41 females) born 1997–2000 and measured 2003–07, living in Greenland’s capital city, Nuuk (population 15,000). The second, referred to as ‘Greenland Towns and Villages’, is a group of 572 children (292 males and 280 females) born 1996–2005 and measured 2001–10, living outside of Nuuk, in towns and villages ranging in size from 700 to 5000 inhabitants. Full descriptions of sampling and consent procedures for these studies can be found elsewhere [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1403494812462495">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1403494812462495">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1403494812462495">8</xref>]. All 1121 children in the dataset (554 males and 567 females) were between 36 and 72 months of age.</p>
<p>Ethics approval for the research was granted by the relevant institutions. In the case of the Nunavut survey, the research was approved by the McGill Faculty of Medicine Institutional Review Board and a Scientific Research License was obtained from the Nunavummi Qaujisaqtulirijikkut. In the case of the Nunavik study, the research was approved by the Nunavik Nutrition and Health Committee and by ethics committees at Laval and Wayne State Universities. The National Scientific Ethical committee in Greenland approved the Greenlandic studies. Approval for the use of GRD data was granted by the Greenland Agency of Health and Prevention.</p>
<p>Anthropometric protocols were similar for all four studies. Following the guidelines recommended by Lohman et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1403494812462495">9</xref>], height and weight were measured in light clothing with shoes removed. Standing height was measured to the nearest 0.1 cm using a portable stadiometer with the child’s head placed in the Frankfurt plane. Weight was measured to the nearest 0.1 kg using an electronic scale. Repeat measures were not recorded therefore it is not possible to calculate the degree of reliability using technical error of measurement and inter-/intra-observer error for this anthropometric data set.</p>
<p>Mean height and body mass index (BMI) were calculated and compared using Student’s t-tests. Height for age (HA) and BMI for age were calculated and converted to z-scores and percentiles using Epiinfo version 3.5.1. One-sample t-tests were conducted on mean z-scores to permit comparison with the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) reference. All statistical comparisons were performed using SPSS version 12.0 software.</p>
<p>Prevalence of height stunting was determined using CDC 2000 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1403494812462495">10</xref>], hereafter referred to as “CDC”, which classifies HA centile &lt;5 as stunted. CDC defines overweight as BMI for age 85–95 centile and obesity as BMI for age ≥95 centile. To facilitate comparison with published studies, prevalence of overweight and obesity were also determined using the cutoffs recommended by the International Obesity Task Force (IOTF), which provides BMI cutoffs for overweight and obesity at 6-month age intervals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1403494812462495">11</xref>]. For the purposes of comparison, our overweight categories do not include obese individuals. Cross-tabulations with Pearson chi-square tests were used to compare prevalence of stunting, overweight, and obesity between regions and by gender. Statistical significance was assessed at the level of <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.05.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>Though all children in the dataset were between 36 and 72 months of age, mean age varied somewhat between the samples. Mean age at measurement was 52.4 months in Nunavut, 64.4 months in Nunavik, 67.3 months in Nuuk, and 56.4 months in the Greenland Towns and Villages sample.</p>
<p>In the total sample, mean height and BMI were consistent with age-matched means from the CDC reference (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1403494812462495">Table I</xref>). The overall mean height for boys was significantly greater than that of girls (t=3.574, df=1119, <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.001), though this was largely attributable to a gender difference in height in Greenland Towns and Villages, where mean height was significantly greater in boys (t=3.044, df=570, <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.005).</p>

<p>The two Canadian samples differed significantly, with children in the Nunavut sample exhibiting lower mean height (t=−7.134, df=461, <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.001) and greater mean BMI (t=2.711, df=461, <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.05) than children in the Nunavik sample.

<p>For the total sample mean HA z-score (HAZ) was significantly higher than that of the CDC growth reference (t=8.752, df=1120, <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.001) though this difference was influenced by high mean HAZ in both the Nuuk (t=5.920, df=85, <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.001) and Greenland Towns and Villages (t=10.406, df=571, <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.001) samples.

<p>Prevalence of height stunting was extremely low, 2.5% of the overall sample (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1403494812462495">Table II</xref>).

<p>Use of CDC guidelines yielded overweight and obesity prevalence of 26.4 and 33.0%, respectively, in the total sample. The highest obesity prevalence observed was 50.8% among Nunavut preschoolers. In contrast, the lowest obesity prevalence observed was 12.8% among the Nuuk, Greenland sample. Samples from Nunavik and Greenland Towns and Villages had intermediate prevalence values.</p>
<p>In contrast, use of IOTF cutoffs yielded prevalence estimates of 32.2% overweight and 16.2% obese in the total sample. In both the Nunavut and Nunavik samples, use of IOTF rather than CDC cutoffs shifted the distribution from a pattern of moderate overweight and high obesity prevalence to one of high overweight and more moderate obesity prevalence. This shift was not apparent among the Greenland samples, which were generally characterized by overweight prevalence in the 20–25% range and obesity prevalence nearer 10%.</p>
<p>Comparing subgroups, the prevalence of overweight and obesity was significantly higher among the Nunavut sample compared with the Nunavik and both Greenland samples (chi-square comparisons, <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.001), though the difference in prevalence of overweight between Nunavut and Nunavik samples was not apparent using IOTF cutoffs. There was a significant difference in overweight and obesity prevalence between Nunavut boys and girls using CDC (Pearson chi-square=7.359, df=2, <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.05); however, this was not the case using IOTF guidelines. No other study groups exhibited a sex difference in overweight and obesity prevalence.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>A challenge in making international comparisons is variability in study methods. We acknowledge there may have been minor inconsistencies in measurement between studies that affect our results. However, our accuracy is supported by the relative simplicity of anthropometric techniques involved (height and weight) and the use of measured, rather than reported, data.</p>

<p>Stature values confirm earlier findings of secular trend in height in both Canadian and Greenland Inuit children [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1403494812462495">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1403494812462495">3</xref>]. Mean stature varied considerably among the samples, with Canadian Inuit children exhibiting significantly shorter stature than their Greenland counterparts. Despite this fact, stature in the Nunavut and Nunavik samples was the highest ever observed among Canadian Inuit children, showing secular trend in height has continued. As recently as a decade ago, young Canadian Inuit children living in coastal Labrador communities had recumbent length/stature values significantly below the NCHS reference beginning at age 12 months [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1403494812462495">12</xref>]. In contrast, preschool-age Canadian Inuit children in the present study exhibit stature values consistent with the CDC reference population.</p>
<p>We observed a marked east–west gradient in stature, with Greenland children taller, Nunavik children intermediate, and Nunavut children shorter relative to the total sample. Greater stature among Greenland children, particularly those living in Nuuk, undoubtedly reflects Danish influence, both through the socioeconomic influence of Danish governance (formally a part of the Kingdom of Denmark since 1953, Greenland has had home rule for 30 years) and through genetic admixture [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1403494812462495">13</xref>]. The continuation of the east–west gradient within Canada is interesting, especially given the geographical contiguity of many communities. Nunavik is under the jurisdiction of the well-established province of Quebec while the Territory of Nunavut is a relatively new political jurisdiction with responsibility for providing health and social services over a vast geographic region. Differences in stature among Canadian Inuit children may be an early warning of socioeconomic and health disparities in these regions.</p>
<p>While little has been published about stature among Greenlandic children, our findings are consistent with Becker-Christensen’s 2003 study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1403494812462495">1</xref>] in which mean standing heights for 6-year-old boys and girls from the western Greenland municipality of Maniitsoq were 118.4 cm and 116.2 cm, respectively. These values are similar to those of our Nuuk sample, but somewhat higher than those of our sample of children from the Greenland Towns and Villages, which may reflect disparities in child health across Greenland. It is also possible that stature differences within Greenland arise from greater Danish ancestry among Nuuk and Maniitsoq residents than among those living in other regions. The population of Nuuk is 85–90% Inuit, 4% mixed Inuit and Danish, and the rest mainly Danish; across the rest of Greenland, the proportion of mixed Inuit and Danish ancestry is somewhat lower [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1403494812462495">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1403494812462495">14</xref>].</p>
<p>Overall prevalence of height stunting was low, though it is worth noting that a majority of children with low HA centile came from Nunavut and Greenland Towns and Villages. These jurisdictions did not exhibit the lowest mean HAZ, rather they were characterized by low HAZ <italic>relative to their national counterparts</italic>, an observation that may be indicative of the influence of relative rather than absolute socioeconomic status on child growth and health.</p>

<title>Obesity prevalence among Inuit children</title>
<p>High mean BMI among Inuit preschoolers is concerning as children aged 3–5 years require optimal health in order to reach major developmental milestones. There are no other recent Canadian studies of BMI in Inuit children. In contrast, Greenland’s health surveillance system monitors child growth with assessments from birth to the end of public school at about age 15. In a retrospective study of children at school entry (age 5–7 years), mean BMI increased from 15.94 in children born 1972–76 to 16.84 in children born 1997–2001 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1403494812462495">7</xref>]. The latter value is consistent with the slightly younger Greenland children in our sample, which had an overall mean BMI of 17.15.</p>
<p>The high obesity prevalence observed in the present study is consistent with reports of rising obesity prevalence among Greenland Inuit children. A retrospective study of children aged 2–15 years has found that prevalence of overweight has increased substantially in recent decades [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1403494812462495">6</xref>]. Analyses of different cohorts of young children (5–7 years) drawn from the GRD report prevalence of overweight and obesity (using IOTF) at 16.6 and 5.9 %, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1403494812462495">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1403494812462495">7</xref>]. We find prevalence of overweight and obesity (using IOTF) among Greenland children to be substantially higher than previously reported values, though the difference may be partly due to the slightly younger and more recent cohort examined in the present study.</p>
<p>While it is commonly assumed that adiposity has an adaptive origin among Arctic populations, evidence suggests that obesity is a relatively recent phenomenon closely associated with socioeconomic and geographic factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1403494812462495">15</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1403494812462495"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1403494812462495">17</xref>]. All Inuit communities struggle with the social and economic challenges accompanying geographic isolation; however, individual communities and households vary in their levels of access to education, employment, and health care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1403494812462495">18</xref>]. As in stature, there was an east–west gradient observed in obesity prevalence, with children living in the western regions of Nunavut and Nunavik exhibiting higher prevalence of obesity than the Greenland children. There is evidence that Nunavut Inuit households are among the poorest in Canada [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1403494812462495">19</xref>] and it is possible that lower income, employment, and education contributing to higher obesity prevalence among Nunavut preschoolers compared to their Nunavik peers.</p>
<p>Differences in food security may account for some of the observed variability in obesity prevalence. Food security is a significant challenge in the Canadian north [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1403494812462495">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1403494812462495">21</xref>]. Results of the Nunavut Inuit Child Health Survey indicate as many as 70% of Nunavut households with preschool-age children are food insecure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1403494812462495">22</xref>]. In the recent Aboriginal People’s Survey, slightly more Nunavut (36%) than Nunavik (33%) child respondents reported experiencing hunger because the family had run out of food or money to buy food [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1403494812462495">19</xref>], a result which suggests supportive structures may be marginally better in Nunavik. In contrast, a recent study of households in Qeqertarsuaq, Greenland reports only 8% of households are food insecure, though residents face many challenges to obtaining healthy foods [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1403494812462495">23</xref>].</p>
<p>It is also possible that higher obesity prevalence in the Canadian samples, particularly among Nunavut children, may in part be attributable to the differences in stature observed between the Canadian and Greenland samples. Among Inuit, secular trend in height has been accompanied by a decrease in sitting height ratio [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1403494812462495">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1403494812462495">25</xref>] suggesting that children’s increased height is the result of increasing leg length. This pattern reflects that observed in other European contexts and suggests that patterns of morphology previously typical of Inuit growth may be changing in response to the environmental stimuli accompanying Westernization. It is possible that higher sitting height values among Canadian Inuit children confound interpretation of BMI [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1403494812462495">26</xref>], though we have no data to test this hypothesis. While previous studies have reported a relationship between high sitting height ratio and higher BMI in Nunavik adults [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1403494812462495">27</xref>], a recent analysis of adult data from the Canadian International Polar Year Inuit Health Survey found no relationship between sitting height and BMI [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1403494812462495">28</xref>].</p>
<p>We report overweight and obesity prevalence using both CDC and IOTF cutoffs for ease of comparison with previous studies. The differences in prevalence using the two methods are considerable, with the use of IOTF cutoffs yielding obesity prevalence roughly half that determined through use of the CDC percentiles. In fact the two methods are most divergent for children in the 3–7-year age range [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1403494812462495">29</xref>]. A future paper will determine obesity prevalence in this population using the new World Health Organization Child Growth Standard [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1403494812462495">30</xref>] to determine its applicability in young Inuit children.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>The present study reports continued secular trend in early child growth such that Inuit preschoolers have stature values consistent with those of the CDC reference. There is marked variability in mean stature values between Canadian and Greenlandic samples which likely reflects both genetic admixture and differences in socioeconomic status. Similarly, while obesity prevalence is high among both Canadian and Greenland Inuit preschoolers, there is considerable regional variability in obesity prevalence, with children living in the city of Nuuk exhibiting much lower obesity prevalence than children living in either Nunavut of Nunavik, Canada or Greenland’s towns and villages. Varying obesity prevalence may arise from the challenges of maintaining food security in remote locations, and may be influenced by morphological issues such as stature and sitting height which have not been well studied in young Inuit children.</p>
