<p>Umberto Eco, in a highly cited book on the role of the reader and on the semiotic interpretation of texts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0081175012460856">1979</xref>), put it this way: “one could say that there are more things in a text than are dreamt of in our text theories. But there are also <italic>fewer</italic> things than are dreamt of” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0081175012460856">Eco 1979</xref>:38). Among these <italic>fewer</italic> things Eco finds in a text is Greimas’s semiotic actantial model, the model of agents (or actants) and their roles, the basic story grammar we discuss in our paper (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0081175012460856">Franzosi, De Fazio, Vicari, this volume, 2012</xref>:1–42). But for as large a class of texts that narrative is, it is just <italic>one</italic> class, one text genre out of many. A story grammar hardly fits non-narrative texts. Yet, even these texts may contain invariant structures: Roberts’s four functional forms—description of a process, description of a state of affairs, judgment of a process, judgment of a state of affairs— applied to measure the intentions of a clause or Vicari’s modal verbs (<italic>can/could, may/might/must, shall/should/ought to, will/would</italic>) applied to analyze social movements’ different framing tasks as expressed in their texts (<italic>can/will</italic> = prognosis; <italic>must/should</italic> = diagnosis) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0081175012460856">Vicari 2010</xref>). Depending upon what we want to see, we focus on different things in a text. Modality would not get us any closer to understanding the social relations of lynching in terms of who does what to/with whom. No more than a story grammar would allow us to understand framing tasks or intentionality. It is no doubt this wide variety of things found in texts that leaves me skeptical of the claim that codebooks and coding rules solve the problem of meaning and interpretation. If a reader brings to the interpretive act Eco’s “encyclopedia of knowledge” where “every text refers back to previous texts” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0081175012460856">Eco 1979</xref>:19), what would Professor Popping’s codebook look like?</p>
<p>Perhaps, the original text that Eco paraphrased in the opening lines of this reply may help us shed further light on this fraught relation between texts and methods (a new <italic>word</italic> brings up a new <italic>world</italic>). “There are more things in heaven and earth” says Hamlet to Horatio “than are dreamt of in your philosophy” (Shakespeare <italic>Hamlet</italic> Act 1, scene 5, 159–67). To see more things in heaven, at the end of 1609, Galileo developed the telescope. In a handful of months, he discovered that the moon is not a perfect celestial sphere; beyond the moon, he discovered Jupiter’s satellites and the strange appearance of Saturn’s and Venus’s behavior. Things on earth were not for Galileo; and having truly invented the microscope in 1624, he never did anything with it. In sending a first exemplar to his friend Cesi, he promised that “you will be able to get not small entertainment and joy, as happens to me” (on the six lessons on scientific innovation to be learned from the Galileo affair, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0081175012460856">Franzosi, 2010</xref>). Heavens or texts, the point is this: There is no single instrument (no single method) that allows us to see everything, on heaven and earth, far away and close by (although, at least theoretically, Newton would later reduce the bewildering variety of “things in heaven and earth” to one fundamental principle: the general law of gravity). As for Galileo, Aristotelian philosophy was the first victim of his discoveries. Galileo himself was the second: tried, and condemned, for heresy by the Roman Inquisition in 1633, blind and gravely ill from rheumatic fever for the many cold winter nights he spent gazing at the heavens, Galileo died in Arcetri under house arrest in 1642, the same year that Newton was born. I was lucky, then. Although, as Professor <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0081175012460856">Tolnay (2012)</xref> points out, the work behind QNA is huge (and I too certainly cringe at the thought of expanding the lynching project beyond Georgia to other Southern states), I have developed neither blindness nor rheumatic fever. And no Inquisition trial.</p>
<p>With so much to see in a text and with the blunt instruments with which we extract some specific and partial meanings (ever elusive meanings, to myself as well, as Professor Junker correctly points out; and at times with better alternatives, as Professor Tolnay also correctly notes), perhaps the wisest course of action is irony about one’s approach, about one’s efforts, efforts yet so passionately and steadfastly pursued. “To conclude a book of textual explorations,” Eco writes, “with a metanarrative text that speaks ambiguously and with tongue in cheek of its own ambiguity and of its own derisory nature seems to me an honest decision” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0081175012460856">Eco 1979</xref>:40). With irony, indeed, I concluded my long journey from words to numbers (and in Columbus’s good company!) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0081175012460856">Franzosi 2004</xref>:332).</p>
