<p>Today’s Gospel lesson is about a most memorable dinner party. Jesus is invited to dine at the home of Simon the Pharisee. For Simon, this just may go down as the most disastrous dinner party of his entire life. And that might make it the most important dinner party of his entire life. Jesus has a habit of turning the tables on his hosts. He is the one invited by Simon the Pharisee. But by the end of dinner, Jesus is the host, teaching Simon and opening his eyes to a new way of life.</p>
<p>If you want a picture to summarize Jesus’s activity in the Gospel according to Luke, you’ll find it two verses before our story begins today, in Luke 7:34, where Jesus says, “the Son of Man has come eating and drinking.” In Luke’s gospel, Jesus uses the table as a place where he lives his teaching, where he lives his gospel of God’s radical forgiveness and welcome. Jesus’s theology, his teaching about God and God’s work in the world, is done around the table. But the table is not only a convenient place for Jesus to teach. Jesus taught that one’s eating habits and one’s spirituality are related. In other words, you cannot say you love God and then refuse to share a meal with a brother or sister.</p>
<p>In Jesus’s time, sharing meals with others was easier said than done. Dietary laws meant that the dining table divided those who kept certain dietary laws from those who did not. The Pharisees, for example, kept laws about everyday foods they ate in their homes, laws others thought applied only to priests in the temple.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0014524613480291">1</xref></sup> It would be inappropriate, the Pharisees believed, to be at table with those not eating properly tithed and prepared food in a state of ritual purity. Jesus, however, often defies these table manners, as he does in today’s story.</p>
<p>Simon the Pharisee has invited Jesus to dine with him. For all the bad press the Pharisees get in the New Testament, we may hear the story better if we remember that the Pharisees are good religious people, people really interested in doing the right thing. They want to please God. While we may not share the details of the their customs, at least insofar as they take their spiritual lives and religious practices seriously, they are, I suspect, a lot like us.</p>
<p>By this time in Jesus’s ministry, some of the Pharisees have begun to reject Jesus and his teaching. But not Simon. He is willing to sit down to a meal with Jesus. This is an intimate and binding act, an act of mutual acceptance and trust. Simon is willing to invite Jesus to his home with some of Simon’s friends. Simon may see himself as fairly open-minded about Jesus. He has heard that Jesus has some less than respectable ideas, but he is willing to be open-minded and see for himself. He has been warned that Jesus has this way of turning things upside down, but Simon wants to do the magnanimous thing: have a party, invite Jesus as a guest, maybe engage in some polite conversation, be a good host.</p>
<p>But nothing goes quite as Simon has planned.</p>
<p>What happens is Jesus’s reputation has preceded him to Simon’s house. Jesus is known for preaching forgiveness of sins and God’s great love for all and a woman in the city known as a sinner has heard where Jesus will dine tonight. We aren’t told what the cause of the woman’s bad reputation is. If you imagine her profession to be the oldest, you could be right. Or she could simply be a woman who is “out of place,” who has entered a space intended for others, righteous men, a place in which she does not fit and to which she has not been invited.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0014524613480291">2</xref></sup> We don’t know if she regularly and habitually participated in some kind of immoral behavior, or if she had done something once that gained her a bad reputation. We don’t know if she was “a villain or a victim.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0014524613480291">3</xref></sup> We simply aren’t told. It is enough to know that she counted among the unrighteous, not clean, not respectable, maybe not even trying hard to clean up her reputation. This woman comes uninvited into Simon’s home. The courtyard to Simon’s home, as was typical, was probably open and accessible from the street, but she was not invited. The woman stands behind Jesus then bends down and begins to touch his feet, bathing them with her tears and ointment mingled. She looses her hair, which is something not done by any respectable Jewish woman of the time, and certainly not when in a room full of respectable Jewish men. She is breaking all the rules and she is in a place where she does not belong. Women and men aren’t even supposed to talk to each other in public, and here she is touching a man she is not married or related to, hair and tears flowing.</p>
<p>I feel for Simon. He just wants to have a nice dinner party.</p>
<p>What is going on here? Simon thinks, if Jesus were a prophet, as some claim, he would know what kind of a woman is touching him — that she is a sinner. How can he not see what is going on here?</p>
<p>Jesus does not draw away from the woman or send her away. Instead he tells Simon a parable. It’s about forgiveness, and the point is that when someone realizes they are forgiven greatly, they respond by forgiving greatly.</p>
<p>Then, turning toward the woman, Jesus says to Simon, “Do you see this woman?”</p>
<p>What a strange question to ask Simon: do you see this woman? I imagine Simon thinking, See this woman?! Of course I see this woman! How could I miss her? This woman, this known sinner, comes barging into my home, kisses and anoints your feet, cries and wipes your feet with her hair, and you ask, Do you see this woman? How could I not see her? Or perhaps you haven’t noticed how all polite dinner conversation has stopped. Perhaps you haven’t noticed the other guests dropping their silverware, their jaws hanging open, their eyes staring in amazement.</p>
<p>You know what else I see? thinks Simon. I see how you respond to her. She touches you and you just sit there, no rejection, no repulsion. I see your reaction to her, that sinner.</p>
<p>You know what else I see? I see all my dinner guests tomorrow in the marketplace, talking about what they have seen here tonight. That’s what I see.</p>
<p>But Simon, do you really see this woman?</p>
<p>What is it Jesus wants Simon to see? What is it Jesus wants us to see?</p>
<p>When Jesus looks at her, he sees not an unrighteous interloper, a rude uninvited guest. He sees a person set free, a person of value, a person so grateful for her forgiveness, she will cross any boundaries, break any rules to show her thanks. He sees a woman who in her lavish thanksgiving holds nothing back, and makes up for all the lack of hospitality shown by Simon, who held back from offering his best. He sees a woman wasting tears and ointment and reputation, like God wastes forgiveness on us, throwing it around, letting it flow down on us, like God’s got an endless supply of forgiveness to give.</p>
<p>Simon, do you see this woman?</p>
<p>What does the woman see? The woman sees only Jesus. She is so focused on her Savior that the stares and disgust and shock of the people are not even noticeable to her. She is ready to let everything go: hair, tears, ointment, any last remaining shreds of reputation. She is ready to pour out everything she is and has in an act of adoration and thanksgiving for what Jesus has done for her. Just as Jesus would pour out his life and love completely for us.</p>
<p>Do you see?</p>
<p>As he does so often, Jesus has turned the tables on a host. He has been invited as a guest, but by the end of the story, Jesus himself is the host. Jesus feeds Simon wisdom, and bids Simon learn. He invites a woman who is a sinner, and Simon, who is a short-sighted host, to see a new way of life, a way of celebration and peace, a way that begins with giving thanks for being made worthy to dine with Jesus at his table, a way that begins with offering all that we have and are at the feet of our Savior.</p>
<p>What do we see in the story?</p>
<p>Through faith, we are invited to share in God’s vision and see what Jesus sees, to see the woman, not as a notorious sinner, but as worth the costly price Christ paid for her, as worth everything he poured out for her. Through faith we are invited to see ourselves as brothers and sisters of this woman, who gather as a community around our Lord’s Table. We are invited to see that we also are forgiven greatly, redeemed, loved. God knows us, God turns toward us and sees us for who we truly are, and, grace upon grace, God loves us still and says to us, you are forgiven, free. Go in peace, your faith has saved you.</p>
<p>Sometimes, it’s enough to make you want to get down on your knees and weep tears of thanksgiving.</p>
<p>Do you see?</p>
