<p>In a newspaper interview in August 2006, in which he revealed his membership, as a 17-year-old, of the Waffen-SS, Günter Grass recalled one of his most powerful memories of the end of the Second World War: ‘The first dead that I saw were not Russians, but Germans. They were hanging from the trees, many of them were my age.’ Grass’s experience paralleled those of many of his fellow Germans in 1945, as their country became a land of corpses. If any country could be described as living in the shadow of death, it was Germany.</p>
<p>Death may be a ubiquitous feature of life, but the dead seem to have occupied a particularly prominent place in twentieth-century Germany – not least because of the massive human losses suffered in two world wars and the campaigns of extermination that left millions of dead across the European continent. What is more, Germans experienced a variety of different political systems, each with an ideology that shaped how death was dealt with in the public sphere, within the space of a mere 30 years. From the competing cultures of mourning after the First World War through the cult of dead heroes of the Nazis to the rituals of the ‘real-existing socialism’ of the German Democratic Republic, Germans experienced vast changes in the ways in which death and disposal featured in public and private life.</p>
<p>In recent years German historians – among them Sabine Behrenbeck, Michael Geyer, Svenya Goltermann and Felix Schulz – have paid increasing attention to the place of death and the dead in modern German history. Monica Black is yet more ambitious, examining Germany’s political and cultural history through the prism of how Germans dealt with death from the early 1930s through to the building of the Berlin Wall. Her canvas is Berlin: as the country’s largest city and its capital, the city at the forefront of ‘modern’ practices, the home of what was Germany’s largest Jewish population, the location for the Nazi regime’s ostentatious attempts to develop a cult of the dead, the target of massive bombing and then site of fearsome combat, the ‘modern necropolis’ at the end of the Second World War and the city divided after 1945, there can be few places so well suited to examining how death figured in twentieth-century German history.</p>
<p>Black’s book is organized chronologically: a chapter on death and dying during the late Weimar period, dealing both with the death and burial culture and with the contested ways in which the war dead were remembered; a chapter on ‘Nazi ways of death’, in particular the ways in which Germany’s racist masters embraced death and sought to develop a cult of the dead; two chapters dealing with how Berliners reacted at the time and subsequently to the losses suffered during the Second World War and the bombing of the city (drawing interesting conclusions about the Nazis’ commitment to provide individual graves for bombing victims, whereby ‘the very notion of “proper burial” became an expression of ethnic solidarity and superiority’); and two chapters dealing with the divided postwar city, one on ‘death in socialism’ and the other on ‘death and the west’.</p>
<p>While not all the findings will surprise, this book offers a wealth of insights. Among these are the resilience of traditional religious practice and funeral rites, despite the sometimes (if temporarily) successful efforts of both Nazi and Communist authorities to impose their ideological imprint on how Germans dealt with the dead. Sensitive observations about how profoundly upsetting were the lack of coffins and the absence of proper burials during the last, terrible weeks of war underscore the point. Black surely is right to think of ‘German culture under Nazism as a historical complex, built on old values reimagined for new circumstances and new principles masquerading as timeless essences’ (126), and her discussion of attitudes towards the dead and missing after 1945 offers a new perspective on the postwar transition and casts doubt upon Hannah Arendt’s oft-quoted assertion about ‘the absence of mourning for the dead’ in postwar Germany. More generally, Black demonstrates that, far from distancing themselves or being alienated from the dead in a secular age (the ‘brutal revolution in traditional ideas and feelings’ as posited by Philippe Ariès), Berliners displayed concern and even obsession about their dead.</p>
<p>‘Death in Berlin’ is a history of mentalities, resting on detailed description and discussion of values, rites and attitudes, and how these reflected and affected German politics. ‘The purpose of the book’, Black writes, ‘is to demonstrate how perceptions and practices of death can illuminate the continual process of cultural change in Berlin over successive waves of historical transformation' (177). For Black, ‘the customs of death are foundational cultural practices, expressing a set of standards and values held in common by the group’ (118). Her book contains rather less on the mechanics and economics of death and disposal – on the running of cemeteries, for example – and there are places where more comparison with practices elsewhere in Europe might have been welcome, to assess the degree to which German practices and mentalities may have formed a special case or to which they reflected the European mainstream. Nevertheless, Monica Black’s phenomenally well-researched (and well-illustrated) study is a treasure trove of information and insights into the cultural history of modern Germany during the decades of its greatest upheavals – an impressive achievement. It is to be hoped that the publisher will be moved to bring out a paperback edition.</p>
