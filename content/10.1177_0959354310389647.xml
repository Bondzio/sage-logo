<abstract>
<p>A number of prominent theoretical psychologists employ the ideas of the philosopher Emmanuel Levinas to address what they take to be a harmful scientism and serious ethical blind spots in modern psychology. We argue that while Levinas’s approach no doubt incorporates a powerful and invaluable turn to ethics, it seems cryptic, limited, and one-sided in some important respects. We illustrate some of the ways these limitations show up in theoretical psychology critiques and suggest that philosophical hermeneutics and the ideas of Mikhail Bakhtin present a fuller and more balanced picture of human agency without diluting the crucial insights conveyed by Levinas’s insistence on “ethics as first philosophy.”</p>

<p>Many social theorists and cultural critics over the last half-century have addressed what they take to be serious ethical blind spots in modern culture. For example, the critical theorist <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0959354310389647">Jürgen Habermas (1971/1973</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0959354310389647">1985/1991</xref>) has extended the seminal insights of Max Weber, who characterized the situation of modern Western societies as being “locked in an iron cage” of instrumental rationality. According to Habermas, modern society to a great extent is built upon a harmful confusion of <italic>praxis</italic> with <italic>techne</italic>, Greek words meaning roughly culturally meaningful activities and technical capacity. Specifically, we tend to collapse the cultural and moral dimensions of life into merely technical and instrumental considerations. As a result, according to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0959354310389647">Habermas (1971/1973)</xref>, we imagine applying theory to practice chiefly as a matter of applying principles uncovered by empirical science in a manipulative or instrumental manner to gain control over natural and social processes and produce desired results. Unfortunately, in his view, even as we have grown in instrumental prowess, we have diminished our ability to evaluate the worth of ends on any basis other than the sheer, arbitrary fact that they are preferred or desired. We become adept at discerning means–ends relationships and performing cost–benefit analyses, but weaken our ability to reason together about the inherent quality of our way of life and about what goals or ends we might best seek. We are left without a moral compass and without ways to keep our individual and collective lives from being co-opted and dominated by modern systems of production and bureaucratic domination.</p>
<p>A variety of thinkers in recent years (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0959354310389647">Etzioni, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0959354310389647">Root, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0959354310389647">Sandel, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0959354310389647">Schatzki, Cetina, &amp; von Savigny, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0959354310389647">Scheff, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0959354310389647">Schumaker, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0959354310389647">Slife, Reber, &amp; Richardson, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0959354310389647">Taylor, 2002</xref>, among others) have taken this critique further, arguing that although the tradition of liberalism in the modern West, with its strong emphasis on individualism, has made great strides in securing individual rights, it has not been as successful in developing appreciation for, among other things, the deep connections that make possible a rich understanding of and meaningful participation in community life. Paradoxically, elevating the status of the individual above all else may have the concomitant effect of obscuring our serious ethical obligations to each other and eroding the undergirding community or meaningful social ties that individuals need to thrive.</p>
<p>Typically, these theorists recommend turning from an individual-centered to a deeply relational view of human action and agency. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0959354310389647">Jonathan Sacks (2002)</xref> summarizes this turn in an especially perspicuous manner. Sacks identifies what he takes to be a profound shift in the “governing presuppositions of modern thought.” In his view, we are discovering that the “concept of the isolated or atomic self, the ‘I’ with which thought and action supposedly began,” the “lonely self,” assured of “nothing [but] its own existence” that is the “hero of almost all the great Enlightenment dramas,” is a “fiction, or at least an abstraction.” Early breakthroughs came with Wittgenstein’s demonstration that “the idea of a ‘private language’ is incoherent” and that we “learn language only by communicating, by engaging, that is to say, in relationship with others,” and with Mead’s beginning to show “that we develop a sense of personal identity only through close and continuous conversation with ‘significant others’” (pp. 150–151).</p>
<p>According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0959354310389647">Sacks (2002)</xref>, this change goes hand in glove with another epic shift in Western thought away from the view of mature human relationships as fundamentally “contractual” to one in which the most basic human ties are what he terms “covenantal,” giving a “richer sense of the importance of culture and community…in sustaining social life.” The question arises as to what happens when “the sense of sin and the deeply internalized constraints of a religious age…begin to weaken” (p. 143). The answer typically comes in the form of an assumption that the only workable alternative to conformity and stagnation are fundamentally competitive schemes of human interaction. Altruism is largely limited to giving individuals the right to participate in the game, and it is felt that indelible self-interest and even a degree of enmity between people need not be destructive, but often will generate outcomes beneficial to all. “Private vice would become public virtue when society was so organized as to turn passions into interests. Thus was economics born” (p. 144).</p>
<p>Sacks describes how in this emerging new view, the “most fundamental forms of association” are seen as “open-ended and enduring.” They consist in bonds “not of interest or advantage, but belonging,” and operate on the basis of an “unconscious choreography of mutuality” in which individuals commonly help one another spontaneously, “without calculations of relative advantage.” He argues that we are beginning to discern how the unique benefits of competition—Sacks prizes healthy competition and a capitalist economy—not only are compatible with such mutuality but cannot be sustained without the kind of “trust” it affords. Sacks summarizes the results of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0959354310389647">Fukuyama’s (1995)</xref> influential study of the role of trust in economic and social affairs with the statement that “markets depend on virtues not produced by the market, just as states depend on virtues not created by the state”(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0959354310389647">Sacks, 2002</xref>, p. 152). Other examples of this new approach are so-called “communitarian” theorists (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0959354310389647">Etzioni, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0959354310389647">Sandel, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0959354310389647">Selznick, 1992</xref>), and others who discuss the importance of cultivating a “civil society,” not just a procedurally fair or efficient one, and proponents of the importance of “social capital” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0959354310389647">Putnam, 2000</xref>), all of whom in different ways stress the importance of a sense of community or what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0959354310389647">Sacks (2002)</xref> calls covenantal relationships to sustaining personal liberty and economic development.</p>

<title>Moral underpinnings of psychology and psychotherapy</title>
<p>In recent years, a number of theoretical and philosophical psychologists (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0959354310389647">Cushman, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0959354310389647">Fowers, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0959354310389647">Flyvbjerg, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0959354310389647">Gantt &amp; Williams, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0959354310389647">Martin &amp; Sugarman, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0959354310389647">Richardson, Fowers, &amp; Guignon, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0959354310389647">Slife et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0959354310389647">Vandenberg, 1999</xref>) have echoed these critiques of modern individualism and addressed what they perceive to be ethical blind spots and something of a moral vacuum in our way of life. Many of them contend, moreover, that modern psychology and psychotherapy to a great extent are blind or oblivious to these ethical deficiencies and actually tend to perpetuate them by way of unacknowledged assumptions and tacit values that infuse theory, research, and practice in the field. For example, some argue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0959354310389647">Cushman, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0959354310389647">Richardson, 2005</xref>) that modern psychology’s propensity for representing itself as an objective and value-neutral enterprise really masks a host of cultural and moral values, a “disguised ideology,” that it both surreptitiously advocates and hides from close scrutiny and possibly needed revision. Typically, these tacit ideals represent some form of modern “liberal individualism” or “liberal instrumentalism” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0959354310389647">Sandel, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0959354310389647">Sullivan, 1986</xref>) that is insufficiently critical of our heavy reliance on instrumental rationality and the promotion of individual rights and autonomy as <italic>the</italic> key to the good life.</p>

<sec id="section2-0959354310389647">
<title>Ontological hermeneutics and dialogue</title>
<p>Some of these theoretical psychologists draw heavily on hermeneutic philosophy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0959354310389647">Gadamer, 1960/1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0959354310389647">Guignon, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0959354310389647">Heidegger, 1927/1962</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0959354310389647">Richardson et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0959354310389647">Taylor, 1989</xref>) to clarify the nature of human action and the social world and to tease out and scrutinize the tacit values underlying psychological theory, research, and practice. In the hermeneutic or interpretive social science view, the kind of understanding sought in the humanities and a large part of the human sciences contrasts sharply with the sort of knowledge typically pursued in natural science. The natural sciences rely centrally on the exercise of a special capacity for abstraction that we might call “objectification.” To adopt an objectifying stance toward things is to ignore or abstract away from “subject-related qualities.” Such qualities are most of the meanings of and relationships among things that show up within our ordinary experience, concerned with our shifting desires, values, and aims. Thus, to take an objectifying stance means to “regard the world as it is independently of the meanings it might have for human subjects, or of how it figures in their experience” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0959354310389647">Taylor, 1985</xref>, p. 31). Obviously this approach has proved its mettle in modern science and its powerful applications. However, there is no good reason to deny the validity of other <italic>kinds</italic> of interpretations of our experience and events, reflecting different <italic>ways</italic> of being involved with the world. It no longer seems proper to many of us to insist that reality must be only that which is formulated through the approach of abstraction and objectification. We have learned to question the detached, somewhat depersonalizing, “spectator” view of knowing and relating to the world that this approach entails (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0959354310389647">Slife &amp; Williams, 1995</xref>).</p>
<p>In the hermeneutic view, humans are first and foremost “self-interpreting beings” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0959354310389647">Taylor, 1989</xref>) who are “always ‘thrown’ into a familiar life-world from which they draw their possibilities of self-interpretation. Their life-stories only make sense against the backdrop of possible story-lines opened by our historical culture” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0959354310389647">Guignon, 1989</xref>, p. 109). These lives are woven into the fabric of a holistic life-world where there are no sharp divisions between the person or mind, on one side, and the world, body, and others, on the other. The meanings we live by permeate and shape the practices and institutions of the “outer” world much as they belong to our “inner” life.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0959354310389647">1</xref></sup> There is certainly a place for scientific knowing and an instrumental stance toward the world. But in this view there is a more fundamental, ultimately practical or moral kind of understanding that humans always and everywhere hammer out together, as they seek to understand the meaning for them of events, the past, texts, works of art, social reality, and the actions of others, so that they can relate to them appropriately along the story-lines of their living.</p>
<p>On this account, a basic fact about humans, in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0959354310389647">Heidegger’s (1927/1962</xref>, p. 228) words, is that they “care” about whether their lives make sense and what they are amounting to. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0959354310389647">Taylor (1985)</xref> develops this notion of care with the idea that humans do <italic>not</italic> simply desire particular outcomes or satisfactions in living. Rather, they always or inherently make “strong evaluations,” even if only tacitly or unconsciously, about the <italic>quality</italic> of their desires and motivations and the <italic>worth</italic> of the ends they seek in terms of how they fit in with their overall sense of a decent or worthwhile life.</p>
<p>The kind of understanding pursued in this way is above all <italic>dialogical</italic>. In <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0959354310389647">Taylor’s (2002)</xref> words, in both everyday life and human science inquiry, “understanding of a text or an event…has to be construed, not on the model of the ‘scientific’ grasp of an object, but rather on the model of speech-partners coming to an understanding” (p. 126). In other words, understanding is the result of a process of mutual communication, influence, negotiation, accommodation, and struggle, as in a conversation or a relationship. This process involves an exquisite, quintessentially human, sometimes almost unbearable tension. On the one hand, we harbor self-defining beliefs and values concerning things we truly care about, in which we have a “deep identity investment,” sometimes an investment in “distorted images we cherish of others” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0959354310389647">Taylor, 2002</xref>, p. 141). On the other hand, since our ideals and our images of others and events are always partial or distorted in some way, we need not just to compromise and get along with others, but to <italic>learn from</italic> the past, others, or other cultures. Thus, in matters closest to our hearts, we <italic>depend</italic> greatly upon these others, their insights, their critical challenge of our points of view, and their beneficent influence.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0959354310389647">Richardson and Fowers (1998)</xref> apply this perspective to psychological inquiry with the suggestion that hermeneutic dialogue offers an approach that is as good as or better than modern liberal theory and would-be “objective” social science in allowing us to defend and advance modern liberal values of human rights and dignity, <italic>and</italic> reveals a way that we can meaningfully and critically discuss more substantive issues of character, community, and the good life. It does this, in part, by bringing our modern ideals of dignity and equality out in the open, where, many of us feel, their considerable merits and their limitations can be discussed without any claims to unquestionable authority or strategies of intimidation playing a role in the debate. These authors suggest, following <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0959354310389647">Gadamer (1960/1975)</xref>, that dialogical understanding can be said to be an interplay of <italic>openness</italic> and <italic>application</italic>. Drawing on <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0959354310389647">Warnke (1987</xref>, p. 167ff.), they characterize such dialogic understanding as involving genuine openness to any meaning or claim that actually involves granting it provisional authority to challenge our beliefs and prejudices. Application involves testing out whether an insight or point of view reveals new aspects of our current motives and dilemmas and helps make sense out of new circumstances. In the process, some reinterpretation or modification of old truths is inevitable. The danger or risk with openness is <italic>conservatism</italic>, in which we bow to authority or rationalize the status quo out of fear or timidity. The only cure for such inauthentic rationalization is further rigorous application of these claims to our unique historical situation. The danger or risk with application is <italic>subjectivism</italic> or the clever, opportunistic interpretation of events or principles in a self-serving manner. However, the only cure for such arbitrariness is further, sometimes annoying or painful openness to challenge from others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0959354310389647">Gadamer, 1960/1975</xref>, p. 507).</p>

<title>Levinas: Ethics as first philosophy</title>
<p>Recently, a number of philosophical psychologists and others have seen the work of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0959354310389647">Emmanuel Levinas (1961/1969</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0959354310389647">1974/1981</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0959354310389647">1997</xref>) as a promising way of analyzing and resolving confusions and problems about modern psychology’s ethical underpinnings and cultural thrust (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0959354310389647">Bloechl, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0959354310389647">Clegg &amp; Slife, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0959354310389647">Davis, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0959354310389647">Gantt, 1996</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0959354310389647">2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0959354310389647">Gantt &amp; Williams, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0959354310389647">Sayre &amp; Kunz, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0959354310389647">Vandenberg, 1999</xref>). Levinas advances a distinctive thesis to the effect that much of the Western tradition has tended strongly to reduce, absorb, or appropriate what is taken to be “the Other” so that it approximates “the Same,” in philosophy, politics, and ethics. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0959354310389647">Levinas (1997)</xref> puts it,</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>The correlation between knowledge and being, or the thematics of contemplation, indicates both a difference and a difference that is <italic>overcome</italic> in the <italic>true</italic>. Here the known is understood and so appropriated by knowledge, and as it were <italic>freed</italic> of its otherness. (p. 76)</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>For <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0959354310389647">Levinas (1997)</xref>, intellectual activity involves “seizing something and making it one’s own,” reducing, appropriating, and grasping “the otherness of the known” (p. 76). This process effaces the alterity of “the Other,” and in this sense the Western tradition for Levinas, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0959354310389647">Bernstein (1991)</xref> interprets him, is “imperialistic” and attempts to “conquer, master and colonize ‘the Other.’” Seeing this “reveals the violence that is implicit in the reduction of ‘the Other’ to ‘the Same’” (p. 69). According to Bernstein, though indebted to phenomenological tradition, Levinas is radical because of his claim that even Husserl’s phenomenology and Heidegger’s ontology fail to escape the reduction of “the Other” to “the Same.” Levinas’s antidote to this kind of imperialism is to open a space for the otherness of “the Other” conceived of as an “absolute other” that is prior to every initiative we might take in relation to “the Other” and prior to any imperialism of coercing “the Other” or defining Him/Her in our terms.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0959354310389647">Levinas (1997)</xref> elevates ethics as “first philosophy” through an analysis of the encounter with “the Face of the Other.” The ethical relation to “the Other” begins with acknowledging the radical incommensurable singularity of the Other. The purpose of Levinas’s emphasis on the radical alterity of “the Other” is to resist the comprehending dominating power of reason in the Western tradition. Thus he insists on the absolute alterity of “the Other,” which is always beyond our grasp of understanding. For Levinas, the face-to-face relation with “the Other” is asymmetrical and he emphasizes unlikeness and lack of reciprocity in contrast to the traditional emphasis on likeness and reciprocity in relationships. The ethical implications of this view for responsibility in relationships are considerable. For Levinas, this asymmetry means that “I, in responding to ‘the Other’ (<italic>l’autrui</italic>), am always responsible for (to) ‘the Other’ (<italic>l’autrui</italic>), regardless of ‘the Other’s’ response to me” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0959354310389647">Bernstein, 1991</xref>, p. 71). In Levinas’s view, “the Other” is utterly different, and so unknowable, and he emphasizes the ethical call implicit in the vulnerability of the Face of the Other. For <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0959354310389647">Levinas (1997)</xref>, “the Other” calls into question and challenges the complacency of the self, which, in claiming its right to be, may usurp “the Other.”</p>

<sec id="section4-0959354310389647">
<title>Levinas vs. hermeneutics</title>
<p>How might Levinas’s philosophy and hermeneutic thought be compared and contrasted with respect to their implications for social and psychological inquiry, especially concerning how they can address the ethical blind spots that many feel characterize both modern culture and much of contemporary psychology? Are they at odds on fundamental issues? Or might they complement one another in the search for a “situated psychology” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0959354310389647">Cushman, 1990</xref>), one that does not ignore cultural context or obscure the inescapably ethical dimensions of psychological theory and research? It seems to us that they are both richly complementary and in some ways significantly at odds.</p>
<sec id="section5-0959354310389647">
<title>Common ground</title>
<p>To begin with, there are some important parallels between the work of Levinas and the pre-eminent hermeneutic philosopher Hans-Georg Gadamer (both of whom were students of Heidegger). First, Gadamer shares Levinas’s concern with the reduction of “the Other” to pre-existing categories of thought.

<p>knows himself as an acting being, and this kind of knowledge he has of himself does not seek to establish what exists. An active being, rather, is concerned with what is not always the same as it is, but can also be different. (p. 280)</p>

<p>In a similar vein, he states that “every experience worthy of the name runs counter to expectation” (p. 280). Others forever surprise us. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0959354310389647">Gadamer (1960/1975)</xref> advocates radical openness to “the Other” (p. 318) and he criticizes the human sciences for addressing only “what is typical and regular about human behavior—[as] this flattens out the nature of the hermeneutic experience” (p. 322). In somewhat different ways, Gadamer and Levinas each challenge us to do more than simply tolerate or even respect the Other; and both warn of the folly thinking it is possible or even desirable fully to grasp “the Other” in understanding. Gadamer challenges us to be willing to be transformed by accepting the “truth claims” of the Other, while Levinas challenges us to respond to the ethical call of the other. Gadamer focuses primarily on the implications of openness for understanding and the self, while Levinas’s focus remains steadfastly on the ethical call expressed by “the Face of the Other.” Here too, though, we find that Gadamer shares Levinas’s ethical concerns when he says that the “claim to understand the other person in advance performs the function of keeping the claim of the other person at a distance” (p. 323), and when he discusses the tendency toward domination often found in charitable work.</p>

<title>Points of contrast</title>
<p>Nevertheless, there remain important points of contrast between Levinas and hermeneutics that need to be explored. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0959354310389647">Derrida (1967/1978)</xref> argues that in certain respects, Levinas goes too far or is too one-sided in his argument. Derrida agrees that the absolute alterity of “the Other” is irreducible, but he argues that this does not discount the possibility (and perhaps even necessity) of similarity or sameness. Irreducible alterity does not mean there is nothing in common between the “I” and the genuine “Other,” nor does it mean that there is no way of understanding the other. Also, he is skeptical about some aspects of Levinas’s claim regarding ethical violence. Derrida states:</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>Not only is the thought of Being not ethical violence [as Levinas claims], but it seems no ethics—in Levinas’s sense—can be opened without it. … [The thought of Being] conditions the respect for the other <italic>as what it is</italic>. Without this acknowledgement, which is not a knowledge, or let us say, without this “letting-be” of an existent (other) as something existing outside me in the essence of what it is (first in its alterity), no ethics would be possible… [T]o let the other be in its existence and essence as other means that what gains access to thought, or (and) what thought gains access to, is that which is essence and that which is existence; and that which is the Being which they presuppose. Without this, no letting-be would be possible, and first of all, the letting be of respect and of the ethical commandment addressing itself to freedom. Violence would reign to such a degree that it would no longer even be able to appear and be named. (p. 138)</p>
</disp-quote>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0959354310389647">Bernstein (1991)</xref> agrees with this rather turgid formulation of Derrida’s and makes the same point more simply. He suggests “there is both sameness and radical alterity, symmetry and asymmetry, identity and difference in my relation with the ‘Other,’ and above all in the ethical relation” (p. 74).</p>
<p>This critique of Levinas by Derrida and Bernstein moderates a position regarding alterity that they take to be ultimately untenable. The Levinasian and hermeneutic views fully agree regarding the point that the alterity of “the Other” is ultimately irreducible and can never be <italic>fully</italic> grasped in understanding. On the other hand, if the alterity of “the Other” is emphasized to the extent that “the Other” is conceived of as substantially and essentially different, and thus beyond any meaningful understanding, important problems seem to arise. For one, this position seems to undermine the possibility of engaging “the Other” in genuine dialogue. It seems to preclude or downplay the possibility that one can be changed by the <italic>actual</italic> other owing to lack of understanding of who “the Other” actually is. Furthermore, an extreme stance on alterity seems to imply that the range of ethical responses to “the Other” is restricted, being based, as they must be, on a severely limited or significantly flawed image of the alterity of other. If one can never truly encounter and <italic>apprehend</italic> (though in a limited way) real difference, then how can one ever escape a significant degree of narcissism or solipsism that would seem likely to entail a degree of violence in responding to the other? For <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0959354310389647">Bernstein (1991)</xref>, “[T]o think of ‘the Other’ as an ‘absolute Other,’ where this is taken to mean that there is no way for relating the ‘I’ to ‘the Other,’ is unintelligible and finally incoherent” (p. 74). Even if this overstates the case and may not represent Levinas’s intention, still Bernstein may be right to claim that “there is a reciprocity between the I and ‘the Other’ which is compatible with their radical alterity. For <italic>both</italic> stand under the reciprocal obligation to seek to transcend their narcissistic egoism in understanding the alterity of the Other” (p. 74). The degree of emphasis on alterity has important implications that distinguish Levinas’s view and the hermeneutic view. Levinas’s claim that even the thought of Being is ethical violence implies that virtually all serious attempts to understand or engage with “the Other” will involve some degree of imperialistic brutality. This view contrasts with a hermeneutic view that holds that reason and culture can serve as both an enemy of alterity and as a resource for appreciating and supporting difference.</p>
<p>In line with this critique, we would add that Levinas’s view might have the effect of sealing off from full scrutiny the cultural, moral, or spiritual value commitments of a thinker, social scientist, or participant in political or moral discourse. In the Levinasian view, our appreciation of the fact that the alterity of “the Other” is substantially and irreducibly different, and so impervious to reason and understanding, enhances our ability to resist violent, imperialistic reduction to preconceived categories. The assumption seems to be that resistance to reducing difference to preconceived categories is good when such reduction is illegitimate, a point driven home by the use of such terms as “violent” and “imperialistic.” But the question arises here regarding possibly legitimate criticism. Does the claim that “the Other” cannot be reduced, grasped, or understood seal off the space for genuine dialogue involving probing questioning by one person or point of view of the other, and vice versa? A view of alterity as essentially and substantially different, irreducible, and beyond understanding appears to have the unfortunate side-effect of placing “the Other” beyond the reach of ethical critique and potentially legitimate criticism, and in doing so may create new problems as troubling as those it sought to resolve.</p>

<title>Mutual influence, dialogue, and learning from others</title>
<p>In our view, we need to be just as concerned about failing to “learn from” the Other, and vice versa, as about opportunistically or maliciously interpreting them in our terms. Often, what we most respect and appreciate about others is their hard-won expertise, knowledge, or wisdom on a particular topic or in a particular area of human practice or experience. Sometimes those we are inclined to admire and rely on for their insights or judgment are also quite humble and open to challenge or criticism from others, including others much less expert or experienced than themselves, from whom they may find they unexpectedly learn something new of real value. In learning from experts or becoming one oneself, on this view, we assume we are able to gauge the reliability and worth of another’s perspective, even if we critically sift it, test it out in various ways, and modify our appreciation of it as we cultivate our own judgment. A similar process takes place among relative equals, friends, intimates, and colleagues in everyday life where we pool our knowledge and insights extensively, one that hermeneutics characterizes “on the model of speech-partners coming to an understanding” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0959354310389647">Taylor, 2002</xref>, p. 126).</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0959354310389647">Bakhtin (1981)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0959354310389647">Taylor (1991)</xref> argue that we are not only essentially creatures of dialogue but veritable dialogical selves. In this view, the mature human self is not essentially a center of monological consciousness, often conceived of as an inner space or mind that contains representations of things outside or inside this container self, including “depictions of ends desired or feared” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0959354310389647">Taylor, 1991</xref>, p. 307). Rather it is a scene or locus of dialogue. In this view, what I centrally <italic>am</italic> is an interplay or conversation among various voices, commitments, identifications, or points of view. Bakhtin imagines this self as a conversation or struggle among multiple voices, speaking from different positions and invested with different kinds and degrees of authority. Becoming a self means internalizing the ongoing conversation or dialogue from the world around us. Some of these voices Bakhtin terms “authoritative” (we might call them “authoritarian”) in an uncontested way. They are not in dialogue with other voices or positions, but are blindly accepted or compulsively rejected. Other voices are “innerly persuasive.” They have been tested, assimilated, retold in our own words. Picturesquely he says that they are “half-ours and half-someone else’s” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0959354310389647">Bakhtin, 1981</xref>, p. 385). Voices become innerly persuasive as a result of a certain kind of dialogic process. Each voice or position is “viewed” by others and glimpses its own image in the eyes of others. For this to take place, “outsideness” is necessary. An image of a voice may be structured only from the point of view of another voice, which is temporarily taken as a norm (p. 296). Each voice incorporates its own evaluative position at the same time that it remains open to the potential truth of the Other (unless it tries to dishonestly or defensively thwart that message or insight). This back-and-forth process draws out the potential insight and wisdom of different voices or positions and allows a new, temporary, open-ended unity to emerge.</p>
<p>Our concern is that Levinas’s approach considerably truncates this process, leaving out of the picture what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0959354310389647">Bakhtin (1981)</xref> calls “outsideness,” the key means by which we can gain a critical perspective on our own views and values and afford the same kind of critical angle of vision to others. The Levinasian stress on lack of reciprocity and difference between self and other may make ethics blind. The process of learning from others, including discerning part of the reason why we appreciate and respect others and they us, is largely obscured. All of the kinds of dialogue, mutual influence, mutual edification, and learning from others described here may, of course, be distorted or marred by denial, defensiveness, malice, or cruelty. But they may not, in which case constructive dialogue <italic>presupposes</italic> a kind of reciprocity and at least limited or partly accurate knowledge of others and their “being” that Levinas proscribes in order to defend the ethical relation. However, we suggest that hermeneutic dialogue that takes seriously the dialectic between respect for “the Other” and engaging them fully with one’s views and commitments can address Levinas’s concern for protecting the alterity of “the Other” while avoiding the danger of stifling legitimate critique. It may be a greater challenge to manage the interplay of granting provisional authority to the perspective of the Other to challenge one’s own while also bringing to bear one’s own sincere convictions in dialogue than simply to refrain from tendentiously imposing one’s own categories and viewpoint on the other person (or text, historical event, or social reality). In the absence of the right kind of reciprocity, we may remain significantly disconnected or alienated from others or ourselves.</p>

<title>Levinas and theoretical psychology</title>
<p>A number of leading theoretical psychologists have employed Levinas’s ideas to address the ethical blind spots or deficiencies they find in current social and psychological inquiry. Their analyses show the corrective power of Levinas’s approach but also illustrate the problems with his approach discussed in this paper.</p>
<p>For example, drawing on Levinas, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0959354310389647">Gantt (1996)</xref> paints an elegant portrait of the way in which we are indebted to each other for our very existence. He writes that,</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>In the absence of others there can, according to Levinas, be only a hollow void of nothingness. For one cannot even begin to recognize one’s own consciousness… except in contradistinction to the absolute priority of that which is other than oneself; the infinite surplus of the existence of another, in the face of whom I discover my own humanity. (p. 134)</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Gantt goes on to indicate how this indebtedness binds us ethically to one another:</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>Thus, it is to these others I must perpetually render an accounting for my very existence, as it is only because of them that I have achieved conscious existence at all. And in that moment, the moment of awakening, of being brought forth in the call of the Other, I must respond to the ethical demands placed upon me by that call. Human subjectivity, then, is a continuous questioning and answering, and must to be understood as both congenitally moral and inherently meaningful, in that it can never take place outside of a sociality with others. (p. 134)</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>However, after acknowledging our dependence on each other and the moral relationship we have to each other, we are given very little guidance with regard to conducting our relationships in a complicated, conflict-ridden, interdependent world apart from being forbidden from violating “Otherness.” It is not clear how the “continuing questioning and answering” Gantt mentions amounts to more than a kind of mutual forbearance.</p>
<p>Though respect for the other and protection of the “Other” by resisting the imperialism of reductive, analytical reason may be perfectly legitimate in many situations, Levinas’s approach seems oddly closed to recognizing, exploring, and elaborating other forms of ethical engagement. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0959354310389647">Gantt (1996)</xref> states:</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>The truth of the matter, as Levinas teaches, is that we are not captive to the blind demand to maintain ourselves socially, we are captive to the needs of others … . And lest this be interpreted as a “giving up” of autonomous freedom for a slave’s existence, remember that captivity to the self-serving drive of a status-centered hedonism is intrinsically petty and addictive, whereas captivity to others is not experienced as captivity at all, but as a conventional relationship that leads to a liberation from hedonistic self addiction. (p. 135)</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The idea of escape from a self-serving hedonism advocated here is generally appealing. However, a striking feature of this passage is the way the author sharply dichotomizes that kind of shallowness or even addiction and a fairly radical “captivity to the needs of others,” a bit of hyperbole that seems as dangerous as it might be inspiring. It seems to us that the latter term of this polarized pair does not amount, as Gantt suggests, to a “conventional relationship” at all. Most of us would think that a conventional relationship—that is, a healthy or fully ethical one—includes at different times a host of qualities and transactions that fall between these extremes, such as mutual correction and learning from one another, assertiveness, appreciation and mutual affection, empathy, forgiveness, constructive argument, mild censure, at times even a bit of “tough love,” and the like (as surely Gantt would agree). But these are excluded from this Levinasian picture of things, leaving us in theory with only the choices of a kind of radical ethical purity or a thoroughly debased alternative.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0959354310389647">Gantt (2000)</xref> discusses how from a Levinasian perspective the psychotherapeutic relationship with the other, at its best, involves a “suffering-with.” He writes,</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>Suffering-with is a moment in which, rather than dogmatically pursuing a pre-established mode of therapy with a particular client-type to realize a particular outcome, we stand open to the being of the other person, a radical otherness that reveals a world of mystery—a world that cannot be appropriated in terms of preconceived categories or totalizing systems. (p. 21)</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Once again, dogmatic reductionism and appreciating radical otherness are sharply dichotomized. If one had to choose, perhaps radical otherness is the way to go. But a lot of life and psychotherapy would seem to take place in a messy middle ground that the Levinasian view leaves largely in the dark.</p>
<p>This middle ground surely is important to psychology and mental health professionals. For example, in recent years, relational psychoanalytic thinkers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0959354310389647">Aron, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0959354310389647">Mitchell, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0959354310389647">Mitchell &amp; Aron, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0959354310389647">Skolnick &amp; Warshaw, 1992</xref>), whose ideas have influenced theorists and therapists well beyond narrow psychoanalytic circles, have elaborated a social and interpersonal account of personality and thoroughly re-conceptualized the analytic process itself in interpersonal terms. Generally in line with the hermeneutic and dialogical self approaches outlined above, this relational view presumes that humans are defined foremost by their relationships and by the intrapsychic, interpersonal, social, and cultural contexts in which they live. Specifically, relational thinkers characterize the therapeutic situation as co-constructed by analyst and patient (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0959354310389647">Aron, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0959354310389647">Hoffman, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0959354310389647">Mitchell, 1993</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0959354310389647">1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0959354310389647">Stern, 1996</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0959354310389647">1997</xref>) and as structured by cultural, historical, and moral factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0959354310389647">Aron, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0959354310389647">Greenberg, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0959354310389647">Spezzano, 1998</xref>). Increasingly, analytic therapy is viewed as fundamentally relational and shaped at the core by the intentionality and action of <italic>both</italic> the analyst and the patient (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0959354310389647">Zeddies, 1999</xref>). From this relational perspective, what an analyst knows about any patient is inseparable from his or her unique mode of participation in the analytic relationship, and his or her subjectivity is intimately connected <italic>to</italic> and a shaping agent <italic>in</italic> how the analytic process unfolds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0959354310389647">Hoffman, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0959354310389647">Renik, 1993</xref>). This radically personal and “irreducibly intersubjective” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0959354310389647">Zeddies &amp; Richardson, 1999</xref>, p. 582) view of the therapy enterprise is anything but depersonalizing and dogmatic, and would seem to be fairly congenial to what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0959354310389647">Gantt (2000)</xref> calls “suffering-with.” But it also describes—imperfectly, no doubt, but many find helpfully—an interpersonal thicket, a world of “all too human” entanglement, shared subjectivity, and mutual influence that a Levinasian perspective gives very little specific guidance in describing or navigating in an ethical and beneficial manner.</p>
<p>Here is another example. In a rich discussion of the “ethical context of human development,” the theoretical psychologist <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0959354310389647">Vandenberg (1999)</xref> seeks to “cross-pollinate” Levinas’s ideas and research on early human development. Vandenberg gives a brief, compelling overview of Levinas’s thought. He concurs with Levinas that “much of Western philosophy has been structured by Greek concerns with epistemology, rationality, and the pursuit of truth,” the sort of truth that “is achieved through classification, generalization, [and] extracting the essential features of objects and events that endure across points in time” (p. 33). Even Husserl and Heidegger, whose work in the tradition of phenomenology and existentialism Levinas builds on, failed in his view to fully “appreciate the fundamentally social, and therefore ethical nature of human existence.” Rather, “Husserl’s attention to intentionality and Heidegger’s emphasis on ‘mineness’ still presume an isolated, solitary ego that must somehow eventually learn to engage and cooperate with other solitary individuals” (p. 32). By contrast, he argues, Levinas “proposes an alternative approach, emphasizing the importance of the unique existential encounter with others that cannot be reduced (without being destroyed) to an essence.” In this face-to face encounter, we “are in communion with others,” we “have a covenant with them,” and “knowing occurs within this context of interpersonal relatedness and responsibility.” In this context, “ethics is not a category of knowing, it is a condition for knowing” (p. 33).</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0959354310389647">Vandenberg (1999)</xref> summarizes a variety of research findings concerning early human development, arguing—very plausibly, it seems to us—that these findings suggest that infant development takes place in the context of deep human “relationship” and involves profound ethical “responsibility” in ways that a perspective like Levinas’s captures much better than conventional psychological theories. Research indicates, according to Vandenberg, that from “the first moments of life, neonates possess remarkable capacities for perceptual orientation to other people” (p. 37). Quickly, these “earliest social attunements, expressions, and communications” are “elaborated, deepening infants’ interpersonal involvement and exchange” (p. 37). Vandenberg terms this involvement “primary intersubjectivity.” It involves “expressive relational involvements and exchanges,” even though it does not yet involve “self-reflective awareness,” which only comes later (p. 38). Thus, it refers to the same general kind of co-constituted, practical, or ethical understanding among humans that hermeneutic thought, as well, deems more fundamental than explicit representations or scientific knowing.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0959354310389647">Vandenberg (1999)</xref> stresses that research on infancy shows individuals to be not only “bound in an intimate web of interpersonal relatedness,” but also bound in a web of “ethical indebtedness” (p. 40), something that only “deepens with development” (p. 39). He interprets the research to show that caregiving for and communication with infants is inseparable from a keen appreciation for their “irreducible uniqueness” (p. 36), unpredictability, and “ungraspable mystery” (p. 35), without which appreciation—perhaps best called “love” or “a special concern and responsibility for a specific, unique individual”—children languish, appear to grieve, and may even die. The tendency of mainstream social science is to seek “objectivity” and a “separation of fact from value,” in which “[e]thics is separated from and subordinated to epistemology; a category of knowledge rather than a condition of being,” reflected in the use of the term “behavior” (p. 42). However, Vandenberg argues, “[e]thics is not something outside or superordinate to everyday exchanges, nor is it contained in a set of rules or in choices made at moments of crisis. Ethics is immanent in simple acts of communication and caregiving” (p. 40). Thus, human action, he suggests, is “more appropriately considered as ‘conduct’ than ‘behavior’” (p. 42).</p>
<p>In a profound way, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0959354310389647">Vandenberg (1999)</xref> uses Levinas’s ideas of ethics as “first philosophy” and the otherness of “the Other” conceived of as an “absolute other” to break the bonds of a distorting scientism or objectivism and assert the primacy of our ethical relatedness and indebtedness to one another. Such ethics is not one kind of knowledge, set of issues, or subtype of human action among others but a very “condition of being.” Moreover, Vandenberg makes a convincing case that such an account of our ethically imbued “primary intersubjectivity” makes better sense of a wide range of research on infant development and caregiver conduct than a conventional social science view of this research as value-neutral findings concerning a particular segment of human behavior. One can only imagine the benefit that would accrue if such a Levinas-derived philosophy were employed to reinterpret other interesting bodies of research in the human sciences!</p>
<p>However, it seems to us that Levinas’s philosophy has some distinct limitations as a guide for this kind of work. It serves well to drive home the point in a general way, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0959354310389647">Vandenberg (1999)</xref> puts it, that we “cannot escape values, no matter what our stance, revealing the fundamental ethical nature of our conduct” (p. 42). But the Levinasian approach, we have argued—perhaps just in order to protect the primacy of ethics—obscures many facets of human ethical reciprocity and shared subjectivity that would seem to be a key part of the moral life. For example, at one point, Vandenberg asserts, “Infant–caregiver exchanges are asymmetric, as caregivers assume the responsibility for the direction of discourse, guiding infants into appropriate pathways of expression and experience” (p. 40). But he summarizes the results of research showing such exchanges to be anything but asymmetric. They describe, he writes, a situation in which “[c]ooperative engagement, a sense of personal agency, self-awareness, and a greater equality in communicative exchanges, all arise together. So too do new emotions of shame and pride” arise, as part of “increasing communicative complexity marking the appearance of a new deeper appreciation of self in relation with others” (p. 38). If by labeling these exchanges asymmetric, he means to invoke the Levinasian concept of the radical alterity of “the Other” in order to preserve their indelibly ethical character from any sort of reductionism, we suggest once again that this concept is distinctly one-sided and problematically oversimplifies the nature of ethical action.</p>
<p>To give one final example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0959354310389647">Clegg and Slife (2005)</xref> advocate a sophisticated “Levinasian account of relational knowing.” They argue that most of the “methods of psychology are tied to a single, ideologically dogmatic way of conceiving both knowledge and practice” (p. 65), one that enshrines empiricism, prediction and control, instrumental applications, and a quest for certainty as overriding ideals for the field, evidenced in the strength in recent years of the empirically supported treatment (EST) movement, which slavishly and uncritically endorses this ideal. They suggest that Levinas’s defense of the “irreducible singularity of the self” against all “totalizing themes” provides us with a uniquely powerful way of undermining dogmatic scientism and properly appreciating the unique, unpredictable, irreducible human person who cannot be securely grasped or thematized.</p>
<p>There is a tendency on the part of theoretical psychologists who draw on Levinas to contrast his admirable stress on ethics as first philosophy with a ghastly and injurious objectifying social science in an almost Manichean fashion. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0959354310389647">Clegg and Slife (2005)</xref> soften this kind of approach to a significant degree. They cite evidence from <italic>Otherwise than Being or Beyond Essence</italic> and elsewhere in Levinas’s writings suggesting that the inaccessibility of the Other does not mean that the Other</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>is beyond experience (or relation), and thus beyond some form of “knowing.” It only means that it is beyond the realm of the fully articulate. We experience what Levinas calls “proximity” and “caress” in ways that cannot be reduced to theme or consciousness. (p. 70)</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>They add, “The Levinasian account of knowing is, to be sure, non-rational and non-ideological, but it is still an account of knowing. It does not so much disqualify knowing as subjugate it to the ethical” (p. 72). Similarly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0959354310389647">Vandenberg (1999)</xref> asserts that there is a proper place for conventional social science methods and constructs, so long as they do not crowd out ethical experience or reduce it to static essences. He does not, however, indicate what that place is or how we might successfully integrate these two angles of vision on human phenomena. None of us has a fully adequate answer to this question. But it is time to squarely address it, not skirt it in favor of merely reiterating Levinas’s powerful critique.</p>
<p>It seems to us that <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0959354310389647">Clegg and Slife’s (2005)</xref> characterization of the partial unknowability of the Other and the uncertainty that always accompanies it nicely opens the door to a blending or cross-fertilizing of a Levinasian approach with the sort of hermeneutic and Bakhtinian viewpoints outlined above. But the writers reviewed here do not take that step, and it seems badly needed. Their remarks remain cryptic, merely suggestive, and largely negative in the sense that they mainly tell us what the authors think is <italic>not</italic> an appropriate conception of knowing, or what Clegg and Slife term an “ethical epistemology.” It is non-rational and non-ideological, it is not totalizing or reductive, it does not entail a quest for certainty, and yet it is not “beyond experience,” and so forth. We hope to have made the idea plausible that hermeneutic thought, as well as other perspectives, has something to offer in terms of filling in the picture concerning our fundamentally ethical, interdependent, intersubjective human practices and relationships. It seems desirable that theoretical psychologists not rely exclusively or heavily on Levinas’s ideas as a framework for their critiques but, in addition, do the hard work of blending his ideas and other philosophical or social theoretical viewpoints. Otherwise, the limitations of Levinas’s approach will limit or adversely affect their accounts, including the risk of resting content with condemning (or even demonizing) scientism and failing more fully to develop a compelling “ethical epistemology.”</p>

<p>Hermeneutic thinkers argue that
<disp-quote>
<p>if we take off the scientific spectacles that govern our ways of seeing things in high-level reflection, and think about how we actually experience things in everyday life, it is obvious that values and meanings are experienced as “out there” in the world rather than as “in our minds.” What normal person could see a child hit by a car and not feel that something bad had happened right there in the street, not just in somebody’s mind? It is only a highly specialized and profoundly questionable characterization of “reality” that could lead people to doubt the reality of badness, shamefulness, or goodness in the world.
