<title>Introduction:</title>
<p>In adult acquired flatfoot deformity, it is unclear whether the lateral column length shortens with progression of the deformity, whether it is short to begin with, or whether it is short at all. To our knowledge, no previous study has examined the lateral column length of patients with adult acquired flatfoot deformity compared to a control population. The purpose of our study was to compare the lateral column length in patients with and without adult acquired flatfoot deformity to see if there was a significant difference.</p></sec>
<sec id="section2-1071100712465738">
<title>Methods:</title>
<p>The study was a retrospective radiographic review of 2 foot and ankle fellowship-trained orthopaedic surgeons’ patients with adult flatfoot deformity. Our study population consisted of 75 patients, 85 feet (28 male, 57 female) with adult flatfoot deformity with a mean age of 64 (range, 23-93). Our control population consisted of 57 patients and 70 feet (23 male, 47 female) without flatfoot deformity with a mean age of 61 (range, 40-86 years). Weightbearing anteroposterior (AP) and lateral foot radiographs were analyzed for each patient, and the following measurements were made: medial and lateral column lengths, talonavicular uncoverage angle, talus-first metatarsal angle, calcaneal pitch angle, and medial and lateral column heights. An unpaired t test was used to analyze the measurements between the groups. Ten patients’ radiographs were remeasured, and correlation coefficients were obtained to assess the reliability of the measuring techniques.</p></sec>
<sec id="section3-1071100712465738">
<title>Results:</title>
<p>For the flatfoot group, the mean medial and lateral column lengths on the AP radiograph were 108.6 mm and 95.8 mm, respectively; the mean talo-navicular uncoverage angle was 26.2 degrees; and the mean talus-first metatarsal angle was 20.0 degrees. In the control group, the mean medial and lateral column lengths on the AP radiograph were 108.8 mm and 96.5 mm, respectively; the mean talo-navicular uncoverage angle was 8.2 degrees; and the mean talus-first metatarsal angle was 7.7 degrees. On the lateral radiograph in the flatfoot group, the mean medial and lateral column lengths were 167.2 mm and 166.6 mm, respectively; the mean medial and lateral column heights were 16.0 mm and 14.7 mm, respectively; the mean calcaneal pitch angle was 15.6 degrees; and the talus-first metatarsal angle was 10.3 degrees and for the control group, the mean medial and lateral column lengths were 165.3 mm and 163.5 mm, respectively; the mean medial and lateral column heights were 22.8 mm and 13.1 mm, respectively; the mean calcaneal pitch angle was 22.4 degrees; and the talus-first metatarsal angle was −3.6 degrees. None of the differences in measurements for medial and lateral column lengths between the flatfoot and control groups achieved statistical significance. However, statistically significant differences between the 2 groups were observed in the measurements for medial and lateral column heights, talo-navicular uncoverage angle, calcaneal pitch angle, and talus-first metatarsal angle.</p></sec>
<sec id="section4-1071100712465738">
<title>Conclusion:</title>
<p>There is no difference in lateral column lengths between patients with and without adult flatfoot deformity. The perceived shortened lateral column is likely due to forefoot abduction and hindfoot valgus deformities that are associated with adult flatfoot deformity.</p></sec>

<body>
<p>Adult acquired flatfoot deformity is characterized by posterior tibial tendon insufficiency and although the disease process has been studied for several decades, it is still not fully understood. At times, a lateral column lengthening is performed as part of the flatfoot reconstruction surgery.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1071100712465738">6</xref></sup> It is unclear whether the lateral column length shortens with progression of the deformity, whether it is congenitally short, or whether it is short at all compared to individuals without flatfoot deformity. No previous study has analyzed the lateral column lengths of patients with adult flatfoot deformity relative to a control population. The purpose of our study was to compare the lateral column lengths in patients with and without adult acquired flatfoot deformity to see if there was a significant difference. Our hypothesis was that the lengths of the columns would be similar between the two groups.</p>

<title>Materials and Methods</title>
<p>The study is a retrospective radiographic review of 2 foot and ankle fellowship-trained orthopaedic surgeons’ (TPC and DBT) patients with adult acquired flatfoot deformity. The inclusion criteria for the study consisted of patients at least 18 years old with a diagnosis of adult flatfoot deformity. This diagnosis was made by the 2 surgeons based on their clinical examination. Positive findings on physical examination included pain and tenderness over the posterior tibial tendon as well as pain or difficulty with single heel rise along with arch collapse, forefoot abduction, and hindfoot valgus. Patients were screened to ensure they had not had a previous flatfoot reconstruction surgery or history of congenital foot abnormalities or any other surgical procedure on their foot.</p>
<p>A control group consisted of patients at least 18 years old without flatfoot deformity. Patients were excluded from the control group if there was evidence of previous flatfoot reconstructive surgery.</p>
<p>Our study population consisted of 75 patients with 85 feet with adult flatfoot deformity. There were 28 male feet and 57 female feet, and the mean age was 64 years (range, 23-93). Our control population consisted of 57 patients and 70 feet without flatfoot deformity: 23 male feet and 47 female feet with a mean age of 61 years (rage, 40-86).</p>

<title>Statistical Analysis</title>
<p>An unpaired t test was used to compare the measurements between the groups with the <italic>P</italic> value set at .05 for statistical significance. Furthermore, as there was only 1 individual performing the measurements, the reliability was assessed by remeasuring 10 patients’ radiographs, using simple regression, and calculating coefficient of determination (R<sup>2</sup>) values between the 2 sets of measurements.</p>
<p>A power analysis was performed to calculate the necessary sample size with alpha = .05, beta = .10, and power set at 90%. With an average lateral column length of 95 mm and a standard deviation of 8 mm, in order to detect a 5 mm difference, there would need to be 44 feet in both the study and control groups.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Historically, although there have been many studies demonstrating various measurements for the foot, to our knowledge no study has specifically examined and compared the lateral column lengths in patients with adult acquired flatfoot deformity versus those who do not. In his 2005 study, Davids et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1071100712465738">2</xref></sup> elegantly detailed various measurements for the foot that can be consistently reproduced and that were utilized in our study. Moraleda and Mubarak<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1071100712465738">4</xref></sup> analyzed the radiographs of 135 patients with idiopathic flatfoot deformity. These patients were divided according to those who had symptomatic and asymptomatic flatfoot deformity. Among the several measurements that were performed, the ratio between the medial column and lateral column was evaluated and showed no statistically significant difference between the groups.</p>
<p>Our results show that none of the medial or lateral column length measurements, including the new measurement techniques we introduced, were significantly different between the groups. Conversely, statistically significant differences did exist for medial and lateral column heights, talonavicular uncoverage angle, talus-first metatarsal angle, and calcaneal pitch angle between the flatfoot and control groups, showing that the 2 populations were indeed different as expected with this accepted methods of measuring a flatfoot deformity. These findings confirmed Younger’s study<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1071100712465738">7</xref></sup> showing statistically significant differences between adult flatfoot and control populations in talus-first metatarsal angle and calcaneal pitch angles, as well as Arangio’s study<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1071100712465738">1</xref></sup> showing a significant difference in medial column height between the 2 groups.</p>
<p>A lateral column lengthening procedure is commonly performed as a component of the surgical reconstruction for a flatfoot deformity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1071100712465738">6</xref></sup> The typical location of the lengthening is the anterior process of the calcaneus with an Evan’s procedure or a calcaneocuboid distraction arthrodesis. Other medial column shortening procedures have been described in the pediatric literature. Since this procedure significantly improves these various radiographic parameters, intuitively it would seem that we are lengthening a short or shortened lateral column; in reality, our study indicates that it is in fact lengthening a normal-sized lateral bony column of the foot. Most likely, the perceived short lateral column is due to the forefoot abduction and hindfoot valgus deformities that are part of the flatfoot deformity. Therefore, the lateral column procedure is actually lengthening a normally sized lateral border of the foot to correct the forefoot abduction deformity, which we believe is likely due to ligamentous attenuation through structures such as the spring ligament.</p>
<p>Our study was limited by the fact that it is a retrospective radiographic review. We measured the entire medial and lateral column length on the lateral view but only from the transverse tarsal joint and distal on the AP view since the posterior aspect of the talus and calcaneus was not well visualized on the AP view. CT scans may have provided more accurate measurements but were beyond the scope of the present study. The study by Pehlivan et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1071100712465738">5</xref></sup> compared the talus-first metatarsal angle and calcaneal pitch angle between symptomatic and asymptomatic flatfeet and showed a statistically significant correlation between a larger talus-first metatarsal angle and symptomatic flatfoot deformity. As an extension of this work, a future study could prospectively follow individuals with adult acquired flatfoot deformity to evaluate which changes radiographically correspond with increasing symptoms. Also, it would be worthwhile to compare these measurements in flatfoot patients preoperatively and after surgical correction to assess how they change. In their study, Haeseker et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1071100712465738">3</xref></sup> found a statistically significant improvement in talus-first metatarsal angle and talonavicular coverage angle between preoperative and postoperative flatfoot patients; however, they did not analyze other measurements such as medial and lateral column lengths and heights. Also, our study was performed on radiographs of patients that had not undergone surgery and our measurement techniques may be more difficult to use in the postoperative setting. Other topics worthy of consideration include assessing whether there are any compensatory effects or changes that result from lengthening what was previously believed to be a short lateral column.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>We found no difference in lateral column lengths between patients with and without adult flatfoot deformity. The perceived shortened lateral column is likely due to forefoot abduction and hindfoot valgus deformities that are associated with adult flatfoot deformity due to ligamentous attrition. It may be worthwhile for future studies to evaluate preoperative and postoperative flatfoot patients to evaluate which measurements changed and whether there were any compensatory adjustments from lengthening a normally sized lateral column.</p>
