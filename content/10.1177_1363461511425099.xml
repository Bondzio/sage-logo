<abstract>
<p>People with lived experience of dual diagnosis face specific challenges in that they have struggled with both severe mental illness and substance use disorder simultaneously. I conducted a 6-year ethnographic study with poor African Americans with lived experience of dual diagnosis in Washington, DC, to assess barriers and facilitators to recovery. In this paper, I analyze the relationship between religion and recovery. I set out to answer two research questions: (a) What is the self-identified role of religious commitment and activity in participants’ recovery from dual diagnosis? (b) What (if any) religious activities, notions, and resources are positively harnessed to enhance recovery? I found high levels of Christian religiosity among participants. Participants perceived their ongoing recovery as a process reliant upon (a) an intimate and personal relationship with God, and (b) engagement in certain core private religious activities, most notably prayer, reading of scripture, and listening to religiously inspired radio, television, or music. Participants’ religiosity was underpinned by a Pauline theology of transformation and reconciliation. Psychiatric services serving an African American clientele with lived experience of dual diagnosis may increase effectiveness by better harnessing client religiosity to assist recovery.</p>

<sec id="sec1-1363461511425099" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title>
<p>Approximately 50% of people with severe mental illness in the United States also have a co-occurring substance use disorder (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1363461511425099">Kessler, 2004</xref>). This is commonly known as “dual diagnosis” in the field of psychiatry. People with lived experience of dual diagnosis face specific challenges in that they are struggling to live with, or recover from, both severe mental illness and substance use disorder simultaneously. One of the abiding insights of decades of work on dual diagnosis is that these challenges significantly supersede and surpass those faced by people living with a single diagnosis of either severe mental illness or substance use disorder alone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1363461511425099">Drake &amp; Mueser, 2000</xref>). People with lived experience of dual diagnosis have elevated rates of homelessness, comorbid physical conditions (such as HIV infection), criminal justice issues, trauma, and other negative outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1363461511425099">Drake &amp; Wallach, 2000</xref>). As such, they comprise a discrete subpopulation of people with mental health difficulties and deserve singular attention from both researchers and mental health services (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1363461511425099">Drake, McLaughlin, Pepper, &amp; Minkoff, 1991</xref>). Researchers cannot simply extrapolate knowledge from studies conducted on those living with a single diagnosis of either severe mental illness or substance use disorder to people living with dual diagnosis.</p>
<p>That said, there are some commonalities that span the whole range of psychiatric disorders present in the population. One of these is the notion of “recovery.” Most definitions of recovery converge to emphasize positive individual transformation in various psychosocial domains. Factors identified as important in the process of recovery include work, social functioning, housing, and community integration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1363461511425099">Anthony, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1363461511425099">Becker &amp; Drake, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1363461511425099">Deegan, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1363461511425099">Padgett, 2007</xref>). One of the most widely utilized definitions of recovery comes from the U.S. Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration: “mental health recovery is a journey of healing and transformation, enabling a person with a mental health problem to live a meaningful life in a community of his or her choice while striving to achieve his or her full potential” (U.S. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1363461511425099">Department of Health and Human Services Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, 2004</xref>). Consumer organizations, researchers, policy makers, and national governments around the world have recently enthusiastically embraced the notion of recovery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1363461511425099">Davidson, Rakfeldt, &amp; Strauss, 2010</xref>). In the United States, the influential President’s <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1363461511425099">New Freedom Commission on Mental Health (2003)</xref> prioritizes the importance of recovery for people diagnosed with mental illness in the USA, including those with a co-occurring substance use disorder.</p>
<p>As indicated by the definitions above, which emphasize “healing” and “transformation,” the recovery movement in mental health is much more holistic and person-centered (rather than disease-centered) than previous paradigms that emphasized “continuing care,” “coping,” or “medication stabilization” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1363461511425099">Berwick, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1363461511425099">Mezzich, 2007</xref>). Key stakeholders, including researchers, mental health advocacy groups, and many progressive clinicians, all agree that recovery can only be enhanced by professionals if their interventions are principally nondirective and person-centered. This often means harnessing the individual’s moral resources and exploiting their social ecology to facilitate recovery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1363461511425099">Kleinman, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>One domain that has been underresearched vis-à-vis recovery from dual diagnosis is that of religion. This may be surprising given that a growing body of research converges to suggest that religiosity is a protective factor across the natural history of mental illness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1363461511425099">Koenig, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1363461511425099">Koenig &amp; Cohen, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1363461511425099">Levin, 1996</xref>). Other research suggests that religiosity is a significantly influential psychological and social resource for coping with the adverse consequences of persistent mental illness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1363461511425099">Tepper, Rogers, Coleman, &amp; Maloni, 2001</xref>). Investigating the relationship between religion and recovery from dual diagnosis is of paramount importance for various reasons. As stated, the recovery paradigm is a new development in psychiatry, and emphasizes the harnessing of individual and communal sociomoral resources to enhance psychiatric rehabilitation through healing and transformation. Recovery is more than just keeping people with dual diagnosis medically stabilized and out of psychiatric hospital. It is about leading a meaningful and fulfilling life in the community, and making a positive contribution to kith and kin, and society (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1363461511425099">Anthony, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1363461511425099">Deegan, 1996</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1363461511425099">1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1363461511425099">Mancini, Hardiman, &amp; Lawson, 2005</xref>). Though there has been a modest amount of work on religion and mental health, a review of the literature suggests that very few studies have focused on populations living with dual diagnosis, and none have done so in the context of the increasingly important recovery paradigm.</p>
<p>The generic work on religion and mental health suggests that religiosity can play a role in enhancing recovery from dual diagnosis, especially among marginalized groups such as low-income urban African Americans. Indeed, evidence suggests that marginalized groups such as African Americans may turn to religion and its institutions because of actual and felt alienation from formal mainstream institutions such as the public mental health system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1363461511425099">Neighbors, Musick, &amp; Williams, 1998</xref>). It has been argued that the Black Church (formerly known as the Negro Church) and African American religiosity are key factors determining thriving and well-being in the African American community (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1363461511425099">Frazier, 1974</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1363461511425099">Levin, Taylor, &amp; Chatters, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1363461511425099">Lincoln, 1974</xref>). This may be especially so for those in so-called “double jeopardy,” such as low-income African Americans with dual diagnosis.</p>
<p>In the present paper, I explore the role of religion in recovery among a sample of low-income African Americans with lived experience of dual diagnosis. Given the lack of literature on religion and recovery from dual diagnosis among African Americans, an exploratory qualitative approach was taken. Two broad research questions were formulated, propelled by certain key debates in the literature on religiosity and mental health. While much research suggests that religiosity is a significant buffer and coping mechanism in mental illness, it is unclear which aspects of religiosity are most significant. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1363461511425099">Allport (1950</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1363461511425099">1958</xref>) made a distinction between “interiorized” and “institutionalized” religiosity. Institutionalized religiosity refers to active participation in a religious congregation, whereas interiorized religiosity refers to religious belief that is practiced in a more quiet and private fashion. It has been argued that institutionalized religion is the more important of the two, mainly because it provides protective social support and social networks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1363461511425099">Ellison &amp; Levin, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1363461511425099">Pescosolido &amp; Georgianna, 1989</xref>). However, it is unclear which precise activities, notions, and resources under the umbrella term “religion” are protective, and to what extent, for people with mental health diagnoses generally, and more specifically for those with lived experience of dual diagnosis. From a practical point of view, it is important to delineate which (if any) religious activities, notions, and resources are important for people with dual diagnosis in order to strategize appropriate interventions or supportive polices. Given this situation, the two research questions were formulated as follows: (a) What is the self-identified role of religious commitment and activity in participants’ recovery from dual diagnosis? (b) What religious activities, notions, and resources are positively harnessed by participants to enhance recovery?</p></sec>
<sec id="sec2-1363461511425099" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title>
<p>This paper is based on data collected as part of an ongoing qualitative study of recovery and community integration for people with lived experience of dual diagnosis in Washington, DC. Participants were sampled from the clientele of Community Connections, a large mental health services agency in Washington, DC. This agency, whose services are funded by Medicaid, treats low-income people with severe mental illness (e.g., schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, bipolar disorder, and major depression). The vast majority of clients at this agency have a history of homelessness, trauma, and/or a co-occurring substance use disorder. Most would be considered among the most vulnerable members of society, subsisting on state benefits and suffering from ongoing socioeconomic marginalization. Over 90% of the clientele at this agency are African American, and most are women.</p>
<p>The participants in this study were all living in small-scale congregate housing sites provided by the agency in various neighborhoods of Washington, DC. In order to obtain housing in these sites, clients had to make a written commitment to lead an abstemious lifestyle (with 6 months preceding “clean time”) and also agree to live by agency-defined recovery principles. These include factors such as helping one another and creating a “safe space” through appropriate behavior and activity. For the present study, all clients living in the small-scale recovery housing were made aware of the research by their case managers. All were invited to attend the regular focus groups conducted by the author, or to speak individually with the author in private. They were given the choice to participate as often or as little as they desired. It is important to note that religiosity was not part of the inclusion criteria for this study.</p>
<p>Research activities consisted of focus groups and participant observation, conducted between August 2005 to the present. Over 40 focus groups, following guidelines set down by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1363461511425099">Krueger (1994)</xref>, were conducted at approximately 4-month intervals, lasting approximately 1 to 2 hours. Focus groups were held at the housing units; either in a spare apartment, a common room, or in a current resident’s apartment. The author, assisted by well-trained graduate students, facilitated the focus groups. Focus groups followed a topic guide, created by the author based on literature review and discussion with colleagues, as a means to access the lived experience of recovery from participants’ perspective. Open questions probed for which factors were facilitating or impeding recovery. Issues arising spontaneously from earlier focus groups were followed up in later focus groups for elaboration. Focus groups were recorded onto audio files and transcribed verbatim for later analysis. On average, approximately 8–12 people attended each focus group. The author also conducted participant observation at around the same time as each focus group, following guidelines set down by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1363461511425099">Spradley (1980)</xref>. In order to build up an intimate knowledge of participants’ lives and to engage in informal conversation, I spent time regularly eating with participants, walking around the neighborhood with them, accompanying them on everyday activities, and taking them for lunch at a local restaurant. I also lived in an on-site housing unit for up to 2 weeks at a time. Data from focus groups and participant observation were brought together in a complementary fashion. For example, if a participant noted in a focus group that a particular church was important, the author would attempt to visit that church with a participant during participant observation.</p>
<p>All data analysis was conducted inductively, propelled by guidelines of qualitative thematic analysis involving the progressive abstraction of themes from raw data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1363461511425099">Strauss &amp; Corbin, 1990</xref>). Specifically, the author reflected on his field experience by reading and rereading field notes and focus group transcriptions. This was done manually as well as in ATLAS.ti qualitative software (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1363461511425099">Muhr, 1997</xref>). For the purposes of this paper, the author extracted all data judged relevant to religion through separate searches in ATLAS.ti. This extracted data was printed and then subjected to a close textual analysis by the author, who critically interrogated it in order to answer the two research questions posed in the study.</p>
<p>The author engaged in three methods regarded as rigorous checks on validity and reliability: respondent validation, triangulation, and multiple coding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1363461511425099">Barbour &amp; Barbour, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1363461511425099">Whitley &amp; Crawford, 2005</xref>). First, the author discussed provisional conclusions from the paper with study participants during a visit to the study site in April 2010. These participants generally agreed with the conclusions presented. This method is known as respondent validation, or member checking. Second, the author engaged in methodological triangulation, combining the data from focus groups and participant observation to cross-check results. Third, the author engaged in multiple coding, a qualitative form of interrater reliability, by asking a well-trained research assistant to independently code the data on recovery and religiosity. There was a high degree of correspondence between the author’s and the research assistant’s coding schemas.</p>
<p>A total of approximately 50 residents have participated in the research. Approximately 45 were African Americans and 40 were women. The aim of such an approach is to identify common collective patterns of belief, attitudes and experience, rather than the specific tracking of individual trajectories. After a complete description of the study was given to participants, informed consent was obtained at the beginning of the research. Participants were compensated $20 for each focus group attended. The Dartmouth Medical School Institutional Review Board reviewed and approved the study.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec3-1363461511425099" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title>
<p>As this is a qualitative study, we did not formally measure religiosity using a quantitative instrument. However through analysis of transcripts it would appear that at least half of the participants sampled professed a strong form of theistic belief, whereas many others subscribed to a weaker form of spirituality. No one self-declared as atheist and no one declared an antireligious attitude, or challenged other participants’ religiosity during focus groups. Religious declarations in focus groups were overwhelmingly met with respectful nods and encouraging gestures from those with little to say about religion.</p>
<p>Almost all participants were of a Christian confession, though two occasionally practiced aspects of Buddhism. Participants were mostly of a generic Protestant orientation, coming from Baptist, Methodist, Jehovah’s Witness, and Pentecostal backgrounds, among others. However, they made little reference to denominational or sectarian affiliation. Their theistic references were made both explicitly and implicitly, with little prompting from the author as researcher.</p>
<p>For the remainder of the results, I highlight and comment upon some of the common religious activities and notions used by the religiously inclined participants when talking about their recovery. Specifically, I devote the results to three themes that emerged from the data and answer the research questions posed in the study. First, I explore the perceived role of God in enhancing recovery. Second, I explore the role of specific religious activities and their impact on recovery. Third, I examine theological notions deployed by religiously inclined participants in their understanding of the process of recovery. All quotes are verbatim, and some characteristics of participants have been altered to protect anonymity. It should also be noted at this stage that participants hardly distinguished between recovery from substance use disorder and recovery from severe mental illness. They perceived this as largely a unitary process where both are so closely intertwined they are rendered almost indistinguishable.</p>
<sec id="sec4-1363461511425099"><title>God or religion?</title>
<p>As stated in the introduction, one of the key questions in the literature on mental health and religion is the role of interiorized versus institutionalized religion. What was most striking in the data is that participants made frequent and unprompted references to God, the overwhelming religious notion (or being) referred to in the study. God was referred to much more frequently than were churches, ministers, priests, and religious institutions per se. In other words, God was the primary religious factor identified by participants as an agent of change in their lives. Churches, ministers, and the like were considered secondary and tertiary factors in relation to the overwhelming agentic power of God. This suggests that for the religiously inclined participants with lived experience of dual diagnosis, interiorized religion is reported as more important than exteriorized. This finding is also contrary to the belief that the main benefit of religion comes from the social support and networks offered by involvement in a religious congregation. Participants talked about the (sometimes very intimate) personal relationship they had with God as the most important thing in their life. This can be seen in the following quotation, in which the participant is effervescent in praise for the transformative role God has played in her life. This participant is a middle-aged African American woman who had been addicted to heroin and admitted to sharing needles:<disp-quote>
<p>Sometimes, I get filled up; because, he has just been so good. You know. He has given me chance, after chance, after chance, you know. And, he spared my life. Sometimes, I say “why me.” A lot of people who have come up in this lifestyle, they are no longer here, they are dead. You know. They are dead, or they are in really bad shape. I am not HIV positive. I know that it’s true to God. I know. You know, and I just love him so much, I really do. Sometime, I just sit up in my apartment. I just listen to gospel music, and I just cry, and I say “Thank you, God.”</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>Belief in the power of God to help people overcome involvement in substance abuse and to sustain an abstemious lifestyle was very frequently proclaimed among religiously inclined participants. Many of these participants gave examples of how they and others had overcome substance abuse through God’s perceived intervention. This is encapsulated in the following interaction between two focus group participants in the study. These participants are both middle-aged African American women who struggled with substance abuse when younger, but have since made progress in recovery:<disp-quote>
<p>A: I have been clean for about five years. Thank God. I has [sic] asked him to take from me the desire to use. And, I have been OK. You know. I have really been OK. This has been the longest I have stayed off drugs. And, it just stops. I have stayed clean for a year or two by myself, but I am very grateful today, that I have come a long way.</p>
<p>B: Well. God is in charge. God is in charge. I can’t do nothing, without him. Even, when I thought it was me. When I think of all the situations that I got myself into. Trust me. It was him that got me out of. You know. I put him first, and foremost, in all that I do. In everything that I do, you know, what I am saying. It’s all about him. For him I live and for him I die.</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>For many participants, God is described as an omnipresent being who personally and irresistibly intrudes into the human situation. God is variously considered a life-giver, a friend, a moral guide, a partner, a listening ear, and a comforter. This is sometimes described in very personal and intimate terms, as by a young African American woman:<disp-quote>
<p>God is the only thing keeping me alive. That I am not committing suicide. I get tired and God keeps me where I am focused. He don’t let me get to the point, where I am so depressed and if I do, he is there with me. I can count on him. You know. I can talk to God. I can pray, and can feel so comforted. You know, and I calm down. But, I have to pray. I pray and cry. But, like I say I go to sleep with God… I wake up with him.</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>Whilst accompanying participants in daily neighborhood routines, I was often taken past “storefront” churches that were previously mentioned in focus groups. These are small, often independent churches unaligned to a “mainstream” denomination commonly found in African American neighborhoods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1363461511425099">Lincoln, 1974</xref>). Participants would often explain the importance of these churches in the community, and how the presence of such churches is comforting, even though they did not attend them. As such, God, rather than congregational participation, was considered the principal religious ingredient of recovery. As one middle-aged African American woman stated,<disp-quote>
<p>I don’t go to church, but my faith in God is strong. I been praying to the Lord for so long, and without Him I’d a known I’d a-been dead to this day. You know, committing suicide so many times, waking up I was scared… but with God, I pray, the inner peace I have now. I have an inner peace, and knowing that everything in his hands going to be all right. And I trust him, trust him to, and there is nothing I can’t talk to him about, that he won’t answer me, that I feel my spiritualism [sic] has a lot to do with my recovery, without it, it is like no foundation. No foundation. That is the foundations of my recovery.</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>Perceived religious impact on recovery was much greater than obtaining social support from a congregation. This challenges an oft-cited confound in the study of religiosity and health, i.e., that the instrumental and emotional support received in congregations is not readily available to those (overwhelmingly the nonreligious) who do not attend places of worship (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1363461511425099">Ellison &amp; Levin, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1363461511425099">Pescosolido &amp; Georgianna, 1989</xref>). It may therefore be more accurate to describe the participants as theistic, rather than religious, as church attendance was relatively infrequent in the sample.</p></sec></sec>
<sec id="sec5-1363461511425099"><title>The means of grace: Religious activities and perceived impact on recovery</title>
<p>I have already stated that a personal and ongoing relationship with God was considered the primary religious facilitator of recovery in this sample. This stood above and independent of congregational participation and church affiliation. That said, religiously inclined participants engaged in various specific activities that allowed them to encounter God, thus enhancing coping and recovery. The most common activities in this regard were church involvement, private prayer, private devotional reading, Bible study, cultivating relationships with other religious people, and listening to sermons/religious music on TV or radio. Below is an extract from a focus group in which two middle-aged church-going African American participants discuss their church attendance and the meaning and benefit it brings them:<disp-quote>
<p>A: I have been going to church. When you want to feel closer to the supreme being that there is, and by going there, and all of the times I have attended church, I feel like I have learned something when I have gone there, from scriptures that, maybe, I didn’t know before. I have always felt good to hear the choir sing, and it’s really a nice atmosphere going to church. As a child, we had to go to Sunday school, every Sunday. It was almost like a routine, like you go to school five days a week, and Sunday, you go to Sunday school. But, if you wanted to go outside to play, you better go to Sunday school, or there was no going out to go to play.</p>
<p>B: I go to another church that I have gone to on and off for twenty years. When I have gone there, recently, people recognize me. And, there will be a sense of fellowship, like they will say, “where have you been?” It has been like two years, and, I have been like a year. The minister was also very welcoming, and that just kind of make you feel warm inside, and it does make you feel better.</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>As can be seen in this exchange, church attendance is perceived by participants as imparting intellectual, emotional, and social benefits. The participants learn something at church, enjoy the music and the welcome, and feel a sense of fellowship with others.</p>
<p>Other activities described by participants included Bible study groups and Alcoholics Anonymous meetings. In the following extract, two middle-aged African American men talk about the importance of these activities. The first participant had previously declared that he goes to a Bible study group once a week, while the other regularly attended Alcoholics Anonymous meetings:<disp-quote>
<p>A: And one of the things I have been learning by going to the Bible study on the corner, and AA, is finding yourself, your spiritual guidance. So, that is what has really been making me stay sane, taking my medication and a good night’s rest, eating properly. Other than that, I don’t know what would happen. We might have to dial 911 again. I am working with one of the deacons at church, and he has been doing a very good job working with me, along with some of the other deacons there, you see. And, he said, if I keep coming, I can get better. So, if he can see that in me, I can see it in myself. Because, I look at myself, I see my reflection; but, someone else could see something different. So, let me try to find the reflection they see.</p>
<p>B: I haven’t had the urge to do any drug since 1994. I went to AA meetings; it was really like getting back to my religion. That has really grounded me. Like, I said, most of my family is Jehovah’s Witness. And, I used to study a lot when I was real young; but like I said, it is really religion is what I believe in. I am going to go to all the meetings; but, I am starting to go again. Like I said, I don’t have any urge right then to drink, smoke, or do anything. That is what I said in 1994. So, I am just hoping that something don’t change.</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>To conclude this section, it is worth remarking on related data gathered through participant observation. Many of the participants’ homes I visited were adorned with religious symbolism, including crosses, religious mosaics, statuettes, and framed texts of prayers (or scripture) hanging on the wall. The latter was most commonly the well-known Serenity Prayer, attributed to Reinhold Niebuhr, often recited at the beginning of Alcoholic Anonymous meetings: “Lord, give me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change, the courage to change the things I can, and the wisdom to know the difference.” The few books on participants’ bookshelves were invariably devotional texts or religious tomes. I would also frequently hear gospel music and sermons in people’s homes, either from radio or from CD/cassette recordings. Many participants prayed a silent or spoken grace before meals I shared with them. These domestic activities could be considered a religious devotion in itself, perhaps representing an attempt to remind the participant of God’s eternal presence.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec6-1363461511425099"><title>Theological notions deployed to understand recovery</title>
<p>In analyzing participants’ discourse and practices surrounding God and religion, it became clear that they adhere to a traditional Pauline theology, though this was never explicitly stated. In Pauline theology, it is posited that man is separated from God through evil forces and sin. Man can only be transformed through Christ, who can renew and reconcile the fractured relationship between God and man. This is an ongoing process, which can be deepened through faith and participation in the means of grace, as described above. This leads to a transformed and reconciled self who is then in a position to praise and give thanks to God, conducting a more godly and holy life.</p>
<p>Among participants, this understanding was deployed in a narrative fashion, providing a framework for the range of positive and negative states and events they experienced. Participants also located their own personal struggles in the context of a wider struggle between good and evil. For example, they often referred to substances such as crack-cocaine and alcohol as manifestations of devilish evil, which could only be confronted with the help of God. One participant said that “crack…become[s] your God,” while another stated that “it’s a demon.” The quote below, from an African American woman in recovery, encapsulates how crack-cocaine was often perceived by participants in quasicosmic terms:<disp-quote>
<p>I said how cunning it [crack-cocaine] is. It is not alcohol, so it is not easily to defeat. And so many people it has destroyed. But you cannot do it on your own. Me and her [pointing] go to church, you have to have God with you to fight that. There is nothing you can do for yourself. Some say, I am going to do it myself; cause there is nothing you can do for yourself. You turn to God to help you on this. And without Him you can’t do it.</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>Here, words such as “cunning” and “defeat” are associated with the unbridled intrusion and effect of crack-cocaine on the lives of people exposed. It is an omnipotent and evil force in the external environment that can devour those who partake. Like those of other participants, this quote indicates how the power to overcome evil is perceived to be located in God, and to a lesser extent, the church.</p>
<p>Consistent with mainstream Christian theology, participants narrated the reality and potential of divinely inspired transformation as they journey through life. Such transformation was often voiced in terms of reconciliation with God. Participants tended to anchor such positive change in religious and moral, rather than psychological, processes. Specifically, faith and trust in God, and the perceived intervention of God during the life course, was mentioned frequently as a positive driver of change, and ultimately recovery. God was considered to work in and through participants, giving them (in the words of the “serenity prayer,” often recited to me), “serenity to accept the things I cannot change, the courage to change the things I can, and the wisdom to know the difference.” Participants reported that new life is breathed into them through the perceived intervention of God. This transformation is considered an active cause (and consequence) of recovery among participants. The individual’s reconciliation with God and processes of recovery are seen as mutually reinforcing. This is exemplified in the following interaction among participants in a focus group of African American men and women of various ages:<disp-quote>
<p>A: I think the major thing that we can say in our recovery is that we finally understand the meaning of the Serenity Prayer. “Change the things you can. Accept the ones you can’t and have the wisdom to know the difference.”</p>
<p>B: We have lived this long. We’re not glad about some of the bad experiences we’ve had. We’re not always happy about the way we have perceived things in our minds and stuff. And there are a lot of things that people actually did to us, okay?</p>
<p>ALL: That’s right.</p>
<p>B: But, we got to the point now we’re going to read that like, “Let go and let God.”</p>
<p>ALL: Amen.</p>
<p>A: That’s in the past. We want people to judge us for what we are today. What we try to be, what we want to be, and we have those in mind and that’s the good thing about it. We are able to do that now. We weren’t able to do that back then. We are in a position now, where we stable enough to learn about our mental illness, drug addiction and whatever.</p>
<p>C: We are dealing with it. That’s all it is. Coping. We had to learn coping skills. A lot of people go through these things but they know how to cope with it better than we did. So, we have learned as we got older, lessons in life that we have learned and I thank God, for today.</p>
<p>ALL: Amen.</p>
<p>A: We can’t change people and they can’t change us so we just have to accept that. But there are other things that we can change. But we have to know, we have to have the wisdom to change, with ourselves, with our relationships, with other people, community. We got to have the wisdom to know which ones we can change. That is what the Serenity Prayer is about.</p></disp-quote></p></sec>
<sec id="sec7-1363461511425099" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title>
<p>A large number of participants in this study expressed their basic ontology within a Christian worldview. Religiously inclined participants stated that their faith in God, and God’s transformative power, pulled them away from substance abuse and sustained their recovery from dual diagnosis. This is consistent with the few other qualitative studies involving African Americans, where spirituality, religion, and theism were self-identified as facilitators to recovery from dual diagnosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1363461511425099">Davis &amp; O’Neill, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1363461511425099">Harris, Fallot, &amp; Berley, 2005</xref>). It should be reiterated that for most Christians in this sample, the direct influence of God, rather than the mediated influence of institutions such as the church, was considered the active religious agent of recovery. This runs counter to the theory that the active beneficial ingredients of religiosity vis-à-vis mental health are social supports and social networks arising from congregational participation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1363461511425099">Pescosolido &amp; Georgianna, 1989</xref>). The strong and intimate personal relationship with God was deepened by the regular conduct of certain religious activities, known theologically as “the means of grace.” Whereas prayer was the most common, these activities also included devotional readings, listening to gospel music, cultivating relationships with other religious individuals, and contemplating sermons on TV or radio.</p>
<p>As stated in the introduction, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1363461511425099">Allport (1950</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1363461511425099">1958</xref>) made a distinction between interiorized and institutionalized religiosity. The predominant form of religiosity in my sample was on the interiorized end of the spectrum, matching in some respects the “religionless Christianity” espoused by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1363461511425099">Bonhoeffer (1944/1953)</xref>. Still, a minority of participants did attend church, Bible study, Alcoholics Anonymous meetings, and other congregational meetings. These meetings deepened their faith and helped provide them with social support and a sense of fellowship.</p>
<p>In analyzing the data, it became clear that the Christian worldview (and concomitant activities) espoused by religiously inclined participants provides what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1363461511425099">Antonovsky (1987)</xref>, building on <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1363461511425099">Durkheim (1912/2001)</xref>, famously labeled a “sense of coherence.” There were few contradictions or doubts in the minds of these participants regarding God and their faith therein. On the contrary, these participants made a clear link between their belief and faith in God, devotional practices, and ethics, and their own recovery. This was especially illustrated in their discourse regarding living an abstemious lifestyle, and was perceived by them as an ethical stance founded on God’s intervention and power.</p>
<p>Common terms used by participants in the context of undeniable suffering and distress included feeling “grounded” and having found “peace.” A Christian worldview and perceived contact with the numinous does not magically dispel suffering among this sample, but rather contextualizes it and inscribes it with constructive meaning. In line with Pauline theology, some of the participants in this study interpreted their past and present suffering as a positive transforming experience that builds perseverance, character, and hope—virtues often mentioned as synonymous with recovery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1363461511425099">Anthony, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1363461511425099">Deegan, 1996</xref>). This process exemplifies the narrative shaping of human experience, with religion imparting meaning and an organizing framework to a life course that involves periods of intense suffering and abandonment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1363461511425099">Biehl, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1363461511425099">Kleinman, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>The results of this study suggest that, from the vantage point of participants, a personal relationship with God and concomitant devotional activity are strong facilitators of recovery from dual diagnosis. This is consistent with wider literature discussed in the introduction suggesting that religiosity has a generic salutogenic effect in terms of primary, secondary, and tertiary prevention, among the general population per se, but also specifically among African Americans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1363461511425099">Koenig, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1363461511425099">Koenig &amp; Cohen, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1363461511425099">Levin, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1363461511425099">Levin et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1363461511425099">Neighbors et al., 1998</xref>). As such, the results warrant some degree of speculation about implications for services.</p>
<sec id="sec8-1363461511425099"><title>Clinical implications</title>
<p>It is known that African Americans suffer considerable disparities in the U.S. mental health system. They are less likely to engage with mental health services, more likely to drop out once engaged, and more likely to be dissatisfied with any treatment received (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1363461511425099">Institute of Medicine, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1363461511425099">Surgeon-General, 2001</xref>). Many factors contribute to these inequities, including poverty, ingrained socioeconomic marginalization, the legacy of Jim Crow laws, and institutional racism within medicine itself. While I acknowledge the importance of these macrolevel factors, they were not the focus of the present study. However, this study can make a contribution to the debate over meso-level factors such as cultural competence in mental health services, a critical variable in engaging and retaining minority patients in the mental health system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1363461511425099">Whitley, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>Many studies have shown the tragic results that follow when the culture of the clinic does not adequately incorporate or integrate the culture of the community being served. This usually has a hugely detrimental impact on service utilization, engagement, and adherence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1363461511425099">Fadiman, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1363461511425099">Frank, 1961</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1363461511425099">Gone, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1363461511425099">Young 1995</xref>). These studies suggest that the organizational culture and personal beliefs of staff are often antithetical to the culture of the community and personal beliefs of clients. If promoting recovery means harnessing the individual’s moral resources and exploiting their social ecology in order to facilitate progress, religion must be meaningfully incorporated into services and treatment in settings serving an African-American clientele.</p>
<p>How is this to be done? At a basic level, mental health services and individual clinicians need to ensure a safe space (both interpersonally and at the level of the treatment provider) where client-expressed religiosity is taken very seriously. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1363461511425099">Koenig (2008)</xref> argues that a psychiatrist can respectfully and successfully address a patient’s religious needs by conducting the following five activities: (a) taking a spiritual history; (b) respecting and supporting spiritual beliefs; (c) challenging beliefs; (d) praying with patients; and (e) consultation with clergy. The results of the present study suggest that if these actions were taken with many in the sample, clinicians could harness the individual’s relationship with God and their devotional activities to help them achieve their self-identified recovery goals.</p>
<p>In a patient-centered service, these activities should be proactive and encouraging, as well as reactive. In other words, clinicians should take the lead in inquiring about religious beliefs, and encourage those aspects that might be therapeutic or successful coping mechanisms for the religiously inclined patient (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1363461511425099">Pargament, Koenig, &amp; Perez, 2000</xref>). However, incorporating religion into mental health services consists of more than optimizing the doctor–patient interaction. It also refers to reorientations at the level of the service provider. Mental health service providers can weave religion into their core activities, or partner with religious bodies (and ministers) to engage and retain religiously inclined patients. This could involve the formation of spiritual reading groups, or peer prayer groups. It could involve making chaplains readily available, deploying them reactively and proactively to support patients. It could also involve celebrating key events in the liturgical calendar (for example Christmas), rather than ignoring their existence. Indeed, throughout history, mental health providers that have actively attempted to incorporate religious programs into their daily activities have reported much success (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1363461511425099">Davidson et al., 2010</xref>). A recent well-documented example is Hope Haven in Iowa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1363461511425099">Bussema &amp; Bussema, 2000</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1363461511425099">2007</xref>). Such clinics could serve as encouraging exemplars to others wishing to better integrate religion into service provision. Of course, providing some of these services will simply extend choice; patients still retain the decision about whether or not to utilize religious programs, or discuss religious issues with clinicians. Indeed the creation of a “safe space” for the discussion of religion must <italic>ipso facto</italic> include the safety to say “no” for those who do not want to discuss religion or utilize religiously oriented programs. Given that choice is also a cornerstone of recovery and recovery-oriented practice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1363461511425099">Deegan 1996</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1363461511425099">1997</xref>), extending such choice would be in alignment with the wider ideals of the recovery movement.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec9-1363461511425099"><title>Limitations</title>
<p>The present study was conducted in one city (Washington, DC) and focused upon one ethno-racial group comprised predominantly of women. The sample size was small. Whereas the in-depth qualitative method increased the internal validity of the study, the author makes no strong claims regarding external validity. I have argued that a religious worldview predominates in a substantial number of these African American participants and that this has a profound and positive impact upon recovery. However, its impact may vary by factors such as geography, class, gender, and illness experience. Caution is advised in extrapolating the results of this study.</p></sec></sec>
<sec id="sec10-1363461511425099" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Any mental health clinic that claims to be recovery-centered needs to assess the culture of the community it serves and to work with the moral resources and social ecology of that culture to facilitate recovery. It may be relatively easy to provide bilingual services in Spanish and English as part of being “culturally competent.” However, integrating religious matters into clinics may be more problematic. There is an obvious need for future research and action that integrates mental illness, religious worldviews, and experience of mental health services. Failure to promote or harness religiosity among marginalized groups such as poor African Americans for salutogenic ends may represent an ongoing missed opportunity for those committed to reducing health disparities in the USA. Action in this regard may help redress persisting ethno-racial inequalities in mental health.</p></sec>
