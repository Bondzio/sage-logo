<p><italic>The Quest for the Historical Satan</italic></p>
<p>Miguel A. De La Torre and Albert Hernández</p>
<p>Minneapolis: Fortress, 2011. 248 pp. $20.00</p>
<p><italic>The Quest for the Historical Satan</italic> is a welcome addition to the diabolical library. Two professors from the Iliff School of Theology, Miguel De La Torre, an ethicist, and Albert Hernández, a historian, guide their readers—presumably English-speaking evangelical and progressive Christians—on a fascinating, often meandering, journey through three millennia of religious and popular culture about the devil, before briefly offering their own modest proposal: that contemporary critical-thinking Christians take the idea of Satan seriously and view this trickster-figure through the ancient lens of <italic>hassatan</italic>, from the Book of Job.</p>
<p>The five chapters of their <italic>Quest</italic> are, for the most part, organized chronologically, as the title suggests, with one notable exception. There are successive chapters on the emergence of Satan and growth of Satanic lore in biblical and post-biblical literature (chapter 2: “The Birth of Satan: A Textual History”), in Judaism, Christianity, and Islam during late antiquity (chapter 3: “Satan through the Ages”), in medieval and early Renaissance epochs (chapter 4: “Satan Comes of Age”), and in the early modern period after the rise of science and rationalism (chapter 5: “The Devil Made Me Do It”). But their treatment of Satan’s profile in contemporary culture is in their initial chapter (chapter 1: “Satan in the Modern World”), and this editorial inversion makes for a dramatic, entertainingly relevant introduction.</p>
<p>The authors arrange a bedazzling array of personages and lore along the string of time, producing a fascinating treasury of oddities, lunatics, and Believe-It-Or-Not Satan sightings. The data is, after all, legion, and much of it is here: the authors of all those Great Books (Augustine, Aquinas, Dante, Goethe), urban legends about Faustian conspiracies involving McDonald’s, Proctor and Gamble, and Santeria. We read about early Jewish angelology, Islamic djinns, the Lost Tribes, C.I. Schofield (of the Schofield Bible), Pat Robertson, conquistadors, Church Fathers, Hannibal Lecter, Indiana Jones, Brer Rabbit, Hellboy, murderous occult Nazis, and murderous medieval witch-hunters. We learn about alchemy and demon possession, Grail legends and <italic>Left Behind</italic> fables. We are amazed by fantastic statistics about the number of demons counted by medieval census takers (in the trillions) and the ratio of Americans who, according to a poll from April 2000, believe in the Devil (75 percent). The Devil’s story has as many twists and turns as its serpentine protagonist. It does occasionally slip the grasp of its handlers. So many fascinating jewels of lore are here, and yet the pendant of a tightly drawn thesis sometimes sags beneath their sheer weight.</p>
<p>But a shyly advanced thesis is finally revealed near the end (196–215), opening with the section titled “Satan as Trickster?” (Note: the authors too often cower behind rhetorical questions and, as above, couch potentially controversial ideas as suggestions.) That thesis is to view the Devil, ultimately, as Christianity’s trickster-figure, as the Necessary Evil, the disruptive imp of chaos who unsettles the stagnant and suffocating status quo and who tests the mettle of the faithful. This is an elegant, bold, and (given their religious backgrounds) even courageous move on behalf of De La Torre and Hernández, and they acknowledge in a postscript that this destination surprised even them. Our Ancient Foe, it seems, is not Satan himself, but the kind of extreme binary moral thinking that demonizes and scapegoats and marginalizes persons, cultures, and ideas that are foreign to us and our interests. As it turns out, then, humanity’s clearest sighting of Satan came at the moment when he first debuted on the stage of religion, in the prologue to the Book of Job, before his appearance was beclouded by a plethora of distracting diabolical details. It is there that <italic>hassatan</italic>, “the adversary,” a member of the divine council, initially displayed his essential and invaluable function in human reality, as the loyal (to God) opposition that makes virtue meaningful, acts of justice necessary, and that forces sentimentality and good intentions to grow into mature love.</p>
