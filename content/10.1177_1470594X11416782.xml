<abstract>
<p>Until relatively recently, few democrats had much to say about the constitution of the ‘demos' that ought to rule. A number of recent writers have, however, argued that all those whose interests are affected must be enfranchised if decision-making is to be fully democratic. This article criticizes this approach, arguing that it misunderstands democracy. Democratic procedures are about the agency of the people so only agents can be enfranchised, yet not all bearers of interests are also agents. If we focus on agency, rather than who is affected, then this leads us to focus on the permissible limits of action, rather than who makes the decision. Just as individual sovereignty is ordinarily limited by the requirement not to injure others, we may apply similar restrictions to what a demos can permissibly do. Thus, any collection of individuals may choose to regulate their affairs collectively for mutual benefit, but should be prohibited from imposing negative externalities on outsiders. On this view, the constitution or definition of the demos is arbitrary, from the democratic point of view. Moreover, democracy does not require the expansion of the franchise, unless injuries cannot be avoided.</p>

<p>Democracy means rule by the people. One problem with this concerns who ‘the people’ in question are.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1470594X11416782">
1
</xref></sup> Since who makes a given decision can effectively determine its solution, this is crucially important. For instance, a referendum on the future of Palestine would doubtless produce very different results depending on whether the franchise consisted only of Palestinians (whether only those in the occupied territories or also refugees overseas), of Israelis and Palestinians, the wider Arab world, or the whole world. Until we know the relevant group of decision-makers, it seems that there is no prospect of a genuinely democratic decision.</p>
<p>This article criticizes the recently popular ‘all-affected principle’ and, particularly, applications of it that suggest the need to enfranchise almost everyone in almost every decision. Such proposals, I argue, would be neither desirable nor even recognizably democratic. Though it is possible that alternative principles could be found, for instance focusing on those subject to coercion, I suggest that any such principle is likely to be misguided, because it focuses on outputs rather than inputs, whereas democracy is about agency. There is no need for a decision-making group to include all who are affected by a decision. This does not mean that groups are entitled to inflict injuries upon outsiders any more than individuals can. Agents, whether groups or individuals, are constrained in what they can legitimately do to others. I may not ordinarily injure you to further my own interests, and my society (acting as a collective) cannot impose injuries on you to further our collective ends.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1470594X11416782">
2
</xref></sup> The rights of a given people to sovereign self-determination are restricted by the rights of others.</p>
<p>This article makes two related main claims: first, that we should focus on rights rather than mere interests and, second, that rights are better respected by limiting the power of groups to infringe them, rather than by requiring them to include or enfranchise the rights-holders. Rights set limits on what we may permissibly do to others without their consent. This does not mean that we must enfranchise others in our decision-making so that we can impose costs upon them. Indeed, it is unclear that mere enfranchisement is sufficient to justify the imposition of costs, since it clearly falls short of individual consent. I shall argue that individuals may be understood as waiving certain rights where they are part of a democratic group, thus explaining why groups are able to affect their members in ways that they cannot legitimately affect outsiders.</p>
<p>Democracy can be seen as a procedure that allows some of us to impose costs on others for our own benefit, provided that all expect to benefit overall. We are prepared to waive some of our rights provided that others do so too and all expect to gain. The gains, however, are confined to members of a particular cooperative group. We are entitled to impose losses on some, but this does not entitle us to impose losses on those who neither consent nor stand to gain.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-1470594X11416782">
3
</xref></sup> This explains why the existence of a permanent minority has long been thought problematic for democracy. If members of this group never actually win, then they never receive the benefits of democracy, so the procedure is not justified to them. More importantly, for present purposes, this suggests that we are not entitled to impose costs on those who are not part of the cooperative scheme. Prohibition of or compensation for negative externalities imposed on outsiders is the first-best ideal.</p>
<p>Section 1 introduces the boundary problem and the need for inclusion principles. Sections 2 and 3, respectively, outline the recently popular all-affected-interests principle and Goodin’s particularly expansive interpretation of it. Section 4 criticizes these proposals as over-inclusive and Section 5 develops one particular diagnosis of this problem: that the focus on who is affected diverts our attention from decision-making agents to the patients affected. Section 6 argues that democracy is essentially about the agency of the people and Section 7 develops a liberal account of collective agency. Agents, whether individual or collective, face various moral limits on their permissible range of action. Though a full account of these cannot be given here, Section 8 argues that we are forbidden from violating others' rights, but not from affecting them in other ways. Section 9 argues that the best way to respect others' rights is to limit the decision-making power of demoi, as of individuals, rather than simply to make them more inclusive and, finally, Section 10 concludes.</p>
<sec id="section1-1470594X11416782">
<title>1. The need for inclusion principles</title>
<p>Historically, democracy was an inclusive ideal, contrasted to the rule of the few (oligarchy) or one (monarchy), but the political unit in question was always taken as a given.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-1470594X11416782">
4
</xref></sup> Athenian democracy may be criticized for excluding women and slaves, but few would have called it less democratic for not enfranchising Spartans. Nonetheless, the decisions of a particular people have always had knock-on effects on their neighbours; damning or polluting a river, for instance, affects the water supply of those downstream. In an increasingly global world, these problems are more widespread, since decisions taken within a single community almost invariably affect outsiders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1470594X11416782">Held, 1999</xref>). Consequently, many of those who have considered the so-called ‘boundary problem’ have argued that there is no justification for restricting the franchise to members of a particular state.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-1470594X11416782">
5
</xref></sup>
</p>
<p>Until relatively recently, democratic theorists had surprisingly little to say about who constitutes the relevant demos.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-1470594X11416782">
6
</xref></sup> Some recent writers, however, suggest that the reasons we have to favour democracy, since they are reasons to give ‘the people’ a vote, also provide grounds for determining the relevant people who ought to be enfranchised.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-1470594X11416782">
7
</xref></sup> If the justification of democracy lies, for example, in allowing people to protect their interests, then it seems reasonable that all whose interests are at stake in a decision should have the chance to participate in making it.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-1470594X11416782">
8
</xref></sup> It is frequently claimed that (1) it is unjustifiable for one group to impose costs on outsiders unilaterally, so (2) those outsiders ought to be included in the decision-making process. I will argue that, while the first claim is true, the second does not follow and ought to be rejected.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-1470594X11416782">
<title>2. The all-affected principle</title>
<p>Among those who believe that democratic principles provide some answer to the boundary problem, the most common solution has been that all of those affected by a decision ought to be enfranchised. The appeal of this ‘all affected’ principle has been augmented by the observation that it seems implicitly presupposed by many other proposed principles for constituting the demos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1470594X11416782">Goodin, 2007</xref>: 49). Until comparatively recently it was the case that those living in close proximity were most likely to affect each other by their actions, so this principle provided derivative justification for territorial political units (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1470594X11416782">Goodin, 2007</xref>: 48). Even now this can be seen to justify practices such as federalism or regional devolution, whereby certain decisions are devolved to the local constituents most affected by them. Some writers have even suggested that people should have unequal shares of decision-making power, proportional to the interests they have at stake in a given decision, which would make being affected the basis both of inclusion and exclusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1470594X11416782">Brighouse and Fleurbaey, 2010</xref>: 139; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1470594X11416782">Heyd and Segal, 2006</xref>: 104 n. 1).</p>
<p>This widespread acceptance of the all-affected-interests principle, however, may be a consequence of its lack of definite content, as can be seen when we try to specify its precise meaning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1470594X11416782">Beckman, 2009</xref>: 36–8). An expansive notion of what it is to be ‘affected’ focuses simply on whether one is <italic>causally</italic> affected by the decision to be made (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1470594X11416782">Beckman, 2009</xref>: 41–7). This seems too broad: the decision to tunnel through a mountain causally affects the rocks that are to be tunnelled through, but it is unclear what it even means to say that the rocks ought to be enfranchised. Since democracy involves some form of collective agency, non-agents cannot meaningfully be included. Some have suggested narrower readings of ‘affected’, for instance, that only those <italic>subject</italic> to the decisions made count as relevantly affected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1470594X11416782">Beckman, 2009</xref>: 47–50).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-1470594X11416782">
9
</xref></sup> This proposal may well have substantive merits, but ‘subjected’ is not what is intuitively meant by ‘affected’, so this should be regarded not as a version of the all-affected principle, but as a different principle altogether (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1470594X11416782">Beckman, 2009</xref>: 45; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1470594X11416782">Goodin, 2007</xref>: 49–50; Näsström, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1470594X11416782">2011</xref>). I shall focus on the all-affected principle, though I think similar objections could be raised against the ‘all-subjected’ principle too.</p>
<p>How, then, should we understand the ‘all-affected’ principle? I believe it is most charitably interpreted as the claim that all those whose <italic>interests</italic> are affected ought to be enfranchised. Since this requires that those objects affected have interests, it is narrower than the ‘causally affected’ interpretation, but broader than ‘all subjected’, since one can be affected by a law even if not legally bound by it. Obviously, this still needs to be fleshed out by an account of interests; I simply suppose that such a task is possible and that what I have to say will be compatible with any plausible theory of interests. Even so, there are still many different formulations of the principle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1470594X11416782">Goodin, 2007</xref>: 51–62). We may distinguish, for example, between enfranchising ‘all <italic>actually</italic> affected interests', ‘all <italic>probably</italic> affected interests', ‘all <italic>possibly</italic> affected interests', ‘all <italic>and only</italic> affected interests', and so on. As Goodin argues, some of these are unappealing, while others may even be incoherent (for instance, we cannot enfranchise only those <italic>actually</italic> affected, because who is affected depends on what the decision is, which depends on who makes it).</p>
<p>Goodin argues for the most expansive possible reading of the all-affected principle, suggesting not only that we should enfranchise all whose interests are <italic>possibly</italic> affected, but also that over-inclusiveness is less problematic than under-inclusiveness. Hence, we should ensure sufficient inclusiveness by enfranchising everyone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1470594X11416782">Goodin, 2007</xref>: 58). I return to the principle in its more general form below, but begin with Goodin’s interpretation since, by taking the principle to its logical extreme, his argument clearly demonstrates its main defects.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-1470594X11416782">
<title>3. Goodin’s expansive interpretation</title>
<p>Goodin argues that all affected interests must be enfranchised, but that we need not restrict the franchise to <italic>only</italic> affected interests (2007: 58). Consequently, adequate inclusion can be ensured by enfranchising everyone on every decision. This is a radical conclusion, but we should not reject it too hastily.</p>
<p>Goodin does not make the surely exaggerated claim that any genuine democracy must be global.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-1470594X11416782">
10
</xref></sup> This would imply either that there has never yet been anything approximating true democracy in the world or, at least, that increasing international interdependency means that democracy on a limited scale is no longer possible. It is perfectly possible that, for some local decisions, all possibly affected interests are included in a narrower franchise. Thus, Goodin does not insist that we <italic>must</italic> always enfranchise everyone, only that doing so is the most practical way to ensure that all possibly affected interests are actually included. While he may allow smaller units, such as nation-states, to operate within a larger system of federal government or regulation, it is for him second- or third-best to a wider franchise that would effectively eradicate these distinct collectives (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1470594X11416782">Goodin, 2007</xref>: 64–7).</p>
<p>Goodin takes being affected as sufficient, but not necessary, for inclusion in the demos, explicitly rejecting the ‘all <italic>and only</italic> affected interests' principle (2007: 58). There seem to be good pragmatic reasons to extend the franchise in this way. First, it avoids many of the problems associated with finding an adequate account of interests and determining who is or may be affected by a given decision. Second, it yields a relatively stable demos (that is, everybody), rather than a different constituency for every decision. This simple solution only works, however, because Goodin does not consider over-inclusiveness a problem. Not all advocates of the all-affected principle agree; some also take it as a principle of exclusion, saying that those unaffected should not be included. The next section argues that over-inclusiveness is a problem; later I argue that even more restrictive versions of the all-affected principle are necessarily over-inclusive, because they include non-agents.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1470594X11416782">
<title>4. Over-inclusion</title>
<p>The tendency towards a global demos results from Goodin’s swift dismissal of any concerns about the <italic>over</italic>-inclusiveness of the demos. His argument is simply that people required to vote on some issue that does not affect their interests will do so randomly and thus be equally distributed across all options, leaving the outcome unchanged.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-1470594X11416782">
11
</xref></sup> This argument can be challenged at a number of points.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-1470594X11416782">
12
</xref></sup>
</p>
<p>First, we may question whether unaffected voters really will vote entirely <italic>randomly</italic>. Voters may be influenced by ‘external preferences', such as racism, or more innocuous factors, such as a tendency to check the first name on the ballot paper. Enough people voting in this way may affect the outcome, especially if voters are not independent, resulting in a ‘cascade’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-1470594X11416782">
13
</xref></sup> Second, even if voting is random, there is still the possibility that it may affect outcomes. Goodin offers an example in which there are 1000 affected voters, all of whom support a proposal, and 1 million unaffected individuals who also vote on it (2007: 58 n. 37). While we might expect those unaffected to be divided <italic>about</italic> 50/50, a division such as 499,499 in favour and 500,501 against would be plausible and enough to defeat the motion, even if all those affected favoured it (500,499 for the proposal and 500,501 against).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn14-1470594X11416782">
14
</xref></sup> Thus, we cannot be sure that outcomes will be unchanged when we permit large amounts of random ‘noise’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn15-1470594X11416782">
15
</xref></sup>
</p>
<p>Of course, Goodin may have good responses to these objections. He might suggest, for example, that <italic>democracy</italic> favours a global franchise, but should sometimes be restricted for the sake of other values, much as some regard liberal rights as imposing external checks on democratic majorities. He might also reply that people may always vote on objectionable grounds, such as external preferences, but this does not mean that this is what they should do. It is possible to condemn the way that people exercise their votes, while maintaining that they ought to have the vote and that they ought to use it for the common good (or vote randomly).</p>
<p>The logic of Goodin’s argument suggests that we ought always to err on the side of over-inclusiveness. This rule of thumb can be applied to other cases, such as that of minors. It is widely accepted that those below a certain age ought not to be enfranchised, in part on grounds of competence.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn16-1470594X11416782">
16
</xref></sup> Goodin’s arguments, however, suggest that we ought to enfranchise <italic>all</italic> children, even newborns, to ensure that all those who should get the vote do so. While this would mean enfranchising many who should not get the vote, this is unproblematic if we assume either that they will not vote or that their votes will cancel out. I find these implications counterintuitive, but, of course, how much weight we should attach to pre-theoretical intuitions in such cases is a live question. I raise these concerns not to refute Goodin’s application of the all-affected-interests principle, but merely to underline how radical it is.</p>
<p>Goodin could mitigate these difficulties by distinguishing between the distinct questions ‘Who should be <italic>entitled</italic> to vote?’ and ‘Who should <italic>exercise</italic> that vote?’ We often think that people should have certain rights, even if they should not use them in particular ways or at particular times. I have the right to say something that you might find offensive, for example, but it may be wrong of me to do so. Similarly, there might be good reasons to grant someone the <italic>right</italic> to vote (for instance, because it shows that they are recognized as an equal) even though it would be wrong of them to exercise it on a given matter.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn17-1470594X11416782">
17
</xref></sup> Goodin fails to make this distinction and speaks of people being <italic>required</italic> to vote on some issue that does not affect their interests. It is not clear why anyone should be required to vote, though some democracies (including Australia) practice compulsory voting, which has recently received support elsewhere (see, for example, Birch, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1470594X11416782">2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1470594X11416782">Lijphart, 1997</xref>). It is possible that individuals may sometimes be under a duty <italic>not</italic> to vote, for instance when they are uninformed about the issue or unaffected by the decision (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1470594X11416782">Brennan, 2009</xref>). In these cases, abstention may be a democratic virtue. Thus, one could hold that everyone should be enfranchised, but that people should only <italic>exercise</italic> their votes if they have interests at stake, and otherwise abstain.</p>
<p>A universal franchise would be less objectionable if those unaffected by a decision could be trusted to abstain. Even this proposal, however, faces problems, since we cannot be sure that people will actually abstain when they ought to. Moreover, while it may be an improvement to know that our decisions are not <italic>actually</italic> determined by outsiders, it might still be objectionable that they <italic>could</italic> influence our decisions if they wished to. Our self-government is not secure where others have the power to interfere arbitrarily if they wish.</p>
<p>As with any foundational normative premise, it is difficult to prove that over-inclusion is problematic to anyone who does not already accept that it is. Nonetheless, we might draw an analogy here to the individual case. We ordinarily think it better that you can choose what to do for yourself than be directed by someone else, even if what she directs you to do is what you would have done anyway. The same, it seems, is true if that ‘someone else’ were a group, rather than an individual, and, plausibly, even if you are a member of that group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1470594X11416782">Nozick, 1974</xref>: 290–2). A central feature of liberalism is that individuals have rights to direct their own lives, whatever the majority thinks they should do. Republicans express a similar concern in terms of non-domination.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn18-1470594X11416782">
18
</xref></sup> It is true that the over-inclusive demos differs from ordinary cases, whereby one individual is dominated by another, since it includes the individual(s) who should be decisive. This may be less objectionable, but it still dilutes the power of the locals to govern their own lives. Even where the wishes of insiders are not swamped by outsiders, the insiders will find their freedom to govern themselves compromised if they get their way only at the pleasure of others.</p>
<p>These problems need not be fatal. Indeed, I do not think that being affected should be a necessary condition for inclusion. My aim is merely to show that Goodin is too swift in dismissing the idea that over-inclusiveness is a problem. Moreover, the all-affected-interests principle is actually far more over-inclusive than so far shown. It is possible for anyone or anything with interests to be affected, but not all of these can be included because not all creatures with interests are also agents.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1470594X11416782">
<title>5. Agency and patients</title>
<p>The all-affected principle, in its purest form, says that it is sufficient for inclusion in decision-making that one has interests that may be affected by the decision. One difficulty is that not all entities with interests capable of being affected are capable of participation in a decision-making process.</p>
<p>It is common to distinguish between moral agents and moral patients. Moral agents are actors, capable of deliberate, reasoned choice, and bound by moral requirements. Moral patients, conversely, are simply those beings deserving of moral consideration. On most views, all moral agents are also moral patients, but the reverse does not hold. We may think that all sentient life is deserving of moral consideration, in virtue of having interests that can be advanced or setback by our actions. This is what distinguishes, say, a dog from a stone, which we can treat in any way that we like. Not all bearers of interests are also agents. We may consider animals, very young children, and the severely mentally handicapped to be moral patients, though not agents. This means that, though they are not moral decision-makers, their interests must be taken into account by others.</p>
<p>Since moral patients have interests, their interests can be affected by a decision. Thus, the all-affected-interests principle requires that even non-agent moral patients are enfranchised if affected, even though incapable of voting. One may reply that this is unproblematic in practice, since either these non-agents will not be able to vote at all (as in the case of animals or future generations) or we can assume that their votes will cancel out (as in the case of young children or the mentally incompetent). Nonetheless, it seems at least odd, if not problematic, that the theory tells us that certain groups ought to be enfranchised though they cannot meaningfully be so.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn19-1470594X11416782">
19
</xref></sup> It is bizarre to suggest, even in principle, that animals or unborn children ought to be granted the vote, though they cannot possibly exercise it.</p>
<p>Goodin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1470594X11416782">2000</xref>) has considered the problem of mute interests, and suggested that the solution lies in ‘democratic deliberation within’, that is, the voting members of the community should imagine themselves justifying their choices to those whose interests are affected, but who cannot vote for themselves. This may be appealing, but one should not confuse the distinct questions of who should have a vote and how those who have a vote should exercise that vote.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn20-1470594X11416782">
20
</xref></sup> One may say that members of a demos should consider the interests of outsiders in voting, without thinking that this is merely a second best and that those outsiders should, ideally, have been enfranchised themselves.</p>
<p>The fact that the all-affected principle can be construed as recommending the inclusion of non-agents within the democratic process at all suggests a faulty conception of democracy. Rule in the interests of the people (or affected patients) is not democracy, but guardianship. Democracy is essentially a matter of rule <italic>by</italic> the people, that is, a matter of their agency.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn21-1470594X11416782">
21
</xref></sup> It does not suffice for a democratic process that my interests are taken into account. Rather, it is necessary that my agency influences the process, since what I vote for may not be my own interests. This explains why we should heed people’s actual, expressed wishes, rather than simply bypassing their opinions whenever we know their interests or preferences.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn22-1470594X11416782">
22
</xref></sup> Moreover, it explains why we do not think that democracy consists in, or even requires, that all people be equally satisfied. Some will get what they want while others will lose out. This is acceptable, provided that the procedure is a fair one, because it respects these people’s agency (that is, their votes) and not because it results in equal satisfaction of their interests.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1470594X11416782">
<title>6. Democracy as agency</title>
<p>Democracy is not simply about the equal satisfaction of different parties' interests, but about giving people equal (and positive) <italic>inputs</italic> into what the decisions are. This is why choosing a course of action by lottery, though it shows equal respect for all people’s interests, is not democratic (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1470594X11416782">Estlund, 2008</xref>: 65–84; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1470594X11416782">Goodin, 2004</xref>: 99).</p>
<p>There may be disagreement about what it is to give people equal inputs into decision-making. Suppose, for example, we have a society divided into two factions, which oppose each other over a number of similar issues, such as trade-offs between economic interests and aesthetic values.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn23-1470594X11416782">
23
</xref></sup> If two-thirds of society consistently favour economic efficiency at the cost of aesthetic values, while the other third would prefer to bear financial burdens in order to enjoy a more attractive environment, then we may question whether majority rule really treats them all fairly. The majority principle would result in the economizers getting their way on all decisions, and the aesthetes being effectively excluded. Perhaps it would be more democratic either to compromise on each decision or to give the economizers their way on two-thirds of the decisions and aesthetes their way on the rest, respecting proportionality.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn24-1470594X11416782">
24
</xref></sup> But no one thinks it would be democratic to give each group their way on half of the decisions because, while this would satisfy all people equally, it would ignore their preferences (it would make no difference whether society was divided 2:1 or 1:5).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn25-1470594X11416782">
25
</xref></sup>
</p>
<p>It seems that democracy is, in some sense, a matter of collective agency. If this is so, then it can only include agents, since others are simply incapable of participation. James <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1470594X11416782">Hyland (1995</xref>: 76–84), in a discussion hitherto largely ignored, proposes restricting the democratic constituency to agents.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn26-1470594X11416782">
26
</xref></sup> He starts by observing that almost all systems exclude the young, the insane, and non-nationals,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn27-1470594X11416782">
27
</xref></sup> but claims that it is ludicrous to consider a state less democratic simply because a baby boom reduces the portion of the population enfranchised. He argues that we can avoid this conclusion if we restrict the ‘domain of relevance’ of democracy. Just as how a society treats animals is irrelevant to our judgement of its racial justice, so the exclusion of animals or very young children is irrelevant to an assessment of a society’s democratic character. They are outside the concept’s domain of relevance because they are not agents and cannot participate in collective decision-making. Hyland’s positive proposal is that the quantitative dimension of democracy depends on the extent to which a state enfranchises all of those who are subject to the decision <italic>and</italic> capable of participating in such decision-making (1995: 81).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn28-1470594X11416782">
28
</xref></sup> These two conditions are each necessary, and jointly sufficient, for inclusion. Consequently, there is nothing undemocratic about excluding non-resident foreigners (who are not subject to the decision) or very young children (who are incapable of participation), though <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1470594X11416782">Hyland (1995</xref>: 82) accepts that excluding 12-year-olds who satisfy both conditions is undemocratic, even if justifiable.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn29-1470594X11416782">
29
</xref></sup>
</p>
<p>Could such a domain restriction rescue the all-affected-interests principle? It seems not. While it has the merit that it does not imply anything undemocratic about the exclusion of non-agents from the franchise, it suggests that being affected is not sufficient for inclusion. The all-affected-interests principle is, then, shown to be importantly incomplete and, at best, only part of a principle of inclusion: it is also necessary that democratic participants be agents. Maybe advocates of the all-affected principle will be inclined to go down this avenue, developing a multipart criterion of inclusion, but this comes at the cost of the simplicity that is part of the appeal of the all-affected-interests principle. I cannot show that no such modified principle could work, but I think that we should look elsewhere. Once we regard the restriction of inclusion to agents as not merely a practical constraint, but the essence of what democracy is, we have the potential to reach very different conclusions about who should be enfranchised. The following sections describe an agency-centred conception of democracy and argue that it implies limits on what may be done to outsiders, rather than a need to enfranchise them.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-1470594X11416782">
<title>7. Democratic agency</title>
<p>Democracy is based on respecting people as agents, rather than merely as patients. This is why we should heed people’s expressed wishes, rather than merely acting in their interests, and why outcomes should be sensitive to these inputs, rather than serving all interests equally. I cannot, here, offer a full theory of democracy, but I shall sketch an agent-centred conception of democracy to show why we may value it and the limits on what democratic groups may permissibly do.</p>
<p>If democracy is simply a form of pseudo-collective agency, we may wonder why anyone would accept such an arrangement, given that it seems to entail a loss of individual autonomy because they will not always get their way.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn30-1470594X11416782">
30
</xref></sup> There are several reasons why autonomous individuals may accept some process of collective decision-making. One is that there is a trade-off between having complete power over only one’s own life and having a share of power over larger decisions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1470594X11416782">Dahl, 1990</xref>: 76–7). Added to this is the fact that there are certain decisions that an individual cannot take, for example, individuals cannot have policies on matters such as national defence.</p>
<p>On many issues we are only able to get what we want if we coordinate our activities with others. This is because we must all live together, but different uses of our property may cause conflict, for example, I will find it hard to use my room as a quiet study if you use your adjacent room for drum practice.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn31-1470594X11416782">
31
</xref></sup> Sometimes the actual solution to these problems may be a matter of indifference, provided that all coordinate on the same solution, for example, which side of the road we drive on. In other cases, it may be that parties have competing preferences or interests, but the need for coordination figures heavily, either because one policy has to be adopted by all or simply because the parties in question have a higher-order preference for coordination. To take an individual example, suppose you and I want to go for a meal together. We may have different preferences over where to go (say, I prefer Indian food and you prefer Chinese food), but the most important thing for each of us is to go together, so it is no solution for each of us to go our own way. In this case, there are a variety of possible solutions to our problem. It may be possible to find some compromise, such as going to a Thai restaurant. If our arrangement is a regular one, we may take it in turns to choose restaurants. In a one-off case, we may simply toss a coin. Any of these solutions allow us to achieve coordination while treating our competing preferences fairly.</p>
<p>Most democratic decisions involve more than two people, but can be seen as essentially larger versions of the same problems. We may have two or more competing groups who need coordination on certain matters. Suppose, to use our earlier economizers and aesthetes example, the latter group favour an expensive urban regeneration programme. Again, we may be able to find some middle-ground compromise, such as a less expensive scheme or, if the situation must be ‘winner takes all’, we may use some fair process, such as a lottery or a vote, that gives each group a chance of getting what they want. All might subscribe to the democratic process because it gives weight to their preferences. They may lose on any given decision, but at least they have a chance of winning next time. (Alternatively, in one-off cases, they may accept it because it gives them a chance of winning.) Winners are allowed to impose certain costs on losers, but in the long run all expect to benefit from these arrangements compared to a world without coordination.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn32-1470594X11416782">
32
</xref></sup> Thus, all have reason to comply with democratic outcomes, even when defeated, because, provided the process is fair, all stand to benefit from the ongoing arrangement.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn33-1470594X11416782">
33
</xref></sup>
</p>
<p>The upshot is that democratic procedures allow a group to act together, as if they were a single agent, with some members getting their way and therefore imposing certain costs on other members.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn34-1470594X11416782">
34
</xref></sup> The use of a fair collective decision procedure can be seen as weakening the ‘separateness of persons', allowing some to impose costs on others for their own benefit, provided that all expect to benefit in the long run. Democratic arrangements are one form of social interaction that impose particular costs on particular agents on particular occasions, but can be justified because in general they are beneficial to all. Other examples include traffic regulations, including provisions, for example, that allow emergency vehicles to ignore the usual rules such as red lights and speed limits.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn35-1470594X11416782">

<sec id="section8-1470594X11416782">
<title>8. Limits on agency</title>
<p>Agents normally face limits on what they can permissibly do. I cannot simply push past you because I am in a rush, for example. Similar limits apply also to collective agents. We cannot permissibly violate your rights simply because it is in our interest to do so.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn36-1470594X11416782">
36
</xref></sup> This applies whether the ‘we’ in question is a sub-state group, such as a firm, or indeed a state.</p>
<p>Whatever the group, there is an important difference between how it may treat insiders and how it may treat outsiders. Participation in democratic procedures renders everyone liable to the costs of defeat on some occasions in return for the expectation of net benefits in the long term. Some members of the demos are allowed to impose costs on others as a consequence of their joint decision-making. This rationale does not, however, extend to outsiders. Those who are not part of the demos cannot expect to receive compensating benefits, so should not be liable to bear costs either.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn37-1470594X11416782">
37
</xref></sup> Thus, the decision-making power of the demos ought to be limited to distributing benefits and burdens internally and not to affecting outsiders (negatively, at least).</p>
<p>Goodin (2007: 62–3) considers and rejects such a proposal. He argues that, given his very inclusive reading of the all-affected principle, there will be few significant decisions that can be left to the demos without potentially affecting outsiders. If this is so, it suggests that a bounded democracy will be unable legitimately to do anything significant. Our only hope then is the global cosmopolitan democracy discussed above, which, by enfranchising all, allows us to affect anyone. Since this is impractical, Goodin (2007: 64–7) suggests two more realistic approximations of this ideal: a federal world government and lateral compensation for negative spillovers. Though he is unspecific about exactly how a federal government would work, the very fact that he considers it suggests that there may be some day-to-day decisions that can safely be devolved to a localized demos, without needing universal enfranchisement. The upper tier of world government, he imagines, would serve only as a higher court of appeal, for cases where decisions taken within one subunit have spillover effects on outsiders.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn38-1470594X11416782">
38
</xref></sup> His other proposal, which he describes as third-best, behind both the ideal of global cosmopolitan democracy and second-best of global federalism, is a system of international law that internalizes negative externalities. Localized demoi are thus prohibited from imposing costs on outsiders, or required to compensate those outsiders for any harms. Of course, compensation is a difficult issue.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn39-1470594X11416782">
39
</xref></sup> Nonetheless, I shall argue that limiting the power of the demos in this way is more attractive than Goodin allows and does not leave demoi as devoid of power as he suggests.</p>
<p>In his earlier discussion, Goodin argued that anyone who could possibly have his or her interests affected ought to be enfranchised. No doubt, if the demos could only <italic>affect</italic> those who were enfranchised, this would significantly constrain its decision-making power. The discussion of compensation, however, focuses not on all possible influences, but only <italic>negative</italic> externalities. It is far from obvious that we need to enfranchise others before performing actions that bestow positive benefits on them (assuming perhaps that these benefits are recognized as such by the recipients). The decisional power of a group need not, therefore, be limited to what does not <italic>affect</italic> outsiders, but only to what does not <italic>harm</italic> outsiders. This already allows much greater scope for action.</p>
<p>Moreover, not all negative influences are illegitimate. Non-consequentialists typically distinguish between harming and not benefiting others. A full account of where this boundary should be drawn is beyond the scope of this article, but we need not enfranchise outsiders in a decision simply because we could benefit them. If this were so, then any developed country considering devoting significant sums of money to some domestic project, such as a new sports stadium, would have to enfranchise the whole of the developing world, since that money could, instead, have been given as aid.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn40-1470594X11416782">
40
</xref></sup> If the money is legitimately ours (as I shall assume that it is, setting aside disputes about global justice), then we should be broadly free to spend it as we see fit. We may be constrained by general moral principles not actively to harm others, but it does not follow that it is wrong for us to spend the money on domestic projects simply because we could instead have benefited outsiders with it.</p>
<p>Thus far, we are permitted to impose or withhold benefits on others without their consent or enfranchisement. There are also cases in which one person is morally permitted to act in ways positively harmful to others. I may, for example, compete with you for business, even if it leaves you worse off. The legitimacy of my action does not depend on any version of the acts/omissions doctrine, but rather on the assumption that there are some things that I have the right to do, even if others are adversely affected by my decision. I have the right, for example, to open my own restaurant, even if other local restaurateurs will be harmed by the increased competition.</p>
<p>If each of us has this (Hohfeldian) liberty, then it will ordinarily be the case that the two of us could together open a restaurant.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn41-1470594X11416782">
41
</xref></sup> Of course, I cannot open a restaurant with you without including you in the decision, and vice versa. Nonetheless, we do not need to include other affected parties, such as other local restaurateurs, patrons, or our immediate families, in the decision. Though these people may have their interests affected, positively or negatively, they have no right to inclusion. Agents acting within their rights do not need the permission of others, so do not need to consult or include others in their decision-making. This is true whether the agent in question is an individual or a collective. Thus, the citizens of one country may act in ways they have a right to, without including others affected by the exercise of that right.</p>
<p>It might be said that, while this action is permissible, it is still undemocratic. But that is so only in a sense of ‘democracy’ that is of little, if any, normative interest. The motivation for asking what democracy requires is presumably the belief that we have, at least <italic>pro tanto</italic>, reason to do what democracy requires. A purely descriptive notion of democracy is, therefore, of little interest. We only care about the requirements of democracy to the extent that these are normative requirements, period. Thus, it seems that our understanding of democracy should be sensitive to rights (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1470594X11416782">Brettschneider, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>A further objection is that I have not only refrained from giving a list of rights, but even from specifying a procedure by which these rights might be determined. If there is disagreement between different groups as to what rights people have, we need some method of adjudication (democratic or otherwise) to establish the limits of permissible action. My aim, however, is to specify the limits to what groups may permissibly do, not to say how groups can know these limits in practice. Hence, the limits that I refer to are those set by a correct account of rights. Of course, in practice we will need mechanisms to determine what rights people have. These will presumably be undemocratic, because we cannot have a democratic process without a prior determination of who should be included in <italic>that</italic> process, which merely opens a regress. Nonetheless, I do not think that my proposal is on more shaky ground here than the all-affected-interests principle, since that may also be afflicted by disagreement between different groups over what interests people have and whether particular individuals have their interests affected by a given decision. The advocate of the all-affected-interests principle must either stipulate that what she means is all whose interests are affected <italic>on the correct account of interests</italic> (a move analogous to my appeal to the correct account of rights) or perhaps evade the problem by taking Goodin’s maximally inclusive line, which has been criticized above (and which might itself be disputed, if some maintain that those unaffected should be excluded).</p>
<p>The rights that we have limit what others can permissibly do to us. I have no complaint against someone simply because their action affects me. It is only if they violate my rights, without my permission, that they wrong me. This applies whether the actor is an individual or a collective. Individuals should be free to act as they wish, provided they do not thereby infringe others' rights, and groups should be free to act as their members wish, provided they do not infringe outsiders' rights. The content of these rights cannot be specified here, but this should be the focus of our attention.</p>
<p>This can be seen if we consider ordinary cases of group decision-making. Consider a group of friends deciding where to go for a meal. Plausibly, a member of the group not attending the meal should have no say, and one attending only part of the evening a lesser say than one attending the whole meal. We cannot, however, conclude that people ought to have power proportionate to the degree to which their interests are affected. Surely the group of decision-makers ought to be the diners in question, even if their decision affects the owners, staff, and patrons of nearby restaurants. It does not seem that members of these other groups ought to be enfranchised; merely that the group should not impose injuries (that is, wrongful or rights-infringing harms) on them.</p>
<p>It might be objected that I have merely introduced a new version of the all-affected principle. It might be acknowledged that it is implausible to enfranchise all whose <italic>interests</italic> are affected, yet maintained that my proposal amounts simply to enfranchising all whose <italic>rights</italic> are affected. This avoids over-inclusiveness, since even on the interest theory of rights not every interest is protected by a right (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1470594X11416782">Kramer, 1998</xref>: 62). The ‘all-affected’ formula is sufficiently contentless that I have no quarrel with those who choose to read my proposal as an interpretation of it, provided it is acknowledged that we have already come some way in moving from affected interests to rights. In the remaining sections of this article, however, I argue that enfranchising others does not allow us to override their rights, so it is better to limit the scope of democracy than to expand the franchise.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-1470594X11416782">
<title>9. Inclusion or compensation?</title>
<p>Our usual intuition is not that all whose interests are affected by any given decision have a right to be included in its making. Rather, agents (whether individuals or groups) have rights to make certain decisions, even where those impose costs on others.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn42-1470594X11416782">
42
</xref></sup> The immediate implication for the boundary problem, then, is that groups do not need to include outsiders when making decisions that they have a right to. If we legitimately own a piece of land, for instance, then we are entitled to exclude others from that land, without including them in the decision.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn43-1470594X11416782">
43
</xref></sup>
</p>
<p>We are not, however, entitled to violate others' rights. If our action infringes on the domain of others' rights, then we need to obtain their consent. Note that this need not take the form of including them in our democratic procedure. The members of my bridge club may need to borrow your van for a proposed trip, so we need your permission to use the van, but it does not follow that you must be included in the decision-making in the same way as the rest of us. Where we choose to go is up to us alone, but whether we can use your van is up to you alone.</p>
<p>Simply including someone in a democratic process is not itself sufficient to allow the overriding of their rights. Someone included in the democratic process may waive some of their rights, provided that they expect to benefit from the process as a whole (perhaps due to others also waiving their rights), but if they do not, then those rights may still constrain what the rest of us may do. I leave open whether we call this constraining democracy or prefer to think that what democracy really requires is respect for rights, rather than unconstrained majoritarianism. Including someone in the process of decision-making does not necessarily entitle us to override their rights. Even if all whose rights are affected by a decision have a further right to be included in the making of that decision, respecting this right to inclusion is no substitute for respecting the original right; it is merely a condition that might lead them to waive that original right.</p>
<p>The obvious implication is that group agency (like that of individuals) should be constrained by others' rights. There are some things that we cannot permissibly do, without others' consent. If we go ahead and violate some other person’s rights, the usual remedy is not to say that that person should be (or should have been) included in decision-making, but that they ought to be compensated for the rights violation. Thus, it seems (1) that groups have the right to act as their members see fit, provided that they do not violate the rights of any outsiders, regardless of whose interests may be affected, and (2) that groups ought to be prohibited from violating rights without permission. One way this permission can be secured is through inclusion in the democratic process, but this is not to say we must include others because we violate their rights, since even inclusion is not necessarily justification. The more obvious solution is to cease the rights violation and, if necessary, pay compensation. A theory of rights will provide us with an account of the limits of group action, but not an account of who ought to be enfranchised in democratic decision-making.</p>

<sec id="section10-1470594X11416782">
<title>10. Conclusion</title>
<p>The bulk of this article has focused on criticizing the all-affected principle, which has become the most popular answer to the boundary problem. I have argued that we ordinarily have some prior notion of the relevant group of decision-makers, and that they should be able to make decisions as they wish, subject only to certain restrictions on not <italic>injuring</italic> outsiders. I have said little about how such groups are to be constituted. My main, negative, argument has been that any variant of the all-affected principle and related proposals (such as ‘all subjected’) go wrong in a similar fashion, by focusing on the outputs of democratic decision-making and neglecting the importance of agency.</p>
<p>This negative conclusion, of course, invites questions about how people come to form a demos, conceived of as, in some sense, a collective agent. One possibility is that political communities may be formed by some contract of association, as supposed by Locke and Rousseau (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1470594X11416782">Dahl, 1989</xref>: 122). This is the case for some groups, such as voluntary associations, but it is questionable whether the state can be regarded as voluntary. Sometimes, we find ourselves simply thrown together by chance, for instance, a group of shipwreck survivors washed up on a desert island. In this case, we have little choice as to who we cooperate with, particularly if cooperation is necessary for survival, though it could be said that there is still a choice of sorts, even if not a fully voluntary one.</p>
<p>Some groups may be fit for democratic self-determination in virtue of some shared property, such as nationality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1470594X11416782">Miller, 1995</xref>: 81–118). If democracy requires all members of the community to be willing to bear short-term losses for the benefit of others, democratic arrangements are likely to function more smoothly where the people are united by a sense of solidarity. Members of a demos need not share anything in common other than their membership of that political institution. What determines their inclusion is not simply that they are affected by decisions, but that they are part of a pervasive basic structure or that decisions are made in their name.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn44-1470594X11416782">
44
</xref></sup> Finally, it may be that none of these methods of constituting the demos are alone adequate, so ultimately we face a trade-off between competing considerations favouring inclusion and exclusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1470594X11416782">Miller, 2009</xref>: 226–8).</p>
<p>The idea that the democratic community is arbitrary from a democratic point of view may strike some as unsatisfactory, but it is not a unique situation. Democracies require various constitutional essentials, such as the procedure for proposals and amendments to be made and decisions on the voting rule, to be settled. While these procedures, once they are in place, can be changed reflexively, their initial establishment cannot itself be a matter of democratic process, since there is as yet no determinate democratic procedure to follow. Initial decisions between these possible forms of democracy cannot be made democratically because, until one has been chosen, none is privileged over the others.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn45-1470594X11416782">
45
</xref></sup> It may be that, on some issues, such as the voting rule, the considerations favouring democracy give us reason to choose one arrangement rather than another, but it cannot be assumed that the value of democracy will be fully determinate here. Different groups may realize democracy in different ways and all of these can be legitimate. How a demos constitutes itself is a matter for its members, provided it does not transgress the rights of others.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn46-1470594X11416782">
46
</xref></sup>
</p>
<p>Democracy is the process whereby a group (any group) of agents unite to coordinate their collective action together. If the members of the demos have the right to act in certain ways, despite possibly negative effects on outsiders, then ordinarily so will the group. There is no need to enfranchise outsiders on matters where their rights are not infringed. Whose interests are affected is irrelevant, since we often have the right to affect others' interests, even negatively. Further, when the group’s action does run up against the limits imposed by others' rights, the usual solution is not to include the rights-holders in the franchise, but to limit the action of the group and, where these limits are exceeded, to require them to compensate outsiders for the infringement.</p>

Ludvig Beckman (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1470594X11416782">2009</xref>: 10–14) distinguishes between the questions of (1) who is a member of the demos (in reference to whom the degree to which the polity is democratic must be assessed) and (2) who ought to have the vote. This enables him to claim that it would be more democratic if children had the vote, but, nonetheless, they ought not to (Beckman, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1470594X11416782">2009</xref>: 119).</p>
<p>My concern is with who should be enfranchised, following Robert E. Goodin, (2007; which also appears in Goodin, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1470594X11416782">2008</xref>: 127–54). This is not to reduce democracy to voting, but recognition that voting is the ultimate stage in decision-making. Some may claim only that certain people should have a say, that is, be entitled to participate in deliberation, but without voting rights. I would not consider such participants members of the demos; their situation is more like that of a counsellor, who offers advice but is not a decision-maker. In this, I agree with David Miller (2009: 224).</p>
<p>Note also that though the phrase ‘boundary problem’ may suggest spatial boundaries, I am not concerned with territorial boundaries, but rather with delineating a group of people who should be enfranchised in decision-making, even if they are situated within different geographic states. See Arash Abizadeh (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1470594X11416782">2008</xref>: 38), who distinguishes civic and territorial boundaries.</p>

<p>‘Injury’ here is distinct from ‘harm’, since we are sometimes permitted to harm others (for example, in self-defence). Injuries are sometimes analysed as something like ‘wrongful harms' (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1470594X11416782">Lazar, 2009</xref>). In fact, a wrong or rights violation need not harm someone’s interests at all, unless we postulate an interest in not being wronged.</p>

<p>I am unsure whether it is consent or standing to gain that does the important normative work here. Each may be appropriate in different contexts. We might require actual consent for voluntary groups, but since some groups, such as the state, seem unavoidably non-voluntary, we might then take standing to gain to be sufficient. The two alternatives might not be so sharply distinct if, for instance, we assume that people would hypothetically consent if and only they stand to gain (see Blake, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1470594X11416782">2002</xref>).

<p>If what matters is simply the outcome, one might wonder whether under-inclusiveness matters, provided that outcomes are unchanged. Perhaps we need only enfranchise a random sample of the population, provided that their decision is representative of what the whole would choose. This idea is suggested by Sarah Birch (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1470594X11416782">2009</xref>: 26) and Ben Saunders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-1470594X11416782">2010a</xref>: 13).

<p>What follows focuses primarily on children capable of decision-making. The all-affected principle may require enfranchising future generations, which is problematic given the ‘non-identity problem’ (see Parfit, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1470594X11416782">1987</xref>: 351–80). Perhaps more problematic is that it may also require us to enfranchise past generations, since (on some accounts) we may have interests that persist and can be affected after our deaths. The deceased are no longer agents, but we can often know what they would have wanted. ‘Enfranchising’ past generations might mean a majority in favour of, for example, criminalizing homosexuality. Of course, one could respond that the majority’s external preferences should be trumped by individual rights. I leave aside such problems here.</p>

<p>I say ‘pseudo-collective agency’ because my conception of democracy does not, like perhaps Rousseau’s, posit some collective will over and above that of individuals.
