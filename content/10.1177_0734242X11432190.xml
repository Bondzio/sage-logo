<abstract>
<p>An experimental study was conducted to assess the pathogen removal efficiency of primary treatment of ecological sanitation (eco-san) system. Ash, lime and soil were used as covering and treatment materials of faeces in the system. A significant rise in pH was observed when the faeces were treated with lime and ash, with a pH value of 11.3 and 9, respectively. Lime treatment was effective in complete destruction of faecal coliforms within 24 h while ash treatment took 30 days of storage to give the same result. On the other hand, no immediate destruction of Ascaris ova was observed during primary treatment of eco-san faeces. Dehydration and storage were other parameters which were considered in the experiment. Faecal coliforms tolerated a moisture content of 3% in untreated faeces while a large number of <italic>Ascaris lumbricoides</italic> eggs were inactivated by the same level of desiccation, even in the absence of alkaline treatment. The study showed a strong direct relationship between moisture content and viability of Ascaris egg (<italic>r</italic> = 0.806, <italic>p</italic> = 0.01) and a negative correlation between viability of eggs and storage time (<italic>r</italic> = −0.895, <italic>p</italic> = 0.01). Generally, the treatment methods used in this experiment showed a substantial potential of faeces sanitization, with removals ranging from 54 to 100% after a minimum of 40 days storage.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Eco-san, short for ecological sanitation is a paradigm in sanitation that recognizes human excreta and water from households not as waste but as resources that can be recovered, treated where necessary and safely used again (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0734242X11432190">GTZ, 2005</xref>). It often refers to a dry system where the urine is diverted from the faeces (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0734242X11432190">Höglund et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0734242X11432190">Matsui, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0734242X11432190">Sondén, 1889</xref>).</p>
<p>Eco-san is an alternative approach to avoid the disadvantages of conventional waste water systems. The eco-san paradigm in sanitation is based on ecosystem approaches and the closure of material flow cycle. It does not favour a specific technology, but constitutes a philosophy in handling substances that have so far been seen merely as wastewater and water-carried waste for disposal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0734242X11432190">Langergraber and Müllegger, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0734242X11432190">Terrefe and Edstrom, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>To successfully introduce and optimize alternative wastewater systems and the utilization of waste products, it is necessary to evaluate the hygienic risk involved in the system, with a particular emphasis on minimizing the risk of disease transmission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0734242X11432190">Höglund, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0734242X11432190">Schönning and Stenström, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>Several approaches are taken in reducing the pathogen content in faeces, such as on-site treatment within the sanitation systems itself, or subsequent off-site treatment. The main reason for employing onsite treatment is to reduce volume and weight of faecal sludge facilitation simpler storage and transport while the off-site treatment, on the other hand, has the object of further reduction of pathogen content to make handling safer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0734242X11432190">Winblad and Simpson-Hébert, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>Storage is often recommended as the main on-site treatment, although the success in practice is variable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0734242X11432190">Schonning and Stenstrom, 2004</xref>). Storage is rather efficient in killing pathogens in dry, hot climates, with desiccation of the material at low moisture contents aiding the pathogen inactivation.</p>
<p>Low moisture levels, 5–25%, result in rapid pathogen destruction and also reduce odour and fly breeding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0734242X11432190">Carlander and Westrell, 1999</xref>).</p>
<p>Various studies have recommended different storage times. However the WHO guidelines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0734242X11432190">WHO, 2006</xref>) suggest that if the ambient temperature is between 2 and 20 °C, a storage period of 1.5 to 2 years will be sufficient, and for an ambient temperature of 20 to 35 °C storage duration of 1 year or more is needed. Storage is best applied alongside other measures and its success is determined by the die off of Ascaris eggs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0734242X11432190">WHO, 2006</xref>). It is recorded that Ascaris ova can be inactivated within weeks if the moisture content is maintained below 8% at temperatures of &gt; 10 °C (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0734242X11432190">EC, 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>Ash and lime can be added at a household level to provide primary treatment, raising the pH above 9 which assists microbial die off. Furthermore the addition of 1–2 cups (200–500 mL) of drying/bulking material (such as ash and/or lime) helps reduce smell, flies and moisture content. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0734242X11432190">Al-Bachir et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0734242X11432190">Schönning and Stenström, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>Studies have been carried out in different regions of the world to obtain baseline values of the efficiency of dry sanitation in relation to the die-off of different representative microbial groups. The approach in recent evaluations of eco-san has been to select more resistant representative organisms, such as viruses and parasites. The die-off of these index organisms, thereby aims to validate the process as an alternative approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0734242X11432190">Stenström, 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>The presence of <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> and other faecal (or thermotolerant) coliforms more accurately correlates with warm-blooded animal faecal discharges (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0734242X11432190">Geldreich, 1978</xref>). According to the WHO guidelines for the reuse of wastewater, faecal coliforms (FC) have been used as an indicator for hygienic quality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0734242X11432190">Blumenthal et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0734242X11432190">WHO, 1989</xref>).</p>
<p>In developing countries, helminths ova, especially eggs of Ascaris and Taenia are regarded as an indicator of hygienic quality due to their multilayered structure of chitin and lipid and their ability to survive in soils after several years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0734242X11432190">Lewis-Jones and Winkler, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0734242X11432190">Snowdon et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0734242X11432190">WHO, 1989</xref>).</p>
<p>Regarding Ecosan sludge, the viability of Ascaris ova seems to be an important parameter related to the actual infectivity of helminth eggs and determines the actual health risk on farmers and crop consumers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0734242X11432190">Jimenez et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0734242X11432190">Wheeler and Carroll, 1989</xref>).</p>
<p>Although eco-san technology is spreading all over the world and with the intention to recycle excreta to soils, few have addressed the problems associated with the revalorization practice or have documented the pathogen die-off. Moreover, few data about the microbial quality of eco-san sludges from developing countries are available, where there is a high health risk (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0734242X11432190">Cifuentes, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0734242X11432190">Jimenez et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0734242X11432190">Peasey, 2000</xref>). This study, therefore, was conducted to assess the role of drying/bulking materials such as lime, ash and soil in the reduction of index organisms to acceptable level and to provide baseline data for further studies.</p>

<title>Experimental set-up and treatment processes</title>
<p>An experimental study was done from 5 January to 30 May 2008 at the Defense University of Health Science College, Debre Zeit Campus, Ethiopia. Urine-diverting eco-san latrine was constructed for the purpose of separate collection of urine and faeces. The toilet was used by students of the college for about 30 days. As dehydration is an essential component of this sanitation system, no water was added in the processing chamber.</p>
<p>Untreated/raw faeces were dropped and accumulated into a processing chamber for 30 days. Then 500 g samples of faeces were mixed with 165 g of different drying/bulking materials (lime, wood ash and ordinary soil, separately) in the ratio of 1 : 3 and stored for another 40 days. Untreated 500 g of faeces were used as a control. The mixing was done thoroughly with sterilized forks. Each treatment group was kept separately inside the lower chamber of the toilet to maintain the same environmental condition. Owing to the relatively low hygienic risk with urine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0734242X11432190">Esrey et al., 1998</xref>), the pathogen reduction assessment of this study considered only the faecal component.</p>
<sec id="section4-0734242X11432190">
<title>Sampling</title>
<p>For microbiological analysis, 30 g of well-mixed sample was used every 10 days of the treatment processes. Samples, for FC analysis, had been thoroughly mixed using a vortex mixer (model VM-1000) for 1 min after dispersion into 270 mL of distilled water.</p>
<p>To determine pH and total solid, 10 g of sample was taken frequently for each parameter. In all cases, sterile equipment was used and necessary precautions were maintained to prevent cross-contamination of samples. All procedures were based on the United States Environmental Protection Agency (US EPA) protocol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0734242X11432190">US EPA, 2006</xref>).</p>

<p>Before the primary treatment, laboratory analysis had been done to determine the presence of Ascaris eggs in the eco-san faeces. As eggs were totally absent, the faeces were artificially contaminated with Ascaris-positive stool that was collected from elementary school children found in the study area. The mean concentration of total and viable Ascaris ova after inoculation of the faeces was 119 and 94 g<sup>−1</sup> of total solid, respectively.</p>
<p>In order to evaluate the pathogen inactivation potential of the treatment processes, Ascaris ova counting and viability test was done based on the US EPA Protocol, developed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0734242X11432190">Schwartzbrod (2003)</xref>.</p>

<title>Results and discussion</title>
<p>Treatment of eco-san faeces with ash, lime and soil gave different logarithmic (log) reduction of FC across time period (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0734242X11432190">Figure 1</xref>). No FC survived lime treatment within 24 h, which is a log 6 abatement, whereas the ash treatment resulted in the reduction of FC from 3.1 × 10<sup>6</sup> to 4.2 × 10<sup>4</sup> g TS<sup>−1</sup> within 10 days, and to 4.4 × 10<sup>3</sup> g TS<sup>−1</sup> within 20 days. Complete destruction was obtained after 30 days of storage (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0734242X11432190">Table 1</xref> below). Soil-reduced FC were reduced from 3.1 × 10<sup>6</sup> to 3.1 × 10<sup>5</sup> g TS<sup>−1</sup> within 40 days whereas untreated faeces showed no significant reduction within the same period (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0734242X11432190">Figure 1</xref>).</p>

<p>The pH value recorded for lime, ash, soil and untreated faeces during the 40 days of storage was 10.2, 9.3, 7.7 and 7.5, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0734242X11432190">Figure 2</xref>). However, fluctuation of pH in all treatment groups was observed upon storage. A comparable result was reported by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0734242X11432190">Schönning and Stenström (2004)</xref> that household-added lime and ash gave pH values of 10.5 and 9.4, respectively, and variability was also observed during storage.</p>

<p>Moreover, the study revealed negative correlation (<italic>r</italic> = −0.789, <italic>p</italic> = 0.01) between the pH value and the number of FC bacteria. Therefore, this reduction of the bacterial indicator within a short period of time might be the result of the high pH obtained in the treatment. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0734242X11432190">Phasha (2006)</xref> reported similar results in terms of FC destruction for faeces from an eco-san latrine treated with sodium hydroxide (NaOH).</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0734242X11432190">Wang (1999)</xref> conducted a similar study mixing a plant ash with faeces in a ratio of 1 : 3 yielding a pH of 9–10. More than 7 log<sub>10</sub> reduction of phages and FC was recorded after 6 months. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0734242X11432190">Phasha, (2006)</xref> reported 1 log<sub>10</sub> reduction of FC within 8 days of storage of ash-treated sludge and a study in Vietnam reported greater than 7 log<sub>10</sub> reduction after 3 months of storage ( <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0734242X11432190">Carlander and Westrell, 1999</xref>). This suggests the influence of storage time to obtain a high reduction of FC after sludge is treated with ash. A 6 log<sub>10</sub> reduction of FC within 30 days of ash treatment, in the present study is remarkably fast.</p>
<p>On the other hand, no immediate destruction of Ascaris eggs was observed during the treatment of eco-san faeces (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0734242X11432190">Figure 3</xref>). Complete inactivation of viable eggs was obtained after 30 days of treatment with lime and ash. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0734242X11432190">Figure 4</xref>)</p>

<p>Ash treatment was effective for complete removal of both viable and non-viable eggs after 40 days of storage, which is faster in reduction compared to a 6 month period of reduction observed in Vietnam. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0734242X11432190">Carlander and Westrell, 1999</xref>). No significant correlation was observed between the pH value and viability of Ascaris eggs (<italic>P</italic> &gt; 0.05).</p>
<p>Substantial reduction of moisture content was observed during storage of eco-san faeces for 40 days (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0734242X11432190">Figure 5</xref>). The moisture content of faeces which were stored for 30 days in the vault (before the addition of drying/bulking materials and the 40 days of storage) was 15.3%. In all treatment groups, the moisture content of faeces on the 40th day of storage was below 4%, which is beneficial in inactivation of helminths ova (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0734242X11432190">EC, 2001</xref>). The moisture reduction may be due to the high temperatures inside the chamber (mean day light temperature of 29.5 °C) and the small volume of faeces used in this experiment. Thus, longer times of storage may be required for larger volumes of faeces in the processing vault to achieve the same level of desiccation.</p>
<fig id="fig5-0734242X11432190" position="float">

<caption><p>Moisture reduction during 40 days of storage.</p></caption>

<p>This experiment revealed that FC tolerated a moisture content of 3% in untreated sludge whereas a large number of Ascaris eggs were inactivated by the same level of desiccation, even in the absence of alkaline treatment. A strong direct relationship between moisture content and viability of Ascaris egg (<italic>r</italic> = 0.806, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01) was observed. Strong inverse relation between viability of eggs and storage time (<italic>r</italic> = −0.895, <italic>p</italic> = 0.01) was also observed, implying that helminths eggs are more sensitive to desiccation and storage than bacterial strains. Therefore, reduction of moisture content and faeces storage could play a significant role in reduction of these microbial groups in combination with other treatment factors.</p>
<p>As summarized in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0734242X11432190">Table 1</xref>, in the present experimental study, all Ascaris eggs and FC were inactivated within 40 days of treatment using ash and lime, resulting in 100% reduction. This means that the use of ash or lime in on-site treatment of eco-san systems can provide fast and complete removal of pathogens.</p>

<p>The number of viable egg following lime and ash treatment was zero whereas untreated faeces (simply dried and stored faeces) and faeces mixed with soil contained higher numbers of indicator organisms. Therefore, according to the World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines (which require less than 1 viable helminths egg L<sup>−1</sup> of waste water; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0734242X11432190">WHO (1989)</xref>), the treated faeces are considered hygienically safe and can be used for agricultural purposes without restrictions. Based on the US EPA classification for reuse of bio-solids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0734242X11432190">Stenström, 2001</xref>), the treated faeces fulfil the requirement to class A biosolid since it resulted in less than 1000 most probable number (MPN) FC g<sup>−1</sup> of total solid in less than 40 days.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>On-site treatment with ash and lime could result in efficient removal of pathogens if process conditions such as dose and time of contact are optimized. Ash appeared to be more effective for the removal of helminths egg whereas lime has a fast knock-down effect on bacterial organisms.</p>
<p>Dehydration and storage alone played a significant role in the reduction of the viable helminths eggs, but did not lead to significant reduction of bacterial indicators. Soil addition was inefficient in inactivating microbes to acceptable levels. Therefore, simple dehydration and storage, or the use of soil as a drying/bulking material of eco-san faeces should not be considered as viable treatment options.</p>
<p>It is likely that the treatment approach tested here will be most useful in hot climatic regions where considerable reductions of moisture can be achieved.</p>
