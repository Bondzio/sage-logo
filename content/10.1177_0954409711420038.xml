<abstract>
<p>Tilting trains are a mature technology using either hydraulic or electrical actuation to perform carbody tilting to reduce centrifugal force in curves at passengers level, thereby maintaining a good passenger comfort at enhanced service speed. The hydraulic actuation systems used in tilting trains operate at constant pressure, which is established to allow operation against the maximum loads at minimum ambient temperatures. However, these conditions occur seldom and unnecessary power is dissipated as heat under normal operating conditions that typically occur for more than 95 per cent of the service time. A research activity was performed to define a variable pressure system which adapts the discharge pressure as a function of the outside temperature and of the force to be developed by the actuators. In this system, the variable pressure is established as a function of an appropriate control strategy in order to minimize the power losses while keeping the required dynamic performance. This system architecture enables the tilting actuation system to save from 25 per cent to 50 per cent power for its operation depending on the severity of the track and on the operating conditions. This power saving is a small fraction (0.3–0.5 per cent) of the maximum traction power, but it is a large saving (10–20 per cent) of theelectrical power required by the train auxiliary systems. The electrical accumulators and the 400 V/50 Hz generators can thus be made smaller reducing the weight and facilitating the components installation. Moreover, lower average heat dissipation and lower average system pressure lead to a reduction of size and weight of the heat exchanger and to lower stresses in the system components. The overall weight reduction on its turn leads to an indirect power saving.</p>
<p>This article presents a description of the system and of the control strategy providing the adaptivity of the pump discharge pressure and the simulations of the system behaviour at different environmental conditions. This is done for a train in service along tracks for which the time histories of train speed, acceleration, and tilt angles were known.</p>

<sec id="sec1-0954409711420038"><title>1 THE TILTING TRAIN</title>
<p>The purpose of tilting trains is to reduce the centrifugal force along the curves at passengers level and, therefore, to maintain a better or equivalent passenger comfort with respect to the lateral acceleration (and the consequent lateral force) on same curves geometry at enhanced service speed. This is obtained by performing carbody tilting towards curve's inner side, which provides a superelevation of the carbody with respect to the track cant, thereby increasing thelateral component of the weight opposing the corresponding component of the centrifugal force. By tilting the carbody of a rail passenger vehicle relative to the track plane during curve negotiation, it is therefore possible to operate at speeds higher than might have been acceptable to passengers in a non-tilting vehicle, and thus reducing overall trip time. The recognized advantage of tilting trains, as described in several papers such as references [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0954409711420038">1</xref></bold>–<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0954409711420038">3</xref></bold>], is to increase the achievable service speed for passenger trains on existing tracks without being forced to invest very large sums of money to build a dedicated new track or to alter the geometry of the existing curves. A total of about 1000 tilting trains are nowadays in service worldwide.</p>
<p>Carbody tilting can be obtained with either passive or active systems. In a passive system, the centrifugal force itself causes the carbody tilting, while active systems use a suitably controlled actuation system to generate the force necessary to tilt the carbody. Although passive systems are simpler and do not require a dedicated power source for their operation, the tilt angle is normally limited to 3°; this is due to the fact that the centre of rotation of passive tilting systems must be in a high position and distant from the centre of mass for providing a sufficient arm to thecentrifugal force, which causes a large lateral displacement of the lower parts of the carbody when it tilts. To prevent a possible interference with walls along the track, the tilt angle and the maximum service speed are hence limited. For this reason, the vast majority of tilting trains use an active technology and reach tilt angles up to 8°.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec2-0954409711420038"><title>2 THE ACTUATION SYSTEM</title>
<p>Both hydraulic and electromechanical actuation systems have been used to provide the controlled force necessary to tilt the carbodies of the train vehicles. The first tilting trains used hydraulic actuation systems, then the preference of the train manufacturers seemed to veer towards electromechanical actuation, but hydraulic actuation technology has again been used in recent applications. The hydraulic actuation systems for carbody tilting consist of hydraulic linear actuators accepting the controlled hydraulic flow from hydraulic power generation units located at the centre of each train vehicle, with each hydraulic power generation unit consisting of an electrically driven pump, accumulator, reservoir, filters, and a complement of control and protection valves. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0954409711420038">Figure 1</xref> shows the concept block diagram of a hydraulic actuation system for tilting trains. For the research activity, reference was made to the requirements for the hydraulic actuation systems for the tilting trains recently built by Alstom.
<fig id="fig1-0954409711420038" position="float"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Concept block diagram of a hydraulic actuation system for tilting trains</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0954409711420038-fig1.tif"/></fig></p>
<p>During system operation, pressure losses develop in the servovalve and in the internal passageways of the hydraulic power generation unit, and in the pipework interconnecting the hydraulic power generation unit with the actuators. The servovalve is normally sized such to generate a pressure drop in the order of 30 per cent of the system pressure to ensure optimal control and a safe margin for allowing system operation in case of abnormal high loads; the othersystem components should create pressure drops aslow as possible to minimize the energy losses. Acritical issue with the hydraulic actuation systems for tilting trains is however to reach a good balance between two conflicting needs: minimizing the pressure losses in the pipes connecting the hydraulic power unit to the actuators, and limiting the size and weight of the same pipes. The main issue is the large pressure loss occurring at very low temperatures between the centrally located hydraulic power generation unit and the actuators placed on the bogies at two ends of the train vehicle. The length of the hydraulic lines between the hydraulic power generation unit and the actuators is typically greater than 10 m; these hydraulic lines are exposed to the outside environment with external temperatures that can fall to extremely low values in harsh winter conditions. The temperature of the hydraulic fluid within the hydraulic power generation unit never falls below 0°C due to the power dissipation of the pump and of the servovalve, but it progressively decreases along the pipes connecting the hydraulic power generation unit to the actuators. When the train travels for some time along a straight track and no tilting iscommanded, the hydraulic fluid in the pipes is stationary and its temperature profile rapidly reaches temperatures close to the outside air temperature. As a result, when a tilting command is issued and hydraulic fluid flows through the pipes, a large pressure drop originates between the hydraulic power unit and the actuators.</p>
<p>In order to meet the performance requirements at very low temperatures, the hydraulic systems for tilting trains are designed with a suitable combination of pump discharge pressure, pipes internal diameter, and actuators diameter in order to develop the maximum force at maximum rate at very low temperature. However, this design approach, though effective, brings about an unnecessary power dissipation in the vast majority of operating conditions. If the pump discharge pressure must be kept at a value high enough to make up for the pressure drops through the pipes at very low temperatures, that means that more power than necessary is converted into heat at normal temperatures due to greater internal leakages and to greater throttling through the flow control servovalve necessary to lower the pressure from that delivered by the pump to that necessary to balance the actuators loads. Internal leakages in particular are the major source of heat generation. Itis known that hydraulic power is the product of flow × pressure; since the internal leakages are, on their turn, a function of the supply pressure, the hydraulic power loss is an exponential function of the supply pressure, with the exponent in the range from 1.5 (for turbulent leakage flows) to 2 (for laminar leakage flows). The conclusion is that thepresent hydraulic systems dissipate unnecessary power under normal operating conditions that normally occur for more than 95 per cent of the service time.</p>

<sec id="sec3-0954409711420038"><title>3 ENERGY SAVING WITH A VARIABLE PRESSURE SYSTEM</title>
<p>Moving from a constant pressure to a variable pressure system in which the pump discharge pressure is modulated according to the system operational requirements is the logical step to improve the hydraulic system efficiency. Load-sensing hydraulic systems are well known and are commonly used in several industrial and mobile applications. A comprehensive description of different types of industrial variable pressure hydraulic systems can be found in the book of Henke [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0954409711420038">4</xref></bold>]. The only known aerospace application of a variable pressure hydraulic system is the Air Flow Control System of the Eurojet EJ200 engine, in which the discharge pressure of a variable delivery pump is modulated as a function of the load pressure of the hydraulic actuators controlling the variable exhaust area of the engine. One of the authors of this article contributed to that system design. The case of hydraulic systems for tilting trains is however more complex for the following reasons
<list id="list1-0954409711420038" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>The actuators are located far away from the hydraulic control unit and the load pressure in the actuator can be very different from that at the corresponding servovalve control port because of the pressure losses along the hydraulic lines connecting the servovalve to the actuator which occur when tilting is commanded and the actuators are moving. In the trains taken as a reference for this study, these pressure drops are relatively small (less than 1 MPa) at normal ambient temperature, but reach 6 MPa for an outside ambient temperature of −40°C.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The dynamic response of the tilting system must be very rapid and be very little dependent on the load. Hence, the pump discharge pressure must adapt to a rapidly varying actuator load with minimum time delay; a lag in the response of the discharge pressure control system would entail a corresponding lag in attaining the required carbody tilt angle with a reduction of the quality of the ride and of the passengers comfort.</p></list-item>
</list></p>
<p>These two issues were duly addressed in the definition of the variable pressure system architecture and of its control strategy.</p>
<p>As it will be outlined in the following of this article, the innovative hydraulic system for tilting trains defined in this research has a pump fitted with a variable pressure compensator capable of establishing a discharge pressure which is a function of both the outside temperature and the force to be developed by the actuators. The compensator accepts as an input a pressure signal which is a function of an appropriate control strategy, thereby varying the pump compensation pressure in the most efficient way.</p>
<p>The maximum and minimum pressures for the variable pressure system were established according to the following rationale. The maximum pressure was set to 35 MPa because this is the maximum operating pressure of many commercially available hydraulic components. A higher pressure might offer some further advantage in reducing the overall system weight, but would require the use of specially designed components, which was ruled out. The minimum pressure was defined by the need of maintaining a good dynamic response of the servovalve. A bandwidth of 70 Hz for the servovalve is necessary for the tilting system taken as a reference for this research work, and this bandwidth can be met if the supply pressure is not lower than 18 MPa.</p>
<p>Since the force to be developed by the actuators isproportional to the train tilt angle, a control logic was established that determines the optimal pump discharge pressure as a function of both the outside air temperature and of the tilt command up to the maximum of 35 MPa for the worst conditions of minimum temperature and maximum tilt angle. This control logic entails both direct and indirect powersavings. The direct power saving is obviously determined by the lower average power consumption; the indirect power saving is associated to the lower size and weight of the heat exchanger, of itselectrically driven cooling fan and of the train 400 V/50 Hz electrical generator. Additional benefits are also brought about by the average lower stresses in the system components with a consequent increase of the system reliability and life.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec4-0954409711420038"><title>4 ARCHITECTURE OF THE VARIABLE PRESSURE SYSTEM</title>
<p>The general architecture of the hydraulic system for tilting trains considered in this research was shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0954409711420038">Fig. 1</xref>. Each train vehicle has its own hydraulic power generation and control unit (HPGCU) located in a central position, four hydraulic actuators: two on the front bogie and two on the rear bogie, and the pipework interconnecting the actuators with the HPGCU.</p>
<p>The present systems use an electrically driven, pressure compensated, variable delivery pump to generate the pressurized fluid flow which is delivered at an approximately constant pressure. The variablepressure system studied in this research has the additional feature of adapting the discharge pressure to the actuators requests as it will be discussed in thenext section of this article. The control of the flowto the actuators is performed by a two-stage electrohydraulic servovalve, which acts as the power-modulating component of a position servoloop.</p>
<p>The tilt angle of each train vehicle is commanded by the train electronics as a function of the lateral acceleration, and a position servoloop is created for each vehicle in which the tilt command is compared with the actual tilt angle of the vehicle carbody. Theresulting error is processed by an appropriate control law that eventually generates the input signal to the servovalve.</p>
<p>The variable pressure system herein described accepts from the train electronics two additional input signals that make it adaptive to the environmental and to the operating conditions:
<list id="list2-0954409711420038" list-type="alpha-lower">
<list-item><p>an oil temperature (OT) signal;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>a load precursor (LP) signal.</p></list-item>
</list></p>
<p>These two signals are appropriately processed to determine the optimal value of the pump discharge pressure with the aim of minimizing the power consumption while ensuring the necessary system performance (accuracy, transient response, and stability). The algorithm used to evaluate the optimal discharge pressure is described in the following section. Since the variation of the pump discharge pressure causes a variation of the servovalve flow and pressure gains, the computed value of the discharge pressure is also used to modify the gains of the servoloop control law in order to maintain constant stability margins independent of the pressure.</p>
<p>The LP signal is determined knowing which loadsare going to act upon the actuators as the train travels along the track. A train in revenue service moves along tracks whose geometrical characteristics (radius of curvature and cant) are well known. Since the train position at each instant in time is known, asit is its speed, the tilt angles necessary to compensate the lateral acceleration for the upcoming track are known in advance and the discharge pressure can be varied with sufficient lead time to obtain the right value at the right instant in time. The only uncertainty is related to the actual mass of the train vehicle that varies within a minimum for an empty vehicle to maximum for full load. However, the range of the vehicle mass is typically 20 per cent of maximum, which leads to a limited departure from optimal performance. The variable pressure algorithm defines the discharge pressure for the case of maximum vehicle mass; if the mass will actually be lower, that would imply a slightly higher pressure than necessary.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec5-0954409711420038"><title>5 ADAPTIVE PRESSURE CONTROL</title>
<p>The first step undertaken to determine the pressure control strategy was to assess the minimum value of the supply pressure necessary to ensure that the hydraulic actuators can develop the necessary force to tilt the carbody at the required speed. Such pressure is a function of the commanded tilt angle since the moment arm of the carbody weight with respect to the centre of rotation increases with the increasing tilt angle. However, the pressure is also a function ofthe OT because the pressure losses through the hydraulic components depend on the density and the viscosity of the hydraulic fluid, that are temperature dependent quantities. A relationship was hence obtained which relates the necessary supply pressure to both the tilt angle and the hydraulic fluid temperature. A three-dimensional diagram derived from thisrelationship is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0954409711420038">Fig. 2</xref>. The pressure shown inthis diagram is the one required at the pump discharge port during tilting system operation at the maximum rate, which is the result of: pressure necessary to balance the actuators loads, pressure losses in the pipes, pressure losses in the internal passageways and components (servovalve, check valve, filter, etc.) of the hydraulic power generation unit.
<fig id="fig2-0954409711420038" position="float"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><p>Required supply pressure as a function of tilt angle and hydraulic fluid temperature</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0954409711420038-fig2.tif"/></fig></p>
<p>It was stated before that a minimum discharge pressure of 18 MPa was established for the variable pressure system; this pressure is definitely greater than the minimum necessary for the actuation system operation at low tilt angles and normal OTs. Establishing a lower threshold for the minimum discharge pressure would bring about a further energy saving when low tilt angles are commanded, but on the other hand would entail some disadvantages. The issues associated with a low discharge pressure are: slower dynamic response of the flow control servovalve, greater time to charge the accumulator when a greater discharge pressure is required and larger number of fatigue cycles in the hydraulic system components. As a result of a tradeoff analysis on the lower pressure threshold, the best solution turned out to set a minimum value for the supply pressure equal to 18 MPa and let the supply pressure increase only when its required value goes above thatlimit. This solution offers a good compromise between the need of reducing the energy consumption, limiting the number of pressure cycles, maintaining a good servovalve dynamic response, and limiting the charge up time of the accumulator from minimum to maximum pressure.</p>
<p>When the train travels along a track, the required tilt angles are known in advance since the position of the train is known, as well as its speed. The pressure control strategy was defined such to continuously consider which are the tilt angles required in the next 35 s of travel, hence generating an LP signal entailing a supply pressure command equal to the maximum pressure required over that period of time based on the diagram of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0954409711420038">Fig. 2</xref> corrected with the minimum pressure limit. The lead time of 35 s was established on the basis of the amount of timeneeded to pressurize the hydraulic system from 18 to 35 MPa for the worst combination of operational conditions. The most critical situation is when the accumulator pressure must grow from 18 to 35 MPa while the train is travelling along a curved track and tilting must meanwhile be performed. Inthis case, most of the pump flow is used by the actuators to perform the carbody tilting and only a fraction of the total pump flow is left for charging the accumulator. The accumulators used in the hydraulic systems for tilting trains are large because they have to provide the amount of pressurized fluid volume necessary to allow two full tilt cycles in case of a temporary loss of the electrical power supply and hence of the pump operation, which justifies the relatively long lead time established for the pressure setting variation.</p>
<p>Once the required supply pressure level is defined, the control pressure for the variable pressure compensator is determined. The schematic of the variable pressure compensator is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0954409711420038">Fig. 3</xref>. Aconventional pressure compensator is modified such to accept a variable pressure on the side wherethe spring is located. In the traditional pressure compensator that pressure is maintained constant by connecting that chamber of the pressure compensator to return. In the variable pressure compensator that same pressure is modulated, thereby modifying the pump compensation pressure. For the specific system which was considered in this research, the control pressure <italic>p<sub>x</sub></italic> varied from 0.186 MPa when the required pump compensation pressure was 18 MPa, to 2.075 MPa when the required pump compensation pressure was 35 MPa. The modulation of the control pressure <italic>p<sub>x</sub></italic> is obtained by a pressure control loop in which the pressure <italic>p<sub>x</sub></italic> is measured by a pressure sensor and the pressure error is processed by a control law whose output signal determines the value of the input voltage to a four-way proportional control valve. An alternative could be to create an on–off control in which the system pressure is kept at 18 MPa and is switched to 35 MPa above a limit tilt angle. This control would anyhow require an electrically operated valve and would be less efficient in reducing the average power consumption, and wastherefore not further considered in the research activity.
<fig id="fig3-0954409711420038" position="float"><label>Fig. 3</label><caption><p>Schematic of the variable pressure compensator</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0954409711420038-fig3.tif"/></fig></p>
<p>The pressure control loop for the control of pressure <italic>p<sub>x</sub></italic> and hence of the supply pressure of thehydraulic system makes use of a proportional valve and not of a servovalve because the control of the system pressure does not require a fast response since it is determined by the LP signal; on the other hand, since the main purpose of the adaptive pressure system is to minimize the energy consumption, part of the energy saving obtained by the variable pressure system would be offset by the additional internal leakage of an electrohydraulic servovalve. Aproportional valve does not have the quiescent flow of the first stage of electrohydraulic servovalves; moreover, the flow to be controlled is very small and the internal leakage through the spool of the proportional valve is limited to 0.05 L/min, with a resulting average power loss of only about 20 W.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec6-0954409711420038"><title>6 TILT ANGLE CONTROL</title>
<p>The carbody tilt angle of each train vehicle is commanded by the train electronics as a function of thexlateral acceleration, and a position servoloop is created for each vehicle in which the commands are compared with the actual tilt angle in order to close the position feedback loop. The servoloop position errors are processed by an appropriate control lawthat eventually generates the input signals to the controlling servovalves.</p>
<p>The control law (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0954409711420038">Fig. 4</xref>) is based on a PID controller with a relatively low value of the integrator gain and a saturation on the integrator output. The function ofthe integrator is in fact to compensate for the steadystate, or slow varying servovalve offsets, while the dynamic performance is dependent on the proportional and derivative gains of the control law. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0954409711420038">Fig. 4</xref>, <italic>θ<sub>c</sub></italic> is the tilt angle command, <italic>θ<sub>f</sub></italic> the feedback signal, <italic>θ<sub>e</sub></italic> the tilt angle error, and <italic>i</italic> the servovalve current.
<fig id="fig4-0954409711420038" position="float"><label>Fig. 4</label><caption><p>Control law block diagram for the tilt angle control system</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0954409711420038-fig4.tif"/></fig></p>
<p>A characteristic of this control law is that the derivative gain <italic>k<sub>d</sub></italic> is not constant, but it is a function of therate of change of the tilt angle error. The derivative gain is zero when the absolute value of the time derivative of the tilt angle error is below a lower threshold <inline-formula id="ilm1-0954409711420038"><mml:math xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="inline" id="mml-math1-0954409711420038"><mml:mrow><mml:mo>|</mml:mo><mml:mover><mml:mrow><mml:mi>θ</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mi>·</mml:mi></mml:mover><mml:mo>|</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi/><mml:mrow><mml:mi>MIN</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula>, then it increases linearly and remains constant and equal to a maximum value above an upper threshold <inline-formula id="ilm2-0954409711420038"><mml:math xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="inline" id="mml-math2-0954409711420038"><mml:mrow><mml:mo>|</mml:mo><mml:mover><mml:mrow><mml:mi>θ</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mi>·</mml:mi></mml:mover><mml:mo>|</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi/><mml:mrow><mml:mi>MIN</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula>. This gain scheduling makes the control law non-linear with the rate of change of the tilt angle error, with the advantage of making the overall control system more responsive to the rapid changes of the tilt angle command, while minimizing its sensitiveness to the noise present in the command and feedback signals.</p>
<p>The above-described control law works well for a constant pressure system where the values of the control parameters are tuned in accordance with the values of the physical parameters of the hydraulic actuation system. However, the pressure and flow gains of the servovalve controlling the flow to the hydraulic actuators are dependent on the supply pressure. Therefore, in order to maintain the optimal performance in a variable pressure system, the control parameters must be adapted to the system pressure. In particular, the servovalve flow gain (ratio between control flow and input current) is the most critical pressure-dependent parameter affecting the dynamic response of the control system and is proportional to the square root of the supply pressure minus the load pressure. The maximum value of the flow gain occurs when the actuator is unloaded, and for this condition the flow gain is simply proportional to the square root of the supply pressure. The control law shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0954409711420038">Fig. 4</xref> was then made adaptive to the supply pressure by dividing the control parameters bythe square root of the supply pressure. This procedure ensures that the servoloop stability margins are unchanged and that the system dynamic response is little affected; it is a simple procedure and does notrequire any additional sensors since the system supply pressure is measured by an already existing pressure transducer.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec7-0954409711420038"><title>7 MERITS OF A VARIABLE PRESSURE SYSTEM</title>
<p>In order to assess the merits of the pressure adaptive control system for the control of the tilt angle of tilting trains, two significant cases were studied relevant to a train travelling along tracks creating medium and severe duty cycles for the tilt control system. The performance assessment was made taking advantage of a very detailed mathematical model developed by the authors for the simulation of a hydraulically actuated tilt control system. This model is of a physical-based type in which all system components are described by the mathematical relationships among the state variables and the physical parameters. The key features of the mathematical model are the following.
<list id="list3-0954409711420038" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>The pump output flow is calculated taking into account the dependency of the internal leakages, and thus the pump volumetric efficiency, on the discharge pressure and on the hydraulic fluid temperature. Internal leakages are computed as leakages through small orifices and the discharge coefficient is varied as a function of the Reynolds number. It was also taken into account the dependency of the internal leakages from the pump displacement. The mathematical model also computes the instantaneous torque necessary to drive the pump and then the mechanical power at the pump shaft and the electrical power drawn from the train electrical system.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The servovalve mathematical model includes the mathematical description of first- and second-stage dynamics, of all the internal flow networks (from supply to control to return, first and second stage internal leakages) and takes into account the variations of the discharge coefficient with the Reynolds number.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The accumulator model describes the behaviours of the liquid and gas section; in particular, the thermodynamic equations describing the gas section take into account the heat transfer between the gas, the oil and the ambient.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The pipes interconnecting the HPGCU with the actuator are modelled with a distributed parameters model, in which resistance, capacitance and inertance effects are described. The heat generation associated with the pressure drops through the pipes and the transfer to the environment is taken into account; thus, the actual progressive variation of the hydraulic fluid temperature along the pipes is computed by the model.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The hydraulic linear actuators mathematical model duly considers the effect of the stiffness ofthe actuators attachment points in order to address the mechanical compliance of the underlying structure.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The mathematical model of the tilting carbody addresses the tilting carbody dynamics and the associated kinematics: the position of the centre of mass and that of the instantaneous centre of rotation are continuously computed, as well as the arms of the forces developed by the hydraulic actuators. The viscous and frictional losses associated to the carbody tilting are also included in the model.</p></list-item>

<p>This model of the train tilting systems and proved to be very accurate when compared with the datameasured during revenue service operations. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0954409711420038">Figure 5</xref> shows an example of correlation between model results and test data. The comparison between model results and test data was performed on existing trains whose tilting actuation systems operate at a constant high pressure, but since the model results and test data correlate very well for any tilt angle, andthus for any pressure in the actuators, a similar simulation accuracy is reasonably expected from the model for lower supply pressures in the operating range of the variable pressure system. The favourable comparison of the simulation model results with the test data provided the necessary confidence for using this model to perform a comparison between the energy consumptions of a conventional constant pressure and of a variable pressure system, as described in the following of this article.

<p>For each of the two reference tracks considered toassess the energy saving provided by a variable pressure system the travel of the train at the rated service speed was simulated and at each instant in time the accelerations that the train would encounter in the forthcoming 35 s of travel were computed. Tocounter the effect of these lateral accelerations, the necessary tilt angle was hence calculated.</p>
<p>Two separate sets of simulations were then performed for each of the two cases. Firstly, simulations were carried out for a constant pressure system and the total energy consumption necessary to operate the system over the entire route was eventually determined. The energy consumption was determined by integrating with time the instantaneous electrical power, which was calculated. Then, a corresponding simulation was performed for the adaptive system, the total energy consumption was determined andthe saving with respect to the previous case was calculated. For each reference track, simulations were performed at different temperatures. Examples of portions of the simulations results are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0954409711420038">Figs 6</xref> to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11-0954409711420038">11</xref>.

<p>The medium duty cycle refers to a track in southern Italy, from Battipaglia to Reggio Calabria, where thehydraulic tilting system is not heavily used since the train encounters sharp curves only in limited parts of the track (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0954409711420038">Fig. 6</xref>). The corresponding required supply pressure is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0954409711420038">Fig. 7</xref>, while <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-0954409711420038">Fig. 8</xref> shows the instantaneous power consumption for an externaltemperature of 0°C for the cases of constant andadaptive pressure systems. The average power consumption of the tilting system over the entire route at different ambient temperatures is reported in conclusive <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12-0954409711420038">Fig. 12</xref>.
<fig id="fig12-0954409711420038" position="float"><label>Fig. 12</label><caption><p>Average power saving for the adaptive, variable pressure, system</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0954409711420038-fig12.tif"/></fig></p>
<p>The severe duty cycle refers to a track in Central Germany, from Lichtenfels to Saafeld, where the hydraulic tilting system is heavily used from the beginning to the end of the track due to a great number of sharp bends (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-0954409711420038">Fig. 9</xref>). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10-0954409711420038">Figure 10</xref> shows therequired supply pressure, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11-0954409711420038">Fig. 11</xref> shows the instantaneous power consumption for the two cases of constant and adaptive pressure systems. It can be seen from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11-0954409711420038">Fig. 11</xref> that the instantaneous power saving is lower than for the previous case, but still significantly large. The average power consumption of the tilting system over the entire route at different ambient temperatures is reported in conclusive <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12-0954409711420038">Fig. 12</xref>.</p>
<p>It is interesting to notice that there are a few instances during the train travel in which the instantaneous power demand for the variable pressure system is greater than that of the constant pressure system at the same instant in time. The reason for thatis that when a forthcoming sharp curve of the track is signalled by the LP signal, and a greater system pressure is commanded, a large flowrate is required for a few seconds to compensate for the increase of the volume of hydraulic fluid inside the accumulator. This occasionally larger power demand for the variable pressure system is however little significant and does not change the overall energy saving attainable with the variable pressure system.</p>

<sec id="sec8-0954409711420038"><title>8 CONCLUSIONS</title>
<p>The study presented in this article shows how an adaptive control system can use the available information of the track characteristics for a given train route and of the hydraulic fluid temperature to modulate the supply pressure of a hydraulic system providing the power necessary to perform the tilting operation with maximum efficiency and minimum energy consumption. The energy saving depends on the severity of the route and on the ambient conditions; it is maximum for routes with smooth curves requiring low tilt angles and with high temperatures. Two specific cases were analysed: a medium and a severe route, and the performance of the constant and adaptive pressure systems were compared. The results of the simulations performed are summarized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12-0954409711420038">Fig. 12</xref>, showing that the variable pressure system provides a power saving for the tilt angle operation from 24 per cent to 36 per cent for a severe track, and from 48 per cent to 55 per cent for a medium track.</p>
<p>A compelling evidence can thus be gained on the possibility of making a smart use of all available information in association with a slight modification of thepressure compensator of the hydraulic system pump to greatly reduce the energy consumption of the trains tilting systems for the trains that presently are in revenue service.</p>
