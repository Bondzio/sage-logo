<abstract>
<p>Biomedical data visualization and modeling rely predominately on manual processing and utilization of voxel- and facet-based homogeneous models. Biological structures are naturally heterogeneous and it is important to incorporate properties, such as material composition, size and shape, into the modeling process. A method to approximate image density data with a continuous B-spline surface is presented. The proposed approach generates a density point cloud, based on medical image data to reproduce heterogeneity across the image, through point densities. The density point cloud is ordered and approximated with a set of B-spline curves. A B-spline surface is lofted through the cross-sectional B-spline curves preserving the heterogeneity of the point cloud dataset. Preliminary results indicate that the proposed methodology produces a mathematical representation capable of capturing and preserving density variations with high fidelity.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Ongoing developments in the field of medical imagining have pushed the frontiers of modern medicine and biomedical engineering, prompting the need for new applications to improve diagnosis, treatment and prevention. A wide range of medical image acquisition techniques, such as X-ray, computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are currently employed to produce accurate portrayals of the body interior. Contiguous image slices produced by these methods are customarily stacked to produce 3D views of the patient’s anatomy.</p>
<p>Originally, existing computer-aided design (CAD) representations have been developed based on the premise of material homogeneity. Until recently, geometry information has been the primary focus of classical solid modeling<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0954411912452995">1</xref></sup> and thus remained limited to homogenous material representation. Therefore, traditional CAD modeling techniques are inadequate for biomedical applications.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0954411912452995">2</xref></sup></p>
<p>Introducing heterogeneity into the design process of natural materials, such as bones and soft tissues, allows the creation of more accurate models suitable for subsequent analysis and simulations, with a wide range of applications in biomedical engineering, such as tissue engineering and manufacturing, and design of patient-specific prosthetic devices. The most current advances in heterogeneous modeling focus mainly on manufacturing and solid free-form fabrication<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0954411912452995">3</xref></sup> for the purpose of designing and manufacturing multi-material objects. In this article, we introduce a mathematical framework for the B-spline heterogeneous model that is capable of preserving and reproducing tissue density variations based on the intensity data from medical imaging, such as MRI and CT scans.</p>

<title>Heterogeneous modeling prior work</title>
<p>Heterogeneous solid modeling is an emerging area of research that, owing to advances in manufacturing, computing and imaging technologies, has continued to generate a great deal of interest. Although traditionally CAD modeling has remained homogeneous, introducing heterogeneity into the modeling process is crucial for more adequate design and manufacturing of biological components.</p>
<p>Heterogeneous modeling is an interdisciplinary field that involves the knowledge of CAD, computer-aided manufacture (CAM) and other related fields, and has a wealth of applications in biomedical, electrical, optical, aeronautical and an array of other fields.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0954411912452995">4</xref></sup> Owing to such a diverse list of applications, a wide range of heterogeneous modeling schemes have emerged that differ in their representation of geometry, materials and the mappings between them.</p>
<p>Since heterogeneous modeling is a highly interdisciplinary area, spanning across CAD, CAM and computer-aided engineering (CAE) fields, each of these domains produced various representations with distinct emphases.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0954411912452995">4</xref></sup> In general, CAD representations focus primarily on modeling schemes for both geometry and material heterogeneity, while CAE research is based on analytical and numerical solutions to simulate the heterogeneity. Given the wealth of approaches and proposed solutions, it would not be possible to cover all the existing works in the scope of this article; instead we will give a structural overview of the major approaches followed by the discussion of the prominent works related to our approach.</p>
<p>Kou and Tan<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0954411912452995">4</xref></sup> surveyed and classified the existing representations into three categories: evaluated, unevaluated and composite models. While this classification is not unique, it gives a constructive overview of the existing schemes.</p>
<p>Unevaluated models utilize space discretization in order to represent material distributions. The object interior can be represented using a mesh or a collection of voxels. The accuracy of these models is coupled tightly with the resolution and can be quite satisfactory for modeling simple and regular material distributions.</p>
<p>Modeling complex and irregular heterogeneities, as demonstrated in biological materials, remains a non-trivial task. Evaluated models are resolution independent, concise and mathematically rigorous and are thus more suitable for modeling of complex material distributions. These models utilize exact geometric representations, such as boundary and functional representation (FRep) schemes, to model the materials. Some of the unevaluated models schemes are feature-based modeling,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0954411912452995">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0954411912452995">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0954411912452995">6</xref></sup> FRep modeling<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0954411912452995">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0954411912452995">7</xref></sup> and set-based schemes modeling.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0954411912452995">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0954411912452995">9</xref></sup></p>
<p>A number of B-spline methods for heterogeneous modeling have been proposed. Quin and Dutta<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0954411912452995">10</xref></sup> used B-spline tensor product representation for heterogeneous turbine blade modeling. The existing B-spline tensor representation was extended to model material compositions and each point in the parametric domain was coupled with a corresponding material composition point. Since the same set of points is used to represent both the geometry and the material composition, material property coverage is limited.</p>
<p>Bhatt and Warkhedkar<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0954411912452995">11</xref></sup> proposed a B-spline surface representation method to create slice models from CT scan data. The approach utilizes the B-spline hyperpatch tensor product representation proposed in Kumar and Dutta.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0954411912452995">9</xref></sup> Using manually segmented CT data, for each voxel, the <italic>z</italic> coordinate is replaced with a material coordinate <italic>m</italic>, and the heterogeneous object is constructed by lofting through both the geometry and the material composition points. The resultant model is suitable for analysis and fabrication, and offers a significant data reduction.</p>
<p>Martin and Cohen<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0954411912452995">12</xref></sup> proposed to separate the geometric modeling from the attribute representation. In their approach, each attribute is represented as a trivariate non-uniform rational B-spline (NURBS) volume, which is independent of the geometry. While the material attributes and the geometry are separated, their triviariate volume representations share the same parametric space.</p>
<p>Wu et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0954411912452995">13</xref></sup> proposed a NURBS-based volume model. An object is constructed as a hybrid model combining a NURBS representation and a voxel-based model. A voxel object can be generated through voxelization of its NURBS volume, that is a generalization of NURBS representation of curves and surfaces.</p>
<p>An alternative approach to heterogeneous modeling using the B-Spline representation scheme was proposed in Schmitt et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0954411912452995">14</xref></sup> Here the authors combined FRep as the basic model for both object geometry and the attributes. FRep defined the object geometry directly through space partition, and a trivariate B-spline primitive was used as a leaf in the FRep constructive tree.</p>
<p>In Ma et al.,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0954411912452995">15</xref></sup> the authors proposed to model the heterogeneity of medical data by combining NURBS models to model geometry and voxel models to represent the interior of the models. A set of contours from sequential medical slices are generated and lofted to produce a NURBS surface, and voxel data from the images is added into the data structure to fill in the interior of the model.</p>
<p>Despite the number of heterogeneous object modeling schemes currently available, effective methodology to model complex heterogeneity has not surfaced.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0954411912452995">4</xref></sup> Most of the proposed methods rely on the designer to control volume fractions of materials at each point, or approach the complex material modeling problem by constructing the objects from simpler primitives.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0954411912452995">
<title>Motivation</title>
<p>This research was motivated by a number of factors. First, the limitations of voxel representation as the current <italic>de facto</italic> tissue modeling tool. They are subject to aliasing (stair case effect) and are unable to represent micro-organisms or objects that are near the voxel size. They also lack a geometric representation, which makes them unsuitable for engineering analysis; they have large memory requirements and are not scalable.</p>
<p>We wanted a precise representation that is resolution independent, i.e. it can be scaled up and down without any loss of detail or visual issues. Parametric surfaces seem to fit the bill just fine, so a B-spline parametric surface was utilized. Please note that sampling a parametric surface into voxel space is doable, while the reverse process, i.e. turning voxels into surfaces, is a non-trivial task.</p>
<p>The chief motivation was to move from a discrete set of points to a continuous space, i.e. the medical imaging devices sample the tissue at discrete locations, which we wanted to turn into a continuous entity via curve and surface fitting algorithms. The advantage of having continuous information from discrete datasets, is that the surface can be sampled at any desired resolution/accuracy. For example, the resultant surface fit can be sampled at a higher resolution than the original MRI scan, or it can provide reasonable estimates of the anatomy or structures not directly revealed in the initial MRI dataset.</p>
<p>Yet another major desire was encapsulation, i.e. designing a technology that is capable of encapsulating density variations in the continuous domain given an initial discrete set of intensity values. B-spline surfaces, by their inherent mathematical representation, do just that. They are, in fact, a density map, i.e. given a uniformly distributed point set, the B-spline surface rearranges the set based on density variations. The added bonus is that the density variation can be computed at any level of resolution.</p>
<p>Intensity variations in medical data have been correlated in literature with the heterogeneity of tissues. For example, density variation within the tumor region of interest in CT data can be correlated with the tumor histological type.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0954411912452995">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0954411912452995">17</xref></sup> Thus, incorporating tumor heterogeneity, based on intensity variations derived from medical image data, can be used to better analyze tumor progression and proliferation and offer new therapeutic approaches. Similarly, intensity variations within bone tissue MRI and CT scans, often in combination with bone mass data produced by bone mineral densitometry, can be used for bone structure analysis. Incorporating this density information into a CAD model can be a useful tool to assess osteoporosis, bone strength and risks of future fracture.</p>
<p>The B-spline encapsulation of heterogeneity is being looked at as a potential tool to quantify heterogeneity of tissue, in particular, of tumor. It turns out that the degree of heterogeneity is a risk factor in the outcome of the condition producing the tumor. The myriad of tools available for B-spline surfaces can be useful to derive such a quantity.</p>
<p>As a future application, we will use the B-spline slices to generate a complete and accurate volumetric model of the entire human body, using B-spline volumes. Again, the volume will be suitable for analysis, sampling and density quantification.</p>

<title>Medical data heterogeneity and density point cloud</title>
<p>Modeling of biological heterogeneities differs vastly from the design of heterogeneous engineering components. Natural objects often have more complicated geometry than the mechanical components and display a vast variation of material properties across the object interior. Over the course of natural development, these material properties have been formed to serve complex biomechanical functions that are challenging, yet crucial, to model.</p>
<p>CT and MRI images create detailed visualizations of internal structures based on inherent characteristics of biological materials. Regardless of the type of imaging modality used, each pixel in the medical image contains a physical parameter value of the corresponding region in the patient’s interior.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0954411912452995">18</xref></sup> Thus, a CT scan is a pixel map of linear attenuation coefficients of a material. Likewise, MRI generates a pixel map of tissue types based on the rates at which perturbed protons return to their equilibrium states.</p>
<p>Owing to this direct relationship between material properties and the grayscale values in the medical images, tissue densities can be reverse estimated based on the pixel values.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0954411912452995">19</xref></sup> Discrete pixel intensity values serve the purpose of differentiating between tissues in a medical image. Using these pixel intensity values, we can construct a point cloud that will capture and model the contrast between tissues through point density distributions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0954411912452995">Figure 1</xref>). The idea is loosely related to the concept of halftoning, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0954411912452995">Figure 2</xref>, a technique for reproducing continuous grayscale and color images through patterns of dots.</p>

</fig>
<p>In a CT medical scan, higher CT numbers, and thus higher grayscale pixel values, indicate a higher material density. The CT number of a material is closely related to the linear attenuation coefficient of the material and, as such, characterizes the relative density of the substance. It is important to stress that we do not seek to reproduce intensity values – instead, we wish to reproduce the intensity variation across the medical image, through varying point densities reconstructed at each pixel according to the pixel’s intensity value.</p>
<p>Since a CT or an MRI image is a discrete map of intensities arranged in a two-dimensional (2D) array of pixels that represent various materials, a corresponding discrete map of point density distributions can be generated. For each pixel, or a set of neighboring pixels, a cluster of non-overlapping points is generated to represent the intensity of the pixel.</p>
<p>The range of intensity values present in a medical image is finite and so is the number of internal organs of interest, and it is, therefore, possible to reduce each color range to a set of points occupying the space of the pixel in order to represent the color. Hence, the inherent contrast and heterogeneity of the medical data, which is originally presented with the help of colors, is reduced to point cloud densities. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0954411912452995">Figure 3</xref> illustrates the concept of generating a density point cloud based on the medical image: each pixel is represented with a point density within that pixel so that the medical image features of interest are encapsulated in the point cloud. Depending on the system capabilities and the accuracy requirements, the density range of the point cloud can be increased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0954411912452995">Figure 4</xref>), which will allow differentiating between finer variations in the image intensities.</p>
<fig id="fig3-0954411912452995" position="float">

<caption><p>The intensity value at each pixel is reproduced through a cluster of points associated with that pixel location.</p></caption>

<graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0954411912452995-fig4.tif"/>
</fig>
<p>Similarly, a point cloud can be built from density data rather than, or in combination with, medical images. For example, bone mass data produced by bone mineral densitometry, combined with MRI or CT data of the bones, can be used to generate a heterogeneous model of a bone. Such a heterogeneous bone density model can be used as a tool to assess osteoporosis, bone strength and risk of future fracture.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0954411912452995">18</xref></sup></p>
<p>In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0954411912452995">Figure 5(a)</xref>, an image of a cross section from the bovine knee is used. The image shows the trabecular bone structure within the joint. Interestingly, the intensity values do not vary greatly across the image. The distribution of features in the image is more important in describing the functional quantities of the bone and the point cloud produced from the image (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0954411912452995">Figure 5(b)</xref>) captures the features and their distribution across the bone very well. In order to reinforce the key features, points from the edge map, which is generated by an edge detector, can be added to the point cloud, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0954411912452995">Figure 6</xref>. Since depiction of the body interior using either MRI or CT technology is based on the concept of generating contrast between different organs depending on their biological material properties, thus making the absolute pixel intensities irrelevant, reproducing the same contrast with point densities preserves the anatomical information of the medical image.</p>

<title>Point cloud approximation with B-spline surface</title>
<p>The point cloud generated from a medical image encapsulates the information about the anatomical features present across the original image. However, similarly to the original image, the point cloud is a discrete representation and thus suffers from the same drawbacks as the original pixel representation. Therefore, we want to generate a continuous mathematical model that will capture the heterogeneity of the original data using B-splines. Owing to the nature of B-spline basis functions, this representation scheme will guarantee smoothness and infinite precision and applicability to material features of arbitrary dimensions. The goal of creating this mathematical model is not to replace the original image representation, but rather to extend and enhance it with an analytical counterpart – a smooth heterogeneous B-spline surface.</p>
<p>Pixels in a medical image slice are arranged in a regular 2D grid. Given this topology, we can organize the point density data into the cross sections and approximate the rows with a set of parallel B-spline curves (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0954411912452995">Figure 7</xref>). However, the number of points and their distribution in each row differs since point density representing each pixel depends on its intensity value.</p>
<fig id="fig7-0954411912452995" position="float">
<label>Figure 7.</label>

<graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0954411912452995-fig7.tif"/>
</fig>
<p>Medical data heterogeneity is quite complex and varies gradually throughout the image and, therefore, the traditional point carpet topology cannot be obtained for surface fitting. Surface fitting to a point cloud has been investigated intensively in CAD/CAM, both for visualization and reverse engineering applications; yet, many questions, such as parameterization for cross-sectional curves and control point explosion during the lofting process, remain an issue.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0954411912452995">20</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0954411912452995"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0954411912452995">22</xref></sup> We therefore focus on outlining a methodology for creating a mathematical representation capable of capturing and preserving density distributions in medical image data using B-splines. The result is a continuous surface that does not deviate from the data by more than the user specified tolerance. The process is outlined as follows:</p>
<list id="list1-0954411912452995" list-type="alpha-lower">
<list-item><p>fit curves to the rows of data points focusing on capturing the distribution of the points along each individual curve;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>fit a B-spline surface to the set of cross-sectional curves produced in Step (a), within a fitting tolerance, while avoiding data explosion.</p></list-item>
</list>
<sec id="section6-0954411912452995">
<title>Heterogeneous cross-sectional curve fitting</title>
<p>Given the data points <italic>Q</italic><sub>0</sub>, …, <italic>Q</italic><sub><italic>m</italic></sub> that fall within the cross section of the density point cloud, we are seeking a B-spline curve that approximates the data in the least-square sense. Since it is essential to capture the unique heterogeneity across the point cloud data, the parameters for curve approximation need to be properly selected. Chord length parameterization is used predominantly in geometric modeling applications. The parameters of a chord length curve are irregularly spaced and their position is proportional to the shortest linear distance between the original data points. These parameters are positioned relative to the physical locations of the data points. We, on the other hand, are interested in the distribution of the data points.</p>
<p>Uniform parameterization is the simplest and least computationally expensive method for calculating parameters, since parameters are uniformly distributed regardless of the data point coordinates. This method is often deemed unsatisfactory for engineering applications.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0954411912452995">23</xref></sup> However, when modeling density variations of medical image data, uniform parameterization is the only parameterization method capable of capturing the density distributions of the data points along the cross-sectional line. This conclusion is theoretically sound, since a B-spline function encapsulates the point distribution of the original data across the scan line and maps the uniformly spaced parameters computed by the uniform parameterization method <italic>onto</italic> the original data points in the density clusters. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-0954411912452995">Figure 8</xref> demonstrates the concept. Using artificial pixel intensity data, we construct a row of point densities that will capture the distribution of features in the color domain. Lighter colors represent higher densities of material in CT and MRI scans and we thus assign a higher number of points per pixel for higher intensity values. Likewise, lower intensities indicate lower material concentration and point assignment is adjusted accordingly. The density data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-0954411912452995">Figure 8(b)</xref>) is approximated with a B-spline curve and then interrogated in order to recover the original distribution back. The result of the sampling is displayed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-0954411912452995">Figure 8(c)</xref> and it is evident that the B-spline function encapsulates and preserves the distribution of the original point dataset.</p>

<p>A CT or MRI procedure can generate, on average, more than 2 million voxels per patient examination.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0954411912452995">24</xref></sup> While each scan line of the point cloud that is generated from the patient image data is fitted independently, the high number of data points across all scan lines can quickly lead to a data explosion during the lofting procedure.</p>
<p>Lofting allows a lot of flexibility, meaning that the cross-sectional curves can be of any degree and be defined over different knot vectors.

<p>The master knot vector is the bookkeeping knot vector, which is passed to each curve approximation procedure as it keeps track of all knots encountered during individual fittings. The purpose of the master knot is to maximize the number of knots that can be reused during the fitting process. Ideally, the master knot vector should contain as many internal knots that are candidates for reuse as possible. Thus, the row of scan line data with the highest rate of density variation is chosen as the base for the master knot calculation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11-0954411912452995">Figure 11</xref>).</p>

<p>For each cross-sectional curve, the algorithm computes two knot vectors, <italic>U</italic><sup><italic>p</italic></sup> and <italic>U</italic><sup><italic>p</italic><italic>−1</italic></sup> in order to bracket the <italic>U</italic><sup><italic>p</italic></sup> knot into ‘fuzzy’ flexibility intervals. For each cross-sectional curve, a check is performed against each knot: if the master knot vector contains a knot within the flexibility interval of the fitted knot, the knot from the master knot vector is selected. On the other hand, if the knot present in the fitted curve is not represented in the master knot vector, that knot is copied over to the master knot vector. Hence, both the fitted knot vector and the master knot vector are examined and updated when necessary, during each curve approximation and the master knot vector is passed and updated after each row approximation.</p>
<p>The master knot algorithm allows re-using knots without having an impact on the density distribution, which results in a tremendous data reduction. Once all the cross-sectional curves are fitted, they contain a large number of knots in common and the compatibility routine for surface lofting does not lead to data explosion. Employing the fuzzy knot approach allows, on average, 65%–80% reuse of knots.</p>

<title>Surface color rendering</title>
<p>The B-spline surface fitted to the original point cloud dataset encapsulates the distribution of points and the features that these distributions define. It is possible to interrogate the surface in order to extract the information the surface function has preserved. One of the simplest, yet useful, tools of interrogation is reverse sampling. The surface is evaluated at a grid of uniformly spaced parameters, which results in a point cloud. This uniform sampling is the reverse process of the fitting process – the generated point cloud can be visualized automatically to produce either a grayscale or a color map of the B-spline surface. The process is illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig13-0954411912452995">Figure 13</xref> – a point cloud is created using the intensity values of the CT scan shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig13-0954411912452995">Figure 13(a)</xref>. Once the surface is fitted to the point cloud and uniformly sampled, the color is assigned to the sampling to create a grayscale image (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig13-0954411912452995">Figure 13(c)</xref>), which closely resembles the original scan.</p>

The surface function representation of the point cloud is evaluated at the uniformly spaced parameters and it is evident that, outside the region of interest, the points are mapped back in the same uniform fashion. Inside the region of interest, the B-spline function acts upon the uniformly placed parameters at which the surface is being evaluated, and remaps them according to the distribution that has been encapsulated. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig15-0954411912452995">Figure 15(a)</xref> fewer sampling points are used, and as the number of sampling points is increased, more details start to emerge (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig15-0954411912452995">Figure 15(b)</xref>).</p>

</fig>
<p>When sampling the surface, it is apparent that the B-spline function is preserving the original distribution of the points faithfully. Having obtained the point cloud back, it is also possible to visualize the captured densities by assigning color based on the densities that fall within the pixel equivalent. Assigning colors can be done through either examining a histogram of density distributions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig16-0954411912452995">Figure 16</xref>) or by assigning the intensities based on an absolute count of points that fall within the pixel region.</p>

<p>As the rate of the sampling increases, the number of points that fall within the individual pixel approaches the intensity value. This not only proves that the B-spline function does indeed encapsulate the intensity variations present in the image, but also allows to automatically assigning colors back to the sampled point cloud. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig17-0954411912452995">Figure 17</xref> displays the results of point density rendering for MRI data of the brain.

<p>Similarly, color can be assigned based on the point densities by using a hue saturation intensity (HSI) color model.

<p>In order to compare original images against the rendered point cloud, we subtracted one image from another. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig21-0954411912452995">Figures 21(a)</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig22-0954411912452995">22(a)</xref> show the original brain MRI. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig21-0954411912452995">Figures 21(b)</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig22-0954411912452995">22(b)</xref> display the grayscale rendering of the B-spline surface point densities where colors are assigned automatically by normalizing the ratio and the distribution of the point densities across the sampled point cloud.

The results are encouraging and display a very constant intensity value throughout the image indicating that the offset between the rendered intensities and the original intensities is consistent and constant throughout the image. This, in fact, demonstrates that the B-spline surface captures and encapsulates the intensity distribution of the original image, as intended. It should be noted that the images above are verifications of the ability of the B-spline to encapsulate heterogeneous biological materials.

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>We have presented a methodology for building a continuous mathematical representation capable of encapsulating and preserving topologically irregular and complex density variations in medical image data using B-spline functions.</p>
<p>The series of algorithms presented in this article generate a point cloud from discrete image data and approximate it with a smooth B-spline surface. The rows of data are first approximated independently with a set of cross-sectional B-spline curves, with the focus on preserving the features that the data point distributions represent. The independent approximation of rows of point cloud data eliminates wiggles in the surface fitting, while uniform parameterization allows the curve fitting to capture the original distribution and the density of the points. Since the number of control points varies throughout the rows, a method for reusing the knots when possible, and thus controlling the growth of control points during the lofting operation, is introduced. The fuzzy knot vector method produces a very slow, logarithmic-like growth of control points as the function of tolerance, while traditional lofting methods would require an order of magnitude more control points in both directions.</p>
<p>In this work, we laid down the groundwork for building accurate heterogeneous models from patient-specific data. The heterogeneous B-spline surface model produced by our method is not in any way the replacement of the image data representation, but rather a means to enhance it and to extend the capabilities of the existing digital representation. Since the application of digitized representation of anatomy is limited to mostly visualization, having an analytical representation scheme augments the image representation owing to the analytical properties of B-spline functions, such as infinite precision, continuity and smoothness.</p>
