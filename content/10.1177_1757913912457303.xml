<p>On May 29<sup>th</sup> 2012, the Royal Society for Public Health (RSPH) held a members’ event which proved to be a great success. Over 60 members and representatives from our centres attended an informative and thought provoking talk by Dr Mabel Blades entitled ‘Nutrition Nuggets’. The lecture focussed on a wide range of nutritional topics including: what is new in regard to diet and diabetes; cholesterol and dietary impact; malnutrition and screening; and Vitamin D. Mabel is a freelance dietician and nutritionist who has written a number of books and articles on food and nutrition, including <italic>Healthier Food and Special Diets</italic> which covers the RSPH Level 2 award and also serves as an introduction to nutrition (available to buy in the next two months). The event, held at 28 Portland Place, was chaired by our president Dr Selwyn Hodge.</p>
<p>The first topic for discussion was diabetes. Mabel gave an overview of the types and effects of having diabetes and the importance of controlling the condition, with particular reference to diet. Diabetes is a significant health problem; with almost three million people in the UK diagnosed with the condition and 10% of the NHS’s budget allocated to managing it. Mabel did note however that the way diabetes is now monitored and treated has changed. Since June 2011 blood glucose levels have been measured in different units with results now reported in units of “mmol per mol” or “mmol/mol” not as a percentage figure. Mabel stressed the importance of promoting a better understanding of diabetes so that patients are better able to manage their condition. Mabel also pointed towards the need for a sensible diet and understanding of the nutritious value of foods which can help improve the effects of both type 1 and 2 diabetes, but particularly for type 2, where the condition can be managed solely by diet and is often caused by obesity.</p>
<p>Mabel moved on to look at the increasingly common issue of high cholesterol. In the UK, a high proportion of men (58%) and women (61%) aged 16-64 years have raised cholesterol. High cholesterol is a serious health risk, causing fatty deposits in arteries which can lead to a heart attack or stroke. Losing weight is key to lowering cholesterol and Mabel explained how she encourages her patients to aim for 10% weight loss, as this can have a significant impact on cholesterol levels but is also an achievable aim. However understanding cholesterol is important, as not all cholesterol is bad. Saturated fat increases the level of bad cholesterol whereas monounsaturated fats reduce bad cholesterol without reducing good cholesterol. Therefore we should all be swapping butter and lard with rapeseed or olive oil. Eggs are a confusing source of cholesterol, so Mabel recommends eating in moderation and not exceeding six a week.</p>
<p>A healthy diet is not all about cutting foods out. Mabel talked about how we should increase our intake of certain foods, for example omega 3 has been found to reduce cholesterol so consuming such foods as oily fish twice a week would be highly beneficial. Similarly increasing the amount of soy protein, almonds and soluble fibre in the diet will all reduce cholesterol. Soluble fibre is one of the easiest things to add to ones diet, as this includes foods such as oats and pulses. Mabel particularly recommends oat bran, which is the husk of oats. A small amount of this added to puddings and breakfast cereals can have a significant impact on cholesterol.</p>
<p>A topic that Mabel was very keen to discuss was the importance of vitamin D, and the lack of publicity this has. In the UK there is currently no recommended intake of vitamin D, despite the fact that vitamin D deficiency amongst certain groups of people is on the increase. A lack of vitamin D can cause rickets in children and osteomalacia in adults, as well as other health problems including cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes. Those most at risk are pregnant or breastfeeding women, young children and older adults. Mabel stressed that vitamin D is particularly important for older people as having strong bones reduces falls and improves their stability so they should be encourage to eat more foods such as oily fish, eggs and fortified cereal.</p>
<p>Mabel concluded the session by discussing the problem of malnutrition; quite surprisingly she currently treats more people who are underweight than overweight and the cost to the NHS is more than £7.3 billion per year. The risk of malnutrition increases with age and is most prevalent in hospitals and care homes. Malnutrition causes a range of issues including fatigue, muscle weakness and impaired immune system. Mabel discussed tools for establishing if someone is malnourished, but stressed the need to act upon the diagnosis.</p>
<p>After the talk, questions were opened up to the floor, provoking further discussion and debate. The evening concluded with drinks, canapés and networking and was thoroughly enjoyed by all.</p>
