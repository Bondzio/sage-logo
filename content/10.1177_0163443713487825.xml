<p>The emerging battle to control the networked digital media consumer habits of us all is well under way between Google, Amazon, Facebook and Apple. This book provides an excellent guide to the context within which these new boundaries and battles will be fought. The authors are keen to outline the terrain they want to operate on, and to that end, eschew titles such as ‘new media’ and ‘digital media’ for the impact that ‘networked digital media’ play in everyday lives. The latter part of this is an important element in this study, which recognizes that convergence is taking place across a range of related contexts, including technical, industrial, social and textual contexts. To this end the authors devote a chapter to each of these areas and succinctly – and with refreshing clarity – establish the key historical contexts that have allowed the media environment to change and develop over the last decade or so.</p>
<p>Running through the book are three key themes. The first recognizes that it is content (media related), computing (hardware and software) and communications (networking, sharing and connectivity) that are framing the contemporary media environment. In other words we are living through the age of many-to-many communications. Second, Meikle and Young compellingly argue that this process is one which ‘displaces’ rather than ‘replaces’ media forms. In other words, the networked digital media environment is one characterized and shot through with continuity as well as posing new challenges to our thinking with regard to the everyday usage and impact of media. Finally, the authors frame this environment as one of a continual contestation between various stakeholders over meaning, voice and often influence across communication platforms.</p>
<p>Along the way Meikle and Young examine the changing role of news gathering and dissemination created by social media. They look at the impact on audiences and cultural production of new forms of media practice. They identify that while this is not a new process, the ‘scale and scope’ of this is new and presents a differing set of challenges for us to think our way through, from evolving commercial and business models, through to the ethical implications of this changing milieu.</p>
<p>One of the most striking chapters – ‘Making the Invisible Visible’ – offers an excellent critique of the genuine impact that the digital networked media has had on issues relating to the discourse and practice of the private and the public in everyday life, and where there is both visible and invisible intervention by the state and commerce in this process. They argue:
<disp-quote>
<p>Networked digital media bring with them new kinds of visibility, new opportunities and requirements to monitor and be monitored, to perform and display, and to connect with others who are newly visible to us and to whom we are ourselves made visible.… this visibility can sometimes bring us to the notice of invisible audiences who we had never imagined, with consequences for our lives and reputations that cannot always be anticipated. (p. 146)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The plethora of commercial, social, political and ethical issues these communicative forms open up will provide a rich research terrain for communication scholars in the coming years. This book, which reminds us of the continuities of communicative practice as well as its dramatic changes, offers a lucid and well informed analysis of an environment that will continue to shape both our public and private lives.</p>
