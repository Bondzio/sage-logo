<p>For school leaders struggling to develop a richer and more nuanced perspective on professionally driven school improvement than narrowly targeted quick fixes, Coral Mitchell and Larry Sackney provide a valuable source of inspiration and ideas. The book explores the connected and collaborative ways in which learners, educators and their leaders grow and develop, rejecting contemporary pressures to objectify people and reify systems. For them, the learning community, rooted in ecology and in living systems theory, emerges as a preferred model for securing deep and sustainable teaching and learning in schools. In this book they set out a coherent programme through which that model might be made to work.</p>
<p>Their focus is on the learning community rather than the learning organization, a distinction which emerged during the 1990s and remains important to their argument. <italic>Learning organizations</italic>, rooted in the work of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1741143212438799">Senge (1990</xref>), are primarily concerned with organizational outcomes, such as growth and effectiveness but <italic>learning communities</italic>, favoured by Mitchell and Sackney, are fundamentally concerned with human experience and the development of people. Their paradigm is ‘wholeness’ and their model is ecological with ‘living systems’ perspectives linked to a social constructivist approach to making it all happen. They claim that building a learning community is a holistic process that brings together the individual, the group and the organization. Building capacity to improve learning in a school depends on connections being made within and between these three interdependent spheres of activity. Blending theory with lively examples from their extensive research and development in schools, they propose a range of principles, behaviours and activities to help secure learning and improved outcomes.</p>
<p>
<italic>Profound Improvement</italic> is a powerful title, holding out the promise of new insights and practical ideas. It echoes ideas back to the 1950s and beyond, including Deming’s ‘system of profound knowledge’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1741143212438799">Delavigne et al., 1994</xref>). The title suggests that this book will tackle the challenge of achieving lasting and sustainable improvements in learning in schools and communities—and the authors have been polishing their response for over 20 years. The first edition was published in 2000, so it is interesting to see what changes the authors have made in the light of subsequent contributions to the literature and of the shifting context and practice in schools. Following <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1741143212438799">Capra (1966</xref>), they adopted deep ecology as a philosophical foundation in their related work on <italic>Sustainable Improvement</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1741143212438799">Mitchell et al., 2008</xref>) and this was the precursor to some of the changes made in this second edition of <italic>Profound Improvement</italic>. The latest writing incorporates: (1) principles, practices and perspectives from educators in the field involved in building ‘growth-promoting’ teaching and learning environments; (2) a stronger understanding of the value of ecological concepts that give prominence to deep connections and reciprocal relationships in and between school systems; and (3) local experience of building learning communities linked with the concept of ‘living systems’ in which learning is a natural process of continuous adaptation and through which human beings are more likely to be influenced and shaped than directed or controlled.</p>
<p>Leadership in the living systems of the learning community is a dispersed function and building leadership capacity to improve teaching and learning is seen to rely on four key activities adapted from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1741143212438799">Leithwood et al. (2006</xref>): setting directions, developing people, redesigning the organisation and enlivening teaching and learning, This fourth activity interestingly replaces Leithwood’s ‘managing the instructional programme’. The authors properly claim that this second edition of <italic>Profound Improvement</italic> is ‘more grounded, descriptive, and practical’. The context and research base is firmly North American but there are some references to the international literature. The process of translating ideas about deep change and learning communities into educational leadership settings in countries and contexts other than Canada is in itself a valuable process into which the reader is implicitly drawn.</p>
<p>It is not enough to be aware of the nature and operational features of ‘profound improvement’ in living systems, we also need to know how can we lead and manage better in and across those systems. There are no simple solutions in this book. Some suggestions make good professional sense and reinforce conclusions reached elsewhere in the literature. The book advocates, for example: putting teaching and learning firmly at the centre of the school’s life; valuing ‘slow’ learning and long-term commitments; building climates of trust that support critical reflection and innovation; creating regular opportunities and personal spaces within which the search for meaning, relevance and connection in learning can take place; and nurturing the emergence of collaborative understandings and commitments.</p>
<p>The argument of ‘Profound Improvement’ does have some weaknesses—the analysis of professional knowledge is not as clear or informative as it might be, for example, and the idea that the members of the school learning community are unique expressions of ‘one interconnected life force’ might not win over many sceptics. However, it does provide a very useful and pertinent perspective on crucial connectivities within learning. Educators looking for a coherent model for leading capacity building and school improvement, that does not rely on old style command and control, will find in these more democratic and developmental approaches a genuine alternative.</p>
