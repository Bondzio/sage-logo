<p>In situ nondestructive evaluation (NDE) during processing of high-temperature polymer-based hybrids offers great potential to gain close control of and achieve the desired level of pore size, with low overall development cost. During the polymer-curing cycle, close control over the evolution of volatiles would be beneficial to avoid the presence of pores or control of their sizes. Traditional NDE methods cannot realistically be expected to evaluate individual pores in such components as each pore evolves and grows during curing. However, NDE techniques offer the potential to detect and quantify the macroscopic response of many pores that are undesirable or intentionally introduced into these advanced materials. In this article, preliminary results will be presented for nondestructive assessment of pore size in foam-based hybrid composite materials using ultrasonic techniques. The ultrasonic method was chosen due to its high sensitivity to the change of composition in material, ability to provide the required depth of penetration and ability to provide the needed modulus information for the cured material through appropriate velocity measurements. Pore size was evaluated through the frequency content of ultrasonic signal. The effects of pore size on the attenuation of ultrasound were studied. Feasibility of this method was demonstrated on two types of foams with various pore sizes.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Polymer foam-based hybrid composite materials have the potential to achieve advanced material properties that are not obtainable with conventional materials. Their performance can be tailored to better suit specific applications by altering the resin, the additives and the foam itself. One of the main problems associated with these systems, however, concerns the wide range of porosity caused by volatile gases formed during the curing process. Changing the processing conditions such as the curing temperature can minimize the effect of volatiles. However, it is often difficult to determine the best conditions for the system as a whole since it involves the timely and costly method of cutting and polishing samples before adjustments can be made to the processing. An in situ nondestructive evaluation method currently does not exist so the goal of this study is to provide such a tool in order to monitor a material process that utilizes foam as a skeleton and resin as a filler for a composite structure. This technique is complicated by the fact that it is difficult to distinguish the inherent porosity of the foam from the pores within the resin. In order to develop an in situ system that accurately monitors the movement of pores within the system, it is necessary to first develop NDE profiles for the foam and the resin separately. As such, this article is the first of a series of articles and focuses upon the development and the evaluation of the effects of pore size on the attenuation of ultrasound for the foam itself. Future publications will analyze the attenuation of the resin separately and later combine the foam and the resin profiles.</p>
<p>In situ nondestructive evaluation (NDE) during processing of high-temperature polymer-based hybrids offers great potential to gain close control of and achieve the desired level of pore size, with low overall development cost. However, traditional NDE methods for these materials require each processing cycle to be completed before analysis can occur (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0095244311426000">Figure 1</xref>). This off-line approach takes significant resources and is usually time consuming, if not cost prohibited. Therefore, it is desirable to introduce NDE sensors in the material process as seen in the right side of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0095244311426000">Figure 1</xref>. Critical material states such as composition and modulus can thus be monitored while the material is still in processing. On the other hand, inserting NDE into material processing is by no means a trivial task. The in situ NDE also has at least two challenges compared to typical off-line NDE practices. First, the sensors need to endure an elevated temperature environment, whereas the off-line test is conducted in ambient temperature. The second challenge is that the in situ inspection time is very limited. The time for off-line inspection is usually much longer, while the in situ inspection is paced by each step of the material process.</p>

<p>Of the several major NDE methods, an ultrasonic technique was chosen. Other methods may work well in different applications but not necessarily for in situ measurements. For example, an X-ray technique was not considered viable due to radiation concerns, especially when prolonged time is needed for material processing. Typical material processing could take from hours to days for a complete heating and cooling cycle. Eddy current methods are more concentrated on the surface or near surface of the material. Consequently, this method cannot monitor the entire material unless the electrical conductivity of the materials is sufficiently low. Other types of advanced NDE methods have also shown to be deficient in meeting these inspection needs. For example, microwave testing and terahertz testing would suffer from a total reflection with the presence of a highly electrical conductivity material like aluminum foam. Similarly, thermal testing would suffer from a strong interference due to the presence of a highly thermally conductive material like aluminum foam. The ultrasonic method, on the other hand, is very sensitive to the change of composition in material and can provide the required depth of penetration. In addition, it can provide the needed modulus information for the cured material through appropriate velocity measurements.</p>
<p>Simple theory was found useful in predicting the velocity change for low porous material.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0095244311426000">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0095244311426000">2</xref>
</sup> For fluid statured porous foam, two types of ultrasonic waves: slow and fast waves can be generated.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0095244311426000">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0095244311426000"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0095244311426000"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0095244311426000">6</xref>
</sup> This phenomenon has been predicted by Biot. Under Biot’s theory, the in-phase coupling of ultrasound with the skeleton of the porous material can produce an ultrasonically fast wave. Likewise, another type of ultrasonic wave with slow speed can be created by the out-of-phase coupling of ultrasound with the fluid in the porous material.</p>
<p>The in situ NDE of a foam-based material processing involves additional challenges, because the material needs to be monitored through a wide spectrum of changes during processing. For example, initially, the material starts as a foam with pores of different sizes. As processing proceeds, the foam will partially fill and eventually become one consisting of different gradients of filler material. At each stage, the material presents a unique class of problem in terms of ultrasonic testing. Also, at the initial stage of unfilled foam, the ultrasonic frequency required to pass through the material needs to be substantially low. Otherwise, the scattering of ultrasound by pores causes high attenuation of ultrasound in the foam. During the partially filled stage, especially before the material is completely cured, the fluid-like filled foam creates a unique case which has been a subject of studies in numerous fields such as geophysics<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0095244311426000">7</xref>
</sup> and medical.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0095244311426000">8</xref>
</sup> Finally, as the foam is filled, inhomogeneity in the material also becomes a subject of study.</p>
<p>In this article, ultrasonic measurements were taken of the foam immersed in water using time and frequency domain ultrasonic NDE. Water was used to simulate the presence of resin within the foam. What follows is a description of the foam materials used in the experiments.</p>

<sec id="section2-0095244311426000">
<title>Brief description of the foam materials</title>
<p>Carbon and aluminum foams were studied. Both of them were made by ERG Materials and Aerospace Corporation, a manufacturer specialized in open celled metal foam, carbon foam, and ceramic foam material.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0095244311426000">9</xref>
</sup> The carbon foam studied had a nominal relative density of 3% of the base material and various pore sizes of 30, 80 and 100 ppi. For aluminum foam, only two pore sizes were tested: 10 and 40 ppi.</p>
<p>The density of the foam was typically around 3% to 12% of the base material density (97%–88% porosity). The change in density was usually accomplished by changing the cross section of the ligament or strut of the foam. For example, a triangular-shaped ligament structure can give 97% porosity foam and circular-shaped ligament structure can give 88% porosity foam.</p>
<p>The size of the pores was specified uniquely by a parameter called pores per inch or simply ppi; 30 ppi has 30 pores in an inch, while 100 ppi has 100 pores. The size of the pore is inversely proportional to the number of pores per inch. Thus, 30 ppi has a larger pore size than 100 ppi does. According to the manufacturer, the smallest unit of foam was called a cell. The foam, however, is typically characterized by counting the number of pores in an inch. Representative carbon foams of 30 and 100 ppi are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0095244311426000">Figure 2</xref>.</p>

<p>The ultrasonic testing was conducted with a 5 MHz, 19 mm (or 0.75-inch) diameter and 50 mm (or 2-inch) spherical focused ultrasonic transducer, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0095244311426000">Figure 3</xref>. A commercial off-the-shelf pulser receiver, not shown, was used to excite the transducer. The electrical pulse produces high-frequency mechanical vibrations, or ultrasound, in the transducer through the piezoelectric effect. The ultrasound then enters the specimen through the water medium in this test. This is a simple test to simulate the situation when resin is infiltrating into foam. A reflector was placed at the focal point of the transducer. Initially, a reference signal was acquired from the reflector without the presence of foam. Then, subsequent tests were made with foams of different pore sizes and materials in the sound path. Each time domain signal was stored in a LeCroy digital oscilloscope and further processed with a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) to study the response of the signal in the frequency domain.</p>

</fig>
<p>Without a reflector, the back surface signal was barely recognizable; use of a reflector provided a return path for the signal. Inserting foam affected the arrival time and the amplitude of the ultrasonic signal from the reflector. During the test, it was noticed that a strong reverberation inside the foam occurred after the ultrasound entered the foam. Experimental data were collected and analyzed.</p>

<title>Signal processing in frequency domain</title>
<p>Deconvolution was applied to make measurements in the frequency domain using the built-in function of the digital oscilloscope. Once the time domain signal was identified, the frequency domain signal could be displayed in real time. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0095244311426000">Figures 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0095244311426000">5</xref> show the time and frequency signals from a reference and a foam. In the reference frequency spectrum, the magnitude reached its peak around the frequency of 5 MHz. This reference peak frequency extended from about 3 to 7 MHz. Outside this frequency range, this transducer would not give meaningful results due to the low magnitude of the frequency response. Subtraction of the reference spectrum (in dB) from the foam signal spectrum removed the nonuniform effect of the transducer. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0095244311426000">Figure 6</xref> shows the spectrum after subtraction.</p>

<title>Variables affecting ultrasonic wave in fluid-filled porous materials</title>
<p>From the materials perspective, the variables affecting the ultrasonic wave in fluid-filled porous materials include type of material, density and pore size. The fact that a foam has cavities of different sizes and shapes could also perturb the measurement. In addition, the filling conditions of fluid into the cavities can also affect the signals.</p>
<p>From the ultrasonic measurement perspective, a key variable in this test is the interrogating frequency spectrum. The nonuniform effect due to transducer frequency response can be removed through the subtraction of a reference signal in dB scale. The geometry of the material could also affect the test. Considering this, a parallel surface on the specimen is usually needed for a robust quantitative measurement.</p>
<p>This test provides a basis for a subsequent study in a more realistic material processing environment. Effects such as viscosity and high temperature are to be studied in next test. The viscosity could affect the amplitude of the signal. The high temperature is to be addressed with the use of a delay line.</p>

<sec id="section5-0095244311426000">
<title>Experimental demonstration</title>
<p>The ultrasonic tests on foams were made with specimens immersed in water. The main purpose was to study the ultrasonic response with respect to pore size. These measurements were conducted under simplified conditions. They demonstrate that a reflector approach can be used to study this unique and complex foam-based material system. Both time and frequency measurements were made.</p>
<sec id="section6-0095244311426000">
<title>Frequency domain results</title>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0095244311426000">Figure 7</xref> shows processed frequency spectra of carbon foam of different pore sizes. The spectra can be divided in two regions: above 5 MHz and below 5 MHz. For frequencies above 5 MHz, the frequency response of the signal was relatively flat. In addition, the spectrum of 30 ppi foam showed a higher magnitude than it did for the 100 ppi foam. This was due to the fact that larger pores allow more ultrasound to pass through. For frequencies below 5 MHz, the long wavelength of ultrasound showed a large response, which depended on the pore size. For large pore foam (30 ppi), the magnitude continued to be relatively flat in the low frequency range. The effect of frequency on magnitude for this large pore foam was minimal. For small size foams, such as 80 and 100 ppi, significant fluctuation in the magnitude as a function of frequency was observed. Future study will be conducted on this dispersion phenomenon and its relationship with the pore size.</p>

<p>In an effort to evaluate the response of magnitude with pore size, the average magnitude for each foam was calculated. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-0095244311426000">Figure 8</xref> shows the plot of average magnitude in the frequency domain versus pore size.

<p>The aluminum foams show a similar type of response with frequency, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-0095244311426000">Figure 9</xref>. For large pore aluminum foam, the frequency response was relatively flat but for small pore aluminum foam, the frequency response changed significantly. The magnitude of the frequency response for large pores was much higher than the response of small pores. In this case, the 40 ppi aluminum pore foam had an average of −43 dB magnitude. This medium size aluminum foam magnitude was comparable with that of the 100 ppi carbon foam (i.e., −39 dB).</p>

<p>Finally, to illustrate the effect of the fill of fluid on the ultrasonic wave, an additional measurement was made on an 80-ppi carbon foam which was partially filled with water and partially filled with air, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10-0095244311426000">Figure 10</xref>. The entrapment of air in the foam partially blocked the ultrasound from reaching the reflector; a reduction of 4 dB in average magnitude as compared to the fully filled case was observed.</p>

A very minimal change in velocity (i.e., much less than 1% variation) was noticed for carbon foams of different pore sizes. The amplitude of the signal in time domain did show significant change with the pore size. This dependence on pore size was also noticed in the frequency domain.</p>

<p>Furthermore, the above observation assumed that the foam was fully saturated with the fluid. In the case where the foam was partially filled, two separate tests were made.

<title>Summary and conclusions</title>
<p>Ultrasonic testing was conducted with a 5 MHz broadband transducer using a reflector approach. Carbon foam with a nominal relative density of 3% of the base material and various pore sizes of 30, 80 and 100 ppi along with 10 and 40 ppi aluminum foam was tested. The foams were immersed in water to simulate resin infiltration into the foam and analyzed using both time and frequency measurements. The average magnitude of the signal in the frequency domain had a good correlation with the carbon foam of different pore sizes. For foam with large pores, the frequency dependence of the magnitude of the response was minimal but this was not the case for foams with small pores. The reflector approach was demonstrated to improve the ultrasonic signal in high-porosity foams. The ultrasonic velocity change with pore size was insignificant for highly porous carbon foams studied. The amplitude of the signal in time domain, however, showed significant change as the pore size varied. The frequency dependence of the magnitude response, or the dispersion in the low frequencies could be useful in evaluating the pore size in foams fully filled with fluid.</p>
<p>The results suggest that the average magnitude of signal in the frequency domain, and the change in arrival time, might be used to show the fill state. The broadband ultrasonic approach is capable of generating a wide range of frequency for the study of the frequency dependence of pore size. Future work will be made with fillers such as resins. Effects such as viscosity and high temperature will be studied in next test.</p>
