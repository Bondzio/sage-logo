<p>This study explores the meaning of teenagers’ media consumption in terms of identity formation and autonomy attainment. In domestication theory, media consumption is conceptualized as the interplay of both media object and content. However, in practical applications, the notion of object has usually been snowed under by contextual descriptions. In response, this article draws upon the concept of a triple articulation that, next to media text, separates the object and the context. Using a multi-method study, we empirically demonstrate the relevance of separating the object and context dimensions in understanding media consumption. This is especially relevant in the current age of convergence in which media scholars are confronted with a changing media landscape, characterized by content that is increasingly device- and context-independent, while a broad range of devices are appropriated in a multitude of contexts.</p>

<sec id="section1-1461444811415046" sec-type="intro">
<title>Introduction</title>
<p>According to recent OECD figures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1461444811415046">2009a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1461444811415046">2009b</xref>), Western households have appropriated abundant media technologies. Consequently, teenagers growing up in these media-rich environments have been confronted with a wealth of media technologies at a very young age. This is not without consequences. A large body of research has highlighted the role of media in identity formation and the attainment of autonomy, both key developmental issues. Media consumption furnishes identity formation, as Brown et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1461444811415046">1994</xref>: 814) state: ‘they [adolescents] use media and cultural insights provided by them [the media] to see both who they might be and how others have constructed or reconstructed themselves’. In addition, choosing independently what content to consume and when to consume it may provide adolescents with a greater sense of autonomy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1461444811415046">Livingstone, 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the question remains of how media are meaningful in forming identity and attaining autonomy. Mainstream communication studies have traditionally concentrated on the role and (real and symbolic) meaning of media texts. However, insights from domestication theory emphasize that media texts cannot be uncoupled from technology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1461444811415046">Silverstone, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1461444811415046">Silverstone and Haddon, 1996</xref>). More specifically, this theory posits that media technologies are doubly articulated: they are meaningful as material objects (<italic>first articulation</italic>) and as conveyers of meaningful texts (<italic>second articulation</italic>). Notwithstanding, in previous empirical domestication research, the material dimension was mainly embedded in contextual descriptions of its use, rather than focusing on its distinct symbolic meanings. Thus, we subscribe to the concept of a triple articulation that dissects media consumption as the symbolic interplay of media as an object (<italic>first articulation: e.g., television, computer</italic>), as a text (<italic>second articulation: e.g., lyric, game, video clip</italic>), and as a context (<italic>third articulation; alone in the bedroom, together with family in the living room</italic>). Still, the value of a triple articulation approach for empirical research, explicitly separating object and context, has yet to be proven (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1461444811415046">Hartmann, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1461444811415046">Livingstone, 2007b</xref>). Given the current trend of convergence that has led to an abundance of objects affording the consumption of the same types of texts, we hypothesize that media consumption practices in terms of these dimensions are increasingly diverging, especially when these devices are spread through various contexts.</p>
<p>Hence, this article aims to explore the meanings ascribed by teenagers to media consumption in terms of identity formation and autonomy attainment. To investigate this issue, a multi-method study was set up. In the first phase, the results from a large-scale quantitative survey of teenagers’ appropriation of media technologies are presented. This provides a clear overall view of what kind of technologies teenagers access, where they use them and for how long. Next, through qualitative research, we explicitly focus on object and context meanings in order to determine whether these components, next to the text dimension, are distinguishable and meaningful in light of teenagers’ media consumption.</p>

<title>The domestication of media technologies</title>
<p>Domestication is a social-constructivist theory stemming from media studies’ main interest in audiences and media texts, theories on consumption (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1461444811415046">Morley, 1996</xref>), and the increasing recognition in the late 1980s of the importance of media objects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1461444811415046">Haddon, 2007</xref>). This theory centres on the process of consumers ascribing meaning to media technologies as the users ‘seek to manage and control their own electronic spaces and to make mass-produced objects and meanings meaningful, useful and intelligible to them’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1461444811415046">Silverstone, 1995</xref>: 64). Domestication involves three processes: (a) commodification, (b) appropriation, and (c) conversion. As technologies are put into the market, they are commodified by their producers. Using marketing, vendors relate meanings of desire to products to instigate consumption. When consumers acknowledge these meanings and start to interweave them with their own, the process of appropriation has commenced. In this process, a technology is welcomed into the household. More specifically, the technology is granted a comfortable physical and discursive place, while its use is given a place within existing routines. Finally, conversion refers to the outward display and communication of the appropriation. Conversion entails the re-entry of a technology into the public domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1461444811415046">Silverstone and Haddon, 1996</xref>).</p>
<p>A crucial notion in the domestication process is the recognition of the moral economy of the household, which is conceived as a ‘transactional system of economic and social relations within the formal or more objective economy and society of the public sphere’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1461444811415046">Silverstone et al., 1992</xref>: 16). When technologies are brought into the home, their meanings need to be aligned with the household’s specific cognitions, evaluations, and aesthetics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1461444811415046">Silverstone, 1994</xref>). However, the dimensions of media technologies’ meanings have been traditionally considered twofold: that is, as a double articulation. On the one hand, media consist of material objects with specific aesthetic and functional properties, while on the other hand media enable the consumption of media texts. Hence, media are deemed doubly articulated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1461444811415046">Morley and Silverstone, 1990</xref>). The first articulation refers to the material object itself. The second articulation concerns the media texts that are being consumed through these material objects. Individuals address meaning to both articulations. This implies that an individual’s bond with media and its consequences are rooted in an interrelation of media technologies and media texts.</p>
<p>Traditionally, communication studies have focused mainly on the meaning of media texts while neglecting the (technological) context in which this content is consumed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1461444811415046">Livingstone, 2007b</xref>): that is, focusing on media content (e.g., television soaps) without taking into account the spatial, social, and technological surroundings. In this respect, we cannot ignore the socio-technological literature on the affordances of technologies. The concept of affordances refers to technologies’ inherent objective capabilities to enable actions, relative to users’ perceptions and interpretations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1461444811415046">Norman, 2002</xref>). Affordances provide links between the external environment or context and the internal state of mind of an actor. In addition, affordances offer cues to users as to how a technology can be used (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1461444811415046">McGrenere and Ho, 2000</xref>). Hence, interpretations of affordances enable users’ constructions of object meanings. However, combining attention for the symbolic dimensions of media texts and the objects used to consume the media texts is the major merit of domestication theory.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, in previous research, the particularities of media objects have been mainly snowed under by contextual descriptions of the objects’ use by not explicitly distinguishing between both. Thus, the objects’ meanings themselves remained largely unattended (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1461444811415046">Hartmann, 2006</xref>). This inspired a re-proposal of the earlier dismissed conceptual notion of a triple articulation. Such a triple articulation sees media consumption as composed by the meaning of (1) media technologies as objects, (2) media texts, and (3) the symbolic environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1461444811415046">Hartmann, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1461444811415046">Figure 1</xref>).</p>

<graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1461444811415046-fig1.tif"/>
</fig>
<p>The concept of a triple articulation holds the potential to shed light on what has previously been unclear – namely, the individual meanings of the object and its context. Nevertheless, the question remains whether such a three-fold approach is manageable and relevant for empirical researchers for guiding their investigations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1461444811415046">Livingstone, 2007b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1461444811415046">Silverstone and Haddon, 1996</xref>). Consequently, it is vital to explore whether objects and contexts are indeed separable when it comes to teenagers’ media consumption and the meanings of identity and autonomy teenagers ascribe to their consumption. If these dimensions are indeed distinct, in constructing the overall significance of media consumption we should be able to find independent interactions of object and context meanings with content meanings.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-1461444811415046">
<title>Ascribing meaning to media</title>
<p>As stated in the introduction, independently selecting media consumption assists teenagers in compiling an identity and attaining autonomy. Identity and autonomy are central developmental issues. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1461444811415046">Baumeister (1999)</xref> briefly defines identity as ‘a definition of the self’. A condition is that identity should differentiate between individuals. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1461444811415046">Buckingham (2008)</xref>, identity is something we uniquely possess, yet it implies a relationship with collective and social groups. He provides a concise overview of identity literature, framed within multiple fields such as psychology, sociology, and cultural studies. However, anything that supports differentiation and identification holds the potential of being an identity attribute. In sum, identity is composed of at least one’s interpersonal self; a concept of potentiality; and one’s general values, principles, and priorities. Autonomy refers to an active, agentic process situated in the physical, psychosocial, cognitive, and moral domain in which the individual, embedded in varying contexts, develops toward independence and personal freedom (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1461444811415046">Spear and Kulbok, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>Yet the question remains, how do media assist in attaining autonomy and forming identity? For one, the latter can be accomplished through a process of active negotiation. This leads to the development of cognitive schemes consisting of interpretative definitions of self and others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1461444811415046">Huntemann and Morgan, 2001</xref>). In fact, these schemes are very broad since media texts furnish multiple aspects of identity, including gender role and sexual identity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1461444811415046">Gauntlett, 2009</xref>), social belonging, occupational aspirations, and political values (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1461444811415046">Arnett, 1995</xref>).</p>
<p>Studies indicating the role and value of media in forming and defining identity are abundant. Although Williams (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1461444811415046">2001</xref>: 228) warns of a ‘fallacy of meaningfulness’, referring to the exaggeration of the meaning of popular culture, literature offers ample accounts of identity attributions. Previous studies have, for instance, shown how teenagers adapt models from televised fiction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1461444811415046">Fisherkeller, 2002</xref>) and how these programs are able to provoke critical reflections on, for example, stereotypical representations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1461444811415046">Barker, 1997</xref>). Likewise, music has been shown to reflect personal characteristics and normative values (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1461444811415046">North and Hargreaves, 1999</xref>), next to visual images of lifestyle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1461444811415046">Connel and Gibson, 2003</xref>). In addition, media that are more interactive, such as games, afford identity formation. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1461444811415046">Marty and Stromer-Galley (2007)</xref> discuss the simulation game ‘The Sims’ as a laboratory for identity development and experimentation with social interaction and norms. In addition, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1461444811415046">Durkin (2006)</xref> stresses the functional role of video gaming in attaining autonomy. First, teenage video gamers are able to differentiate their own media use from their parents’ and mould it into a peer-related activity. Second, in games, players experience a symbolic agentic autonomy as they are encouraged to face challenges and make their own choices.</p>
<p>A less investigated but important field of exploration is the internet. Various studies have indicated that the Web serves as a playground in which teenagers can display their selves and even experiment with their identity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1461444811415046">Katz and Rice, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1461444811415046">Thomas, 2007</xref>). Online, teenagers can pretend to be someone else, have an opposite gender, etc. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1461444811415046">Gross, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1461444811415046">Valkenburg et al., 2005</xref>). In fact, popular social network sites serve as ideal platforms for these kinds of explorations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1461444811415046">boyd, 2008</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1461444811415046">
<title>The medium and the message</title>
<p>In the seminal work <italic>Understanding Media</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1461444811415046">McLuhan (1964)</xref> stressed the symbolic collision of a message and the medium through which the message is conveyed. In this technological determinist perspective, the medium’s properties exercise such an influence that the message gets absorbed. Although this claim is very strong and contested, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1461444811415046">Silverstone (1994)</xref> partially agrees within the context of a double articulation. He acknowledges that the medium <italic>becomes</italic> the message to the extent that media technologies contribute to the meanings attributed to media experience as a whole. Silverstone recognizes ‘that the mass media do have a particular claim on the technological culture of the modern world’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1461444811415046">Silverstone, 1994</xref>: 82).</p>
<p>Of course, at the time of McLuhan’s writing, media content was highly dependent on a specific technology. Due to digitization, however, media content has been increasingly subjected to convergence. As already indicated by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1461444811415046">de Sola Pool (1983)</xref>, this entails a blurring of the lines between media and communications, enabling the delivery of services that used to be provided in different physical ways. Thus, the tight, classic relationship between a medium and <italic>its</italic> content disappears.</p>
<p>However, the fact that media content is increasingly device-independent does not imply that users limit themselves to a single unified device. Although for quite some time it was believed that technology would converge into a single central device (a black box), nowadays a large variety of devices are available (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1461444811415046">Dwyer, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1461444811415046">Jenkins, 2006</xref>). This increasing variety in available devices, each with its own features, renders technology an important factor in media studies, especially considering the devices’ potential meanings. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1461444811415046">Oksman and Turtiainen (2004)</xref> found that mobile phones are ascribed manifold meanings. Parents think of mobile phones as reassuring because they are constantly able to contact their children, which provides a sense of control, security, and trust. Although teenagers themselves interpret this contact as interference, the potential for independent communication with their peers offers teenagers a sense of autonomy. Furthermore, technological devices are not limited to their functions. For instance, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1461444811415046">Katz and Sugiyama (2006)</xref> found that early mobile phone adopters were more fashion-oriented. Even more, the authors discovered a relationship between heavy usage and the importance attributed to the device’s style over functional aspects. This suggests that objects have a tendency to communicate identity.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1461444811415046">
<title>Context of media consumption</title>
<p>When we look at the lives of teenagers, and especially at their leisure time, various spaces seem important. These spaces are situated outside (e.g., youth and sports clubs) as well as inside the home. However, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1461444811415046">Livingstone (2002)</xref> observed that, since the 1950s, two distinct trends have emerged, characterizing the significance of the home in teenagers’ everyday lives. First, family life has become clearly separated from public life: this demarcation between public and private space is symbolized by the front door, which has become a stringent barrier. Second, the bedroom door symbolizes a relative separation of teenagers’ private space from family and public life. These trends link with the aforementioned concept of the household as a moral economy, in which the household is an economic entity with an individual culture and logic.</p>
<p>Occupying a private space is especially meaningful for many Western teenagers. Research has indicated that teenagers voluntarily seek to spend time alone, which is positively correlated with short-term well-being and positive emotional states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1461444811415046">Larson, 1997</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1461444811415046">Livingstone (2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1461444811415046">2007a)</xref> touches upon several factors explaining the meaning of private bedrooms as convenient storage places for all kinds of private goods, but also as places for autonomous activity without notable interruption, and as creative spaces of self reflection and self-expression.</p>
<p>Analogous to households as a whole, bedrooms have become increasingly filled with media technologies. Bovill and Livingstone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1461444811415046">2001</xref>: 180–181) see the emergence of a ‘bedroom culture’, implying that ‘children and young people spend significant proportions of their leisure time at home with the mass media, increasingly screen media, in their own private space rather than communal or family space’. The authors found that a room’s degree of media richness is positively associated with the time a teenager spends in it. Moreover, media-rich teenagers spend less time with their family and more time on their own. This occurrence raises issues about the influence of spatial and even social context on media consumption.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1461444811415046">
<title>A multi-method study</title>
<p>To investigate whether the conceptual distinction between context and objects as distinct sources of meaning empirically holds up, a multi-method case study was set up in Flanders, Belgium’s northern, Dutch-speaking region. In the first, quantitative phase, reliable figures on the appropriation of media technologies and the spaces of appropriation were gathered. In the second, qualitative phase, face-to-face interviews were performed to gather in-depth information on object and context meanings and how these relate to each other. The participants in this second phase were directly recruited from the first phase’s respondents. Thus, the first, quantitative phase served a double purpose: this phase not only provided a larger guiding framework concerning the appropriation of objects but also served as a recruitment funnel. Both research stages were embedded in a larger, joint research project with two non-profit youth work organizations aiming at clarifying teenagers’ relations with new media.</p>
<p>Twelve Flemish secondary schools cooperated in the first phase, which involved a large-scale survey. These schools, selected to reflect the diversity in types of education, agreed to allocate class time to let their pupils fill out a computer-based questionnaire. Hence, self-selection bias was avoided. A total of 1725 Flemish secondary school pupils participated (<italic>M</italic><sub>age</sub>= 15.24, <italic>SD</italic><sub>age</sub>= 1.85, Age range = 12–18; 51% male). After data cleaning was performed, a three-dimensional weighing procedure was applied to correct the sample for gender, grade, and education type. Thus, the dataset resembles the Flemish secondary school population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1461444811415046">Departement Onderwijs, 2009</xref>). The questionnaire was composed of questions regarding socio-demographics and the appropriation (the site of access, rules set out, etc.) and usage frequency of the following media: television, computer, games, and mobile devices. The survey data were analyzed using SPSS 15 and Latent Gold 4.5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1461444811415046">Vermunt and Magidson, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>In the second research phase, a total of 40 one-on-one interviews were conducted in the respondents’ homes. A maximum variety sampling strategy (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1461444811415046">Table 2</xref>) was used to recruit the interviewees from the pool of respondents in phase one. Two semi-structured topic lists were used: one mainly focused on instances of autonomy, while the other emphasized identity attributes. Each topic list concentrated on the role of technology and context within media consumption. In both types of interviews, which took up to an hour and a half, photo elicitation was used to facilitate the interviews. This technique allows for structure in the interview and eases the evocation of information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1461444811415046">Harper, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1461444811415046">Figure 2</xref>). Still, the interviewees were invited to speak their minds and were allowed to talk freely about their everyday interactions with media. The photographs used to structure the interview depicted examples of content (video, music, games, and the internet), devices (television, computer, game consoles, and mobile phones and other mobile devices), and contexts. Contexts were made up of public space (e.g., a bus, a square), shared domestic space (e.g., a living room, an attic room), and private space (e.g., a bedroom, a study). The exact manifestations of these spaces, devices, and content were left open for the respondents.</p>
<p>The interviews were analyzed using NVivo 8. Because of this research’s conceptual underpinnings, we subscribe to what is referred to as <italic>analytic induction</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1461444811415046">Patton, 2002</xref>). This theory-based analysis approach involves a thorough analysis and cross-validation of the hypotheses in a broad variety of cases. Therefore, the selected variety of cases should demonstrate specific associations with object and context. Even more, we should find that these articulations independently interact with media texts within the overall significance of media consumption. First, every broad reference to object (technological dimension), text (the contents of what is consumed), and context (the social and spatial surroundings) was coded. Then, instances in which the objects and contexts diverged, that is, situations in which teenagers claimed to consume the same kind of media texts through different devices and/or in different spatial and social contexts, were specifically analyzed.</p>

<title>Appropriation of media technologies</title>
<p>The objective of the quantitative research phase is to provide a view of teenagers’ overall appropriation of media technologies. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1461444811415046">Table 1</xref> shows that, in general, teenagers spend a substantial proportion of their time on media consumption, especially watching television and surfing the internet. As expected, the appropriation figures of media technologies are generally high: 99 per cent have at least one television and computer at home, 98 per cent have a mobile phone, 91 per cent own a mobile device such as an MP3 player or a mobile game console, and 67 per cent have a game console. Still, these figures strongly resemble earlier findings from recent international research on Western teenagers’ media usage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1461444811415046">Livingstone et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1461444811415046">Lenhart et al., 2010</xref>).</p>

<p>Although these figures reveal overall high access rates of media technologies, we prefer to grasp the probable heterogeneity in this appropriation. Therefore, a latent class analysis (LCA) was performed on the survey data. This statistical technique allows latent structures to be discovered within a set of categorical variables (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1461444811415046">Vermunt and Magidson, 2006</xref>). A common strategy is to iterate the analysis until a sufficient model fit is reached. The results indicate a three-class model to yield an excellent fit (<italic>L</italic><sup>2</sup>(1686) = 1463.19, <italic>p</italic> = 1). In the following paragraphs, these classes, which differ significantly for age (<italic>F</italic>(2, 1722) = 30.88, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001, partial η<sup>2</sup> = .04) and gender (χ<sup>2</sup>(2) = 218.21, <italic>p</italic> &lt;.001), are discussed.</p>
<p>The first class consists of teenagers with a <italic>media-rich bedroom</italic> (MRB; 67% males, <italic>M</italic><sub>age</sub> = 15.27, <italic>SD</italic> = 1.88). This group is characterized by high rates of watching television, gaming, and internet usage. These teenagers have all kinds of media technologies in their personal bedrooms. This group also shares high appropriation rates of mobile devices. The second class is composed of teenagers with a <italic>media-rich environment</italic> (MRE; 55% males, <italic>M</italic><sub>age</sub> = 14.77, <italic>SD</italic> = 1.81). Although their media attendance and ownership closely resemble that of the first class, the affording media technologies appear to be located elsewhere than the bedroom (e.g., the living room or study). The third and final class consists of teenagers with a <italic>limited media environment</italic> (LME; 75% female, <italic>M</italic><sub>age</sub> = 15.64, <italic>SD</italic> = 1.74). Compared to the other classes, this class is characterized by subtle differences in media usage and ownership. More specifically, watching television and, especially, playing video games, occur less frequently. Still, internet usage differs only marginally. Finally, this third class has a very low rate of having a game console and slightly lower rates of having a mobile device, television, or computer.</p>
<p>In sum, these results show that there is more than meets the eye: despite the teenagers’ high overall appropriation of media technologies, the teenagers differ in the kind of devices they own, the places where they are able to use the devices, and the intensity with which they use them. For the qualitative phase, forty teenagers were selected from the first phase’s respondents in order to gain a deeper insight into how these respondents attribute meaning to objects and contexts. The interviewees were carefully selected, reflecting the media appropriation profiles concerning age, gender, and education type. Thus, these respondents reflect the diversity found in the quantitative phase.</p>

<sec id="section9-1461444811415046">
<title>The meaning of objects</title>
<p>The survey data indicate that, in general, Flemish teenagers share an overall high degree of access to various kinds of media technologies. In the interviews, we elaborated on the associations with these technologies, which led to some remarkable differences among devices. For one, television sets were praised for their functional characteristics, such as having a large screen and various connections (e.g., cable, PVR, DVD, etc.). Televisions usually allow for high-quality sound and images. In addition, a television was generally seen as a shared device – something you use in the company of others. Parents usually made the purchase, without consulting their children. This leads to a limited affinity with the device as such, or as Eric puts it:</p>
<speech>
<speaker>Eric (13, M, MRE):</speaker>
<p>… I don’t care about the brand. If the image and sound quality are good, then it’s OK for me. My standards aren’t that high.</p>
</speech>
<p>Similar findings were noted for computers, which were also rarely purchased by the teenagers themselves. More often, computers were gifts or passed on within the household when a parent bought a new device. Unlike televisions sets, computers were seen as personal devices as computers are used to store personal information such as photographs, e-mails, etc. During the interviews, respondents elaborated on functional characteristics such as screen size, performance, and installed software. No notable value was attached to the brand or aesthetics. This is likely attributable to the commonness of these devices and the respondents’ relative absence of voice in the purchase decision, making computers a hard basis to upon which to differentiate oneself from parents and peers as they use very similar or even the same devices.</p>
<p>This finding does not hold up for gaming consoles, which are not equally widespread. In addition, the decision about what brand or type of console to purchase was – at least in our interview sample – mainly made by the teenagers themselves. Moreover, it was not unusual that the respondents bought gaming consoles with their own savings or by putting money together with siblings or parents. Like televisions, game consoles are associated with shared experiences because console gaming is often regarded as a social activity with siblings and friends, even when the device is located in a private space such as the bedroom.</p>
<p>In contrast, mobile devices mainly serve a single user. Still, these devices also provide a joint experience – for example, by sharing MP3 player earphones with a friend on the bus while commuting to school. In addition, instances of non-simultaneous joint use were mentioned, such as sharing a mobile game device with siblings:</p>
<speech>
<speaker>Interviewer:</speaker>
<p>So you share a Nintendo DS with your brother?</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Catherine (16, F, MRB):</speaker>
<p>Yes, he bought the device. I buy the games …</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Interviewer:</speaker>
<p>Did your brother decide to buy it?</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Catherine:</speaker>
<p>Yes.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Interviewer:</speaker>
<p>Did you have any voice in deciding which one?</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Catherine:</speaker>
<p>No … Yes, I chose the colour. You know, we don’t want a pink one!</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Interviewer:</speaker>
<p>Do you think it is that important?</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Catherine:</speaker>
<p>Yes, because it’s for the both of us. The colour had to be neutral; not pink for girls or black for boys.</p>
</speech>
<p>This links with the value attributed to device aesthetics. As the teenagers themselves mainly use these mobile technologies, the respondents had a considerable voice in deciding what device to purchase. This indicates a more autonomous role in the household’s moral economy. Consequently, choosing a specific device holds the potential to communicate about oneself. This was especially apparent for mobile phones:</p>
<speech>
<speaker>Interviewer:</speaker>
<p>Do you receive comments on your mobile phone?</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Chris (14, M, MRE):</speaker>
<p>Yes, I do receive comments on my mobile, really … it’s unbelievable. First, I bought a ‘normal’ phone, and then those with the sliding keypads were popular. And then, when I finally got me one of those, those clamshell phones were fashionable. Now that I’ve got one of them clamshells, it seems like touch screens are hip. I’m always late.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Interviewer:</speaker>
<p>Who says you are ‘late’?</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Chris:</speaker>
<p>I think so myself … others also ask why I’m still messing with such an old phone.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Interviewer:</speaker>
<p>Do you believe that a mobile phone is about fashion?</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Chris:</speaker>
<p>That’s the way you should put it … I don’t care about it that much, but next time, when I buy a new one, it’s got to be up-to-date.</p>
</speech>
<p>It is striking how mobile phones are especially prone to such identity claims. This is likely to be accredited to the individual nature of these devices and their display in public spaces. Of all possible technologies, the teenagers interviewed said they were least likely to share their phone with anyone, or let anyone look at its content. Mobile phones usually hold a variety of personal information such as contacts and text messages, but also photos, video, and music. Mobile phones are almost permanently carried and are used in various instances. The latter is amplified by the large variety of functions they encompass (e.g., photo camera, MP3 player). Like computers, mobile phones are associated with multifarious media consumption.</p>
<p>In sum, these findings lead to a two-dimensional conceptual mapping of the teenagers’ attributions to technology (See <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1461444811415046">Figure 3</xref>). The first dimension is composed of the opposition of private and shared. It refers to the degree to which a device is subject to property claims and individual use. The second dimension holds the distinction between correspondence and differentiation and is in line with a previous conceptualization by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1461444811415046">Punie (2004)</xref>. It refers to the extent to which teenagers use technology to distance themselves from adults and peers without access to a similar device. The differentiation can be interpreted in terms of unequal access (e.g., game consoles versus mobile devices) or valued differences in the devices themselves (e.g., the prices and features of mobile phones).</p>

<title>The meaning of contexts</title>
<p>In the previous section, we discussed the meaning of media technologies themselves, while this section focuses on teenagers’ associations with different spaces. In the quantitative phase, the figures revealed large differences in the locations of media technologies in the home (private bedroom versus shared spaces). The answers in the second research phase showed remarkable consistency in the sense that different spaces, inside as well as outside the home, diverge concerning their ascribed meanings. Shared domestic spaces, such as the kitchen and living room, were associated with familial sociability and shared experiences. However, the bedroom was generally mentioned as a preferred private space:</p>
<speech>
<speaker>Interviewer:</speaker>
<p>What place do you like best?</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Sarah (13, F, LME):</speaker>
<p>My own bedroom.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Interviewer:</speaker>
<p>Why is that so?</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Sarah:</speaker>
<p>Because it’s my own, I can do what I want there. I can have some peace and quiet there. It’s the place where I spend most of my time …</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Interviewer:</speaker>
<p>What kind of places don’t you like?</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Sarah:</speaker>
<p>There aren’t really places I don’t like. Although … I don’t like sitting in the living room when my dad is watching something I don’t like.</p>
</speech>
<p>Like Sarah, the other respondents commonly mentioned the bedroom as a tranquil refuge from everyday bustle. One’s bedroom is a place to do one’s homework and to spend a substantial proportion of one’s leisure time. Still, this does not mean that teenagers exclude themselves from family life. On the contrary, the majority enjoyed spending time with family, especially in the joint context of the living room:</p>
<speech>
<speaker>Interviewer:</speaker>
<p>Why do you like spending time in the living room?</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Nicolas (13, M, MRE):</speaker>
<p>Because that’s where we join … because then I’m not alone in my room. I rather sit with friends and my parents. I don’t take my friends to my bedroom that often and … in the evening, I sit with my parents, to watch television.</p>
</speech>
<p>This response indicates that the teenagers we interviewed seek a balance between engaging in family activities and spending time alone in their own space. This finding is especially interesting when we couple it with earlier results from the quantitative phase indicating that technologies were spread throughout these contexts, albeit not equally. More specifically, teenagers with a media-rich bedroom experienced media consumption in multiple contexts, whereas the others needed to share and comply with other family members’ preferences.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-1461444811415046">
<title>Disentangling object and context</title>
<p>The findings in the two previous sections demonstrate how technology and context are meaningful. However, application of the double articulation concept within domestication research resulted in an intermingling. More specifically, it led to general descriptions of how an object is used and how it is encapsulated in time and space. Still, in defence of a triple articulation, we find two arguments in favour of the relative separation of device and context.</p>
<p>First, teenagers substantially appropriate mobile devices that hold the potential of being used in various spatial and social contexts. Second, fixed devices are increasingly available in multiple spaces – for instance, in both the living room and the bedroom. Consequently, teenagers experience a large degree of freedom in compiling the modalities of their media consumption. This implies that the use of a technology is not <italic>a priori</italic> linked with a specific context, nor does a context necessarily imply the use of a specific technology. In addition, when technology and context are indeed separable, both entities’ meanings should interact independently with the meaning of content within the overall media consumption.</p>
<p>In the interviews, we explored how objects and texts interact within the same context by asking the participants to sort devices by content type according to preference. For the consumption of audiovisual content, the television was most popular, closely followed by the computer. Although ranked last, mobile devices were also used. For music consumption, opinions were divided between computers and MP3 players (standalone as well as incorporated in mobile phones). Computers dominated internet surfing, while gaming was divided into game consoles, computers, and mobile devices. Despite apparent preferences, all kinds of objects were used to consume similar texts. This is aptly demonstrated by the example of Carl (15, M, MRB), who talked about his preferred game devices:</p>
<speech>
<speaker>Carl:</speaker>
<p>I like my game console the best, then computer, mobile devices, and my mobile phone.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Interviewer:</speaker>
<p>Why do you rank them in that order?</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Carl:</speaker>
<p>Eh, because my game console is mainly focused on games, while on my computer I also use MSN and stuff like that, when I’m doing something else. Those mobile devices usually have a tiny screen. And, I only use my mobile to play simple games when I’m bored.</p>
</speech>
<p>Another example is found with Oliver (15, M, MRE), who described how different technologies can complement each other:</p>
<speech>
<speaker>Oliver:</speaker>
<p>I don’t use my MP3 player that much. I rather listen to my mobile phone because it’s easy to handle on my way to school. In second place, I like to watch TMF [a music television channel], because it’s got the most recent music. After that come my MP3 player and computer.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Interviewer:</speaker>
<p>How do you get to know music you like?</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Oliver:</speaker>
<p>By what is aired on TMF. When I’m listening to music and there’s something I like, I search those songs on the Internet and download them to my computer. Next, I put those on my mobile phone.</p>
</speech>
<p>However, not only object meanings interact with content. In the interviews, several instances of context meaning were found. For example, teenagers listened to music in their bedrooms because of comments on music preference and sound volume (especially by parents). Still, headphones are commonly used to eliminate this conflict, albeit creating a symbolic, private auditory space within a shared space. Concerning internet usage, nearly all respondents claimed that parental surveillance in shared spaces made them uncomfortable. When teenagers are communicating with friends online, through social network sites or instant messaging, they want no one looking over their shoulder. With regard to playing video games, Chris (14, M, MRB) gave a remarkable example of text–context interaction:</p>
<speech>
<speaker>Interviewer:</speaker>
<p>Is there a difference in what kind of games you play by space?</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Chris:</speaker>
<p>Yes, in my own place [private bedroom] I play shooter games, that’s action gaming. In the shared spaces, I usually play RPGs [Role-Playing Games] on my PlayStation. Or even puzzle games. In public, I also play those …</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Interviewer:</speaker>
<p>Is it a conscious choice?</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Chris:</speaker>
<p>Yes, it is …</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Interview:</speaker>
<p>Why?</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Chris:</speaker>
<p>Because my grandmother [with whom he lives] can’t cope with those shooter games. That’s why I usually play them on my computer.</p>
</speech>
<p>In other words, Chris avoided conflict and complied with the household’s dominant values by shifting the disapproved behaviour to another space where he could autonomously perform it. In Tom’s home (17, M, LME), two television sets were available: one in the living room and one in his parents’ bedroom. The content he consumed depended on the context:</p>
<speech>
<speaker>Tom:</speaker>
<p>In my parents’ bedroom, we [he and his brother] watch movies because you can darken the place quite well, because there are good blinds. And, downstairs we mainly watch football or the news.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Our study findings consistently indicate that media objects as well as the contexts in which media are consumed are explicitly meaningful. Still, our primary research goal was to empirically verify the ability to distinguish between object and context meanings in the overall context of media consumption. In previous research, domestication scholars mainly drew upon the concept of a double articulation, distinguishing between objects and texts. As a result, the objects’ meanings were largely snowed under by contextual descriptions of the objects’ application. The triple articulation concept aims to alleviate this problem by separating object and context meanings. However, the question remained whether such a threefold distinction is valuable for media researchers, as whether all three articulations <italic>independently</italic> contribute to the overall meaning of media consumption had not yet been verified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1461444811415046">Hartmann, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1461444811415046">Livingstone, 2007b</xref>).</p>
<p>We believe the results support the application of a triple articulation. First, we found multiple examples of how context influences the meanings of consumption, regardless of the object: for example, a teenager owning multiple game consoles yet tending to play violent video games only in the privacy of his bedroom to avoid negative reactions from family members in the living room. Second, we found teenagers use different objects with the same social and spatial context to consume similar texts: for instance, teenagers using devices such as a television set, a computer, and a mobile device in the same room to listen to music. In such instances, television can be used to become acquainted with new music, a computer can be used to download that music, and a mobile device can be used to consume it. All these devices are alike in affording the consumption of the same kind of media texts. However, each device reflects a different kind of engagement and usage, therefore contributing in another way to the overall meaning of consumption.</p>
<p>These interactions are the direct result of the increasing number of devices in multiple contexts, affording the consumption of similar texts. We believe this phenomenon is recent and still emerging, owing to the divergence in devices and the continuing convergence of media. Hence, the division of object and context is a direct result of the increasing number of objects affording the consumption of similar texts in multiple contexts. Fixed devices such as television sets are found in multiple contexts such as the living room or teenagers’ bedrooms. Simultaneously, mobile devices have the inherent potential to be transferred from context to context.</p>
<p>Still, we must take into account that not all teenagers have <italic>media-rich</italic> bedrooms. Substantial proportions of teenagers either have fewer devices at their disposal (<italic>limited media environment</italic>) or need to use the devices in shared family spaces (<italic>media-rich environment</italic>). Those teenagers’ degrees of freedom to consume media through multiple devices in multiple contexts are <italic>de facto</italic> limited. This limitation has a profound impact on the range of experiences that can be derived from media consumption. For example, if a teenager is prohibited from playing certain video games in the living room, but that is where the only console is located, he or she is unable to play and experience those games. The higher the number of available devices and the more these devices are located in private spaces, the larger the chances of making up autonomous media consumption. This reflects a personally tailored and distinguishing media consumption that can be interpreted as an identity attribute. Therefore, it is imperative at least to have a clear view of the devices that are appropriated and in which spaces this appropriation takes place. In doing so, we need to acknowledge the existence of all three articulations to grasp teenagers’ media consumption. It is important to study the meanings of media texts, yet it is equally important to take into account the meanings associated with devices that are used and the context in which this consumption takes place.</p>
</sec>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>This article shows that the triple articulation concept indeed has practical relevance for media researchers. The article demonstrates how object and context are separable and independently contribute to the overall meaning of media consumption. However, the implications extend beyond domestication research as they apply to the entire field of media studies. Media scholars should bear in mind that all three articulations are equally important, not ignoring factors that make up meaningful media consumption. Furthermore, we found inequalities in the diversity of objects and contexts among the teenagers in our sample. Likewise, the degrees of freedom to compile meaningful media consumption were not equal among the teenagers. This signals a possibly emerging divide between teenagers concerning the autonomy to build self-defining media repertoires and to use these repertoires to define themselves.</p>
<p>We must, of course, recognize that this research concerns a sample of Flemish teenagers. This implies that the exact appropriation and object and context meanings cannot be automatically transferred to other populations and contexts, nor are these meanings exhaustive. Although the figures closely resemble the results of rigorous cross-national research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1461444811415046">Livingstone et al., 2011</xref>), we encourage and welcome replication and extensions in other cultural, economic, and technological contexts. However, we hope to have demonstrated that the triple articulation approach we used in the Flemish case can provide a deeper insight into the media consumption of teenagers growing up in a context characterized by high degrees of technology adoption.</p>
