<abstract>
<p>Internationalisation of the sport industry has resulted in a demand for integration of international perspectives into the sport management higher education curriculum, to produce graduates capable of working within this rapidly developing global industry. Internationalisation of the curriculum can occur both abroad (i.e., study tour) or at home (i.e., within institution). A collaborative internationalisation at home (IaH) sport management curriculum research project was undertaken between the University of Worcester (the United Kingdom) and La Trobe University (Australia) sport management programmes in 2010. Reflections from the student cohorts and participating academics are presented to provide a case study of a teaching and learning collaboration and to address the lack of individual voice in internationalisation discourse. The results of this study indicate that there are benefits to classroom-level intervention. However, working within the institutional environment presents challenges to the development and implementation of such projects.</p>

<p>As we progress through the 21st century, there is no denying the significance of the knowledge economy. The global economic downturn and competition within the job market all place increasing importance on developing human capital through international education initiatives. More than a decade ago, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1028315311403487">Masteralexis and McDonald (1997)</xref> highlighted that the sport industry would require sport managers with international business capabilities. Entering and competing in the graduate market has never been a tougher prospect for students. Sport management graduates can and should have the opportunity to work internationally, particularly those who endeavour to work with the megaevents on the world circuit, such as the Olympics, or a multinational sports agency such as IMG (International Management Group—the global sports, entertainment, and media corporation). To prepare graduates for work in the sport industry, it is essential that the sport management curriculum reflects this global perspective.</p>
<p>Internationalisation of higher education is not a new topic of discourse, yet a definitive definition has yet to be accepted. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1028315311403487">Knight (2004)</xref> explained, internationalisation can and does occur at both the institutional and national or sector level. It would appear, however, that a more micro level of engagement has to some extent been neglected along the way and, until recent efforts by authors such as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1028315311403487">Jones (2010)</xref>, the discourse of internationalisation appeared to lack a student voice. Indeed, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1028315311403487">Luxon and Peelo (2009)</xref> highlight that at the micro level of teaching and learning, internationalisation is in some cases seen only as problematic. As academics, we can review the definitions and come to terms with the terminology, we can buy into the significance of internationalisation, and we can place all this into the context of our subject-specific discipline. We may be engaged and enthusiastic, yet at the same time clueless as to the actual execution. What do I actually do in my classroom and does it make a difference to the student experience?</p>
<p>The following discussion charts our journey into the development, implementation, and reflection of a collaborative project between an Australian and U.K. university designed to internationalise an aspect of the sport management curriculum for home students. In the grand narrative of internationalisation, this may seem too simplistic. We are fully aware of our position within this topic and do not profess to be innovators leading the way in the subject context of internationalisation of higher education; we are aware of our starting point. However, we are convinced we are not alone. In the broader context of internationalisation, we feel the need to question its specific implications for teaching and learning, rather than simply allowing the discussion to remain implicitly at a policy level.</p>
<p>We argue that for internationalisation to have real meaning, it needs to be examined from the shop-floor level, with practical issues and reflection at the forefront of the discussion. In the United Kingdom, specifically, such practical implementations have to some extent been addressed by subject centres associated with the Higher Education Academy. Sport management falls under the Hospitality, Leisure, Sport and Tourism centre which to date has produced some interesting literature relating to internationalisation of the curricular, for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1028315311403487">Black (2004)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1028315311403487">Becket and Brookes (2008)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1028315311403487">Carroll (2008)</xref>, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1028315311403487">Wicaksono (2008)</xref>. In the Australian context, although work has been undertaken in the research of internationalisation of curriculum, practical implementation is largely left to the individual institutions and, in the case of sport management, has not been an area of significant focus.</p>
<p>This article will address the subject of IaH specifically issues of internationalisation of the curriculum in three parts. First, we will discuss the broad literature of internationalisation of the curriculum and place this literature within the subject-specific context of sport management. We will then reflect on an international collaborative project which focussed on sport policy and the Olympics, sharing feedback from both students and academics in an attempt to present a real-life experience of the design and implementation of a project aimed at internationalising one aspect of the curriculum. Finally, we will come back to the issues of internationalisation as we discuss the applicability of our experience.</p>
<sec id="section1-1028315311403487">
<title>Internationalisation of the Curriculum</title>
<p>The “internationalisation” of higher education has become a buzzword in many countries. The speed at which communication technology has advanced, the globalisation of industries, international mobility of labour, and the evolution of the knowledge economy have influenced the shape of higher education. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1028315311403487">Knight (2004)</xref> purports that internationalisation of higher education occurs at the national or sector level and the institutional level and argues that although the topic of internationalisation is highly debated, interpretation and implementation is different in different countries and for different stakeholders. Indeed, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1028315311403487">Leask (2003)</xref> believes that even within the context of one institution, internationalisation will be viewed differently by the various stakeholders such as academics, student support officers, and marketing staff. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1028315311403487">Stone (2006)</xref> reflects that focussing on trying to define the concept of internationalisation can only result in unsatisfactory responses and recommends conceptual and practical suggestions that respond to reframed questions.</p>
<p>In the following section, we begin the discussion looking at the broad subject of internationalisation before focussing on the specific aspect of IaH. Finally, we will look at internationalisation of the curriculum, moving beyond the focus of the logical arrangement of content delivery to focus on the student experience.</p>
<sec id="section2-1028315311403487">
<title>Internationalisation in the Higher Education Sector</title>
<p>In the context of higher education, the term <italic>internationalisation</italic> has only become popular since the early 1980s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1028315311403487">Knight, 2004</xref>). According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1028315311403487">Leask (2004)</xref>, internationalisation in higher education is usually focussed on the movement of students, attracting international students to study on campus and in country and encouraging domestic students to travel and study abroad. Brookes and Becket (2008, 2010) also discuss how internationalisation has risen high on the agenda of many higher education institutions (HEIs), which include changes to the structure of higher education such as the development of the European Higher Education Area (EHEA) and the Bologna process, alongside sociocultural perspectives driving change. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1028315311403487">Leask (2004)</xref>, however, argues that the movement of students is only one aspect of internationalisation and that broad and indeed varied strategies are required to support the achievement of internationalisation goals.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1028315311403487">Jones (2010)</xref> provides a useful collection of research on the internationalisation of higher education sector, including a much-needed focus on the student response to the internationalisation of curriculum. Other key areas covered by this collection include study abroad and international volunteering, student learning in a cross-cultural classroom, and transnational education and support for international students. Through a review of this edited collection, the scope and variety of foci for research into the concept of internationalisation of the curriculum is made clear.</p>
<p>Finally, moving on to a discussion of the economic imperatives of the higher education sector globally, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1028315311403487">Hanson (2010)</xref> recognises internationalisation as comprising the processes by which HEIs compete for students globally as well as the processes that prepare students for a globalised world. There are, however, many drivers influencing internationalisation of higher education.</p>
<p>It is important to note that the examples presented so far are by no means an exhaustive list. However, identification of drivers and goals of internationalisation are important as they underpin how internationalisation is defined by individual stakeholders and consequently influence how policies and practices are interpreted and implemented. As a result of the different drivers and approaches adapted, internationalisation as a construct remains hard to conclusively define. However, there is some consensus as to internationalisation as a process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1028315311403487">Gacel-Avila, 2007</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1028315311403487">Knight’s (2004)</xref> definition as “the process of integrating an international, intercultural, or global dimension in the purpose, functions or delivery of post secondary education” (p. 11) has gained favour with numerous academics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1028315311403487">Brookes &amp; Becket, 2010</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-1028315311403487">
<title>IaH</title>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1028315311403487">Knight (2003)</xref> defines two streams of internationalisation, internationalisation abroad and IaH. The first is concerned primarily with movement of people or programmes within international environments. The second focuses on helping students develop international understanding and intercultural skills without ever having to leave campus. These definitions and practical implementation of such concepts may be problematic. However, it is useful to use these broad constructs to divide discussion of internationalisation of curriculum research to differentiate between those activities that occur solely within an institution (IaH) and those that occur within a geographically international context (such as study tours and exchange programmes).</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1028315311403487">Wachter (2003)</xref> reports that from a European perspective, the development of IaH began in the late 1990s. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1028315311403487">Knight (2004)</xref> goes on to interpret IaH as “the creation of a culture or climate on campus that promotes and supports international/intercultural understanding and focuses on campus-based activities” (p. 20).</p>
<p>Included in the campus-based activities associated with IaH are initiatives delivered at a programme level and specifically at the curriculum level. Although <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1028315311403487">Black (2004)</xref> suggests that internationalisation of a programme can occur to a certain degree through the inclusion of international case studies and teaching materials, developing international-focussed projects, or assessment and adding language courses, the consideration of curriculum content alone is inadequate. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1028315311403487">Brookes and Becket (2010)</xref> highlight that internationalisation of the curriculum cannot be viewed in isolation from faculty and student experiences. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1028315311403487">Raimond and Halliburton (1995)</xref> support this by concluding that for a curriculum to be international, internationalised teaching staff are needed.</p>
<p>In the following section, we briefly discuss the evolution of sport management as an academic discipline highlighting the individual nuances of this discipline area. We then go on to explain how we designed and implemented an international collaborative project, while reflecting on the theory outlined above.</p>

<title>Defining Sport Management as a Discipline</title>
<p>Paradigmatic discussion and debates will undoubtedly continue to resound as academics try to define sport management as a discipline. While this article does not attempt to offer such a definition, we feel we have to at least acknowledge the discourse surrounding the general identity of the discipline to discuss the relevance of internationalising the curriculum. We begin therefore by taking a brief look at the general evolution of the sport management discipline to date.</p>
<p>The global sport industry is estimated to be worth approximately £263 billion GBP. The sport industry is made up of a unique combination of public, private, and voluntary sectors and it operates on a local, national, and international scale. The management of sport can be traced back through the history pages of sport itself. From the creation and organisation of the Ancient Olympic Games in 776 <sc>BC</sc> to the formalisation of rules in the late 19th century for many popular sports today such as cricket, football, and basketball, the practice of managing sport has been around far longer than the organised education of such an activity.</p>
<p>Reference to the evolution of an academic field associated with sport management appears to have a diary entry of either 1966, when the first master’s degree programme in sport management was established at Ohio University in the United States (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1028315311403487">Brassie, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1028315311403487">Laird, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1028315311403487">NASPE-NASSM Joint Task Force on Sport Management Curriculum and Accreditation, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1028315311403487">Stier, 2001</xref>), or in the 1980s, when according to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1028315311403487">Costa (2005)</xref> “the field defined itself as a discipline signalled by the founding of NASSM (North American Society for Sport Management)” (p. 117). Regardless of the start date, scholars agree that sport management is a relatively young field in comparison with other academic disciplines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1028315311403487">Chalip, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1028315311403487">Costa, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1028315311403487">Hardy, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1028315311403487">Humphreys &amp; Maxcy, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1028315311403487">Jones, Brooks, &amp; Mak, 2008</xref>).</p>
<sec id="section5-1028315311403487">
<title>Sport Management Curriculum and Internationalisation</title>
<p>The sport management curriculum is multidisciplinary, covering aspects of management, sociology, economics, and marketing, and, in the context of internationalising the curriculum, sport and specifically sport management is an internationally relevant subject area. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1028315311403487">Masteralexis and McDonald (1997)</xref> highlight the need for education programmes to recognise sport’s movement into a global market and hence consider providing students with the competency to compete for positions within the industry on a global scale.</p>
<p>The management systems and philosophy in Europe and the Commonwealth countries (with greater public sector and voluntary roles) are fundamentally different in nature compared to the United States (with a greater role for commercial providers and sponsors). Within the context of sport development, the U.K. and Australian sport industries often reflect each other’s policy strategies in a pendulum motion. In the build up to the 2012 London Olympics, the United Kingdom is mirroring the structure and policy seen in Australia around the time of the 2000 Sydney Olympics. Evaluating Australia’s current policy position and the sociopolitical focus of sport (10 years on from the Olympics) can give U.K. graduates an insight into the potential changes and opportunities in the U.K. sport industry post 2012. Understanding the different management systems and the structure of sport industries in Europe, America, and Australia can also help graduates identify market opportunities in developing sport nations such as Asia and South America. Therefore, regardless of their area of employment, sport management graduates need to be globally aware.</p>
<p>As sport management is an academic discipline that is still evolving, it is not surprising that the subject of internationalising the curriculum has not been at the forefront of research and discussion. However, to keep up with broader issues of internationalising higher education and the increasing globalisation of sport as an industry, the last decade has seen the beginning of a shift in research focus. Reviewing the limited body of research discussing internationalisation of sport management curriculum, key issues identified include academic staff expertise in international sport management education, opportunities for international exchange (academic staff and students), international collaborative research opportunities, and ways of internationalising programme content (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1028315311403487">Jones et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1028315311403487">Li, Ammon, &amp; Kanters, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1028315311403487">Masteralexis &amp; McDonald, 1997</xref>).</p>
<p>In the late 1990s, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1028315311403487">Masteralexis and McDonald (1997)</xref> urged academics and students to view sport management with a more global vision by “keeping abreast of global sport issues to infuse a more global perspective into their courses” (p. 106). In a U.S. national faculty survey, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1028315311403487">Li et al. (2002)</xref> noted that the majority of sport management educators felt they had made an effort to internationalise the courses they taught. Using international examples in lectures was the most commonly adapted inclusion technique, followed by discussion on international issues in class. However, while reflecting on the research of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1028315311403487">Li et al. (2002)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1028315311403487">Daprano and Titlebaum (2003)</xref> noted that from their experience many undergraduate sport management students in the United States were blissfully unaware of the global transformation of sport, showing little knowledge of less popular sports in the United States such as cricket and rugby and little understanding of the structure of international sport organisations such as the IOC or FIFA. Although their students were aware of multinational sport companies, their knowledge was limited to Nike and other sporting goods manufacturers.</p>

<title>Internationalising the Sport Management Curriculum: A Case Study</title>
<p>The following case study provides an overview of what happened when two academics, in the absence of institutional IaH strategies, embarked on developing and implementing a cross-institutional project designed to internationalise an aspect of the sport management curriculum. By providing a voice to both the academic and student experience, we hope to highlight a unique perspective on this subject.</p>
<p>This project within the sport management context came about due to the authors’ shared interest in this field of scholarship and experiences in the classroom. We felt that although our individual programmes contained international content, our students remained nationally focussed in their discussions and career aspirations and often lacked wider international awareness. Our main objectives when we embarked on this project was to bring to life an international issue in the classroom setting and help develop global awareness in our students. We had no previous experience of such a project, and although our respective institutions had “international strategies,” there was no history of IaH projects. The collaboration was, at this stage, a bespoke project on a personal level between the two authors. As we were approaching this project from a U.K. and Australian perspective, we chose the Olympics as a central theme. The Olympics is undoubtedly a global sport phenomenon, and from a teaching perspective, it provided us with a vehicle to discuss many interesting issues. The following section provides an overview of the project we designed and implemented during the 2010 academic year.</p>
<p>The Olympics (specifically the Summer Games) provided a clear focus to the project. Hosting the Olympics is something both nations share and both the 2000 Sydney Olympics and 2012 London Olympics are current and accessible events for both groups of students. There were many different aspects of the Olympics on which to focus the project, but a shared interest was sport development. We both deliver content focussing on sport development, a subject that combines theoretical and practical issues and has areas of international similarity and difference as points of comparison for student reflection.</p>
<p>The gap between the hosting of the Olympics provided an interesting element of reflective practice as we were both able to embed within our teaching what the effects of hosting the Olympics have had (in the case of Australia) or is having (in the case of the United Kingdom) on our national sport development policies from grassroots to elite. We were also able to discuss the timely release of government policies such as Backing Australia’s Sporting Ability and the Crawford Report in Australia, and Game Plan and Playing to Win in the United Kingdom. Combining the Olympics with sport development seemed like the perfect focus of a U.K. and Australian collaborative project. However, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1028315311403487">Black (2004)</xref> outlines, although the utilisation of international material or case study focus can develop to a certain degree of internationalisation of the curriculum, the consideration of curriculum content alone is inadequate.</p>
<p>To develop the project further and move the discussion from the pages of text books and policy documents, we wanted to increase academic and student involvement. From an academic perspective, we recorded “guest lectures” in the form of video podcasts that focussed on the specific aspects of our respective national sport development models. This material was shown in class, uploaded to web-based teaching spaces, and formed the basis of in-class discussions. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1028315311403487">Raimond and Halliburton (1995)</xref> believe that international teaching staff are required to support internationalisation of the curriculum. In the absence of international members of the home teaching faculty, we believe the video podcasts were a suitable replacement, and, under those circumstances, this was our way of internationalising aspects of the teaching delivery.</p>
<p>To encourage student engagement within the international context, we agreed that our respective students (U.K. Level 6, Australia Level 5) were motivated by assessed work and so decided to develop a collaborative three-stage assessment (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1028315311403487">Table 1</xref>). In short, the U.K. students would review their national system of sport development and then draw comparisons with Australian system and vice versa, specifically focussing on 10 summer Olympic sports in which both nations compete.</p>

<p>Each group was required to prepare a 15-min presentation on the sport development policies and programmes of a national sport organisation. The students were informed that the audience for this presentation was their module leader, their classmates, and a cohort of international students undertaking a similar programme from La Trobe University (Australia) or the University of Worcester (the United Kingdom).</p>
<p>Each group was briefed to prepare a presentation of the sport development policies and programmes for their chosen sport at the national level, including junior (and modified sport) programmes and pathways, talent identification, pathways from grassroots to elite, and the institutional and organisational structures that support the sport development process. Students were encouraged to include evaluation and discussion of the most effective and least effective elements of the individual sport’s development strategy. Students were also briefed that the presentations would be video-recorded for peer review by the La Trobe University class and the University of Worcester class.</p>
<p>It is important to note, however, that developing a collaborative international assessment focused on Olympic sports was by no means straightforward. We had to address institutional regulations, research ethics, and basic issues of semester schedules across different hemispheres. Although we both teach the same broad subject of sport development, we do not teach the same classes, at the same level, in the same institution. Thankfully, our respective requirements and assessment criteria were not too different, and suitable items of assessment were developed for our respective classes that holistically resulted in the same project in the United Kingdom and Australia.</p>

<title>Academic Reflections on the Project</title>
<p>From an academic perspective, this project was more practically challenging than we initially gave it credit for. Although we thought we had embarked on a small-scale project, we had underestimated the time and resources required to establish and deliver this teaching activity. As previously stated, this was a project we undertook due to personal and scholarly interest rather than an institutional directive; this may reflect why at times we felt isolated in the development of the project and faced barriers to even the simplest of tasks such as secure international file sharing. In the absence of similar project-related experience, we both found ourselves struggling to access suitable staff-development initiatives in our respective intuitions. We found that support with the development of practical skills such as video editing very difficult to come by, which resulted in us both using personal technology and equipment. Consequently, during the file-sharing stage, we faced problems with technology compatibility.</p>
<p>When sharing her own experience at the University of South Australia, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1028315311403487">Leask (2001)</xref> describes how internationalisation was clearly embedded within the university in the policy, mission statement, and goals. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1028315311403487">Leask (2001)</xref>, this process approach to internationalisation proved a major challenge requiring a strategic, staged approach over a number of years. The type of strategic buy-in described by Leask results in a cultural shift within an institute or university, cultivating an agreed way of doing things. We developed our bespoke project in the absence of strategic policy or institutional buy-in and as a result faced a sense of isolation alongside practical barriers.</p>
<p>Moving beyond the policy level, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1028315311403487">Knight (1996)</xref> discusses the “infusion” approach to internationalisation of the curriculum that requires teaching staff to develop new knowledge, skills, attitudes, and values centred upon exploring the concept of internationalisation. With reference to this, both <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1028315311403487">Knight (1996)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1028315311403487">Leask (2001)</xref> outline the additional pressure internationalisation strategies place on staff-development units. Again we developed our project in the absence of any such “internationalisation” staff-development support. While developing this project, we were therefore faced with updating not only our practical skills but also our theoretical understanding of IaH.</p>
<p>In the absence of an institutional process or infusion approach to internationalisation, we developed what we refer to as a classroom-level intervention. We created a model that in theory could be adapted and used in any subject. The student feedback on which we will elaborate shortly illustrates the positive merits of such a one-off project. Our personal experience, however, highlights the significance of institutional buy-in to internationalisation and similarly the difficulties faced when attempting to internationalise an aspect of the curriculum in the absence of an IaH culture. As a result of our experience, we are working on staff-development initiatives within our respective institutions to support future internationalisation projects. We have also provided internal feedback regarding access to and the level of practical support required to develop such collaborative learning and teaching projects.</p>

<title>Student Reflections on the Project</title>
<p>Reflecting on student engagement through this single semester class and using student feedback, both cohorts of students appeared to be aware of the significance of learning about international systems of sport development, although the Australian students appeared to demonstrate a greater appreciation of international issues in general.</p>
<p>When specifically asked about this project and if they enjoyed the international aspect of the module and assessment, the majority of both cohorts gave a positive response, as evidenced by the following representative quotes:</p>
<p>
<disp-quote>
<p>It helped to broaden my perspective on sports development with regards to not only a British but also Australian one, though it may have been useful to have expanded beyond these to others nations as well, possibly America. (the United Kingdom)</p>
<p>It was interesting to see how Australia compared to another big nation in terms of sport development and the practices and policies. It gives a broader view, on how our methods compare to those in other nations . . . (Australia)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>From a U.K. perspective, there was a mixed response in terms of the depth of understanding of international sport related issues in general, with some feedback appearing very insightful:</p>
<p>
<disp-quote>
<p>Information about how sports systems work in other countries would be good knowledge to have. It can be used to influence our own systems, or good to know if someone chooses to migrate and work in another country.</p>
<p>International perspectives would seem to be a valuable addition especially considering current globalisation. With improving technology the inclusion of international comparative work could become even easier to facilitate.</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Some student responses show a lack of wider understanding of international issues as the following responses demonstrate:</p>
<p>
<disp-quote>
<p>What’s going on in AUS has no real effect on Sports Development in the UK. Should concentrate more on UK structure and organisations surrounding sports development. (the United Kingdom)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>The U.K. students involved in this project were final-year undergraduate students, who had taken previous classes that included international issues in their curriculum. At the start of this project, from a U.K. perspective at least, it would appear we may have wrongly assumed a level of international awareness. This observation supports the comments from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1028315311403487">Daprano and Titlebaum (2003)</xref> who noted that from their experience despite international curriculum content, many undergraduate sport management students in the United States were blissfully unaware of the global transformation of sport and international sport-related issues.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1028315311403487">Daprano and Titlebaum (2003)</xref> also discuss the American students’ affinity with certain national sports such as baseball compared with examples of international sports such as rugby. The choice of sports used in this project provided surprising feedback from the U.K. students. Although both cohorts of students were given a choice of 10 Summer Olympic sports which both nations compete in, some of the U.K. students alone were resentful of the fact they could not focus on their favourite “English” sports, primarily, rugby, cricket, and football:</p>
<p>
<disp-quote>
<p>It was good to do something different however an analysis of more main stream sports not just Olympic would have been more interesting, e.g., cricket, rugby, football. (the United Kingdom)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Student feedback with regards to the international guest lecture podcast again received encouraging feedback from both cohorts of students but mainly due to the uniqueness of the medium rather than the authenticity of having an Australian lecturer discuss the Australian system and U.K. lecturer discuss the U.K. system of sport development. To some extent, this rejects <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1028315311403487">Raimond and Halliburton (1995)</xref> theory that international teaching staff are required to support internationalisation of the curriculum.</p>
<p>Analysis of the peer-review aspect of the project was encouraging. Both cohorts of students were able to reflect on their own personal preparation with regards to presenting to an international audience, thinking about colloquial language, for example,</p>
<p>
<disp-quote>
<p>abbreviations and acronyms like AIS and ASC had to be explained and more detail needed to be provided. Although our classmates would understand what was meant if we just said “AIS” we needed to explain further for the international audience. (Australia)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Along with reflecting on their actual presentation skills,</p>
<p>
<disp-quote>
<p>How you present yourself when giving a presentation seems to be as important as what is being said; not slouching around or seeming uninterested when giving the presentation as this makes you as a listener be less interested. (the United Kingdom)</p>
<p>It was interesting to watch ourselves and consciously make the effort to sharpen our presentational skills. In addition, seeing how others (internationally) perceived the task was interesting. (Australia)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>This level of reflection regarding presentation skills is often absent in a straightforward presentation-based assessment. From the comments outlined above, we cannot, however, deduce if this reflection is based on the introduction of an international audience or simply due to the introduction of an unknown audience. The fact that the presentations were going to be shown to an international audience did, however, seem to bring out a more professional response from the students:</p>
<p>
<disp-quote>
<p>Just the fact that overseas students were seeing our presentations made it more serious. (Australia)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>It would be interesting to further research the significance of the international audience from both the U.K. and Australian students’ perspectives in order to analyse the level of acceptance shown to cultural outsiders.</p>
<p>Students were also able to reflect on their own personal learning experience:</p>
<p>
<disp-quote>
<p>The presentation I watched clearly showed the difference between Australia and England when it comes to hockey. I think this was the easiest way to learn about this, rather than reading about it in a book or an article. (the United Kingdom)</p>
<p>If we had only been presenting to our own peers, then we probably wouldn’t have researched in comparison to other countries and mainly focussed on Australia alone. (Australia)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>In general, the student feedback from both sides was positive. The peer assessment helped to bring the subject to life and developed an element of personal reflection we had not previously seen in these cohorts. Overall, students engaged with the project, gave mature and insightful feedback to their peers, and through their written work they developed a critical perspective of the different sport development systems.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>The 21st century has seen the birth of the knowledge economy and the need for graduate global awareness. Internationalisation of higher education is high on the agenda of institutions around the world and is responsible for a growing body of research and discussion. The level of engagement has been defined as occurring at both the institutional and national or sector level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1028315311403487">Knight, 2004</xref>) and as both internationalisation abroad and IaH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1028315311403487">Knight, 2003</xref>). The relevance of strategic and cultural buy-in has been discussed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1028315311403487">Black, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1028315311403487">Brookes &amp; Becket, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1028315311403487">Li et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1028315311403487">Raimond &amp; Halliburton, 1995</xref>), but the actual classroom experience of such has to date been a neglected part of the discourse.</p>
<p>The aim of this article was to provide a voice to those involved in a project designed to internationalise an element of the curriculum, thereby providing a unique perspective to the subject. The experiences of both the academics and students involved in the project have provided a useful insight into IaH and more broadly internationalisation of the curriculum.</p>
<p>The nature of sport management as an academic subject provided a unique case study. We learnt that simply because the subject content implicitly has an international focus, in this case Olympic sport, does not mean those studying will have an implicit international appreciation or awareness. There are many more aspects to sport management for which international issues are highly significant but far less overt. If we are to address <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1028315311403487">Masteralexis and McDonald’s (1997)</xref> call for internationally aware sport managers and develop graduates capable of working in the global arena that is the sports industry, we as sport management academics need to address how we internationalise our curriculum.</p>
<p>The results of this study highlight that there are benefits to classroom-level intervention. The example given in this article of an international collaborative project embedded in one teaching area has highlighted positive student feedback, and we would certainly conclude that there was no evidence of any negative effects to the learning experience of these students. However, in agreement with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1028315311403487">Black (2004)</xref>, the project has highlighted that internationalisation of a programme can occur to a certain degree through the inclusion of international teaching materials and developing international focussed projects and assessment, but the consideration of curriculum content alone is inadequate to truly facilitate international awareness concurrent with the characteristics required of a globally aware graduate.</p>
