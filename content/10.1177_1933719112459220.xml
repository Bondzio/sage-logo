It was revealed that both ACA and CDDP induced dose- and time-dependent cytotoxicity when used as a stand-alone agent, while synergistic effects were observed when used in combination with a combination index (CI) value of 0.74 ± 0.01 and 0.85 ± 0.01 in Ca Ski and HeLa cells, respectively. A total of 25 miRNAs were found to be significantly differentially expressed in response to ACA and/or CDDP. These include hsa-miR-138, hsa-miR-210, and hsa-miR-744 with predicted gene targets involved in signaling pathways regulating apoptosis and cell cycle progression. In conclusion, ACA acts as a chemosensitizer which synergistically potentiates the cytotoxic effect of CDDP in cervical cancer cells. The altered miRNA expression upon administration of ACA and/or CDDP suggests that miRNAs play an important role in anticancer drug responses, which can be manipulated for therapeutic purposes.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>1′-acetoxychavicol acetate</kwd><kwd>microRNA</kwd><kwd>cisplatin</kwd><kwd>cervical cancer</kwd><kwd>combination chemotherapy</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="section1-1933719112459220"><title>Introduction</title><p>Despite cervical cancer having a good prognosis through early detection, it remains the second most common cancer and cancer-related mortality in women worldwide with an estimated 529 409 new cases and 274 883 deaths in 2008.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1933719112459220">1</xref></sup> Incidence and mortality rates in developed countries were lower due to effective cervical screening and ongoing active health education programs as compared to developing countries, which accounts for 86% of cervical cancer cases worldwide.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1933719112459220">2</xref></sup> In Malaysia, a total of 1074 cases of cervical cancer were registered by National Cancer Registry (NCR) in 2006, making it the third most common cancer in women after breast and colorectal cancer.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1933719112459220">3</xref></sup></p><p>Natural bioactive compounds have been extensively used in the treatment of cancer for many years either as stand-alone or as adjuvants to improve therapeutic efficacy by reducing drug-induced toxicity and drug resistance.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1933719112459220">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1933719112459220">5</xref></sup> One example is the naturally occurring phenylpropanoid, 1′<italic>S</italic>-1′-acetoxychavicol acetate (ACA) isolated from the wild ginger, <italic>Alpinia conchigera</italic>. 1′<italic>S</italic>-1′-Acetoxychavicol acetate has been shown to exhibit various biological activities such as inhibition of tumor promoter–induced Epstein-Barr virus activation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1933719112459220">6</xref></sup> and induction of apoptosis in Ehrlich ascites tumor cells through polyamine metabolism and caspase 3 activation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1933719112459220">7</xref></sup> Furthermore, ACA was shown to inhibit the cellular growth of myeloid leukemic cells in vitro and in vivo through induction of apoptosis via mitochondrial- and Fas-mediated dual mechanism.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1933719112459220">8</xref></sup> More recently, we have also reported that ACA induced comparable levels of dose- and time-dependent cytotoxicity on a variety of other tumor cell lines to current commercial anticancer drugs, without any adverse effects on normal cells.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1933719112459220">9</xref></sup> Despite numerous studies reporting its efficacy on cancer cells over the past years, its combined effects with other anticancer drugs as well as its effect on microRNAs (miRNAs) expression have not been reported.</p><p>Cisplatin (CDDP) is a platinum-based anticancer drug widely used in treatment of various cancers, such as ovarian, testicular, lung, cervical as well as head and neck carcinomas.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1933719112459220">10</xref></sup> Even with extensive development of cisplatin analogues, only very few have entered clinical trials, with the resulting approved drugs such as carboplatin and oxaliplatin having limited advantages over cisplatin.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1933719112459220">11</xref></sup> Although CDDP treatment results in high initial responsiveness, treatment failures due to toxicity and acquired resistance remains a major clinical problem.

In this study, the cytotoxic effects of ACA and/or CDDP were first assessed using MTT cell viability assays, and results showed that synergistic effects were observed when cells were treated with ACA and CDDP simultaneously as well as sequentially over 24 hours. Earlier studies on ACA revealed a rapid decrease in intracellular levels of glutathione (GSH),<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1933719112459220">27</xref></sup> which prevents resistance through CDDP inactivation, enhanced DNA repair, and reduced CDDP-induced oxidative stress.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1933719112459220">28</xref></sup> Furthermore, studies have shown that ACA inhibits activation of NF-κB and NF-κB-regulated gene expression such as cyclin D, c-Myc, survivin, inhibitors of apoptosis, B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2), B-cell lymphoma-extra large (Bcl-xL), Bcl-2-related protein A1, and FLICE-like inhibitory proteins.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1933719112459220">29</xref></sup> Thus, inhibition of these proliferative and antiapoptotic gene products together with a decrease in GSH intracellular levels would theoretically augment CDDP efficacy. The shift toward antagonistic effects in sequential 12-hour pretreatment with CDDP followed by ACA for 24 hours corroborates with our notion, indicating that the chemosensitizing effect of Ca Ski cells by CDDP was absent in comparison to ACA. The inability to obtain significantly synergistic CDDP/ACA relationships in HeLa cells compared to Ca Ski cells was expected since HeLa cells had originally displayed a higher susceptibility toward stand-alone CDDP, making it relatively difficult to identify new synergistic drug partners, which can further improve its existing high CDDP efficacy. Even though HeLa and Ca Ski cells are of similar cervical origin, variations in specific HPV strains present may also contribute toward the alteration of gene expression governing drug sensitivity, resulting in disparities between both cell lines.</p><p>Here, we hypothesized that different treatment regimens would exhibit different miRNA expression patterns following different mechanisms of action in ACA and CDDP. Of the 25 miRNAs identified, several have been previously associated with response to chemotherapy. For example, overexpression of miR-212 induced sensitivity toward cetuximab in head and lung squamous cell carcinoma<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1933719112459220">30</xref></sup>; whereas downregulation of miR-342 was associated with tamoxifen resistance in breast cancer cell lines.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1933719112459220">31</xref></sup> It was also reported that silencing of miR-130b promotes multidrug resistance, whereas its overexpression increases sensitivity toward CDDP and taxol in ovarian cancer.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1933719112459220">32</xref></sup> Dysregulation of other miRNAs such as miR-134 and miR-138 have also been shown to augment the sensitivity of lung tumor cells toward CDDP exposure and subsequent apoptosis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1933719112459220">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1933719112459220">34</xref></sup> Since our miRNA microarray data showed a directional correspondence to these earlier studies, this indicates that these miRNAs could also play a role in modulating response toward ACA and/or CDDP. Furthermore, the markedly different miRNA expression profile between different treatment regimens showed that specific clusters of miRNAs are, indeed, modulated in response toward ACA and/or CDDP and, thus, can be manipulated for future therapeutic advantages in cervical cancer drug combination treatment options.</p><p>Since ACA is able to synergistically potentiate the cytotoxic effects of CDDP when used in combination, pathway analysis on 3 primary miRNA candidates (hsa-miR-138, hsa-miR-210, and hsa-miR-744) affected with the highest fold change during combination chemotherapy was evaluated. It was revealed that many members of the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) signaling cascade were being targeted by these miRNAs, including platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), fibroblast growth factor (FGF), hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), fms-related tyrosine kinase 3 ligand (FLT3LG), PDGF receptor (PDGFR), son of sevenless (Sos), and Raf and MAP/ERK kinase (MEK). The ERK is a subfamily of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs), which regulates cell proliferation and differentiation,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1933719112459220">35</xref></sup> and whose activation has been associated with cervical cancer.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1933719112459220">36</xref></sup> It was reported previously that activation of ERK signaling pathway confers survival signals, which counteracts proapoptotic signals activated by c-Jun N-terminal kinases and p38-signaling pathway, the other 2 subfamilies in MAPK.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1933719112459220">37</xref></sup> Therefore, inactivation of this pathway by miRNAs may lead to increased levels of apoptosis. Despite previous reports indicating that CDDP exposure activates ERK signaling, inhibition of this cascade could in fact enhance CDDP-based cytotoxicity, suggesting that CDDP-induced ERK activation provided the cells partial protection against CDDP.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1933719112459220">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1933719112459220">39</xref></sup> Our pathway analysis also revealed protein kinase C (PKCs) and calcium channel proteins among the putative targets of these 3 miRNAs, consistent with past reports linking them to CDDP-induced ERK activation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1933719112459220">39</xref></sup> Collectively, all these targets have highlighted the ERK-signaling cascade as the most affected pathway following ACA and CDDP exposure through the negative regulation of hsa-miR-138, hsa-miR-210, and hsa-miR-744.</p><p>Another pathway found to be affected by these miRNAs is the TGF-β signaling pathway, whereby mutations or disruptions in this pathway have been linked to carcinogenesis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1933719112459220">40</xref></sup> TGF-β mediates cell cycle arrest by activating Smad2/3/4 complex, which then interacts with p300 to induce the expression of p15 proteins responsible for cyclin D-cdk4/6 complex inactivation and a G<sub>0</sub>/G<sub>1</sub> cell cycle arrest.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1933719112459220">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1933719112459220">42</xref></sup> Our in silico pathway analysis not only describes the above proteins as direct putative miRNA targets but also other cell cycle regulatory targets such as cyclin E and E2F.

Although it is contradictory, it is important to note that a downregulation in caspase 3 expression by miRNAs cannot be used to rule out the occurrence of apoptosis as CDDP-mediated cell death can still occur via caspase 3-independent routes as described previously.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1933719112459220">47</xref></sup></p><p>We also identified the involvement of several NF-κB family members such as IκB kinase (IKK) and tumor necrosis factor receptor–associated factor 2 (TRAF2) among the putative targets.

Therefore, our study provides a platform to methodically study the roles of these miRNAs in modulating response toward anticancer drugs.
