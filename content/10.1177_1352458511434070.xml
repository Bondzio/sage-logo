<title>Proposal</title>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>‘Epidemiology in MS has had its day: there are no more unanswered questions.’</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>At first glance, this statement is so extreme that it appears manifestly indefensible. To accept this as multiple sclerosis (MS) physicians, would mean depriving ourselves of our monthly hit of MS trivia, challenging the funding of major grants to eminent individuals and breaking the hearts of trainees worldwide looking for a pipette-free doctorate.</p>
<p>The first step in accepting the proposition is to remind ourselves what questions epidemiology is able to frame and answer. <italic>McAlpine’s Multiple Sclerosis</italic> gives us three justifications for epidemiological research:<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1352458511434070">1</xref></sup></p>

<list-item><p>to generate hypotheses for the causation of the disease;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>to assess local needs for the provision of services and allocation of resources;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>to generate registries of untreated patients to provide natural history data.</p></list-item></list>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-1352458511434070">
<title>1. To generate hypotheses for the causation of the disease</title>
<p>No one can deny that epidemiology, in its heyday, brought us a long way. Key hypotheses were generated which have furthered our understanding of MS aetiology. Studies of geographical distribution, migration, clusters, twins and families have shown the existence of genetic and environmental factors which have shaped our, as yet, incomplete model of aetiology. Links with other diseases and environmental factors have generated hypotheses on the role of Epstein–Barr virus (EBV), vitamin D, smoking and gender in susceptibility or modification of the disease. Within an acceptable margin of error, we know the answers to the questions on associations with childhood infections, vaccination, personal and family autoimmune diseases, allergies, month and place of birth, migration, trauma, stress, susceptibility to cancer, diet and drugs.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1352458511434070">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1352458511434070">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>We could go on counting cases and cross-referencing other pathologies and putative risk factors in an aim to generate more hypotheses on causation, yet the major work has already been done. The low-hanging epidemiological fruit has all been picked, hypotheses generated and tested. The hunt for lesser associations requires larger studies for less reward. Outside these formal studies, as physicians, we practise week by week, observing the disease in our clinics. What are the chances that there is a major unrecognized risk factor whose discovery will cause a paradigm shift in our thinking on MS? Supporters of further studies will point to recent work on vitamin D and smoking, yet the observations on sunlight and vitamin D are decades old, although recently revisited. How has our thinking or practice changed now we know (from 14 studies in over 3000 individuals<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1352458511434070">4</xref></sup>) that smoking confers a 1.5 relative risk increase for MS susceptibility?</p>
<p>Our consideration of ‘unanswered questions’ must include a value judgment on the question posed. Academic curiosity alone is not justification for embarking on futile studies which tie up our trainees, consume research funds and use up the good will of people with MS and their families.</p>
<p>Like many, I have genuinely troubling, unanswered questions about MS, fundamental to my clinical work, to which the eventual answer may render my practice futile or flawed. Is MS preventable by interventions in childhood or adolescence? How early and how aggressive does immune therapy need to be to alter the trajectory of the disease? Is secondary progressive disease inevitable? How can repair in MS be promoted? These questions have come from the classic, completed epidemiological studies needed in the process of exploring incompletely understood diseases, but cannot be answered by the same tools. If we put these questions to the MS community, pitched against (with apologies to the authors of two well-presented 2011 papers) ‘latitudinal prevalence gradient of multiple sclerosis in Latin America’<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1352458511434070">5</xref></sup> or ‘The co-occurrence of endometriosis with MS….’,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1352458511434070">6</xref></sup> where would priorities lie?</p>

<title>2. To assess local needs for the provision of services and allocation of resources</title>
<p>Knowing how many people with MS are in a region and ascertaining their needs are essential public health concerns. There is a difference, however, in the purist epidemiological approach to this, looking for complete ascertainment for academic purposes, compared with the level of accuracy needed for public health resource allocation. Outside the pages of academic journals where perfect is required, ‘good enough’ suffices. We have estimated MS prevalence for most of the world. At least in the UK, incident cases come through a finite number of centres, allowing tracking of trends. Data collected through coding in primary and secondary care gives us a fair picture of what is happening. In most health systems, MS is not budgeted for separately in social care provision, and authorities have tools to assess total community needs for physiotherapy, social care, aids and appliances. Resource allocation is not a precise science. What a rigorous, academic epidemiological study might add in this context is debatable, particularly balanced against the time required in ascertainment, and effort involved. From my daily practice, I know we are short on physician and specialist nurse input, access to specialist rehabilitation and other support services, and I struggle to see how 3 years of a PhD student’s life will produce a data that advances my understanding of this, or will convince commissioners of healthcare to divert finite and shrinking resources.</p>

<title>3. To generate registries of untreated patients to provide natural history data</title>
<p>In this respect, the sun has set on epidemiology’s day in MS. The era of purist natural history studies of untreated patients is over (though the data remains to be digested). From here on we are in observational, phase 4 treatment territory. Untreated patients are an unrepresentative subgroup. There are important data to be gleaned in this era of treatment of observational longitudinal cohort studies, using techniques evolved from epidemiology, but in this viewpoint I am sticking to a strict distinction of epidemiology from observational treatment studies. This current landscape is a good place to be. A criticism levelled at neurologists is that we do not treat disease, we stand back and admire it. Epidemiology is the ultimate non-interventional branch of clinical study and we must not mourn that effective treatments in MS have brought about its demise.</p>
<p>Epidemiology has had its day: it was a good one, but it is in the past. We only have limited money and limited personnel for MS research. We should use our time and energy in ways most likely to deepen our understanding of the disease and progress to our ultimate goals of preventing, treating and reversing MS while assessing and addressing the needs of those already with disability. I do not see where yet another epidemiology study comes into this.</p>
<p>There are indeed major unanswered questions in MS but epidemiology, a discipline essential to the early study of complex diseases, is not able to answer them. It is time for us to pass the baton (and resources) on to the medical sciences able to respond to the 21st century questions.</p>
